Grants may not exceed $2,000,000.

The Secretary determines grant amounts up to $2,000,000 for State departments of veterans affairs to distribute to qualified agencies and organizations providing casework services to rural veterans. States are eligible for grants if they lack covered veterans service officers in certain counties. Counties with at least 1,000 veterans can have a part-time covered veterans service officer if there is a demonstrated need for additional services. Eligible States must compete for the grant by submitting an application to the Secretary. The Secretary approves promising grant applications for State departments of veterans affairs based on various factors like total appropriation, veteran population, and training needs for covered veteran service officers in rural counties. Approved States receive funds determined by the Secretary, which are to be used by the State department of veterans affairs. States receiving grants must provide information and assurances to the Secretary to receive the funds. The grant program for training covered veteran service officers requires states to match 20% of the total cost, use funds only as a supplement, and grants are given annually. A covered veteran service officer is defined as a qualified employee. The term 'covered veteran service officer' refers to a qualified employee who provides advice and services to veterans regarding benefits, accredited to file claims with the Veterans Benefits Administration. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 for this program. The Comptroller General will review the grant program for rural counties employing veteran service officers to assess its effectiveness in improving benefits access for veterans living in rural areas."
