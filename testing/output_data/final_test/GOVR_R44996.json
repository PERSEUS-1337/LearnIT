    "content": "Since 1979, the U.S. has maintained an unofficial relationship with Taiwan due to diplomatic ties with China. The Taiwan Relations Act provides a legal basis for this relationship and includes commitments related to Taiwan's security. Balancing support for Taiwan's democracy, prosperity, and security remains a key issue for U.S. policy. Congress has a strong interest in supporting Taiwan's democracy, prosperity, and security while maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and constructive relations with China. They have pushed for easing U.S. restrictions on contacts with Taiwan officials and providing security-related support, including arms sales. Before his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump signaled a potential closer relationship with Taiwan, speaking with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in a historic phone call. Trump also questioned the U.S. \"one-China\" policy, which recognizes the PRC as the sole legal government of China. President Trump initially signaled a closer relationship with Taiwan but later reaffirmed the \"one-China\" policy in a call with PRC President Xi Jinping. President Tsai's election victory in Taiwan has strained relations with the PRC, as she has not fully embraced the concept of \"one China.\" The PRC has increased pressure on Taiwan to accept this principle. The PRC has intensified pressure on Taiwan by implementing various measures such as blocking Taiwan's participation in international meetings, increasing military deployments near Taiwan, and demanding the return of Taiwan citizens accused of crimes. President Tsai has emphasized that coercion and threats will not bring the two sides closer, stating that Taiwan will not surrender to intimidation. Taiwan's history dates back to Austronesian settlement 6,000 years ago. Dutch and Spanish colonial presence in the 17th century. Zheng Chenggong led Chinese forces to expel the Dutch in 1661. Qing Dynasty gained control in 1683. Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895 after the First Sino-Japanese War. After being ceded to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan remained a Japanese colony for 50 years until the Republic of China took control on Retrocession Day in 1945. The Kuomintang Party led the ROC, which moved to Taiwan after losing the civil war to the Communist Party of China in 1949. Mainlanders refer to families who fled to Taiwan with the KMT in the 1940s. The KMT arrived in Taiwan in the 1940s, bringing with them mainlanders. The ROC imposed martial law on Taiwan in 1949, which lasted for 38 years until lifted in 1987 by President Chiang Ching-Kuo, leading to political liberalization. Taiwan legalized political parties in 1989. The DPP, founded in 1986, played a key role in ending the KMT's one-party rule in Taiwan. The National Assembly abolished the \"Temporary Provisions\" in 1991, leading to direct elections for the Legislative Yuan in 1992 and the first presidential election in 1996. Chen Shui-bian of the DPP became Taiwan's first non-KMT president, followed by Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT. Taiwan presidents are limited to two terms, with the DPP winning both the presidency and legislature in 2016. The DPP emphasizes democracy, freedom, human rights, and a strong Taiwanese identity. The ROC government claims jurisdiction over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Mazu, and other islands. They also assert sovereignty over disputed islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The official name for Taiwan is highly debated, with the government calling itself the Republic of China (ROC). The Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan is officially recognized by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, although there is debate over the name. The People's Republic of China (PRC) does not acknowledge the ROC and refers to Taiwan as the \"Taiwan authorities.\" Taiwan is blocked from using the ROC name internationally. In international fora, Taiwan is known as \"Chinese Taipei\" or \"Taiwan.\" US policy refers to Taiwan as an \"area\" or \"economy\" and the \"Taiwan authorities\" instead of the government. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act recognizes Taiwan's government as the Republic of China. Recent legislation increasingly refers to Taiwan simply as \"Taiwan.\" The Legislative Branch in Taiwan is not subject to executive branch rules on how to refer to Taiwan. Taiwan's central government consists of the Office of the President and five government branches known as \"yuan.\" The president serves as head of state and commander of the armed forces. The Executive Yuan is Taiwan's cabinet, headed by a premier appointed by the President. The Legislative Yuan is Taiwan's unicameral parliament with 113 members elected for four-year terms with no limits. In the January 2016 election, the DPP won 68 seats, ending the KMT's control of the body. The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) holds 1 seat, and an independent candidate aligned with the DPP holds 1 seat. The Judicial Yuan oversees Taiwan's judiciary, while the Examination Yuan manages the civil service system. The Control Yuan monitors government expenditures and investigates wrongdoing. There is a debate in Taiwan about potentially abolishing the Examination Yuan and Control Yuan. President Tsai Ing-wen, 61, took office in May 2016 after winning 56% of the vote in the January 2016 elections. President Tsai Ing-wen's inauguration marked the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another in Taiwan. She was born in 1956, trained as a lawyer, and served as a law professor before entering public service. Tsai played a key role in Taiwan's bid to join the GATT and later the WTO. Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's first female president, has a background in law and government service. She held various advisory and government positions before joining the Democratic Progressive Party in 2004. Tsai served in Taiwan's parliament and as Vice Premier before becoming DPP chair. She is not from a political family and faced declining public support after her inauguration in 2016. Public support for Tsai Ing-wen has dropped significantly since her inauguration, with only 29.8% approval in August 2017. Criticisms include her handling of judicial reforms and infrastructure projects. Vice President Chen Chien-jen, an epidemiologist with a Doctor of Science degree from Johns Hopkins University, has held various public service positions including Minister of Health during the 2003 SARS outbreak. He describes himself as a devout Catholic. Chen Chien-jen, a devout Catholic, has had audiences with multiple Popes. Lai Ching-te, a political rival of President Tsai, is a trained physician with a master's degree from Harvard. Lai served as mayor of Tainan before becoming Tsai's premier in 2017, sparking controversy by asserting Taiwan's sovereignty. Lai is President Tsai's second premier, succeeding Lin Chuan. Su Jia-chyuan is the first non-KMT member to serve as Speaker of Taiwan's parliament. The United States terminated diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979, maintaining an unofficial but extensive relationship since then. The United States has an unofficial but extensive relationship with Taiwan, which has evolved over time. U.S. policymakers have improvised rules to differentiate this unofficial relationship from official diplomatic partnerships, while upholding commitments to both Taiwan and China. The United States has an unofficial but extensive relationship with Taiwan, which has evolved over time. U.S. policymakers have differentiated this unofficial relationship from official diplomatic partnerships, while upholding commitments to both Taiwan and China. The U.S. policy aims to preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and opposes unilateral changes in the status quo by either the PRC or Taiwan. The United States adheres to a one-China policy based on three joint communiqu\u00e9s with China and the Taiwan Relations Act. The United States has an unofficial relationship with Taiwan, separate from official diplomatic partnerships, to preserve peace in the Taiwan Strait. This is based on three joint communiqu\u00e9s with China and the Taiwan Relations Act. The joint communiqu\u00e9s, signed in 1972, 1978, and 1982, acknowledge Taiwan as part of China and aim for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question. In a 1978 joint communiqu\u00e9, the Carter Administration recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China and acknowledged Taiwan as part of China. The 1982 joint communiqu\u00e9 reiterated this stance. The 1982 joint communiqu\u00e9 between the United States and China reaffirmed the acknowledgment that Taiwan is part of China. It also outlined commitments regarding arms sales to Taiwan, stating that the US does not seek a long-term policy of arms sales and intends to gradually reduce them. The PRC argues that the US agreed in joint communiqu\u00e9s that Taiwan is part of China, while US commentators believe the US position on Taiwan's status is ambiguous. President Carter signed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, including security commitments added by Congress. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) was signed by President Carter in 1979, with key provisions including relations with Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the commitment to provide defense articles and services for Taiwan's self-defense capability. The Act also emphasizes the US policy to resist any coercion that threatens Taiwan's security or economic system. The Taiwan Relations Act requires the President to inform Congress of any threats to Taiwan's security or US interests, with appropriate action determined through constitutional processes. The Act includes Taiwan in US laws related to foreign entities. It does not mandate US defense of Taiwan but maintains \"strategic ambiguity\" to deter attacks from China and actions that may provoke them. Executive Order (E.O.) 13014, issued by President Clinton in 1996, directs the implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan. It delegates authority to the Secretary of State and aims to facilitate commercial, cultural, and other relations between the US and Taiwan without official representation or diplomatic relations. President Reagan communicated \"the Six Assurances\" to Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-kuo before a joint communiqu\u00e9 with China in 1982. The text of the assurances was not made public by the executive branch, but a senior Reagan Administration official shared similar assurances with Congress, including not setting a date to end arms sales to Taiwan and not mediating between Taiwan and China. The U.S. has maintained its stance on Taiwan, emphasizing no pressure for negotiations with China, no change in sovereignty position, and no plans to revise the Taiwan Relations Act. The Six Assurances have been occasionally mentioned by officials, with Congress aiming to highlight their importance. Congress has long sought to elevate the profile of \"the Six Assurances\" in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, focusing on assurances related to arms sales to Taiwan. The first full written text for the Six Assurances was issued in the 114th Congress, affirming them as \"cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan relations.\" Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord testified on the results of a Taiwan Policy Review, warning against actions that China would perceive as official. President Clinton decided to adjust the U.S. attitude towards Taiwan's participation in international organizations, supporting its membership where statehood is not required. This policy change also affected how U.S. and Taiwan officials engaged with each other. President Bill Clinton reiterated the U.S. \"Three No's\" policy on Taiwan during a visit to Shanghai in 1998, stating that the U.S. does not support Taiwan independence. This policy remains in place, with U.S. officials clarifying that the U.S. does not oppose Taiwan independence but simply does not support it. Additionally, the U.S. maintains that Taiwan should not be a member of organizations requiring statehood. The U.S. policy states that Taiwan should not be a member of organizations requiring statehood. The 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communiqu\u00e9 recognized China as the sole legal government and Taiwan as part of China. The U.S. and Taiwan have a robust unofficial relationship. The United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and does not support Taiwan independence. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act serves as the legal basis for this relationship, emphasizing U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense. The U.S. advocates for peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences and opposes unilateral changes to the status quo. The 2017 annual report to Congress on China's military highlights U.S. policy regarding Taiwan, emphasizing the one China policy based on the three Joint Communiqu\u00e9s and the Taiwan Relations Act. The Trump Administration has hinted at re-evaluating U.S. policy towards Taiwan and the PRC, with President-Elect Trump speaking with Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen in December 2016. In a December 11, 2016, Fox News interview, Trump questioned the one-China policy but later reaffirmed it in a February 9, 2017, call with President Xi Jinping. They held a summit in April 2017. Trump mentioned in an April 28, 2017, interview that he would consult with President Xi before speaking with President Tsai again. President Trump's administration raised concerns in Taiwan about a possible \"grand bargain\" with China. Reports suggested Henry Kissinger advised Trump to stabilize US-China relations with a \"fourth communiqu\u00e9.\" Taiwan's government expressed worry and reached out to Trump, cautioning against such a development. Taiwan's Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee warned against a potential arms sales halt by the Trump Administration. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis reassured Taiwan at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore about continued arms sales, in line with the Taiwan Relations Act. Mattis pledged to work with Taiwan's democratic government for defense needs and notified Congress of arms sales on June 29, 2017. He also emphasized not using allies as bargaining chips. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's testimony hinted at possible future shifts in U.S. policy. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's remarks reignited speculation about U.S. policy towards Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of stability and no conflict with China in the Pacific region for the next 50 years. He reaffirmed the commitment to the one-China policy and the Taiwan Relations Act, while also discussing the future relationship with China. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the importance of stability and no conflict with China in the Pacific region for the next 50 years, reaffirming the commitment to the one-China policy and the Taiwan Relations Act. Discussions with China include Taiwan, North Korea, and island militarization, aiming for a continued era of stability. Trump's upcoming visit to Asia, including a stop in Beijing, will not involve using allies as \"bargaining chips.\" The United States' relations with Taiwan are conducted through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) after diplomatic relations were terminated in 1979. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) operates under contract with the Department of State and has headquarters in Arlington, VA, a main office in Taipei, a branch office in Kaohsiung, and a virtual branch office in Taichung. AIT is overseen by a six-person board of trustees and a managing director, responsible for liaising with Taiwan's representative office in the United States, supporting U.S.-Taiwan trade policy and defense relationship, and conducting public diplomacy. AIT Taipei functions like an embassy with over 120 American staff and a new $240-million office compound. AIT Kaohsiung has nearly 40 staff members. The U.S. government changed its policy in 2003 to allow employees to work at AIT Taipei. The head of AIT Taipei is titled \"Director\" and U.S. government personnel there have different titles than in embassies. The head of AIT Taipei is titled \"Director\" and the senior military representative is \"Chief, Liaison Affairs Section.\" AIT is funded through a line item in appropriations legislation for the Department of State, with Congress authorizing payments for necessary expenses to carry out the Taiwan Relations Act. The Trump Administration requested a reduced payment for FY2018 compared to FY2017. The administration's budget request for AIT in FY2018 supports core operations and the move to a new office compound. H.R. 3354 authorizes a payment of $30,557,000, a reduction from FY2017. S. 1780 maintains AIT's budget at the FY2017 level. Taiwan's principal representative office in the U.S. is TECRO, overseeing 12 subsidiary offices. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) oversees 12 subsidiary offices in the United States known as Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices (TECOs). TECRO employees hold E-category visas instead of A-category visas, but enjoy privileges and immunities similar to diplomats under an agreement with AIT. TECRO employees and their families have full criminal immunity and tax exemption privileges, similar to diplomats. They are also eligible for services from the Department of State's Diplomatic Motor Vehicles Office for driver's licenses and license plates. Since December 2014, TECRO and TECO employees have been issued identity cards, personal tax exemption cards, driver's licenses, and license plates similar to diplomats, but with certain differences. Their cards are issued in the name of AIT, approved by the U.S. Department of State, and their license plates have an \"E\" prefix instead of \"D\" for diplomats. Twin Oaks, a mansion in Washington, DC, served as the residence of ROC Ambassadors from 1937 to 1978. The estate was rented and then purchased by the ROC. In 1978, it was sold to prevent transfer to the PRC. It was later bought back by Taiwan's representative office in 1982 with the help of Congress. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1982 helped Taiwan maintain ownership of Twin Oaks estate in Washington, DC, despite the termination of diplomatic relations with Taiwan by the United States. The Act included a provision stating that recognition of the People's Republic of China would not affect Taiwan's ownership rights to properties acquired before December 31, 1978. This provision was specifically crafted with Twin Oaks and its furnishings in mind, leading to objections from Beijing and negotiations with the State Department. China had the option to challenge the Taiwan Relations Act in the Supreme Court, but chose not to. Despite not being allowed to use Twin Oaks as a residence since de-recognition, Taiwan was authorized by the Obama Administration in 2011 to use it for annual receptions. State Department guidance prohibits executive branch employees from attending events at Twin Oaks. The State Department prohibits executive branch employees from attending events at Twin Oaks, but Legislative Branch employees are not covered by this guidance. Some Members of Congress and AIT personnel, including the AIT Chairman and Managing Director, regularly attend functions at Twin Oaks. State Department guidelines for handling interactions with Taiwan include restrictions on meeting venues and requirements for written permission before traveling to Taiwan. These guidelines aim to differentiate the unofficial U.S.-Taiwan relationship from official diplomatic partnerships. The State Department guidelines on contacts with Taiwan were last updated during the Obama Administration. Executive branch officials above certain ranks must obtain written permission before traveling to Taiwan for official purposes. Legislative branch personnel, including Members of Congress, are not subject to these restrictions. The guidelines aim to maintain the unofficial nature of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. Executive branch officials above certain ranks must obtain clearance from the Office of Taiwan Coordination for travel to Taiwan. They are required to use regular passports for travel, in line with the absence of diplomatic relations between the US and Taiwan. Meetings with Taiwan visitors can take place in most US government offices, with exceptions for certain high-level locations. Taiwan's representative in Washington, DC attends meetings of international groups, such as the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS. In 2015, during Taiwan's presidential election campaign, candidates Tsai Ing-wen and Eric Chu met with officials at the State Department and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Congress aims to ease restrictions on U.S.-Taiwan interactions, with pending legislation in the 115th Congress addressing the lack of high-level communication between the two countries since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. The pending legislation in the 115th Congress, H.R. 535 and S. 1051, aims to allow high-level officials from the United States and Taiwan to travel and meet each other, as well as encourage business activities between the two countries. S. 1051 authorizes U.S. government officials to travel to Taiwan and requires reports every 180 days on their visits. U.S. guidance on Cabinet-level travel to Taiwan is based on a 1994 policy review, allowing visits by senior officials in economic and technical areas. Six Cabinet-level officials have visited Taiwan since diplomatic relations were terminated in 1979, all in economic or technical roles. Since diplomatic relations were terminated in 1979, six Cabinet-level officials have visited Taiwan in economic or technical roles. The 1994 Taiwan Policy Review allows Taiwan's \"top leadership\" to make \"normal transits\" to the United States but prohibits non-transit visits or public activities on U.S. soil. Executive branch policy still upholds this restriction. Since 1979, Taiwan's \"top leaders\" can transit through the U.S. but cannot engage in public activities on American soil. President Tsai has had three transit layovers in the U.S., following protocol by not meeting with executive branch officials. These transits are considered private and unofficial, in line with long-standing U.S. practice in its unofficial relations with Taiwan. President Tsai of Taiwan has had three transit layovers in the U.S., meeting with Members of Congress and local officials. These transits are considered private and unofficial, in line with long-standing U.S. practice in its unofficial relations with Taiwan. President Tsai's successful management of Taiwan-U.S. relations was evidenced by her transit visits, according to Taiwan's Foreign Minister David Lee. President Tsai of Taiwan has successfully managed Taiwan-U.S. relations, earning affirmation from Washington. Despite restrictions on Taiwan's foreign ministers visiting Washington, DC, Tsai has made transit stops in four American cities, forging closer contact with important U.S. officials each time. The United States has only twice permitted a Taiwan Minister of Defense to visit, both times during the George W. Bush Administration. During the George W. Bush Administration, Taiwan's Defense Ministers were granted permission to attend U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conferences in Florida. The United States and Taiwan were parties to a Mutual Defense Treaty from 1954 to 1979, which was terminated when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979. The United States terminated its defense treaty with Taiwan in 1980, withdrawing military personnel by April 30, 1979. Despite this, the U.S. has continued to support Taiwan's military through arms sales and defense services as per the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. This support expanded after the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-1996 to include dialogues, training, and military education opportunities for Taiwan military personnel. In 2017, the United States focused on assisting Taiwan with non-hardware aspects of military capability, including overhauling reserve forces, developing improved joint doctrine, and enhancing ground forces' ability to operate in a decentralized manner. This effort aimed to increase jointness and service interoperability in the Taiwan military, with an emphasis on asymmetric warfare. In 2017, the United States assisted Taiwan in enhancing its military capabilities, focusing on non-hardware aspects such as overhauling reserve forces and improving joint doctrine. This included developing the NCO corps towards greater decentralization and initiative. U.S. security assistance to Taiwan aims to promote peace and stability in Asia by deterring potential aggression from mainland China. The Monterey Talks are the most senior U.S.-Taiwan military discussion, focusing on future arrangements between Taiwan and mainland China. A vulnerable Taiwan could invite aggression, jeopardizing regional peace and prosperity. The talks have been held in various locations, with key U.S. officials participating in 2017. The Monterey Talks are the most senior U.S.-Taiwan military discussion, focusing on future arrangements between Taiwan and mainland China. The Taiwan delegation, led by high-ranking officials, engages in various dialogues with U.S. counterparts, including Defense Review Talks and exchanges involving senior military officers and civilian officials as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act. The Monterey Talks involve discussions between senior U.S.-Taiwan military officials regarding future arrangements with mainland China. Senior military and civilian officials from both countries engage in dialogues as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act, with specific travel restrictions for certain ranks. In the 115th Congress, there is a proposed requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on actions taken and future plans related to these interactions. The U.S. Pacific Command sends observers to Taiwan's military exercises and Taiwan F-16 pilots train at Luke Air Force Base. However, Luke Force Base is transitioning to F-35 operations, raising questions about future F-16 training. Approximately 400 Taiwan military officers study at U.S. military academies each year. Section 1270E of the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 requires a report on actions taken regarding U.S.-Taiwan military interactions. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 and the Senate amendment would require a report on the feasibility of U.S. Navy port calls to Taiwan and ROC navy port calls in Hawaii and Guam. The Senate amendment also directs the reestablishment of regular ports of call in Taiwan and allows the U.S. Pacific Command to receive port calls from the Taiwan Navy. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 and the Senate amendment would require a report on the feasibility of U.S. Navy port calls to Taiwan and ROC navy port calls in Hawaii and Guam. Congressman Forbes called for the U.S. to consider port calls to Taiwan after the PRC cancelled a port call to Hong Kong by the USS John C. Stennis, citing China's politicization of port visits. Former State Department official Randall Schriver also argued for U.S. port calls to Taiwan to show support amidst increasing pressure from Beijing. The White House announced the nomination of Schriver for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Affairs. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense welcomed the U.S. Navy port calls to Taiwan, emphasizing the importance of military exchanges and enhancing Taiwan's national defense. The ministry welcomes partnerships to enhance Taiwan's defense. Critics fear U.S. port visits with Taiwan could provoke China. James Moriarty warns of dangers for U.S. ships in Taiwan ports. China strongly opposes the proposal for port calls. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense and Foreign Ministry strongly oppose any official contact and military interaction between Taiwan and the U.S. They urge the U.S. to stop military contacts with Taiwan to avoid damaging relations and stability in the region. China emphasizes that the Taiwan issue is a matter of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and criticizes the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee's bill for violating agreements between China and the U.S. The U.S. Senate bill violates agreements between China and the U.S., interfering in China's domestic affairs. China urges the U.S. to stop military contact and arms sales to Taiwan to avoid damaging bilateral relations. Legal experts question Congress's authority to direct military actions in Taiwan. Congress is interested in involving Taiwan in U.S.-hosted military training activities. The Senate amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 includes support for Taiwan to participate in U.S. military training activities. The Taiwan Security Act of 2017 would require Taiwan's military to join the Rim of the Pacific Exercise and a \"Red Flag\" exercise at Eielson Air Force Base or Nellis Air Force Base. The U.S. Air Force's premier air-to-air combat training exercise, RED FLAG-Alaska, involves both U.S. and allied nations' combat air forces. RIMPAC is the world's largest international maritime exercise held every other year in Hawaii and Southern California, with participants from 26 nations in 2016, including the PRC. Questions arise about inviting Taiwan to participate in these activities and how it may impact allies' relationships with the PRC. Since 1979, all administrations have notified Congress of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Taiwan, presenting the sales as consistent with U.S. law and policy as expressed in the Taiwan Relations Act. Taiwan is the largest customer for FMS programs in Asia and the United States' second largest FMS partner globally. The Obama Administration notified Congress of over $14 billion in Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan and licensed another $6.2 billion in Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) during its eight years in office (2009-2017). Taiwan describes the $20 billion in total arms sales from 2009 through 2015 as \"the largest amount.\" Taiwan received the largest amount of arms sales from the United States between 2009 and 2015, totaling $20 billion. This included advanced military systems such as AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopters, Patriot-3 missiles, F-16 A/B aircraft upgraded to F-16V, tactical data links, and the AN/FPS-115 PAVE Phased Array Warning System for surveillance. The PAVE PAWS system, commissioned in 2013, allows Taiwan to monitor aerial activities within a 3,000-mile range, including Chinese missile and Air Force flights. The United States policy towards Taiwan under the Relations Act is to provide arms of a defensive nature. The Act states that the US will supply Taiwan with defense articles and services necessary for self-defense, determined by the President and Congress based on Taiwan's needs. Former AIT Chairman Richard Bush suggests that this provision may not be as strong as commonly believed. Former AIT Chairman Richard Bush explains that the phrase \"in accordance with procedures established by law\" in the US legislative practice gives the Executive Branch substantial discretion in deciding Taiwan's defense needs and specific weapon systems to provide. This provision in the Relations Act may not be as strong as commonly believed. The Reagan Administration's Six Assurances to Taiwan in 1982 included provisions related to arms sales, stating no set date for ending sales and no prior consultations with Beijing. This has been interpreted as a prohibition on setting deadlines for arms sales and consulting with Beijing on Taiwan arms sales. The 1982 U.S.-PRC joint communiqu\u00e9 also limits arms sales to Taiwan to not exceed recent levels. The Reagan Administration's Six Assurances to Taiwan in 1982 included provisions related to arms sales, stating no set date for ending sales and no prior consultations with Beijing. This has been interpreted as a prohibition on setting deadlines for arms sales and consulting with Beijing on Taiwan arms sales. The 1982 U.S.-PRC joint communiqu\u00e9 also limits arms sales to Taiwan to not exceed recent levels. In recent years, the United States has gradually reduced its sale of arms to Taiwan, with the Trump Administration notifying Congress of proposed Foreign Military Sales programs totaling $1.36 billion and an additional proposed Direct Commercial Sale to Taiwan valued at $68.8 million. The Trump Administration notified Congress of $1.42 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including a $400 million operations and maintenance package for Taiwan's Surveillance Radar Program. Other proposed sales cover various weapons and upgrades, with a total of seven Foreign Military Sales programs and one Direct Commercial Sale program. State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert emphasized the continuity of defense sales with Taiwan over the past 50 years. The TRA is silent on how the President and Congress determine arms sales to Taiwan. From 1983 to 2001, annual Arms Sales Talks were held between the US and Taiwan in Washington, DC. The talks ended in 2001, moving to meetings on an \"as-needed\" basis. The executive branch notified Congress of proposed major arms sales to Taiwan at least once a year from 2001 to 2008, except for 2006. Since 2001, the executive branch has notified Congress of arms sales to Taiwan annually, except for 2006. In 2008, a new approach was adopted with multiple arms sales notifications sent to Congress on a single day. This bundling strategy aimed to reduce potential retaliation from China and strategically position the sales at the least-worst time. Since then, multiple proposed arms sales programs for Taiwan have been routinely notified to Congress on a single date. The Obama Administration had a gap of over four years between major arms sales notifications to Taiwan, from September 21, 2011 to December 19, 2015. The Trump Administration bundled arms sales to Taiwan in June 2017, becoming the third administration to do so. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018, along with the pending Taiwan Security Act, aim for more frequent transfers of defense articles and services to Taiwan. The Senate amendment calls for regular transfers of arms to Taiwan, while H.R. 2810 calls for a timely review of arms requests from Taiwan. The Secretary of Defense will review Taiwan's arms sales requests on a case-by-case basis to normalize the process. The United States must conduct regular transfers of defense articles to Taiwan and revive annual sales talks. Tensions have arisen over assessments of Taiwan's defense needs, with Taiwan seeking sophisticated military platforms like F-16C/D fighters and the F-35. The executive branch believes Taiwan needs to urgently enhance its defense capabilities due to a growing threat from China. DOD's Helvey suggests Taiwan focus on affordable, cutting-edge systems and integrate older capabilities like sea mines for defense. Taiwan is urged to enhance its defense capabilities by integrating old and new technologies for a resilient deterrent. The focus is on acquiring advanced weapon systems, including fighters with stealth characteristics. President Tsai of Taiwan expressed interest in purchasing the F-35 strike fighter from the United States, citing its importance for defense strategy. The F-35 is estimated to cost between $95 million and $123 million per plane. Taiwan is also pursuing indigenous defense submarine and fighter-trainer programs with hopes of receiving technical support from the U.S. Congress is considering a program to provide technical assistance to Taiwan for defense efforts. The Department of Defense's Helvey cautioned about U.S. support for Taiwan's development of indigenous warfare capabilities, suggesting that any assistance may need to be in the form of Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) due to technology limitations. Taiwan seeks to develop vehicles and sea mines for its military forces, including diesel-electric submarines, which differ from U.S. nuclear-powered submarines. Taiwan is transitioning towards indigenous manufacturing for arms purchases, shifting risks to the buyer. Compliance with U.S. standards for safeguarding defense technologies is crucial, potentially requiring new regulatory mechanisms. Section 1206 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 designates Taiwan as a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA), allowing for various defense benefits and exemptions. The Taiwan Relations Act emphasizes the importance of meeting Taiwan's defense needs based on judgment, potentially limiting considerations of other factors. The Taiwan Relations Act emphasizes meeting Taiwan's defense needs, potentially limiting considerations of other factors. Arms sales to Taiwan draw strong protests from China, who sees them as a violation of agreements to reduce arms sales and hinder negotiations for a resolution to the cross-strait standoff. China strongly protests the US arms sales to Taiwan, stating it violates international law and jeopardizes China's sovereignty. China urges the US to cancel the arms sales plan and cease military contact with Taiwan to avoid further damage to China-US relations. The United States aims to support Taiwan in earning respect and dignity through initiatives like the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), which has conducted workshops on various topics in Taiwan. AIT Chairman James Moriarty emphasized the importance of providing technical expertise and cooperation in areas such as public health, energy efficiency, women's empowerment, e-commerce, and humanitarian assistance. The United States, through the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), aims to create networks and build bridges between Taiwan, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. In 2014, the US assisted Taiwan in contributing to the global Ebola response by delivering personal protective equipment and making a $1 million USD contribution to fight Ebola. Taiwan made a $1 million USD contribution to the U.S. CDC Foundation's initiatives to fight Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. In 2016, Taiwan was the United States' 10th largest merchandise trading partner, with exports valued at $26.0 billion and imports at $39.3 billion. U.S. exports to Taiwan grew by 8.3% from 2000 to 2016, while imports fell by 4.9%. The United States is Taiwan's second-largest trading partner after the PRC. Taiwan's manufacturing firms have shifted labor-intensive production overseas, particularly to mainland China, as seen in the rise of export orders produced abroad. Data shows a significant increase in export orders from the United States, with orders to Taiwan increasing by 160.4% from 2000 to 2016. The United States is Taiwan's largest source of export orders. The United States is the largest source of Taiwan's export orders, accounting for 28.7% of the total in 2016. U.S.-Taiwan commercial ties are more complex than reflected in trade data. U.S. FDI in Taiwan was $16.2 billion, while Taiwanese FDI in the U.S. was $7.2 billion. American business groups are optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects but have concerns about the business climate. A 2017 survey by AmCham in Taipei showed that 67% of respondents found their business operations very profitable in 2016, with 56% expecting strong profits in 2017. However, only 49% were positive about their business prospects over the next five years, down from 60% previously. The top five issues affecting business operations in Taiwan are government bureaucracy, cross-Strait relations, lack of clarity in labor laws, inconsistent regulatory interpretation, and political turmoil. Taiwan has sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions on agricultural products, especially beef and pork. Taiwan also has import bans on certain beef products and a total ban on imported pork containing ractopamine. Taiwan was cited in the USTR's 2017 Special 301 report for strengthening trade secrets law but was also identified as a concern regarding government use of intellectual property rights. AmCham Taipei's 2017 White Paper highlighted unresolved issues with Taiwan's government, including concerns about unlicensed software and pharmaceutical innovation. Recommendations were made to enhance U.S.-Taiwan commercial ties through agreements and high-level visits. In 1994, a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement was established between the United States and Taiwan. In 1994, the United States and Taiwan signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) to discuss trade and investment disputes. Talks cover market access, IPR protection, and trade capacity building. TIFA talks were suspended for six years due to Taiwan's ban on beef and pork imports with ractopamine. Talks resumed in 2013 after Taiwan allowed some beef imports with ractopamine. At the 2016 talks, the USTR urged Taiwan to resolve agricultural trade issues. The USTR highlighted progress in resolving agricultural trade issues with Taiwan, including barriers to U.S. beef and pork. Efforts to improve IP protection, market access for medical devices, and procedural fairness in trade were also noted. Congressional proposals for a bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan have been ongoing since the 109th Congress. Taiwan was designated as a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. Taiwan, a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, allows passport holders to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. The program also grants reciprocal privileges to Americans visiting Taiwan. Despite not having diplomatic relations, Taiwan had over 440,000 visitors to the U.S. in 2015, spending $1.8 billion. The U.S. has a strong interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, supported by the Taiwan Relations Act. Tensions have risen in cross-Strait relations under President Tsai due to disagreements over Taiwan's sovereignty and Beijing's pressure for a \"one China\" commitment. The PRC sees Taiwan as unfinished business from the civil war era. The PRC asserts its claim over Taiwan, viewing it as part of China and threatening force for unification. It requires Taiwan to accept the \"one-China principle\" and not maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. During the 2008-2016 Ma Ying-jeou Administration, the PRC and Taiwan reached an uneasy accommodation on the \"one-China\" demand through the \"1992 Consensus.\" This agreement allowed both sides to adhere to the one-China principle with their own interpretations. Beijing and Taipei engaged in high-level talks and signed multiple cross-Strait agreements under this formula. During the Ma Ying-jeou Administration, Taiwan and the PRC reached agreements on cross-Strait relations, including the \"1992 Consensus.\" President Tsai has not affirmed this consensus, which states that both mainland China and Taiwan belong to one China. The PRC has proposed a \"one country, two systems\" concept for reunification with Taiwan. The PRC has proposed a \"one country, two systems\" concept for reunification with Taiwan, where Taiwan will maintain its capitalist system and enjoy a high degree of autonomy after reunification. Different from other regions of China, a special administrative region like Taiwan will have its own administrative and legislative powers, independent judiciary, and rights in foreign affairs. It can manage its own party, political, military, economic, and cultural affairs, including maintaining its military forces. The central government will not interfere with troops or administrative personnel on the island. Additionally, representatives from Taiwan may hold senior positions in the central government and participate in national affairs. The \"one country, two systems\" concept has been implemented in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions. The PRC has intervened in political and judicial matters in Hong Kong and Macao since their return to Chinese sovereignty, undermining the \"one country, two systems\" concept. The PRC's policy towards Taiwan includes a looser form of the concept, as stated in a 2000 White Paper. In 2005, the National People's Congress passed an Anti-Secession Law threatening the use of force to uphold the one-China principle. Article 2 of the PRC reiterates the one-China principle, emphasizing China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Articles 5 and 7 focus on peaceful reunification, with a commitment to achieve it through negotiations and consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. The Anti-Secession Law emphasizes the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, promoting cross-Straits relations, and outlines conditions for the use of force to prevent Taiwan's secession from China. The Anti-Secession Law emphasizes maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and outlines conditions for using force to prevent Taiwan's secession from China. If peaceful means fail, the state will use necessary measures to protect sovereignty and territorial integrity, reporting to the National People's Congress. Measures will aim to protect civilians and minimize losses, also safeguarding the rights of Taiwan compatriots in China. The law does not define \"secession\" or \"major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession.\" The Anti-Secession Law does not define \"secession\" or provide guidelines on evaluating possibilities for peaceful reunification. The U.S. Department of Defense notes that the ambiguity of these 'redlines' preserves China's flexibility. PRC commentators believe President Tsai aims for \"soft independence\" by downplaying Taiwan's Chinese identity and emphasizing its distinct cultural influences. The PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the Tsai Administration of not accepting the 1992 Consensus and promoting 'de-sinicization' and 'Taiwan independence.' Xi Jinping emphasized China's goal of reunification and reiterated the principles of \"peaceful reunification\" and \"one country, two systems.\" Xi also set preconditions for dialogue with Taiwan, including recognition of the 1992 Consensus. Xi Jinping emphasized China's goal of reunification with Taiwan, stating that as long as Taiwan recognizes the 1992 Consensus and belongs to one China, exchanges with the mainland will not be difficult. He also promised development opportunities for Taiwan residents and vowed to allow them to enjoy the same treatment as local people on the mainland. Additionally, Xi asserted China's resolve to defeat any attempts for Taiwan independence. President Xi Jinping emphasized China's goal of reunification with Taiwan during the 90th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. He stated that Taiwan must recognize the 1992 Consensus and belong to one China to facilitate exchanges with the mainland. In contrast, President Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party advocates for Taiwan's sovereignty and independence, rejecting the 'one-China principle' and 'one country, two systems' proposed by China. The DPP calls for the establishment of a sovereign, independent Republic of Taiwan through a referendum, asserting that Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. President Tsai of Taiwan has been cautious about Taiwan's status, neither endorsing nor refuting the \"1992 Consensus\" or the idea of \"one China.\" Despite appointing members of the opposition party to her government, the PRC did not interpret her statements as a partial endorsement of the \"one China\" principle. President Tsai of Taiwan appointed members of the opposition party to her government, including the KMT, in an effort to build bridges with Beijing. In her inauguration speech, she acknowledged the 1992 meeting between mainland China and Taiwan, hinting at the possibility of cherishing the \"1992 Consensus.\" Tsai stated that cross-Strait affairs would be conducted in accordance with relevant laws and the Republic of China Constitution. In her speech, President Tsai challenged the PRC's interpretation of the \"political foundation\" for cross-Strait relations and the \"1992 Consensus,\" emphasizing the 1992 talks between SEF & ARATS as key elements. In 1992, talks between SEF & ARATS acknowledged setting aside differences to seek common ground. Tsai suggested this did not mean mainland China and Taiwan were parts of \"one China.\" Beijing was not satisfied with Tsai's remarks. Tsai's remarks in her speech on October 10, 2016, did not satisfy Beijing as she did not explicitly recognize the 1992 Consensus or propose concrete measures for cross-Strait relations. She expressed a desire for a consistent and peaceful relationship but emphasized that Taiwan would not yield to pressure. Tsai challenges PRC's definition of the status quo as \"peace\" and expresses concern over Beijing's actions of dividing and coercing Taiwan. She accuses Beijing of destabilizing cross-strait relations and hurting the feelings of the Taiwanese people. President Tsai accuses Beijing of challenging the cross-strait status quo and destabilizing relations with Taiwan. She declares Taiwan's commitment to peace and stability while rejecting intimidation and coercion from China. President Tsai emphasizes safeguarding Taiwan's freedom, democracy, and way of life, calling for new modes of cross-Strait interactions. The Kuomintang (KMT) was founded in mainland China in 1912 and ruled Taiwan since 1945 until 1987. The Kuomintang (KMT) lost the presidency in 2000 but regained it from 2008 to 2016. In 2016, the KMT suffered a major defeat in both presidential and legislative elections. Former ROC Vice President Wu Den-yih now leads the KMT, advocating for Taiwan's unity with mainland China under the Republic of China. The party's cross-Strait policy under former President Ma Ying-jeou aimed for a status quo of \"no unification, no independence, and no use of force.\" The KMT criticizes President Tsai for not endorsing the \"1992 Consensus,\" leading to unnecessary confrontation with the PRC. AIT Chairman James Moriarty acknowledges the lack of trust and communication in the current cross-Strait relationship and urges constructive dialogue and patience to avoid miscalculation. AIT Chairman James Moriarty praised President Tsai's leadership and commitment to maintaining stable cross-Strait ties amidst pressure from the PRC. He reiterated the U.S.'s stance on peaceful resolution and emphasized the importance of avoiding unilateral actions to change the status quo. The PRC had suspended communication with Taiwan due to President Tsai's refusal to recognize the \"1992 Consensus.\" The suspension of communication between official bodies on each side of the Taiwan Strait, including the PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office and Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, has led to low-level working level communications continuing. Beijing has pressured President Tsai to embrace \"one China\" through various actions, including engaging with Taiwan's opposition party and participating in cross-Strait exchanges. Beijing's efforts to pressure countries to switch recognition from Taiwan to China have been successful with Panama, Sao Tome and Principe, and the Gambia. Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 20 countries, including the Holy See. Beijing has also pressured countries with Taiwan trade offices to use \"Taipei\" instead of \"Republic of China\" or \"Taiwan\" in their names. In May 2017, Taiwan was blocked from attending the World Health Assembly as an observer, after attending from 2009 to 2016. In December 2016, Taiwan faced pressure from Beijing at the International Civil Aviation Organization meeting. Delegates from the PRC also forced the ejection of a Taiwan delegation from a Kimberley Process meeting in May 2017. Taiwan had attended WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016. The PRC's military aircraft and warships are operating close to Taiwan, with the Liaoning aircraft carrier passing through the Taiwan Strait. The number of mainland Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan has declined since President Tsai took office. The number of mainland Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan has significantly declined since President Tsai took office, with a 16% drop in 2016 and further decreases in 2017. The PRC's state media has linked this decline to President Tsai's policies and refusal to adhere to the 1992 Consensus. The PRC has been insisting on repatriating Taiwanese citizens suspected of fraud from foreign countries to China instead of Taiwan. Activist Lee Ming-che from Taiwan was tried in a PRC court for \"subversion of state power\" and pleaded guilty. He claimed ignorance of mainland China's development and biased media reports from the West and Taiwan. Lee Ming-che and a mainland Chinese co-conspirator were charged with attempting to overturn state power and the socialist system in Taiwan through distortion of facts and inciting public hostility. Lee, an employee of Wenshan Community College in Taipei, was detained in Hunan Province in March 2017. Taiwan's Premier called for his quick release. Taiwan's exports to mainland China fell due to slowing economic growth, with mainland China being a significant destination for foreign direct investment. Taiwan's FDI flows to mainland China in 2016 were $9.1 billion, with a total Taiwanese FDI stock in mainland China from 1991 to 2016 reaching $164.6 billion. President Ma Ying-jeou aimed to enhance commercial ties with mainland China to benefit Taiwan firms and potentially ease PRC's opposition to Taiwan's FTAs with other economies. Ma lifted trade restrictions, negotiated an ECFA with the PRC, and sought to leverage the PRC's growing economy for Taiwan's advantage. Following the signing of the ECFA in June 2010, Taiwan identified four follow-on agreements for negotiation with the PRC: trade in goods, trade in services, investment, and dispute settlement. Taiwan also concluded economic cooperation agreements with New Zealand and Singapore in 2013. However, cross-strait trade relations soured in 2014 due to protests against the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), known as the \"Sunflower Movement,\" leading to the suspension of discussions on a trade in goods agreement between the two sides. President Tsai's administration aims to reduce Taiwan's economic dependence on mainland China through various economic initiatives, including participation in free trade negotiations like the TPP and RCEP. The focus is on creating a new economic model based on innovation, employment, and equitable distribution. President Tsai's administration aims to reduce Taiwan's economic dependence on mainland China through various economic initiatives, including participation in free trade negotiations like the TPP and RCEP. Taiwan also plans to promote a \"New Southbound Policy\" to diversify its external economy. Taiwan's democracy has rapidly evolved since martial law was lifted in 1987, with U.S. officials praising its democratic achievements and describing it as a beacon of democracy in Asia. The U.S.-Taiwan relationship is based on mutual respect for democracy, human rights, and civil liberties. Taiwan is seen as a model for the region and the world with its market economy and vibrant democracy. The U.S.-Taiwan relationship is based on shared values, with Taiwan's authorities generally respecting freedom of speech and press. The 2016 State Department report highlighted Taiwan's democratic political system and free elections, resulting in the first female president and a record number of female legislators. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan has a record 38% female representation, including the first immigrant lawmaker from Cambodia. Taiwan maintained Tier One status in the 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report, showing serious efforts in combating trafficking. However, lenient penalties for traffickers were noted as a concern. Freedom House rated Taiwan as \"free\" in its 2017 rankings, highlighting its commitment to freedom and democracy. Taiwan was rated \"free\" by Freedom House in its 2017 rankings, with a score of 91 for political rights and civil liberties. China was rated \"not free\" with a score of 15. Taiwan's democratic system has allowed peaceful transfers of power and robust civil liberties. Concerns include Chinese influence, exploitation of foreign workers, and disputes over land rights. Taiwan has a highly developed and competitive economy. In 2016, Taiwan's GDP on a PPP basis was $1.1 trillion, ranking as the world's 21st largest economy. Its per capita GDP was $48,100, 15% higher than Japan's. Taiwan was the 19th largest trading economy and ranked 14th most competitive by the World Economic Forum in 2016. Taiwan's GDP growth has been slow in recent years. Taiwan's GDP growth has been slow, with a 0.7% increase in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects a 2.2% growth in 2017. The economy heavily relies on international trade, with exports totaling $331 billion in 2016. Despite challenges like declining competitiveness and stagnant wages, the unemployment rate is relatively low at 3.8%. The unemployment rate in Taiwan is 3.8%, but for those aged 20-24, it is 13%. Many young professionals are seeking better opportunities in mainland China. Over 720,000 Taiwanese citizens work abroad, with 58% in China. Taiwan's global export share decreased from 2.5% in 1993 to 1.6% in 2016 due to exclusion from trade agreements. This exclusion could harm Taiwan's industries in the long run. Taiwan's exclusion from RTAs may harm industries, reducing trade flows and economic growth. Taiwan seeks FTAs and BIAs with the US, Japan, UK, EU, and Australia. The US withdrawal from the TPP in 2017 complicates Taiwan's strategy. Taiwan aims to boost innovation and job creation through the \"five plus two\" industries program, focusing on IoT, smart machinery, biotech, green energy, defense, high-value agriculture, and the circular economy. Taiwan's Executive Yuan approved an eight-year $58 billion infrastructure development program focusing on railways, aquatic environments, green energy, digital technology, and urban and rural facilities. The government also launched a New Southbound Policy to reduce economic dependence on China and enhance relations with Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand through economic collaboration and regional connectivity. Challenges include pressure from China on Southeast Asian countries and a lack of representative offices in Cambodia and Laos. Taiwan's strategy to diversify economic ties led to positive results in foreign tourism. In 2016, mainland Chinese tourists to Taiwan decreased by 16.2%, but tourists from other Asian countries increased, boosting overall inbound tourism by 2.4%. Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 20 states and suspended \"dollar diplomacy\" efforts with China during President Ma's administration. China re-established diplomatic relations with The Gambia in 2016, a former partner of Taiwan. The Gambia broke relations with Taipei in 2013, and since President Tsai took office in May 2016, two more countries switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing - Sao Tome and Principe in December 2016, and Panama in June 2017. The Tsai Administration is closely monitoring engagement between the Holy See and the PRC, as they have explored establishing diplomatic relations but have differences over China's religious policy. Taiwan has 94 unofficial representative offices in 58 countries as of September 2016. In 2016, Taiwan had 94 unofficial representative offices in 58 countries, including 12 in the United States. Taiwan also has a mission at the World Trade Organization's headquarters in Geneva. Japan changed the name of its representative office in Taiwan to \"Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association\" in January 2017, which was criticized by the PRC. Since President Tsai took office, the PRC has pressured countries with Taiwan's unofficial offices to drop references to \"Republic of China\" or \"Taiwan\" from their names. In response to PRC pressure, several countries have ordered Taiwan's representative offices to change their names to use \"Taipei\" instead of \"Republic of China\" or \"Taiwan.\" Nigeria, Dubai, Ecuador, and Bahrain made these changes in 2017. Nigeria also reduced staff at Taiwan's unofficial office, sealed off the office in Abuja, and expelled Taiwan's top representative. Taiwan still uses the \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\" name in Jordan and Papua New Guinea. On September 22, 2017, Taiwan suspended bilateral trade with North Korea in response to security threats posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Taiwan's decision was praised by AIT Chairman Moriarty for going beyond UN sanctions. Taiwan had reported goods imports of $12.2 million from North Korea and goods exports of $507,000 in 2016. Taiwan suspended bilateral trade with North Korea in response to security threats from nuclear and missile tests. Taiwan imported $1.2 million in goods from North Korea and exported $26,600 in the first six months of 2017. Taiwan is a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, allowing officials to engage with senior officials from various countries, including the U.S. Secretary of State. Taiwan, a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, has donated pre-fabricated houses to displaced families in Iraq and is working on additional contributions for humanitarian operations in Iraq and Syria. Despite being a member of organizations like the WTO and APEC, Taiwan is barred from UN membership at China's insistence. Taiwan, known as \"Chinese Taipei\" in international organizations, faces naming challenges due to China's influence. US policy supports Taiwan's participation in organizations regardless of statehood requirements. China often hinders Taiwan's involvement in global forums. The US supports Taiwan's participation in international organizations despite China's influence. Congress has passed legislation to pressure the executive branch to implement this policy, including in organizations like the World Health Assembly, International Civil Aviation Organization, and International Criminal Police Organization. Taiwan lost its UN membership in 1971. Resolution 2758 expelled Chiang Kai-shek's representatives from the United Nations and related organizations, leading to Taiwan's exclusion. Taiwan's interpretation of the resolution remains disputed, with some arguing it did not explicitly expel Taiwan's representatives. Taiwan sought UN membership annually between 1993 and 2006 under different names. Despite efforts by diplomatic allies, the issue was never included on the General Assembly's agenda. In 2008, President Chen Shui-bian attempted to put the issue before voters through referenda, but they were declared void due to low participation. In 2007 and 2008, Taiwan's bids for U.N. membership faced opposition from U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and the United States. Both entities stated that Taiwan is considered part of China and that they do not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations requiring statehood. Dennis Wilder also emphasized that U.N. membership requires statehood, which Taiwan does not have at this point. Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, is not recognized as a state in the international community. Restrictions on Taiwan's participation in the U.N. extend to non-governmental organizations and journalists from Taiwan, who are barred from attending meetings and conferences. Taiwan's Foreign Minister called for support from the international community to allow fair treatment by the U.N. and to stop excluding them from participation. The World Health Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, replaced Taiwan with the People's Republic of China in 1972. Taiwan is now referred to as \"the Taiwan Province of China\" within the WHO. An internal 2010 WHO memorandum instructs that information related to Taiwan must be listed under China to avoid recognition of a separate status. After being expelled from the WHO, Taiwan sought observer status in the WHA in 1997. It attended as \"Chinese Taipei\" in 2009 under Ma Ying-jeou. Taiwan's health minister attended WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016 with PRC approval. In 2017, PRC blocked Taiwan's invitation to WHA as an observer to pressure President Tsai. U.S. expressed disappointment at this action. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, M.D. expressed U.S. disappointment at Taiwan not being invited to observe the World Health Assembly. The United States remains committed to ensuring Taiwan is not excluded from the WHO. Legislation requires the Secretary of State to report to Congress on efforts to endorse Taiwan's observer status at the WHA. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 3320 (Yoho) aims to amend reporting requirements to include improvements made by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has made changes and improvements to the US plan to endorse Taiwan for observer status at the World Health Assembly. The US seeks Taiwan's regular observer status and supports its participation in WHO's activities. The US insists on referring to Taiwan as 'Taiwan' or 'Chinese Taipei' in all WHO communications. The United States is concerned about restrictions imposed by the WHO on Taiwan's participation in technical bodies relevant to the island's population. In 2016, Taiwan requested to attend 13 WHO meetings but only received invitations to six. The US is actively supporting Taiwan's involvement in the INFOSAN to benefit the region. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a UN agency that sets international rules on air navigation and accidents. In 2013, Taiwan was invited to the ICAO Assembly with PRC's approval. In 2015, Dr. Fang Liu, a Chinese national, was appointed as the new Secretary General. President Tsai took office in Taiwan in 2016, but the PRC prevented Taiwan from receiving any invitations from ICAO. President Tsai took office in Taiwan in 2016. The PRC blocked Taiwan's participation in the 39th ICAO Session Assembly, despite Taiwan's efforts to stay updated on ICAO regulations for aviation safety at Taoyuan International Airport. Taiwan joined APEC as a full member economy in November 1991, but its president is barred from attending the annual economic leaders' meeting. Special envoys have been sent in their place, subject to PRC approval. In 2016, President Tsai named James Soong as her special envoy for the leaders' meeting in Lima, Peru. Soong met briefly with China's President Xi at the meeting, which was seen as a positive development by Taiwan's Presidential Office. The Republic of China's membership in INTERPOL ended in 1984 when China joined and imposed conditions on Taiwan, leading to Taiwan's exit from the organization. Beijing will host the 86th INTERPOL General Assembly in September 2017, with Meng Hongwei as the President. P.L. 114-139 directed the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL. The Secretary of State is tasked with developing a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and related activities. The United States will advocate for Taiwan's participation in INTERPOL for international safety. Taiwan's lack of membership in INTERPOL hinders access to crucial law enforcement databases. The lack of Taiwan's membership in INTERPOL hinders access to crucial law enforcement databases, leading to lost travel documents. The Department of Defense report highlights the PRC's military preparations in the Taiwan Strait to deter Taiwan's moves towards independence. The Department of Defense report outlines possible military actions by the PRC against Taiwan, including blockades, disruptive military actions, missile attacks, and an amphibious invasion. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense acknowledges the PRC's capability to impose a blockade and conduct operations to seize offshore islands. The balance of power across the Taiwan Strait is shifting in favor of the PRC, posing a challenge for Taiwan's defense. Taiwan is facing declining defensive advantages due to China's military modernization efforts, eroding historical advantages in deterring PLA aggression. Despite Taiwan's efforts to improve its defense capabilities, concerns remain about the planned shift to an all-volunteer force by 2019, leading to additional personnel costs. Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND) faces challenges including constraints in defense financial resources, manpower, acquiring advanced weapons systems, cyber security threats, and public awareness issues. Ongoing PRC military reforms may reduce the likelihood of military action against Taiwan in the near term. PRC military reforms may decrease the chance of military action against Taiwan in the near term. The PLA is expected to focus inward for the next few years due to organizational disruptions. However, if the reforms succeed, China's joint force could pose a greater threat to Taiwan in the long run. The PRC's defense budget in 2016 was significantly higher than Taiwan's. Taiwan's defense budget for 2018 is proposed at $10.79 billion, representing 2.03% of its 2016 GDP. This marks a slight increase from 2017 but falls short of the government's pledge to reach 3% of GDP. The U.S. has urged Taiwan to increase its defense spending, citing a need to keep pace with the changing security environment. Taiwan's defense budget is proposed at $10.79 billion for 2018, representing 2.03% of its 2016 GDP. AIT Chairman Moriarty emphasized the need for Taiwan to significantly increase its defense budget to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability. In the House version of H.R. 2810, it is stated that Taiwan should increase its defense budget. President Tsai's party's strong Taiwan identity may lead to a reevaluation of Taiwan's relationship to maritime features claimed in the name of the Republic of China. President Tsai, in her inauguration speech, reaffirmed Taiwan's sovereignty claims and emphasized the responsibility to safeguard the Republic of China's territory. Taiwan proposes setting aside disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea for joint development. In the East China Sea, Taiwan claims sovereignty over the Diaoyutai Islets, also claimed by the PRC and Japan, leading to tensions since Japan's purchase of three islets in 2012. In 2012, Taiwan's President proposed an East China Sea Peace Initiative to resolve territorial disputes with Japan and the PRC. The initiative led to a fisheries agreement in 2013, allowing Taiwanese and Japanese fishermen to fish around the disputed islets. The PRC's \"nine-dash line\" claim in the South China Sea is based on Taiwan's \"eleven-dash line\" from the 1940s. Taiwan and the PRC both claim sovereignty over the Paracels, Spratlys, Pratas, Macclesfield Bank, and Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Taiwan physically occupies Taiping Island in the Spratly chain, which is also claimed by the PRC, Philippines, and Vietnam. An arbitral tribunal ruled in 2016 that none of the features in the Spratly chain, including Taiping Island, are entitled to Exclusive Economic Zones or Continental Shelves under UNCLOS. Taiwan rejects the ruling on Taiping Island in the South China Sea, arguing that the arbitral tribunal did not involve Taiwan in the proceedings and undermined its rights over the area. Taiwan rejects decisions undermining its rights in the South China Sea and is excluded from regional talks. President Tsai vows to protect navigation despite exclusion. US Congress includes Taiwan in South China Sea Initiative for maritime security. The US Congress has passed legislation targeting countries in the South China Sea region, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2017 provides funding for the Taiwan Relations Act. Pending bills include provisions related to arms sales requests from Taiwan, reciprocal port calls, military exchanges, and support for Taiwan's undersea warfare capabilities. Several bills in the US Congress address Taiwan's military capabilities and relations with the United States. These bills include provisions for high-level military exchanges, reciprocal port calls, and Taiwan's participation in multilateral military exercises. Additionally, there are bills expressing support for humanitarian assistance to Taiwan, promoting travel between US and Taiwanese officials, and amending requirements for Taiwan's observer status at the World Health Assembly. Several bills in the US Congress address Taiwan's military capabilities and relations with the United States, including provisions for high-level military exchanges, reciprocal port calls, and Taiwan's participation in multilateral military exercises. Additionally, there are bills expressing support for humanitarian assistance to Taiwan, promoting travel between US and Taiwanese officials, and amending requirements for Taiwan's observer status at the World Health Assembly. H.Res. 271 (Yoho) would encourage the United States Trade Representative to commence negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement. Appendix A. The Six Assurances Appearing before the House and Senate to explain the August 17, 1982, U.S.-PRC joint communiqu\u00e9, then-Assistant Secretary of State John H. Holdridge wove into his prepared statement a set of assurances that corresponded to what Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said were assurances the Reagan Administration had offered privately to Taiwan's president a month earlier. A portion of Holdridge's testimony is reproduced below. CRS has used bold text to highlight the statements in the testimony that later became known as the \"The Six Assurances.\" Excerpt of Testimony of John H. Holdridge, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Department of State, before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, August. The August 17, 1982 U.S.-PRC joint communiqu\u00e9 did not set a specific date for ending arms sales to Taiwan. The U.S. will continue to make appropriate arms sales to Taiwan based on their defense needs. The resolution of the Taiwan problem is seen as a matter to be worked out by the Chinese themselves, with the sole concern being a peaceful resolution. The United States emphasizes the need for a peaceful resolution regarding Taiwan and rejects any mediation role or pressure on Taiwan to negotiate with China. There is no intention to revise the Taiwan Relations Act, and both sides agree to maintain contact and consultations on common issues. The United States and China agree to maintain contact and consultations on bilateral and international issues of common interest, emphasizing the need for a peaceful resolution regarding Taiwan. This does not imply prior consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan. The resolution of differences on this issue is expected to enhance the confidence of the people of Taiwan."
