The \"Reservists Pay Security Act of 2001\" guarantees that federal employees serving in the uniformed services or National Guard will not have their pay reduced during active duty. Employees are entitled to receive basic pay for each pay period while on service, ensuring no financial loss. The Reservists Pay Security Act of 2001 ensures that federal employees in the uniformed services or National Guard receive basic pay for each pay period during active duty, preventing any pay reduction. Amounts under this act are payable if the employee is entitled to reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38 and does not receive basic pay for that period. The Reservists Pay Security Act of 2001 guarantees federal employees in the uniformed services or National Guard receive basic pay during active duty. Reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38 are considered, and payments are made by the employing agency from the appropriate fund. The Office of Personnel Management oversees the implementation of this act. The Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, will prescribe regulations to implement the provisions of this section. Agency heads must establish procedures to ensure employee rights under this section, with the Federal Aviation Administration Administrator also required to do so. Terms like 'employee', 'Federal Government', and 'uniformed services' have specific meanings as defined in section 4303 of title 38. The term 'employing agency' refers to the government entity where an employee has reemployment rights under title 38. Basic pay includes all amounts payable under section 5304. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 55 of title 5. The amendments made by this section regarding nonreduction in pay for uniformed services or National Guard members apply to pay periods starting on or after September 11, 2001."
