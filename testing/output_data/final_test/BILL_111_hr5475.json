Any terms used in this section have the same meaning as in section 2032A. Tax treatment applies if the qualified heir disposes of the farmland before their death. If a qualified heir stops using farmland acquired from a decedent for farming purposes, a recapture tax is imposed. The amount of the recapture tax is determined based on rules similar to those of section 2032A, with adjustments for the increase in the farmland's value.

Definitions for terms like \"qualified conservation contribution\" and \"qualified organization\" are provided.

The percentage of value of land that is excludable is increased to 50 percent with a 2.5 percentage point adjustment.
