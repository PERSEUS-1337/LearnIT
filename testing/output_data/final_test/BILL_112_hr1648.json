    "content": "The \"Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2011\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that bullying fosters fear and disrespect, negatively impacting students' physical and psychological health, leading to high dropout rates and academic underachievement. Bullying includes various behaviors such as hitting, teasing, intimidation, and cyberbullying. Students are targeted for bullying based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Schools with anti-bullying policies see increased reporting and teacher intervention, reducing incidents. Some experience relational aggression or psychological bullying. Interventions to address bullying and harassment in schools, along with creating a positive and safe school climate, can reduce exclusionary discipline policies. A recent poll shows strong support for a Federal law to prevent bullying in schools. Students, parents, educators, and policymakers are all involved in addressing this issue.
