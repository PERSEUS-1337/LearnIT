    "content": "POLICY FOR NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION. The Congress finds that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, poses a serious threat to global security. They emphasize the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and urge all states to accede to it. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons aims to address concerns about nuclear disarmament and testing. The National Academy of Sciences recommends reducing proliferation risks associated with all forms of plutonium. The National Academy of Sciences report highlights the potential consequences of using weapons plutonium in reactors, which could be seen as endorsing separated plutonium fuel cycles. The Congress has set objectives in the National Defense Authorization Act to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament. The Congress has set eleven objectives in the National Defense Authorization Act to support the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and express views on the future of the US nuclear weapons posture. The National Defense Authorization Act sets objectives to support the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including reducing the US nuclear arsenal and adopting a no-first-use policy. The National Defense Authorization Act aims to reduce the US nuclear arsenal in line with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, while also addressing the proliferation risks of plutonium stockpiles through various measures. The President must report to Congress within one year on US efforts to achieve a treaty ending production of weapons-usable fissile material."
