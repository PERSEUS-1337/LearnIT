    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010\". Congress finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to develop clean renewable geothermal energy on appropriate Federal land. The Bureau of Land Management is authorized to issue noncompetitive geothermal leases for production of geothermal energy on Federal land, including leases to mining claim holders with valid operating plans, direct use leases, and leases on parcels that do not sell at a competitive auction. Federal geothermal energy leasing activity should be directed towards persons seeking to develop the land. Developers of geothermal energy on Federal land should be allowed to secure a discovery of geothermal energy resources, as successful development will provide increased revenue to the Federal Government through production royalties over decades. SEC. 3. Noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for development of geothermal resources allows developers to secure geothermal energy resources on Federal land, increasing revenue through production royalties. Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to include definitions related to fair market value per acre for adjoining land leases. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to establish fair market value for land leases, based on industry standards and not less than 4 times the median amount paid per acre for all leases in the previous year or $50. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to establish fair market value for land leases on qualified Federal land. A qualified geothermal professional must have at least 5 years of experience in geothermal engineering or geoscience. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010 defines terms like \"qualified lessee\" and \"valid discovery\" related to geothermal exploration and development. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010 outlines criteria for noncompetitive leasing of qualified Federal land for geothermal development if certain conditions are met. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010 sets criteria for noncompetitive leasing of qualified Federal land for geothermal development, requiring submission of geological data by a qualified lessee to demonstrate a valid discovery of geothermal resources. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010 establishes criteria for noncompetitive leasing of Federal land for geothermal development, requiring geological data submission by a qualified lessee to demonstrate a valid discovery of geothermal resources. The fair market value for leasing land is determined by the Secretary in accordance with specific procedures. The Secretary issues regulations for determinations related to fair market value of areas for leasing under the Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010. Qualified lessees are provided with proposed determinations and the opportunity to appeal within a 30-day period. The Secretary issues regulations for determining fair market value for leasing under the Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010. Qualified lessees can appeal proposed determinations within a 30-day period. After publication of a notice of request to lease land, the Secretary cannot accept any nomination for leasing unless the request has been denied or withdrawn. Regulations must be issued within 180 days of the Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2010 enactment."
