    "content": "Health care reform is a current issue in the United States, with interest in reforming health care increasing since 1994. President Obama has made it a top priority, and bills have been prepared by congressional committees. The main concerns driving reform are coverage, with over 45 million uninsured in 2007, and the recession likely increasing this number. Health care costs are rising for nearly everyone, with national spending exceeding $2.5 trillion, more than 17% of the GDP. Quality of care in the United States is only average or somewhat worse compared to other countries, with concerns about medical and medication errors harming many people annually. The three concerns in healthcare - rising costs, quality of care, and coverage for the uninsured - present significant challenges due to their complexity and potential conflicts in finding solutions. Cost-saving measures may impede efforts to improve quality, and stakeholder interests such as insurers and hospitals may be threatened by reform. Healthcare reform poses challenges for stakeholders like insurers, hospitals, and providers with investments in the current system. Transitioning to a new system may cause unease, despite potential benefits. The report focuses on coverage, cost, quality, and legislative debates surrounding Medicare and Medicaid inclusion. The report discusses key concerns in the emerging debate over healthcare reform, including the scope of reform, public vs private coverage, employment-based insurance, and state involvement. It focuses on coverage, cost, and quality issues, with potential updates as the congressional debate progresses. Other important concerns not addressed in the report include problems in private insurance. In August 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 45.7 million people had no health insurance in 2007, a decrease from the previous year. The number may be increasing again due to the recession. Families USA estimated that 86.7 million people lack insurance. According to USA, 86.7 million people were uninsured for some or all of the two-year period 2007-2008, indicating that more than 45 million people may be uninsured over a short time period. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that 26.1 million people were uninsured for the entire two-year period 2004-2005, with 17.4 million uninsured for four straight years. Access to care is not guaranteed by having coverage, as some uninsured individuals can receive care from community health clinics or pro bono doctors. Hospitals participating in Medicare are required to stabilize uninsured individuals in need of emergency care. Having health coverage does not always ensure easy access to care or the ability to pay for it. High deductible insurance plans may require significant out-of-pocket expenses before coverage kicks in. Even those with comprehensive plans may struggle with ongoing costs of chronic conditions or major illnesses. Being uninsured can lead to postponing necessary care and preventive tests. The uninsured have diverse characteristics, lacking coverage for various reasons. Many are employed full-time or have family members who are, while some are in families without anyone in the labor force. Most are not poor but are low income, with some having household incomes over $50,000. Congress is considering issues such as the importance of universal coverage and whether there should be an individual mandate for coverage. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that healthcare spending in the United States has been steadily increasing, reaching over 17% of GDP in 2009. Without changes, it is projected to rise to 25% by 2025. This high spending level raises concerns about difficult choices between healthcare and other priorities. The United States spends more on healthcare per capita compared to other industrialized countries. The United States spends more on healthcare per capita compared to other industrialized countries, with its spending more than two times greater than the median OECD country. The value of this higher spending has been questioned due to mixed performance on health care quality indicators. \"Cost\" and \"spending\" are often used interchangeably in discussions, reflecting differences in context or perspective. The rising costs of healthcare, particularly in terms of health insurance premiums, have outpaced increases in workers' earnings, leading to a rise in the number of uninsured individuals. Controlling healthcare costs is challenging, with technology being a key driver of spending increases. Controlling healthcare costs is challenging as payers may shift burdens to others, such as employers passing on costs to workers. Congressional concern includes the rising costs of federal health insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which accounted for a significant portion of the federal budget and national healthcare expenditures. The rising costs of federal health insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which accounted for about 5% of GDP, could potentially grow to 20% of GDP by 2050. Congress is considering various issues related to healthcare costs and spending, including the impact of less regulated markets, cost reduction efforts, and the balance between reducing spending and providing coverage to more people. Despite spending more on healthcare than other countries, the United States only scores average in terms of healthcare quality. The United States spends more on healthcare than other countries but only scores average in terms of healthcare quality. The country ranks near the top for survival rates in some diseases but near the bottom for others. Concerns about healthcare quality go beyond international comparisons, with issues such as medical errors being identified. Medical errors are a systemic shortcoming in healthcare. Studies have shown that faulty systems and processes lead to mistakes, resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Adhering to evidence-based practices and clinical guidelines is crucial to improving patient safety. Quality of care in the United States has been a significant issue, with only about 55% of Americans receiving recommended evidence-based care. Disparities exist among sociodemographic subgroups, with whites generally receiving better care than racial and ethnic minorities. Efforts have been made to improve the quality of care, including refining metrics and publicly reporting on quality measures. Despite progress in refining quality metrics and reporting comparative information, the 2008 National Healthcare Quality Report highlighted suboptimal healthcare quality in the US. Challenges to further improvement include disagreements on measure utility, fragmented healthcare system, and access barriers for some groups. Congress is debating pursuing quality improvements regardless of cost savings and the feasibility of enhancing care quality. The reform debate in the 111th Congress raises perennial issues about national health care policy, including public vs. private insurance, strengthening or weakening employment-based insurance, and the role of states in reform. Legislative issues will impact attempts to improve healthcare quality despite challenges in measure utility, fragmented systems, and access barriers. The legislative issues surrounding healthcare reform in the 111th Congress include debates on public vs. private insurance, employer-provided coverage, state responsibilities, and financing. Disputes over these issues could hinder efforts to achieve coverage goals. Other controversies include the cost of reform, individual vs. employer mandates, and expected financial contributions from individuals and families. The scope of healthcare reform includes debates on public vs. private insurance, employer-provided coverage, state responsibilities, and financing. President Clinton's 1993 proposal aimed to change private insurance for individuals under 65 through market restructuring, benefit standards, and financing reforms. His Health Security Act also included changes in Medicare, Medicaid, long-term care, tax code, administrative simplification, health information privacy, quality of care, malpractice reform, prevention, public health, and healthcare workforce expansion. As a result of the failed 1993 Health Security Act, subsequent healthcare reform bills have been smaller in scope. Proposals for insuring individuals under 65 have focused on creating better options for small businesses and allowing a Medicare buy-in. Other aspects of the Clinton proposal were addressed in later legislation, such as privacy rules in HIPAA and Health Savings Accounts in the Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003. Congress has taken incremental steps towards changing the private insurance market for individuals under 65. The insurance market for individuals under 65 is a key focus of health care reform. Advocates call for providing access to coverage that meets specific standards, with some suggesting Medicare reform due to its impact on healthcare delivery systems and unsustainable spending projections. H.R. 3200 includes extensive Medicare changes, while the Senate HELP Committee measure does not address Medicare. Medicare changes are a key focus of health care reform, with H.R. 3200 including extensive reforms. The Senate HELP Committee measure does not address Medicare. Medicaid might also be included to provide lower-income families with private insurance options. Private insurance is the largest source of funding for national health expenditures. Arguments are being made for improvements in quality and public health to ensure adequate healthcare for all. Private insurance is larger than Medicare and Medicaid combined, with distinctions between public and private insurance becoming blurred. Medicare and Medicaid offer private plan options, while private insurance is regulated more than other consumer products. Financing differences remain between public programs and private insurance. The debate over expanding public health programs like Medicaid, as proposed in H.R. 3200, revolves around financing, eligibility, and flexibility differences compared to private insurance. Proponents argue for simpler comprehensive coverage, while opponents are concerned about access to private insurance. States worry about financing other parts of the program despite federal funding for new populations. The debate over expanding public health programs like Medicaid, as proposed in H.R. 3200, revolves around financing and eligibility differences compared to private insurance. There is contentious debate over including a public insurance option in health insurance purchasing exchanges. The public option could provide coverage for those not typically sought by private insurers and control costs using government purchasing power. However, concerns exist about unfair competition with private plans and potential market displacement. Employment-based insurance is the primary coverage for those under 65. Appendix A states that more than three-fifths of the population is insured through employment-based insurance, which has strengths such as risk pools not based on health status and tax subsidies. There are debates on whether to strengthen, weaken, or leave employment-based insurance as is. Some propose eliminating or capping the tax exclusion for employer-paid coverage to help finance reform and discourage overly generous health benefits. Completely eliminating the exclusion could increase federal receipts by over $225 billion annually. Currently, there is a debate on capping the tax exclusion for employer-paid coverage to help finance reform and discourage overly generous health benefits. This change could generate over $225 billion annually, but may result in tax increases for many households and impact the attractiveness of employment-based insurance. Small employers are less likely to offer insurance compared to larger employers, with very small employers being the least likely to offer coverage. Both H.R. 3200 and the Senate HELP legislation are considering changes in this area. The House bill and Senate HELP legislation propose tax credits for small businesses to offer health coverage. The House bill includes a 50% tax credit for firms with 10 to 25 employees or average wages of $20,000 to $40,000. The HELP legislation suggests a tax credit for employers with 50 or fewer employees. Both measures require larger employers to offer insurance or pay a penalty, potentially impacting job creation. States regulate insurance in the private market, especially for individual and small group markets. States regulate insurance in the private market, particularly the individual and small group markets. Their authority to regulate self-insured employer plans has been preempted by ERISA, but they are responsible for regulating business practices associated with employer-purchased insurance. States also handle licensing of healthcare providers, investigating complaints, approving healthcare facilities, and governing contracts and employment. In 2007, states and local subdivisions accounted for over 12% of health care expenditures. This raises important issues for health care reform regarding the role of states. An important issue for health care reform is the role of states in governing the reformed system. Reform proposals typically assign some responsibilities to states or allow existing state laws to continue. H.R. 3200 and the HELP legislation differ in their approach to health insurance purchasing exchanges, with one proposing a national exchange and the other state-based exchanges. Both measures aim to establish national rules for benefit design, guaranteed issue, pre-existing conditions, marketing standards, and pooling mechanisms. If federal legislation is not enacted, states will have varying regulations in place. States may take action on health care reform independently if federal legislation is not passed. Massachusetts' 2006 reforms could serve as a model for state-level changes. However, states face varying problems and fiscal capacities. ERISA preemption could hinder some initiatives, leading to a patchwork of health care systems. Federal assistance may be needed to prompt state action. The cost of health care reform is a major concern, with proposals potentially costing over $1 trillion in the next decade. Subsidies for insurance and public programs are a significant part of the expenses. Mandates for coverage may only work with financial assistance for those with little money. Reform could increase costs for states, employers, employees, consumers, and taxpayers, potentially leading to financial strain for many. Health care reform legislation must not increase the federal deficit. Ways to offset spending increases and revenue reductions include increasing tax rates, reducing tax subsidies, cutting federal health program spending, and increasing borrowing. Medicare reductions and tax increases are the main offsets being considered. The largest tax increases being considered for health care reform include limiting high-income taxpayers' deductions, an income tax surcharge, and caps on employer-provided health care exclusions. Other options outlined by the Congressional Budget Office and committees have prepared comprehensive reform proposals. The Senate HELP Committee approved the Affordable Health Choices Act on July 15, while the Senate Finance Committee has not released a proposal yet. H.R. 3200 was approved by three House committees with variations on July 17 and 31. Other reform bills introduced in the 111th Congress include H.R. 15, H.R. 193, H.R. 676, H.R. 1200, H.R. 1321, H.R. 2399, H.R. 2520, H.R. 3000, S. 391, S. 703, S. 1099, S. 1240, S. 1278, and S. 1324. These bills aim to provide coverage for healthcare. The bills S. 1278 (Rockefeller) and S. 1324 (DeMint) aim to provide healthcare coverage for nearly all people in the United States, with some including an individual mandate. The Administration has not proposed its own health reform bill but has been working with Congress on legislation and negotiating with stakeholders. The FY2010 budget included principles for reform and proposed tax changes to raise $300 billion over the next 10 years. The FY2010 budget proposed significant tax changes to raise $300 billion over the next 10 years, primarily by limiting high-income taxpayers' deductions. It also included over $280 billion in Medicare savings, $22 billion in Medicaid savings, and the possibility of an additional $300 billion in Medicare savings. The Administration introduced the Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC) Act of 2009, which would consist of five members providing annual recommendations to the President on changing federal payments for Medicare services. The Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC) Act of 2009 proposed recommendations to limit Medicare spending over 10 years, with potential savings of $2 billion by 2019. IMAC's suggestions would require approval from the President and could lead to more savings beyond 2019. The Act included provisions for Congress to disapprove within 30 days. In 2007, the uninsured population had diverse characteristics: Young adults ages 19 to 24 and Hispanics were overrepresented, more than one-quarter were not native-born U.S. citizens, over half were full-time workers, and the majority had household incomes below $25,000. Uninsurance rates varied widely among states for people under age 65. States have varying rates of uninsured people under 65. Texas, New Mexico, Florida, Louisiana, Arizona, and California had the highest rates, while Massachusetts, Hawaii, Wisconsin, and Minnesota had the lowest rates. In 2007, the nation's $2.2 trillion health care spending was distributed among different services, products, and activities, with an estimated growth of 6.1% between 2007 and 2008. The table shows how the nation's $2.2 trillion health care spending in 2007 was distributed by source of funds."
