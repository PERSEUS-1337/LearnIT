    "content": "The \"Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013\" allows for deductions for contributions to disaster savings accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows eligible individuals to deduct amounts paid to a disaster savings account, limited to $5,000 per year. Eligibility is based on owning and using a residence. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows eligible individuals to deduct amounts paid to a disaster savings account if they owned and used a residence in the United States insured under a policy required by a lender. A disaster savings account is a trust created for paying disaster mitigation expenses, with specific requirements for contributions. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows eligible individuals to deduct contributions to a disaster savings account, which must be in cash or exceed the annual dollar limitation. The trustee must be a bank, insurance company, or person meeting specific criteria, and trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows individuals to deduct contributions to a disaster savings account. Trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts. Disaster mitigation expenses include safe rooms, opening protection, reinforcement of connections, and roof coverings for impact resistance. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 allows individuals to deduct contributions to a disaster savings account for various mitigation expenses such as roof coverings for impact resistance, flood resistant materials, and whole home standby generators. Additionally, the act includes provisions for seismic activity resistance, elevating structures above flood elevation, fire resistant wall assemblies, lightning protection systems, and other measures to mitigate risks of natural disasters. The Disaster Savings Accounts Act of 2013 defines an account beneficiary as the individual for whom the account was established. The tax treatment of disaster savings accounts exempts them from taxation unless they cease to be classified as such, subject to certain exceptions. Rules similar to those for traditional retirement accounts apply to account terminations, with distributions not used for disaster mitigation expenses. The tax treatment of distributions from disaster savings accounts exempts amounts used for disaster mitigation expenses from gross income. Any amount not used for disaster mitigation expenses will be included in the gross income of the beneficiary. Excess contributions must be returned before the due date of the return. Excess contributions to disaster savings accounts must be returned before the tax return due date, along with any net income attributable to the excess contribution. Any excess contribution to a disaster savings account must be returned before the tax return due date, along with any net income earned on the excess contribution. The tax on distributions not used for disaster mitigation expenses will be imposed on the account beneficiary for any taxable year with a payment or distribution from the account that is included in gross income. The amount includible in gross income under paragraph (2) is increased by 20 percent. An exception applies if the payment is made after the beneficiary becomes disabled or dies. A rollover contribution is defined if it meets specific requirements. Amounts paid into a disaster savings account are not subject to paragraph (2) if they are paid back into the account. The amount received is paid into a disaster savings account for the beneficiary within 60 days. There is a limitation on receiving multiple amounts from the account within a year. A cost-of-living adjustment is applied to the $5,000 amount in subsection (b). The $5,000 amount in subsection (b) is increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. Any increase is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. No deduction is allowed under this section for individuals who are eligible for a deduction under section 151 by another taxpayer. The deduction under this section is not allowed for a taxable year less than 12 months, except in cases of a taxpayer's death. Certain rules apply, including no deduction for rollovers and specific timeframes for contributions. Employer payments and community property laws also apply. The Secretary may require reports from the trustee of a disaster savings account regarding contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters. Deduction allowed under section 62 of the Code regardless of itemizing other deductions. The amendment introduces a new paragraph regarding disaster savings accounts and excess contributions to such accounts under the tax code. The term 'excess contributions' is defined for disaster savings accounts. The term 'excess contributions' for disaster savings accounts is defined as the total amount contributed to the accounts for the taxable year that is not deductible under section 224, plus the amount from the previous year, minus distributions included in gross income and any excess of the maximum deduction allowable over the contributions for the year. The text discusses the treatment of contributions distributed from disaster savings accounts and the failure to provide reports on these accounts. It also includes a clerical amendment to the tax code. The text introduces Sec. 224 on disaster savings accounts and Sec. 225 on cross-references. The amendments mentioned will apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
