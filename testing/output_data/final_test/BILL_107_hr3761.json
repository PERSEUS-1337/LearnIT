    "content": "The Native American Education Equity Act of 2001, also known as the Native American Education Equity Act, authorizes an assistance program for Native American-serving institutions under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will provide grants and assistance to Native American-serving institutions to enhance their capacity to serve Indian tribes. Definitions include 'Indian tribe' as any recognized group eligible for special programs, and 'Native American-serving institution' as defined for this section. Native American-serving institutions, defined as eligible institutions with at least 20% undergraduate enrollment of students from Indian tribes, can receive grants to improve their capacity to serve these tribes. Native American-serving institutions can receive grants to enhance their capacity to serve Indian tribes through activities like purchasing educational equipment, renovating facilities, supporting faculty development, curriculum development, and acquiring educational materials. Native American-serving institutions seeking assistance must provide enrollment data to demonstrate eligibility and submit required information to the Secretary for grant consideration. Native American-serving institutions must submit an application for assistance to the Secretary, including a 5-year plan for improving student assistance and other required information. Native American-serving institutions receiving funds under this section cannot receive funds under other provisions, are exempt from Section 313(d), and the Secretary must ensure equitable distribution of grants among eligible institutions. Section 399(a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to authorize appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and necessary sums for the following 4 years for section 318."
