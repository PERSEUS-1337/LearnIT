The Public Buildings Renewal Act of 2016 allows tax-exempt financing for qualified government buildings, which are defined as elementary or secondary schools under specific criteria. The term \"qualified government buildings\" includes facilities such as state colleges, libraries, courts, hospitals, public safety facilities, government offices, and related equipment or land. The term \"qualified government buildings\" includes state colleges, libraries, courts, hospitals, public safety facilities, government offices, and related equipment or land. Excluded facilities are those primarily for retail food and beverage services, recreation, entertainment, private or commercial golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, tennis clubs, skating facilities, racquet sports facilities, hot tub facilities, suntan facilities, racetracks, or convention centers. The national limitation on tax-exempt financing for qualified governmental buildings is set at $5,000,000,000. Bonds issued for such buildings cannot exceed the allocated amount. The Secretary shall allocate a portion of the amount described in subparagraph (A) to a qualified governmental building if the application meets the requirements and does not exceed the national limitation. The Secretary allocates funds to a qualified governmental building if the application includes the requested amount, the name of the owning governmental unit, project description, organizational structure, timeline, and milestone status. The curr_chunk provides details on the current status of milestones, permits, environmental approvals, sources and uses of funds, and a declaration signed under penalties of perjury. The curr_chunk explains that if bonds allocated by the Secretary are not issued within 2 years, the unused portion will be withdrawn unless an extension is granted for a valid reason. There is an exception for refunding bonds where the average maturity date must not exceed the original bonds' maturity date. The curr_chunk discusses conditions for refunding bonds, including limitations on the amount and timing of redemption. It also excludes certain facilities from depreciation or investment credits. The curr_chunk amends sections of the Code related to governmentally owned requirements and exemptions from volume cap on private activity bonds. The amendments apply to bonds issued after the enactment of the Act."
