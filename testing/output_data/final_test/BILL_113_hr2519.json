    "content": "The Act titled \"Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2013\" aims to provide relief for individuals affected by Agent Orange. Between 1961 and 1971, large quantities of herbicides, including Agent Orange, were sprayed over southern Vietnam, exposing millions of Vietnamese and Americans to toxic contaminants like dioxin and arsenic. Many Vietnamese and Americans were exposed to Agent Orange during the spraying in Vietnam. Today, there are still environmental hot spots contaminating food, soil, and wildlife with Agent Orange, negatively affecting the lives of many individuals in both countries. Victims suffer from illnesses, disabilities, and pain, often untreated or unrecognized. The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes illnesses associated with Agent Orange exposure by US Armed Forces during the Vietnam era, but no similar consideration has been given to affected Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans. Compensation is provided for severe birth defects among the children of American women veterans who served in Vietnam. The list of birth defects covered for children of American women veterans who served in Vietnam includes achondroplasia, cleft lip, congenital heart disease, clubfoot, and more. Affected children receive medical care and benefits. In contrast, the only recognized birth defect for children of male American veterans is spina bifida, resulting in most affected children receiving no benefits. The Institute of Medicine has suggested a possible link between exposure to herbicides in Vietnam and transgenerational effects. Recent studies have found epigenetic connections between toxin exposure and birth defects in subsequent generations of exposed individuals. No assistance has been provided to the children of male American veterans with spina bifida or to Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans affected by exposure. The United States has been addressing environmental contamination in southern Vietnam related to Agent Orange since 2007, providing funds for public health and disabilities activities. The purpose of this Act is to remediate ongoing issues from Agent Orange use during the Vietnam era. Assistance for individuals affected by health issues related to exposure to Agent Orange. The Secretary of State provides assistance for covered individuals affected by health issues related to exposure to Agent Orange, including medical services, vocational training, and medical equipment. Assistance is also provided to caregivers and institutions in Vietnam, including medicines, custodial care, training programs, and reconstructive surgical programs. Additionally, assistance is provided for housing and poverty reduction. The Secretary of State provides assistance for covered individuals affected by health issues related to exposure to Agent Orange, including medical services, vocational training, and medical equipment. Assistance is also provided for housing and poverty reduction, including repairing and rebuilding substandard homes, providing micro grants and loans for subsistence payments, and facilitating poverty reduction. Additionally, assistance is provided for environmental remediation in geographic areas of Vietnam with high levels of Agent Orange contamination, prioritizing heavily sprayed areas and military bases where Agent Orange was handled. The Secretary of State provides assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical services, vocational training, housing, and poverty reduction. Assistance is also given for environmental remediation in heavily sprayed areas of Vietnam. The Secretary encourages partnerships between private and public sectors to achieve the goals of the program. Vietnam supports development assistance and corporate philanthropy programs for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange. A \"covered individual\" is defined as a resident of Vietnam affected by health issues related to Agent Orange exposure or living in areas with high levels of Agent Orange. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will support research on health issues of individuals affected by Agent Orange, following recommendations from the United States Institute of Medicine. Schools of public health and medicine in the US, Vietnam, and other countries will be actively involved in this research. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services will provide health assessment and assistance for Vietnamese-Americans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide grants for health assessments of Vietnamese-Americans exposed to Agent Orange and establish centers for assessment, counseling, and treatment in areas with large Vietnamese-American populations. This may be carried out through community organizations. SEC. 6. Provision of benefits for children of male veterans who served in Vietnam affected by certain birth defects. In General, Subchapter II of chapter 18 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to remove references to \"woman Vietnam veteran\" and replace them with \"Vietnam veteran.\" Access to medical records for research purposes is also expanded for individuals receiving health care under this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized to conduct research on the intergenerational effects of Agent Orange exposure. The table of sections in chapter 18 of title 38 is updated to reflect these changes. SEC. 7. DEADLINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION.\n\nWithin 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs must each create a plan for implementing the Act's provisions. They must issue requests for proposals if needed and implement the Act within 18 months.\n\nSEC. 8. QUARTERLY REPORTS. SEC. 8. QUARTERLY REPORTS.\n\nWithin 30 days after each fiscal quarter, the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs must submit a report to Congress on the Act's implementation. \n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITION.\n\n\"Agent Orange\" in this Act includes any chemical compound that was part of herbicide agents used in military operations in Vietnam."
