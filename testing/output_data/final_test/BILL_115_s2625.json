    "content": "The \"Allocation for Music Producers Act\" or the \"AMP Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It pertains to the payment of statutory performance royalties. The \"Allocation for Music Producers Act\" amends Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code, to allow a nonprofit collective to distribute payments to producers, mixers, or sound engineers involved in creating a sound recording, upon instructions from an artist payee. The \"Allocation for Music Producers Act\" allows a nonprofit collective to distribute payments to producers, mixers, or sound engineers involved in creating a sound recording, upon instructions from an artist payee in the form of a 'letter of direction'. If accepted by the collective, the person entitled to payment will be treated as the owner of the right to receive such payment during the period specified in the letter of direction. The \"Allocation for Music Producers Act\" allows a nonprofit collective to distribute payments for sound recordings fixed before November 1, 1995, even without a letter of direction from the artist payee. The collective is authorized to accept payment instructions in various circumstances beyond those specified in the act. The nonprofit collective must have a policy to deduct 2 percent of receipts from licensing transmissions of pre-November 1, 1995 sound recordings and distribute it to specified persons after deducting costs. The nonprofit collective must deduct 2 percent of receipts from licensing transmissions of pre-November 1, 1995 sound recordings and distribute it to specified persons after deducting costs, provided certain requirements are met. This includes certification of attempts to obtain a letter of direction from the artist payee for a period of at least 4 months. The nonprofit collective must deduct 2 percent of receipts from licensing transmissions of pre-November 1, 1995 sound recordings and distribute it to specified persons after deducting costs. This involves certification of efforts to obtain a letter of direction from the artist payee for a minimum of 4 months. Additionally, a portion of royalties is payable to the featured recording artist during a specific period, provided certain conditions are met. The collective must attempt to notify the artist payee of certification before the first distribution, and the artist payee must not object in writing 10 business days before the distribution to be eligible for payment. A person is eligible for payment if they are a producer, mixer, or sound engineer of the sound recording and have a written contract with a record company or recording artist allowing them to participate in royalty payments based on the exploitation of the sound recording. The person eligible for payment must have a written contract with a record company or recording artist, made a creative contribution to the sound recording, and submit a written certification to the collective. Multiple certifications are allowed. In cases where multiple individuals meet the requirements for a distribution under a sound recording, the collective will divide the distribution equally among them. If an artist objects to a distribution, the collective must stop further payments related to that distribution within 10 business days. The collective will distribute payments equally among eligible individuals. If an artist objects to a distribution, the collective must stop further payments within 10 business days. The objection will not affect previous distributions made before the collective stops payments. During a distribution period, the recipient of payments is considered the owner, and the artist payee has no claim to the payments. An artist payee is defined as someone who owns the right to receive payments for a sound recording. If multiple artist payees object, it only affects their share of the payments. The amendment to Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code, designates a nonprofit collective to receive payments on behalf of artist payees. Multiple artist payees can object, affecting only their share of the payments. The amendment designates a nonprofit collective to receive payments on behalf of artist payees, allowing multiple payees to object affecting only their share of the payments. The amendment also replaces references to \"designated agent\" with \"nonprofit collective\" and \"agent\" with \"collective\" throughout the text. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Act and its amendments will take effect upon enactment."
