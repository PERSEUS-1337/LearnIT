The amended Section 40122(a) of title 49, United States Code, allows for dispute resolution through mediation with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service if an agreement is not reached with the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. If no agreement is reached, the parties can opt for alternative procedures or submit their issues to binding arbitration with the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The Federal Service Impasses Panel assists parties in resolving disputes by ordering binding arbitration through a private arbitration board appointed by the Executive Director. The Federal Service Impasses Panel assists parties in resolving disputes by ordering binding arbitration through a list of arbitrators with Federal sector experience. Each party selects one arbitrator from the list, and the two chosen arbitrators then select a third arbitrator from the same list. The arbitration process involves selecting arbitrators from a list, framing issues in controversy, and conducting hearings if parties do not agree on the issues. The arbitration board conducts hearings where parties can present evidence and their case, with decisions rendered within 90 days and being binding. The parties share arbitration costs equally. Upon reaching a voluntary agreement or conclusion of binding arbitration, the final agreement is subject to ratification by the employees' bargaining representative and approval by the agency head. Enforcement actions can be taken in United States courts. United States courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate enforcement actions under this section in any judicial district where the violation occurred. The Federal Aviation Administration may be subject to attorney fees and litigation costs in cases where the complainant prevails. Changes to the personnel management system implemented by the Administrator after July 10, 2005, require agreement with the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. The exclusive bargaining representative of the Federal Aviation Administration employees certified under section 7111 of title 5, United States Code, shall resume negotiations promptly if the last mutual agreement is void. If a new agreement is not reached within 45 days, the issues will be submitted to the Federal Service Impasses Panel for binding arbitration. If the Administrator and the exclusive bargaining representative reach a final agreement before the enactment of this Act, the agreement will supersede any changes made by the Administrator without the representative's agreement. Subsections (b) and (c) will not take effect in this case."
