    "content": "There is concern over the US deficits and budget outlook, leading to debates on tax reform. Congress may address these issues by looking at tax benefits for homeowners, estimated to cost $136.3 billion annually. Economists suggest reforming these benefits for improved economic efficiency, focusing on the mortgage interest deduction and deduction for property taxes. The homeownership rate in the US has fluctuated over time, with a peak of 69% in 2004 and currently around 65%. Of the 132.6 million homes in the US, 75.0 million are principal residences, 39.7 million are renter-occupied, and 17.9 million are either for sale, for rent, or for seasonal use. The size of homes owned by Americans has increased over time, with the median new home size rising from 1,385 square feet in 1970 to 2,135 square feet in 2009. Despite this, family sizes have decreased. This trend of larger homes and smaller families can impact land use, energy consumption, transportation, and affordability. These long-term homeownership trends contrast with more recent trends in foreclosures. The national foreclosure rate on mortgage loans increased between 2007 and 2008, peaking in late 2009 and early 2010 before gradually decreasing. By the fourth quarter of 2013, the foreclosure rate on all loans was 2.86%, with subprime borrowers at 10.43%. As of March 2014, there were significant tax incentives benefiting homeowner-occupiers, costing the federal government $136.3 billion annually in foregone revenue. The tax benefits in 2017, including mortgage interest deduction, state and local property tax deduction, and exclusion of capital gains on the sale of a principal residence, have significant budget impacts. Some argue that the exclusion of imputed rental income should also be considered, with unofficial estimates placing the foregone revenue at $20-30 billion annually. The focus is on mortgage interest and property tax deductions, as the effects of the exclusion of capital gains differ fundamentally. The largest tax benefit for homeowners is the mortgage interest deduction, allowing them to deduct interest paid on a mortgage for a primary or secondary residence if they itemize deductions. This deduction can reduce income taxes based on the homeowner's marginal tax rate. Higher-income individuals benefit more from the mortgage interest deduction due to larger payments on more expensive homes. The deduction is limited to the interest on the first $1 million of mortgage debt and up to $100,000 of home equity debt. The mortgage interest deduction allows for the deduction of interest payments on up to $1 million of mortgage debt and $100,000 of home equity debt. Originally, the deduction was intended to allow for the deduction of expenses incurred in generating income, without making a distinction between business, personal, living, or family expenses. Households in the past had minimal debt, with credit cards and widespread mortgage finance being non-existent. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limited mortgage interest deductions and the number of homes eligible for the deduction. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 established current deduction limits. Not all homeowners claim the mortgage interest deduction. Around 48% of homeowners claim the mortgage interest deduction, with 73% of mortgage holders claiming it. The remaining 27% of mortgage holders likely do not claim the deduction due to various reasons such as nearing the end of their mortgage payments or living in a low-cost area. The deduction is claimed on about 25% of all federal income tax returns and 78% of itemized returns. Additionally, homeowners benefit from deducting state and local property taxes. Homeowners can deduct state and local property taxes paid, with the deduction increasing with taxpayer income. The deduction allows homeowners to reduce their income taxes based on their tax bracket. Higher-income individuals with more expensive homes benefit more from this deduction. The deduction for state and local property taxes allows homeowners to reduce their income taxes based on their tax bracket. It was not intended to encourage homeownership but rather to account for compulsory tax payments. Deductible taxes include real estate taxes, personal property taxes, income taxes, and sales taxes. The deduction for state and local sales taxes was only available through 2013. The deduction for state and local property taxes can be taken in lieu of the deduction for income taxes. In 2011, 54% of homeowners claimed this deduction, which was taken on over 28% of federal income tax returns. Approximately 87% of itemizers claimed the property tax deduction, higher than those claiming the mortgage interest deduction. The next largest tax benefit is the exclusion of capital gains from the sale of a principal residence, up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly. The tax treatment of capital gains on housing, including the exclusion of imputed rental income, has important effects on the economy. Homeowners can exclude up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly from taxable income. However, this exclusion has a minimal impact on the homeownership rate due to the upfront down payment being the main barrier. Currently, rental property owners are taxed on their net rental income, deducting costs like mortgage interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation. Homeowners, on the other hand, can deduct mortgage interest and taxes without paying taxes on their \"rent.\" This subsidy for owner-occupied housing over rental housing is further supported by additional tax benefits available to homeowners, such as tax-exempt interest on mortgage revenue bonds. Tax benefits for homeowners include deducting premiums for qualified mortgage insurance and excluding forgiven mortgage debt from taxable income. Homeownership is also supported by non-tax-related programs like federal home loan banks, FHA and VA loan insurance, and USDA loan programs. The government supports homeownership through various programs such as favorable loan terms for farmers, guaranteeing financial institutions for mortgage financing, funding counseling agencies for homebuyers, and providing down payment assistance. Subsidizing homeownership is justified by benefits to society, income distribution, and individual financial security. Tax benefits for homeowners are often justified by the positive externalities generated by homeownership, which benefit society as a whole. Positive externalities occur when one individual's actions benefit others in society. Governments intervene through taxes and subsidies to align individual interests with societal benefits. Tax benefits for homeowners are often justified by the positive externalities generated by homeownership, which benefit society as a whole. Governments may intervene through taxes and subsidies to align individual interests with societal benefits, such as the positive effect ownership has on property values in a community. Homeowners are more likely to make investments that raise surrounding property values, positively influencing the values of surrounding properties. Homeownership generates positive externalities such as neighborhood stability, social and political involvement, lower crime rates, and responsible behavior among youths. Economists have found a correlation between homeownership and these positive effects. DiPasquale and Edward Glaeser found that homeowners are more likely to be involved in non-professional organizations, know local officials, vote in elections, and garden. Studies show a positive relationship between homeownership and children's academic performance. Rohe and Stewart found a correlation between homeownership rates and home value increases. Economists struggle to establish causality between homeownership and these positive effects due to observable differences between owners. There are reasons for researchers struggling to establish causality between homeownership and positive effects. Observable differences between owners and renters, as well as unobservable differences, can lead to false conclusions and incorrect attributions of influence. Statistical methods can be used to address unobservable differences in determining causality, but reliability depends on certain assumptions. Researchers debate whether these assumptions hold and if reported results are reliable. Another challenge is the potential interaction between homeownership and desired outcomes, such as increased property values. Determining causality is complex due to homeowners' preferences for rising home values. Statistical methods exist to address this interdependence, but reliable results hinge on specific assumptions, sparking further debate among researchers. Determining the impact of homeownership on externalities is debated among researchers due to reliability issues with statistical methods. The difficulty in establishing causality raises questions about the justification for housing subsidies. Estimating the magnitude of homeownership benefits is challenging, making it hard to determine the appropriate level of subsidization. The debate over the amount of subsidization for homeownership revolves around the potential negative externalities it may create. While some economists argue that current subsidies are substantial, reducing them could free up resources for more socially valuable investments like education. The impact of homeownership on externalities is uncertain, with the possibility that it may result in negative consequences for society. Homeownership can impact property values, with defaults leading to decreased values in the neighborhood. This lack of diversification in homeowners can cause economic shocks to spread. Additionally, homeowners may push for initiatives that exclude certain groups from their communities. Zoning restrictions may exclude certain groups from communities to protect property values. Subsidizing homeownership may not be the most efficient remedy; instead, incentivizing exterior investments directly could be more effective. The government could offer incentives for activities like painting or landscaping to benefit both renters and homeowners. Promoting homeownership can lead to higher property values and economic benefits. Homeowners have higher incomes, savings, and access to wealth through home equity. This can help achieve a more even distribution of income and wealth. Promoting homeownership may help achieve a more even distribution of income and wealth. Economists debate whether homeownership leads to higher income and wealth or if higher-income households are more likely to become homeowners. It could also be related to the ability of wealthier households to invest in their children. Investing in education may be a more efficient way to achieve wealth distribution. Homeownership is seen as a way to build personal savings, especially as personal saving rates in the US have declined. Promoting homeownership is seen as a way to build personal savings, especially as personal saving rates in the US have declined over the past decade. Home equity can be used for various purposes such as home improvements, college expenses, or retirement income. Homeownership also helps in building credit scores and accessing cheaper credit. However, there are risks involved in homeownership as the financial return may not be as high or predictable as believed, with differences across income groups and regional markets to consider. There are differences across income groups and regional markets that should be considered with homeownership. Lower-income households may have lower returns due to various factors like not claiming deductions or paying higher mortgage rates. However, homes in lower-income markets may experience greater appreciation. The financial return on homeownership depends on market conditions and alternative investments. Policies promoting homeownership should take these factors into account. Households should diversify their portfolios to minimize risk, but homeownership can complicate this due to the large and indivisible nature of a home as the largest asset. Combining a home with human capital further complicates diversification, as seen in the recent housing market crash. Areas with high unemployment suffered high foreclosure rates, impacting certain industries and age groups. Homeownership may not be financially prudent for all Americans due to the use of substantial mortgage debt, increasing exposure to fluctuations in home prices. This can lead to negative equity or being \"underwater\" on the mortgage, with significant transaction costs involved in selling a house. Owning a house incurs significant transaction costs and is considered an illiquid asset, increasing risk. Homeownership can lead to improved psychological wellbeing, higher self-esteem, and life satisfaction. It also promotes a sense of security, stability, and control, potentially reducing stress. However, struggling to make mortgage payments can have the opposite effect. Some also suggest physical health benefits associated with homeownership. Homeownership may provide higher-quality living conditions leading to better physical health. It allows households to cope with health events by using home equity. Researchers face challenges in determining causation from correlation in studying the health benefits of homeownership. Some economists question the need for widespread homeownership subsidy programs if benefits are individual rather than societal. The text discusses the effects of tax incentives on homeownership rates and the overall economy. It questions whether tax provisions like mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction actually increase homeownership. The analysis focuses on addressing barriers that households face in achieving homeownership and how subsidizing owner-occupied housing impacts the economy. Economists have identified high transaction costs, primarily the down payment requirement, as the main barrier to homeownership. Household income influences the decision to buy a home, but the ability to finance a down payment is more significant. Tax deductions like mortgage interest and property tax do not effectively lower the down payment barrier, as they only reduce annual homeownership costs without providing upfront assistance in purchasing a home. The mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction do not effectively lower the down payment barrier for homeownership. These deductions are not well targeted towards lower-income households, limiting their benefits to potential first-time buyers. The mortgage interest deduction, property tax deduction, and exclusion of imputed rental income have been debated for their impact on homeownership rates. Research suggests that these tax benefits account for a significant increase in homeownership post-World War II. However, the long-term effects depend on the interaction between rental and owner-occupied housing markets. The study's approach lacks the ability to separate the individual effects of each tax benefit. The study's model cannot isolate the effects of individual tax benefits, potentially overestimating the impact of repealing them. Economists Glaeser and Shapiro challenge Rosen and Rosen's findings, suggesting uncertainty in the long-term effects of repealing these tax benefits. Glaeser and Shapiro conducted an empirical investigation on the impact of the mortgage interest deduction on homeownership rates. They found no significant relationship between inflation, itemization rate, and homeownership rate, contradicting previous findings by Rosen and Rosen. The home mortgage interest deduction does not significantly impact homeownership rates according to Glaeser and Shapiro. Economists Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf suggest that innovation in mortgage markets, not tax policy, was the main factor driving increased homeownership over the last decade. The mortgage interest deduction and property tax benefits can influence the size of homes purchased by taxpayers, especially for higher-income households. These tax benefits lower the effective annual price of homeownership, leading to larger home purchases among those who can take advantage of them. Tax policy, such as mortgage interest and property tax deductions, can impact housing consumption by influencing home prices. These deductions increase after-tax income for homeowners, potentially leading to higher home prices. This could result in a disincentive to purchase larger homes, affecting land use, energy use, and transportation, including increased commuting distances and carbon emissions. Traffic congestion may increase if transportation infrastructure is not improved to support outward transition. Larger homes may lead to higher energy use for heating and cooling. The mortgage interest deduction had a significant impact on housing consumption during the recent housing boom, with some homebuyers opting for interest-only mortgage products. These products were attractive due to low interest rates and rising home prices, allowing homeowners to refinance before the interest-only period ended. The mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction can improve the long-term performance of the U.S. economy by promoting homeownership and addressing market failures. Providing preferential tax treatment for homeowners encourages capital and labor to flow into the housing sector, resulting in higher returns and overall economic well-being. Providing preferential tax treatment to homeowners can divert capital and labor from more productive sectors of the economy, potentially harming long-term economic performance. Reducing tax preferences for homeowners could improve the budgetary situation of the United States by increasing federal tax revenues. Housing tax policy can influence the economy in the short term by reinforcing factors that led to the housing market boom and subsequent bust. The ability to deduct interest on exotic mortgage products and home equity loans may have encouraged expensive home purchases and increased consumption. This could divert capital and labor from more productive sectors, potentially harming long-term economic performance. In 2005, The Economist estimated that over two-fifths of all private-sector jobs created since 2001 have been in housing-related sectors. Encouraging homeownership may slow the economy's recovery during a recession by hindering workers' ability to transition to stronger sectors. For example, a homeowner may struggle to sell their house to accept a job elsewhere, impacting the overall economic recovery process. The deduction for state and local property taxes is provided because these payments are compulsory, impacting a taxpayer's ability to pay federal income tax. However, the deductibility of such taxes depends on the benefits received in exchange. For instance, a homeowner paying a private company for trash collection services cannot deduct these payments for tax purposes. When property taxes are used to finance government services, the property tax deduction may not be justified. Taxpayers may pay for services they do not value, such as a childless homeowner paying for a public school system. However, taxpayers can still argue for the deductibility of property taxes, as it is the local government that determines which services are provided. One justification for the mortgage interest deduction is to promote neutrality between homeowners who rely on debt financing and those who rely on equity financing. This deduction aims to balance the tax preference for equity financing, which is typically used by higher-income individuals. The mortgage interest deduction promotes financing neutrality among homeowners of different income levels by balancing the tax preference for equity financing. Debt financing increases a homeowner's exposure to home price fluctuations, leading to potential problems if the taxpayer needs to move or sell their house unexpectedly. Increased leveraging can also impose costs on surrounding property owners if it raises the risk of foreclosure. The mortgage interest deduction can lead to costs for surrounding property owners if it increases the risk of foreclosure, impacting neighboring home values. Congress has options to change this deduction, such as converting it into a credit or limiting the deductibility of state and local property taxes. Eliminating mortgage interest and property tax deductions could be a policy alternative to taxing net imputed rental income. Non-economists may not fully accept the idea of taxing implicit income from homeownership. Limited data on rental rates and property values complicates the implementation of such a tax. The impact on the economy and housing market would depend on the phased elimination of these deductions. Eliminating mortgage interest and property tax deductions could impact the economy and housing market. Sudden elimination may decrease home purchases and prices, leading to capital losses for current owners. Gradual phase-out could mitigate negative consequences, such as reduced new home construction and homeowner wealth, and potential defaults. Researchers propose gradually eliminating mortgage interest and property tax deductions over 15-20 years to mitigate negative consequences for the economy and housing market. This approach could potentially delay short-term impacts and lead to a net improvement in long-term economic performance. Eliminating mortgage interest and property tax deductions could improve the economy by reducing distortions, directing capital and labor to more productive sectors, increasing federal revenue by $108.8 billion annually, and decreasing reliance on deficits for spending. The mortgage interest and property tax deductions could be limited to target benefits more effectively. Currently, deductions allow for up to $1 million of mortgage debt and $100,000 of home equity debt. State and local property taxes are fully deductible. Limiting the deductions could provide a tax benefit to a large number of taxpayers who would become homeowners regardless. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the cost of gradually reducing the maximum mortgage amount. The CBO has proposed reducing the maximum mortgage amount eligible for interest deduction from $1.1 million to $500,000, raising $41.4 billion between 2013 and 2019. Chairman Dave Camp's tax reform draft also suggests limiting mortgage size to $500,000 by 2015, with no deduction for home equity debt after 2014. New limits would only apply to new mortgage debt, with a grandfather provision for refinanced debt. The proposal includes a grandfather provision for refinanced debt if the original mortgage debt is incurred prior to the mortgage limits being reduced. One option is to limit the amount of interest that can be deducted to a percentage of adjusted gross income (AGI), like 10%, 12%, or 15%. The CBO has suggested limiting the deduction for all state and local taxes to 2% of AGI, estimating a potential revenue increase of $625.7 billion between 2010 and 2019. The CBO suggests limiting property tax deductions to increase revenue, potentially affecting first-time buyers and homeowners with multiple properties. Options include limiting deductions to a taxpayer's primary residence or those below a certain income threshold. The current deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes disproportionately benefit higher-income homeowners due to limitations on itemized deductions. Replacing them with a tax credit could benefit more homeowners by eliminating the need for itemization and reducing the burden of tax preparation. A refundable tax credit could provide a more consistent rate of subsidization across homeowners and better target those in need. Converting the mortgage interest deduction to a refundable tax credit could better target lower-income homeowners. Various options have been proposed, including limiting the deduction to a taxpayer's principal residence, allowing a 15% credit rate, and capping the maximum eligible mortgage amount. The CBO suggested converting the deduction in a recent report on deficit reduction options. The Reducing the Deficit report proposed converting the mortgage interest deduction to a 15% nonrefundable tax credit, limited to a taxpayer's primary residence. The credit would phase in between 2014 and 2018, with a reduced maximum mortgage amount eligible for the credit. Starting in 2019, only the credit could be claimed on mortgage amounts up to $500,000. Similar options were previously suggested by the CBO and Alan Viard from the American Enterprise Institute. President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Fiscal Commission) has recommended replacing the mortgage interest deduction with a nonrefundable credit equal to 12% of the interest paid on mortgages of $500,000 or less for a taxpayer's primary residence. The Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Taskforce proposes a 15% credit for up to $25,000 of interest paid on a mortgage associated with a principal residence, excluding interest on home equity loans and second homes. The proposed tax credit for mortgage interest would be refundable and administered through mortgage lenders, allowing lower-income homeowners to benefit. In 2005, President George W. Bush's Tax Reform Panel suggested a 15% credit for mortgage interest paid on a primary residence, limited to the average home price in the taxpayer's region. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) proposed a 15% credit for interest on mortgages under $500,000 in 2009."
