    "content": "Hurricane Sandy was a historic storm with significant impact, comparable to Gulf Coast storms in 2005. Congress responded with hearings, visits, and legislation, including evaluating the need for supplemental appropriations and reforming the Stafford Act. Concerns were raised about delays and bureaucratic challenges in the recovery efforts. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 revised the Stafford Act in response to delays and bureaucratic challenges in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy. It provided a $50.7 billion disaster assistance package and increased the National Flood Insurance Program's borrowing authority by $9.7 billion. These laws are discussed in CRS Report R42869, FY2013 Supplemental Funding for Disaster Relief. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 aims to streamline disaster assistance programs authorized by the Stafford Act. It reauthorizes pilot programs from the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act and allows tribes to request emergency declarations. FEMA is directed to establish procedures for resolving disputes related to disaster assistance. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 modified disaster assistance programs funded by the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate approved $60.41 billion in supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance and mitigation, including reforms to disaster assistance authorities. The bill also included the Disaster Recovery Act of 2012. The House passed H.R. 219, the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, which was added to H.R. 152 (Division B\u2014Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013) and signed into law as P.L. 113-2. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, signed into law as P.L. 113-2, amended the Stafford Act to allow tribal groups to directly request disaster declarations from the federal government, instead of relying on state governors. This change was sought by FEMA to address the independence and sovereignty concerns of tribal governments. The updated policy allows tribal groups to directly request disaster declarations from the federal government, strengthening government-to-government relationships and improving emergency management. FEMA views tribal governments as sovereign nations and consults with them before taking actions that may affect them. The policy aims to eliminate procedural impediments and work effectively with tribal governments. The amendment to the Stafford Act now allows tribes to request disaster declarations directly from the President, giving them the same authority as states. This change addresses issues of tribal sovereignty and ensures that tribes can receive assistance without relying on state governments. The amendment to the Stafford Act allows tribes to request disaster declarations directly from the President, giving them the same authority as states. This change addresses issues of tribal sovereignty and ensures tribes can receive assistance without relying on state governments. The amendment also includes a cost-share adjustment for tribes affected by disasters. The amendment to the Stafford Act allows tribes to request disaster declarations directly from the President, giving them the same authority as states. This change addresses issues of tribal sovereignty and ensures tribes can receive assistance without relying on state governments. Section 1110 of P.L. 113-2 adds flexibility for the President to waive or adjust non-federal contributions for tribal governments in disaster assistance. The President may waive cost-shares for tribal governments under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and adjust the cost-share for the Public Assistance program. FEMA's criteria for providing Individual Assistance during disasters have raised interest from Congress and state governments. State governments and Congress are interested in FEMA's review of factors for providing Individual Assistance during disasters. The review, mandated by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, aims to update regulations that have not been adjusted since 1999. FEMA will collaborate with state, tribal, and local emergency management agencies to expedite the declaration process. The current factors considered for disaster declaration or designation are outlined in FEMA's regulations. FEMA regulations direct special attention to trauma factor when measuring severity of disasters. Trauma includes injuries, deaths, disruption of community functions, and loss of power or water. Recent experiences highlight importance of addressing extended power outages during disasters. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 impacts the Individual Assistance program by amending the Stafford Act. Attention has been given to providing child care assistance during natural disasters, with a challenge being that many providers are private entities not covered by the Stafford Act. Expanding federal grant eligibility for services like child care facilities and health clinics may be justified. Child care facilities and health clinics provide essential services during natural disasters, filling gaps left by limited resources. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 includes child care as an eligible expense under the Other Needs Assistance program, part of the Federal Assistance to Individuals and Households Program. ONA offers emergency assistance for immediate needs not covered by insurance, including medical, dental, funeral expenses, and replacement of personal property. The Individuals and Households Pilot Program, authorized by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, aims to increase the use of existing rental housing for temporary housing for disaster victims. The program allows for repair and improvement of multi-family rental properties in disaster areas to provide more rental options for victims. Assistance under the program is cost-shared between the federal government and the state, with a limit of 18 months and $31,900 per household. Section 1103 increases FEMA's options for providing temporary housing under the Individuals and Households Program (IHP) by allowing lease agreements with owners of multi-family units. This new authority complements the existing \"direct assistance\" provision in the Stafford Act, providing additional options for temporary housing beyond manufactured housing. FEMA's Section 1103 allows lease agreements with owners of multi-family units for temporary housing, contributing to the local economy. The government pays for repairs to make units habitable, deducting costs from the lease agreement. This approach was piloted in Texas and Iowa, showing cost savings compared to providing manufactured homes. The Texas pilot project for FEMA's Section 1103 showed significant cost savings compared to providing manufactured homes. The estimated total cost for the project is $897,358, with savings of $363,522 to the federal government. This approach provides FEMA with another tool for housing individuals in their home area during disasters. The Public Assistance program provides financial aid to state and local governments and eligible non-profits for disaster response and recovery. The program has faced criticism for being inflexible, especially after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 created alternative procedures under Section 428 of the Stafford Act to address these concerns, except for Emergency Protective Measures. The new alternative procedure for Category B\u2014Emergency Protective Measures aims to reduce costs, increase flexibility, expedite assistance, and incentivize timely project completion. Participation is voluntary, and the law mandates requirements for repair, restoration, replacement of facilities, and debris removal assistance. The alternative procedures for debris removal assistance under the Stafford Act include major revisions for how FEMA can provide assistance for damaged facilities. This includes issuing grants based on cost estimates, revising in-lieu contributions, and consolidating project worksheets for public assistance projects. Under new alternative procedures, FEMA can issue public assistance grants based on estimates of total eligibility, as authorized by Section 406(e) of the Stafford Act. The President was directed to convene an expert panel on cost estimation, but regulations implementing these procedures have not been issued. Additionally, a Public Assistance Pilot Program was authorized under Section 689j of PKEMRA. The creation of a Public Assistance Pilot Program under PKEMRA allows the President to issue grants based on estimates for public assistance projects. FEMA typically reimburses based on actual costs but uses cost-estimating processes for some projects. Grants based on estimates are issued for projects costing less than $67,500 or eligible for simplified procedures under the Stafford Act. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act allows for simplified procedures for Public Assistance projects under the Stafford Act. Grants based on estimates of eligible costs can be issued, but it is unclear if there is a limit on the amount of assistance available. FEMA will interpret and implement these procedures. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows for grants based on estimates of eligible costs for Public Assistance projects under the Stafford Act. FEMA has implemented procedures limiting estimated assistance on single facility projects to $500,000, which may contradict legislative intent but is a feasible option based on past precedent. Regulations for cost estimation procedures under Section 406(e)(3) of the Stafford Act have not been issued, so alternative procedures provide basic guidelines for determining estimated eligible assistance for each project. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows grants based on estimates of eligible costs for Public Assistance projects under the Stafford Act. FEMA should accept estimates from professionally licensed engineers and allow for an independent expert panel to review costs over $5 million. Further guidance on the panel's composition and authority will be developed by FEMA. The law provides guidance on handling discrepancies between estimated grant amounts and actual project costs. If the grant is less than the actual cost, the applicant must cover the difference. If the grant exceeds the cost, FEMA can allow the extra funds for mitigation or future disaster relief. It is unclear what happens to unused excess funds. Unlike other cost-estimating procedures, there is no specified margin of error mentioned in the guidelines. The cost estimate for projects funded by FEMA may not have a margin of error, leading to potential disputes. Applicants may aim for higher estimates to use extra funds for other purposes. FEMA can allow excess funds for mitigation or future disaster relief. Applicants under the Stafford Act can opt for an \"in-lieu contribution\" from FEMA for Public Assistance projects. This grant can be used for repair, replacement, or mitigation measures. FEMA is required to reduce the assistance amount for public and private non-profit facilities by 10% and 25% respectively. The alternative procedures under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 eliminate the 10% reduction for public facilities and 25% reduction for private non-profit facilities in in-lieu contributions. FEMA may still add requirements for in-lieu contributions to be in the public welfare's interest. Additionally, the alternative procedures allow applicants to consolidate repair and reconstruction projects. The alternative procedures under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allow applicants to consolidate repair and reconstruction projects, potentially combining different types of facilities into a single project. The extent to which projects can be consolidated is not clearly defined. The new Section 428(e)(2) of the Stafford Act authorizes alternative procedures for debris removal assistance, similar to those in the PA Pilot Program. These procedures include providing grants based on fixed estimates and adjusting the federal share based on the speed of debris removal completion to incentivize quicker work. The new Section 428(e)(2) of the Stafford Act authorizes alternative procedures for debris removal assistance, providing financial incentives for faster work completion. This includes adjusting the federal share based on the speed of debris removal and allowing recycling of debris without reducing the award amount. FEMA also reimburses wages for employees involved in debris removal projects and implements similar policies permanently for all future disasters. During the PA Pilot Program, FEMA offered financial incentives for governments with pre-qualified debris removal contracts in place. They did not implement a sliding scale due to complexity concerns but saw positive results from recycling debris and reimbursement of wages policies. The audit confirmed positive results from financial incentives and wage reimbursement policies. The Inspector General will assess the effectiveness of alternative procedures for disaster assistance, with recommendations for future legislation. The report will not cover debris removal assistance procedures authorized by specific sections of the Stafford Act. The report on alternative procedures for disaster assistance under the Stafford Act will be issued in three to five years, providing Congress with direction on potential revisions to improve the PA program. FEMA can provide PA grants based on federal estimates of eligible costs, known as a \"simplified procedure,\" for projects under $67,500. Section 1107 of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 revises this by analyzing the possibility of raising the cap. The Administrator will analyze raising the ceiling on small projects based on various factors, with findings reported to Congress within a year of enactment. The President will then establish a new threshold adjusted annually by CPI and reviewed every three years. This could result in a new ceiling for simplified procedures being set within a year of enactment and every three years after. Section 1108(b) of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 revises Section 403 of the Stafford Act, authorizing the President and federal agencies to provide assistance for essential services like debris removal and temporary facilities. Federal agencies can also make contributions to state or local governments for such activities at a federal share of no less than 75%. FEMA refers to these activities as \"emergency work.\" FEMA regulations specify that only overtime wages of permanent employees are eligible for reimbursement for emergency work, not base pay or benefits. However, contract labor costs are fully reimbursable. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows reimbursement for base and overtime pay and benefits of permanent employees for emergency protective measures. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows FEMA to reimburse base and overtime pay and benefits for some permanent employees conducting emergency protective measures. This provision does not affect wages for private nonprofits and still allows reimbursement for overtime and hazardous duty pay for all state and local permanent employees. The Act also addresses reimbursement for wages for debris removal. State and local governments are encouraged not to use their own employees for emergency protective measures under pre-existing FEMA procedures. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows FEMA to reimburse base and overtime pay and benefits for some permanent employees conducting emergency protective measures. However, local governments are encouraged not to use their own employees for these measures, as contract work is fully eligible for reimbursement while base wages of government employees are not. The new law authorizing reimbursement of base pay and benefits would only apply to permanent employees who do not typically perform emergency protective measures. This may lead state and local governments to continue contracting for these services rather than using their own employees. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allows FEMA to reimburse base and overtime pay for permanent employees conducting emergency protective measures. The policy's implementation depends on FEMA's interpretation of which government employees typically conduct these measures and which do not. Activities for community recovery post-disaster may be subject to various laws protecting cultural, natural, or environmental resources. Section 1106 of the Act creates a new process to address potential delays in federal compliance with disaster recovery project requirements. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 amends the Stafford Act to expedite compliance with environmental review requirements for disaster recovery projects. It also accelerates the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program by implementing streamlined procedures to provide assistance more rapidly. Public officials have been concerned about the program's traditionally slower pace due to its processes and project types funded. The Stafford Act was amended in 2013 to speed up environmental review requirements for disaster recovery projects and accelerate the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. One streamlining procedure involves treating multiple structures as a group to remove vulnerable properties and prevent repeat federal expenditures. The new Section 404(d)(2) references FEMA's Prototype Programmatic Agreement to address cost-effectiveness and cost-share issues for HMGP projects. FEMA has submitted a draft \"Prototype\" to ACHP for an HMGP project but has not reached an agreement yet. The \"Prototype\" serves as a framework for historic preservation work but lacks cost-effectiveness considerations. Streamlined procedures now include analyzing environmental impacts and cost-share requirements for hazard mitigation measures. Adequate resources are emphasized, and FEMA has flexibility in Stafford Act administration. Accelerating these provisions may be challenging. The cost-effectiveness requirement for hazard mitigation measures under the Stafford Act may be challenging to accelerate due to the need for extensive research. The Act allows the President to contribute up to 75% of the cost-share, with the option to advance 25% of estimated costs upfront. This provision aims to speed up the mitigation process, although it may increase initial costs. The Administrator also has the authority to waive notice requirements. The provision in P.L. 113-2 allows the Administrator to waive notice and rulemaking procedures for states to administer the HMGP program. This authority was first established in the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, which also required the President to set criteria for state management. The current provision authorizes a pilot program for state management while criteria are being established. The Stafford Act outlines state criteria for managing the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) in Section 404(c), including the state's ability, mitigation plan, and commitment to mitigation. Regulations also require a state administrative plan for HMGP. Disputes over eligibility for reimbursement can be appealed to FEMA, with two tiers of appeal available. The appeals process for FEMA can be time-consuming and inconsistent in applying timelines. The DHS Inspector General found that FEMA does not consistently meet timeliness standards for appeals, with decisions taking an average of 7 months for first appeals and 10 additional months for second appeals. Some appeals have taken several years to resolve, with one example spanning about 20 months for a subgrantee. Some have suggested that arbitration or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) may be more efficient than the traditional appeals process for FEMA. Legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 have directed FEMA to establish arbitration panels and pilot programs for alternative dispute resolution. The FEMA has a pre-existing ADR program for resolving disputes, with a focus on arbitration by an independent review panel. Eligible disputes must involve assistance provided under specific sections of the Stafford Act, excluding Section 428. Projects approved under Section 428 of the Stafford Act may still be eligible for assistance under Sections 403, 406, or 407, making them eligible for the new ADR procedures. Disputes must involve at least $1,000,000 to qualify for the pilot program, with the threshold based on the \"amount in dispute.\" This is a higher threshold compared to previous arbitration panels for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita PA claims. The pilot program for alternative dispute resolution (ADR) under the Stafford Act has jurisdiction over disputes involving projects totaling more than $500,000. ADR is limited to situations with a non-federal cost share, excluding projects with 100% federal funding. Eligibility is restricted to projects with a decision on the first administrative appeal. Independent Review Panels (IRP) decisions are binding on both FEMA and the applicant. The Independent Review Panels (IRP) decisions are binding on both FEMA and the applicant. The Administrator designates a sponsor for the IRPs who must be unaffiliated with the dispute, but can be another federal agency, an administrative law judge, or a former federal employee. The size and composition of the panels is not fixed under Section 1105. When considering arbitration schemes, an important question is the level of review arbiters would undertake for disputed determinations by a federal agency. In a case involving Hurricanes Katrina and Rita PA claims, the arbitration panel rejected FEMA's argument for limited review and opted for a de novo review, not deferring to FEMA's initial findings. The arbitration panel in Bay St. Louis-Waveland School District rejected FEMA's argument for limited review and opted for a de novo review, not deferring to FEMA's initial findings. The panel created an independent record to resolve disputes related to a public assistance grant, affirming the need for de novo evaluations of witness credibility and feasibility determinations previously made by FEMA officials. The new pilot program for Independent Review Panels (IRPs) limits their review to the record at the time of FEMA's decision. FEMA's decision can only be overturned if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. IRPs can order claimants to pay FEMA's arbitration costs if the request for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is deemed frivolous. Amounts received by FEMA for arbitration costs are credited to the Disaster Relief Fund. The pilot program for Independent Review Panels (IRPs) must receive requests for review before December 31, 2015. The Comptroller General will submit a report analyzing the program's effectiveness, including data availability, impact on recovery process, costs, procedures, and recommendations for potential permanency. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 requires FEMA to provide recommendations to Congress for a national strategy to reduce future disaster costs and improve national resiliency. This strategy is similar to the National Planning Frameworks under PPD-8 and is due to Congress 180 days after enactment. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 requires FEMA to provide recommendations to Congress for a national strategy to reduce future disaster costs and improve national resiliency. The National Mitigation Framework may address national capabilities to reduce loss of life and property by lessening disaster impact and identifying roles and responsibilities for federal, state, and local governments and the private sector. The effective date of the act is presumed to be the day it was enacted, January 29, 2013, and the changes will apply to disasters declared on or after this date. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 aims to reduce disaster costs and improve national resiliency. Provisions of the act may apply to disasters declared before January 29, 2013, with specific language in sections 1102 and 1104 addressing applicability to prior disasters. Section 1102 outlines alternative procedures for public assistance projects, stating they apply to projects where construction has not yet begun. Section 1104 provides streamlined procedures for hazard mitigation. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 includes provisions for hazard mitigation assistance with streamlined procedures. Requests for assistance must be sent within 12 months of a disaster declaration, with possible extensions granted. The act's retroactive application is unclear due to the absence of clear legislative intent. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 includes provisions for hazard mitigation assistance with streamlined procedures. The retroactive application of the act is uncertain as courts disfavor retroactivity without clear legislative intent. However, retroactive application may be upheld if it does not impair existing rights or increase liability. Section 1103 of the act authorizes the Administrator to enter into lease arrangements. Section 1103 of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act authorizes the Administrator to enter into lease arrangements for temporary housing without impairing existing rights or increasing liability. The legislation may apply retroactively to claims arising from Hurricane Sandy or earlier disasters. Additionally, Section 1105 directs the Administrator to create an alternative dispute resolution program. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 includes provisions for arbitration, unified federal review for environmental requirements, adjusting project thresholds, offering additional assistance, and revising individual assistance factors. The act also allows tribes to request disaster declarations but does not apply to prior declared disasters. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 revised disaster assistance programs authorized by the Stafford Act, requiring FEMA to develop policies and regulations. Congress may oversee the implementation of these reforms to ensure alignment with future interests. FEMA has not released proposed rulemakings yet, but future rulemakings are anticipated. The Disaster Recovery Act of 2012, influenced by the Senate-passed Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, was eventually passed by the 113th Congress. A comparison of the legislation starting from the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 shows similarities and unique provisions in each bill. The unique provision of the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 is discussed in the full report, while an explanation of the unique provision of the Disaster Recovery Act of 2012 is provided at the end of the table. Section 609(l) of Senate-passed H.R. 1 (112 th Congress) would have required the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to submit a report on the impact of Hurricane Sandy on local and state budgets, especially the revenue streams of these governments. This provision was not included in the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. The shortage of local revenues has been a significant hurdle to long-term disaster recovery. The Task Force's report would evaluate hurdles to long-term disaster recovery, including loss in revenue and impact on budgets. It would assess FEMA's Community Disaster Loan program to address budgetary impacts by providing federal loans to local governments facing revenue loss after a disaster. The Task Force's report evaluates hurdles to long-term disaster recovery, including revenue loss and budget impact. It assesses FEMA's Community Disaster Loan program, providing federal loans to local governments facing revenue loss after a disaster. The program is funded through the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program account, with recommendations for legislative amendments."
