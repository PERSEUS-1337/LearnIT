Grant was a national hero, led the Union army to victory in the Civil War, served as the 18th President of the United States, protected the rights of freed slaves, and worked towards rebuilding the Nation and restoring unity among the American people. The Act aims to recognize and honor Ulysses S. Grant as a general and President, preserve Grant's Tomb National Monument, and educate future generations about his contributions to the United States. Redesignation of Grant's Tomb National Monument. The General Grant National Memorial in New York, NY is redesignated as Grant's Tomb National Monument. The monument includes the tomb of Ulysses S. Grant and the surrounding plaza area. The Secretary of the Interior will administer and maintain the monument in accordance with the law. The Secretary will design and construct a visitors center at Grant's Tomb National Monument to aid in interpretation and maintain historical significance. The center will be established in consultation with a study commission and designed to be consistent with the site's architectural and historical intent without detracting from its interpretation and scenic views. The Secretary will acquire non-Federal lands within the monument boundaries through donation, purchase, or exchange. They may also lease or enter into cooperative agreements for management. Additionally, a study commission will be established. The Secretary will establish a study commission of seven members, including representatives from the Grant Monument Association and the local community, with unique expertise. Members will serve without pay and designate a chair. The Secretary will provide administrative support upon request. The study commission will review security, maintenance, and interpretive programs at the monument. They will submit a report to the Secretary within 180 days with proposed measures for improvements based on original plans by architects John H. Duncan and John Russell Pope. The report will also include cost estimates for implementing these measures. The study commission will monitor repairs to the Tomb and submit progress reports to the Secretary and Congress as needed. The Secretary will review the report within 90 days and submit a final plan for completing projects at the monument by April 27, 1999, unless aspects are deemed unreasonable or compromise the site's historical integrity. The final plan for the monument must align with the study commission's report, maintaining historical and scenic integrity. Meetings of the commission are open to the public, allowing interested individuals to participate. The study commission will terminate within three years of establishment, following the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the study commission. The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, will provide three military guards to protect the monument 24/7 indefinitely. Appropriations are authorized as needed for this Act."
