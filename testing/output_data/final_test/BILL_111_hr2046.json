    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bottle Recycling Climate Protection Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to bottle recycling and climate protection. The Congress finds that recycling beverage containers can reduce energy consumption, municipal waste, and emissions. Millions of bottles and cans end up in landfills daily, with a significant amount of aluminum and plastic wasted each year. A national system for refunding beverage containers would incentivize individuals to clean up the environment and promote high levels of reuse and recycling. States with container deposit incentives and convenient redemption locations have significantly higher recycling rates compared to states without such programs. A national system for beverage container recycling, like bottle bills, can increase recycling rates significantly, benefiting industries reliant on recycled materials. States with container deposit systems have higher recycling rates compared to the national average. This aligns with the goals of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Subtitle K, Beverage Container Recycling, is added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act with new definitions outlined in Section 12001. The term 'beverage' refers to a liquid for human consumption, while a 'beverage container' is a sealed container holding up to one gallon of liquid. A 'beverage distributor' sells beverages to retailers, and a 'beverage manufacturer' sells beverages to distributors or retailers. The terms defined in the curr_chunk relate to the sale and distribution of beverages in containers. These terms include 'beverage retailer' for those selling to consumers, 'deposit initiator' for manufacturers or distributors, 'consumer' for those buying for personal use, and 'refund value' for the specified amount for container returns. The curr_chunk defines the recovery value for beverage containers, including those made of beverage container materials. The curr_chunk discusses the required labeling for beverage containers, stating that a 5 cent refund value must be clearly displayed. The Administrator will set standards for the label's size and location, with the 5 cent amount subject to adjustment. The distributor collects the refund value from retailers for beverage containers sold in interstate commerce. Retailers then collect the refund value from consumers. Only specified persons can collect a deposit on a beverage container. If a person returns an empty and unbroken beverage container to a retailer selling the same brand and size, the retailer must refund the deposit stated on the container, with exceptions for hazardous waste or excessive returns. If a person returns an empty beverage container to a retailer, the retailer must refund the deposit. If the retailer occupies a space greater than 5,000 square feet, they must refund for up to 1,800 containers per day. Distributors must pay at least 3 cents per container for refunds. This does not prevent people from returning containers to others. Agreements can be made between distributors, retailers, or others to establish beverage collection centers. Retailers can crush or bundle beverage containers. Opening a container as designed and compressing metal or plastic containers does not count as breaking if the refund value is still readable. Deposit initiators must provide annual reports on redemption rates. \"SEC. 12005. ACCOUNTING FOR UNCLAIMED REFUNDS AND STATE RECYCLING FUNDS.\" \"Unclaimed refunds from container sales must be paid to each State quarterly. The excess refunds can be used for greenhouse gas reduction programs. Any refunds exceeding the total container sales value will be credited against future payments by the deposit initiator.\" \"Excess refunds from container sales can be credited against future payments by the deposit initiator for a subsequent fiscal year quarter.\" SEC. 12006 prohibits retailers, distributors, or their agents from disposing of labeled beverage containers or any metal, glass, or plastic from such containers in landfills or solid waste facilities. SEC. 12007 provides exemptions for certain states. States that have implemented a beverage container deposit law or achieved high recycling rates are exempt from certain provisions of the subtitle. The law requires a 70 percent recovery rate within one year of enactment, with recertification every 3 years. If a State fails to maintain the recycling rate for 12 consecutive months, certain provisions will apply until a new determination is made. No tax on beverage container sales if tax is imposed on refund value. States can still regulate refund values on non-beverage containers and redemption centers. The Administrator must create regulations within 12 months of this subtitle's enactment, defining 'beverage retailer' and adjusting specified amounts for inflation every 10 years. Penalties can be increased after 5 years. The penalties for violating specific sections range from $1,000 to $10,000 per violation. The effective date for this subtitle is 2 years after enactment, except for certain sections. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling includes definitions, required labeling, refund value origination, return process, accounting for unclaimed refunds, disposal prohibitions, exempted States, regulations, and penalties. Effective date is 2 years after enactment, with penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 per violation."
