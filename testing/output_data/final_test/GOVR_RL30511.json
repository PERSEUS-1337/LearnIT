    "content": "Congress increased spending to $425 million for international family planning in FY2001, but funds were restricted until after February 15, 2001. President George W. Bush directed USAID to reinstate the Mexico City Policy, maintaining the funding level for population assistance. USAID released policy guidelines to implement the President's directive on February 15, 2001. The White House re-issued guidelines on March 28 to block an early congressional vote to overturn Mexico City restrictions. President Clinton signed a $14.9 billion Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2001 on November 6, 2000. The enacted legislation falls about $550 million below the President's requests but includes funding for top Administration priorities like international debt relief. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill provides funding for global health programs, including HIV/AIDS and malaria control. It is a key legislative vehicle for U.S. foreign assistance budget and influences foreign policy making. The bill funds bilateral development assistance programs managed by USAID and humanitarian aid activities. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill funds global health programs, bilateral development assistance, humanitarian aid, security assistance for Israel and Egypt, contributions to international organizations, and export promotion agencies. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill has significant importance in shaping U.S. foreign aid policy, as Congress has not passed a foreign aid authorization bill since 1985. This has led to appropriations committees expanding their role in guiding foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. The United States has adjusted aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the Cold War. Legislation has been used by Congress to impose restrictions on foreign assistance management, leading to clashes with the executive branch. President Clinton submitted the FY2001 budget proposal for Foreign Operations Appropriations, with hearings held by House and Senate subcommittees. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 2522 on May 9. The Senate delayed taking up S. 2522 due to disputes over scheduling and minority amendments. However, it was approved on June 22. The House approved its companion bill, H.R. 4811, on July 13. Congress approved the conference report for H.R. 4811 on October 25, and President Clinton signed it into law on November 6, 2000. The trend in Foreign Operations funding in recent years has seen demands for additional resources due to foreign policy contingencies and international disasters. Congress approved substantial amounts for FY1999 and FY2000 through emergency or supplemental appropriations. Foreign aid spending cuts were sharp in FY1996, undermining U.S. foreign policy interests. The State Department and other executive agencies campaigned to reverse budget reductions that undermined U.S. foreign policy interests. Funding levels increased in FY1998 to $13.15 billion, and further rose to $15.4 billion in FY1999 with additional appropriations for Central American hurricane relief and Kosovo emergency assistance. FY2000 saw a total of $16.5 billion in Foreign Operations funds, including late-year \"emergency\" add-ons. The FY2000 Foreign Operations budget saw a total of $16.5 billion in funds, the highest in six years. However, when adjusted for inflation, the spending levels were significantly lower compared to previous years. The spending represented 0.91% of the federal budget and 2.8% of total discretionary budget authority. The FY2000 Foreign Operations budget totaled $16.5 billion, the highest in six years but lower when adjusted for inflation. It represented 0.91% of the federal budget and 2.8% of discretionary budget authority. Appropriation Committees start markups after Congress adopts a budget resolution and funds are allocated. Foreign policy funds are distributed among 13 subcommittees, with Foreign Operations receiving 67-70% in most years. The FY2000 Foreign Operations budget totaled $16.5 billion, representing 0.91% of the federal budget and 2.8% of discretionary budget authority. Appropriation Committees allocate funds among 13 subcommittees, with Foreign Operations receiving 67-70% in most years. Decision-making on foreign policy funds allocation is reserved for the Appropriations Committees, with overall ceilings set in the budget resolution impacting budget limitations for the subcommittees. The FY2001 budget resolution indicated a reduced allocation for Foreign Operations subcommittees compared to the President's budget request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees released funding allocations for Foreign Operations programs, with the House allocating $13.28 billion, below the President's request. The Senate approved a slightly higher amount of $13.39 billion, still insufficient for FY2001 increases. The allocations were below the FY2000 levels, indicating a potential freeze compared to the previous year. Practices in recent years suggest that initial allocations may change for Foreign Operations and other spending bills. During appropriations debates, initial funding allocations for Foreign Operations and other spending bills can change significantly. In 1999, House and Senate Subcommittees received allocations of $12.6 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively. Despite initial bills around $13.3 billion, Congress agreed to $15.3 billion for Foreign Operations after a Presidential veto and pressure to raise foreign aid spending. Additional funds were designated as \"emergency\" appropriations, not counting against allocation limits. The Administration pushed for additional funding, resulting in a new Foreign Operations level of $14.9 billion approved by Congress for FY2001. President Clinton requested $15.1 billion for FY2001 Foreign Operations. The FY2001 budget recommendation was about $1.4 billion less than total FY2000 appropriations. Congressional Committees frequently compared the proposed budget with existing spending for FY2000. In FY2000, Congress approved a $1.8 billion aid package for Israel, Jordan, and Palestinians under emergency designation. An additional $1.1 billion was allocated for counternarcotics in Colombia. The FY2001 Foreign Operations request was 12% higher than FY2000 spending, totaling $13.5 billion. The FY2001 Foreign Operations budget faces a 0.22% cut due to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, resulting in a reduction of about $33 million from the $14.897 billion level. The President's budget plan raised funding levels for most Foreign Operations accounts. The FY2001 budget plan increased funding levels for various Foreign Operations accounts, with notable increases for the Export-Import Bank and USAID development assistance. The Eximbank saw a 26% funding increase, although it was projected to support a smaller level of U.S. exports. USAID's bilateral development aid grew by $350 million, primarily supporting family planning, HIV/AIDS funding, and democracy promotion initiatives. The FY2001 budget plan increased funding for family planning programs, HIV/AIDS funding, and democracy promotion by 45%, 39%, and 24% respectively. It also included funding for debt reduction for poor developing nations, with $262 million allocated for this purpose. Additionally, there was a $136 million increase in funding for nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining, and related programs. The FY2001 budget sought a $136 million increase for counterproliferation and anti-terrorism programs, including funding for a new anti-terrorism training facility. There was also a $20 million increase for heavy fuel oil payment to North Korea as part of the Korean Energy Development Organization. Additionally, voluntary contributions to international organizations were increased by $83 million. The FY2001 budget proposed increased funding for various international programs, including support for the U.N. Development Program, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, and the U.N. Population Fund. There was also a significant increase in U.S. commitments to multilateral development banks, with a focus on the Global Environment Facility. Congressional action on the Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY2001 included approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee and the full Senate. The full Senate and House approved various Foreign Operations programs, leading to the signing of legislation on November 6 - P.L. 106-429. Additionally, Congress passed an $11.2 billion FY2000 Supplemental on June 29. On November 6, P.L. 106-429 was signed into law, including an $11.2 billion FY2000 Supplemental with $1.094 billion for Foreign Operations. The funding supported a counternarcotics initiative in Colombia, economic aid to Kosovo, Croatia, and Montenegro, and southern Africa flood relief. Congress rejected a $210 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund but later approved it in October. The Senate approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, which was $110 million less than FY2000 enacted. This amount was $1.7 billion below the President's request. Various accounts, including USAID operating expenses and Former Soviet Union aid, were funded below the Administration's request and reduced from FY2000 levels. USAID may need to make choices on where to cut expenses. The Senate approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, $110 million less than FY2000 enacted and $1.7 billion below the President's request. Former Soviet Union aid declined by $65 million. Earmarks for Ukraine, Georgia, and Armenia were slightly higher than requested, potentially impacting aid to Russia. The Inter-American Foundation received no funding in FY2001, with authorization to abolish the Foundation. Last year, Congress authorized the President to terminate the Foundation but did not exercise this authority. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, $110 million less than FY2000 enacted and $1.7 billion below the President's request. The President did not exercise authority to terminate the Inter-American Foundation, which received no funding in FY2001. Peace Corps funding fell below requested levels, but an amendment provided additional funds to maintain levels similar to FY2000. Debt reduction resources for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative were significantly less than previous requests. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, $110 million less than FY2000 enacted and $1.7 billion below the President's request. This would delay final debt relief for Bolivia due to funding shortfalls in the HIPC Trust Fund. International narcotics control appropriations were below enacted and requested amounts, affecting anti-drug initiatives. Peacekeeping operations funds were also reduced, potentially jeopardizing Administration plans for various activities. The World Bank's IDA contribution would increase arrears owed by the U.S. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, with a reduction in funding for various organizations. S. 2522 increased funding in some areas, including the creation of a Global Health account to address global health issues. $691 million was appropriated, with earmarks for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $13.4 billion for Foreign Operations programs in FY2001, with earmarks for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and a U.S. contribution to the Global Fund for Children's Vaccines. S. 2522 earmarked $425 million for population assistance, higher than FY2000 spending but below the requested amount. The bill also replaced abortion-related restrictions with language allowing the White House to restore previous family planning policy. The House approved H.R. 4811 with $13.3 billion for development assistance, $200 million less than FY2000 Act. Many accounts were below the Administration request, including USAID development assistance and operating expenses. Former Soviet Union aid decreased by $95 million. The House panel allocated 12.5% of the account total for Armenia and Georgia, similar to the Senate earmarks. Ukraine did not receive earmarked funds, giving more flexibility to the State Department for country allocations. Foreign Military Financing was reduced by $242 million to $3.268 billion, part of offset packages for debt reduction and HIV/AIDS funding. The House measure also cut World Bank IDA contribution by $270 million. The House measure reduced proposed U.S. contributions to various multilateral organizations by $270 million. It included $1 billion for multilateral assistance, which is one-third less than requested and 25% below FY2000 amounts. The legislation prioritized child survival and infectious disease activities, approving $886 million for these efforts. Initially, H.R. 4811 provided $82.4 million for debt reduction, but an amendment increased this amount during floor debate. The House adopted an amendment raising the amount for Foreign Operations spending to $238 million, $24 million below the FY2001 request. Congress approved $14.9 billion for Foreign Operations spending in FY2001, including amounts requested for FY2000 supplementals. The total falls about $500 million below the Administration's request, representing a 3.5% decrease. The FY2001 Foreign Operations bill, P.L. 106-429, significantly increases funding to support top Administration priorities, including HIPC debt relief contributions. Key items include $435 million for HIPC debt relief, support for IMF gold revaluation, and increased funding for global health programs such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and GAVI. The Child Survival and Disease Program Fund is also funded at $963 million, nearly double the previous amount. The Child Survival and Disease Program Fund is funded at $963 million, nearly double the level of six years ago. Child survival programs are earmarked at $295 million, UNICEF at $110 million, and basic education at $103 million. USAID development assistance falls about $200 million below the President's request but $90 million higher than in FY2000. Family planning assistance is set at $425 million, the highest level since FY1995. President Bush applied abortion restrictions for foreign organizations to receive USAID grants. Population aid funds will fall as USAID operating expenses increase to $520 million. The Inter-American Foundation receives $12 million, Serbia aid is funded at up to $100 million with conditions, Peace Corps receives $265 million, and Foreign Military Financing is restored to $3.545 billion. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill includes funding for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as $31 million for southeast Europe. Multilateral Development Bank contributions increase significantly, but fall $200 million below the request. The World Bank IDA receives $775 million, $60 million less than proposed. The bill also includes policy provisions that often lead to foreign policy disagreements between Congress and the President. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill includes funding for various countries and multilateral development banks. Policy provisions in the bill often lead to disagreements between Congress and the President regarding foreign policy priorities and funding allocations. Key issues in the 2000 debate included conflicting priorities in development assistance, restrictions on family planning programs, aid allocations, and efforts to reduce debt burdens in developing countries. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a debate on the future of foreign aid in the United States, especially regarding economic aid programs. Critics question the need for a globally focused aid program and suggest a more targeted approach. The Clinton Administration supports an activist foreign aid policy to bolster U.S. foreign policy initiatives. USAID released a post-Cold War development aid policy focused on sustainable development and economic growth strategies. USAID's strategies focus on sustainable development through economic growth, population stabilization, environmental protection, democracy promotion, and human capacity development. However, funding reductions and shifting priorities have led to changes in resource allocation, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the integrated approach. Congress has also imposed limitations on development aid for population programs. Congress limited development aid for population programs in FY1996-FY2000 to two-thirds of the amount provided in FY1995. The State Department's Bureau of Global Affairs prioritized environment programs, resulting in sustainable development not declining as much as it could have. USAID's goals in millions of dollars are detailed in Table 4, including economic assistance across various Foreign Operations accounts. In FY2000, Congress approved a $5,517 million economic package for Jordan and the Palestinians, excluding special supplemental funds. There have been ongoing differences between Congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for child survival, basic education, and efforts against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. Despite overall cuts in development aid, Congress maintained or increased funding for children and disease programs compared to FY1995 levels. The President's FY2000 development aid request was reduced by $80 million, with specific funding targets set for child survival and infectious disease programs. In FY2000, Congress approved a $5,517 million economic package for Jordan and the Palestinians, excluding special supplemental funds. Despite overall cuts in development aid, lawmakers set funding targets for child survival and infectious disease activities $18 million higher than proposed. USAID reduced funding for economic growth programs by $49 million, environment projects by $37 million, and democracy promotion activities by $18 million below planned levels. Congressional proponents emphasize the importance of protecting children and combating infectious diseases for American national interests. USAID officials argue that child survival efforts go beyond just immunizations and health services, encompassing factors like stability, environmental protection, shelter, and economic policies. They believe that focusing on these areas can undermine other programs benefiting children. In FY2001, USAID's economic assistance request for its main objectives was reduced or maintained at FY2000 levels. In FY2001, USAID's economic assistance request for its main objectives was reduced or maintained at FY2000 levels. The $5.9 billion request included cuts to child survival and infectious disease programs, while holding steady for microenterprise and reducing funds for agriculture and food security. Significant increases were requested for sustainable activities and new initiatives, with a focus on combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, especially in Africa. In FY2001, the United States increased spending on AIDS education, prevention, and treatment in Africa, India, and other areas to $325 million, up $100 million from existing levels. HIV/AIDS funding from USAID development aid accounts grew by nearly $50 million, or 28% in FY2001. Congress prioritized AIDS funding, with one bill authorizing $300 million for HIV/AIDS programs. Population assistance saw the largest single funding increase for FY2001, rising by $169 million, or 45% from FY2000 amounts. The White House accepted new congressional restrictions on abortion and foreign family planning organizations implementing USAID population programs. Environmental funding would have grown significantly for biodiversity and a new clean energy initiative. USAID met the $100 million congressional target for biodiversity funding in FY2000, but the Administration sought a 27% increase for FY2001. The Administration sought a $26 million, or 27% increase for FY2001, including a new $30 million clean energy initiative. The Senate approved bill, S. 2522, set USAID economic assistance at $5.8 billion, about $100 million below the request. The sustainable development appropriation was nearly $230 million, or 12%, higher than FY2000 spending, with a new $691 million Global Health account created. The new account supported funding initiatives for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, polio, and maternal health. S. 2522 directed USAID to allocate $310 million for agriculture programs, higher than FY2000 amounts. Population assistance would also increase under S. 2522. The overall funding level for USAID sustainable development programs was protected and increased for Senate priorities, especially in the health area. The House measure approved $5.63 billion for USAID economic aid accounts, slightly below the requested amount. Sustainable development activities received $2.144 billion, $200 million less than requested. Child Survival/Disease account remained at $886 million. The House measure maintained the Child Survival/Disease account at $886 million, an increase of $159 million over the previous year. It included earmarks and directives to prioritize health and children programs, while also acknowledging the need for broader social and economic development. The Committee encouraged USAID to increase spending on economic growth, private sector programs, agriculture activities, and microenterprise programs. The House panel endorsed increased funding for agriculture and microenterprise programs, totaling $152 million. USAID may need to make reductions in non-health program areas due to the number of earmarks and priorities in children and health sectors. Enacted legislation raises USAID funding above previous levels approved by the House and Senate, with overall programs set at $5.835 billion, slightly lower than requested but higher than previous approvals. Sustainable development funds total $2.268 billion, over $100 million higher than earlier approvals. Congressional directives and earmarks will impact how USAID funding is allocated. Directives and earmarks will significantly alter how USAID distributes funding among core goals. Child survival, health, and basic education will receive higher amounts, while funding for private sector, environment, family planning, and democracy programs will fall below proposed levels. USAID decisions on FY2001 appropriations are ongoing, with tentative estimates provided in Table 5. Controversy surrounds international family planning priorities in U.S. development aid. The controversy surrounding international family planning restrictions in U.S. development aid has led to significant changes in funding allocation. The President sought a substantial increase in funding for USAID population programs in FY2001, while also proposing a U.S. contribution to the UNFPA. Lawmakers faced deadlock over abortion-related restrictions and U.S. population aid policy, leading to strict limitations on funding for USAID family planning programs. The appropriation cap for USAID family planning programs was limited to $385 million in FY1997-FY2000, which is two-thirds less than the amount provided in FY1995. The debate over international family planning policy and abortion restrictions has been ongoing for over 15 years in Congress. The controversy began nearly three decades ago with a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 prohibiting the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. The \"Mexico City\" policy, first announced in 1984, restricted funds for foreign NGOs involved in abortion-related activities. President Clinton reversed this policy in 1993, allowing funding for family planning organizations as long as no U.S. money was used for abortion work. Congress has been divided on this issue in recent years. In recent years, the House and Senate have disagreed on the Mexico City policy regarding U.S. aid funds for foreign organizations involved in abortion-related activities. The House supported reinstating the policy, while the Senate favored leaving decisions to the Administration. President Clinton vetoed bills with Mexico City restrictions in 1998. The Mexico City policy (H.R. 1757) was a point of contention between Congress and the White House during the FY2000 budget negotiations. Despite interim arrangements in previous years, the FY2000 debate saw a reduction in population assistance to $385 million and contentious discussions over international family planning and population aid issues. Congressional leaders linked approval of legislation authorizing nearly $1 billion of U.S. arrears to resolving these issues. The White House agreed to abortion restrictions in exchange for paying $1 billion in U.S. arrears to the United Nations. President Clinton reluctantly accepted the Mexico City conditions, which required organizations to certify they do not perform abortions or lobby for abortion law changes to receive USAID population aid grants in FY2000. The President could waive the certification requirement for up to $15 million in grants. In FY2000, President Clinton accepted abortion restrictions to receive $1 billion in U.S. arrears to the United Nations. He could waive the certification requirement for up to $15 million in grants, with $12.5 million of population aid funds transferred to child health programs. The restrictions expired on September 30, 2000, and the President exercised his waiver authority on November 30, 1999, reducing population aid funds to $372.5 million. USAID was instructed to minimize the impact on family planning programs. The certification requirement for organizations receiving FY2000 USAID population funds prohibits engaging in certain activities related to abortion in foreign countries. Failure to certify results in ineligibility for funding, with a loss of $12.5 million. Despite this requirement, the impact on USAID family planning programs has been minimal. Critics of the certification requirement for organizations receiving USAID population funds argue that it will increase costs and delay implementation of family planning projects due to additional paperwork. IPPF-London and the World Health Organization have refused to certify, leading to uncertainty about how the $15 million in grants will be allocated among the nine organizations that have not responded. Agency officials believe they will not exceed the $15 million cap. Opponents of the certification requirement for USAID population funds fear it will lead to increased costs, project delays, and cutbacks in services by family planning organizations. They argue that the new conditions will strain relations with foreign NGOs and infringe on their sovereignty. Supporters believe the requirement is necessary to prevent funds from being used to promote abortion. Opponents argue that despite permanent law bans on USAID funds for abortions, money is fungible, allowing organizations to divert funds for abortions or lobbying. President Clinton opposed extending abortion restrictions beyond September 30, 2000. Bills introduced in 2000 aimed to reverse Mexico City language by relaxing eligibility requirements for NGOs and subjecting foreign groups to the same restrictions as U.S. NGOs. The FY2000 funding bill imposed restrictions on U.S. contributions to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) due to concerns about coercive family planning practices in China. Congress reduced UNFPA contributions by the amount spent in China during the mid-1990s. UNFPA faced funding restrictions due to concerns about coercive family planning practices in China. After ending its China program in 1997, UNFPA resumed activities, leading to the withholding of $5 million in FY1998 and a total prohibition of $25 million in FY1999 as long as UNFPA remained active in China. Congress restored the $25 million earmark in FY2000 but required a deduction of $3.5 million for UNFPA's 2000 program in China. In Peru, reports emerged of national targets for tubal ligations and vasectomies, with allegations of health workers conditioning food and medical care on sterilizations. Peru's government may have conditioned food and medical care on sterilizations. USAID maintains a policy of voluntarism for family planning programs and opposes quota systems. Congress adopted amendments to ensure voluntary informed consent in population projects. The funding for family planning activities in FY2000 is about $482 million, higher than previous years but below the Administration's request of $541 million. Section 590 of S. 2522 removed restrictions on abortion conditions, aligning with previous Clinton Administration policy on foreign NGOs and multilateral organization eligibility for USAID population aid grants. The FY2000 funding for family planning activities is $482 million, below the Administration's request of $541 million. Section 590 of S. 2522 removed restrictions on abortion conditions for foreign NGOs and multilateral organizations eligible for USAID grants. H.R. 4811 did not change current law, allowing restrictions on abortion services to continue. The Foreign Operations panel rejected an amendment to remove abortion restrictions from the bill. H.R. 4811 provided $385 million for population assistance, below the President's request. The House measure required new investigations in response to coercive family planning practices in Peru. Foreign Operations met the Administration's requirement for removal of abortion-related restrictions. President Bush altered the Administration's requirement for removal of abortion-related restrictions by reinstating the Mexico City Policy through executive action. He stated that taxpayer funds should not be used for abortions and maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance. President Bush maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance to prevent abortion by providing quality family planning services. USAID issued policy language and contract clauses to implement the President's directive, similar to the 1980s and 1990s. The FY2001 appropriations for UNFPA included a $25 million earmark, with a reduction based on spending in China. Conferees did not address coercive practices in Peru. The allocation of U.S. assistance to different regions has fluctuated over the years. While the Middle East has consistently received the largest share, Asia and Latin America saw a decrease in their proportions. Africa's share has remained relatively stable. The focus on security assistance has reduced, disappointing those advocating for increased aid to the world's poorest region. The allocation of U.S. assistance shifted towards emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, representing over 16% of American bilateral assistance by the end of the decade. Some believed this shift swung too far, especially in Asia and Latin America. Recent Foreign Operations appropriation measures emphasized the need to maintain or increase assistance to Latin America, the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia. Some argued for more aid allocation to Africa to meet unmet needs and promote U.S.-African trade opportunities. Concerns were raised when bilateral funding for the Middle East exceeded 60%, with calls for limits and resources for new peace initiatives to come from existing programs or additional appropriations. Regional allocations of U.S. aid were a topic of debate in Congress. In FY1998, Congress legislated a cap on Foreign Operations resources for the Middle East, limiting aid to selected nations and programs to $5.4 billion. This cap was lowered to $5.3 billion in FY2000. Israel proposed a plan in January 1998 to reduce aid received from the U.S. over the next decade. Israel proposed a plan to gradually reduce economic aid from the United States over 10 to 12 years, with a $120 million annual decrease in economic aid and a $60 million increase in military assistance. This would result in a total savings of $600 million by 2009. Congress has supported this reduction in aid to Israel and Egypt since FY1999. The President's FY2001 Foreign Operations request aligned with these regional allocation views. The President proposed re-establishing a separate Foreign Operations account for African aid and increasing bilateral funding by 16% over FY2000 levels. The Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was created in the late 1980s to provide flexibility to USAID program managers and protect aid resources for Africa. Congress ended direct DFA appropriations in FY1996, funding Africa's assistance out of worldwide development aid. The Administration proposed a direct DFA appropriation account for FY2000 to increase Africa's assistance funding. Congress rejected the DFA recommendation but approved sufficient development funds, leading to an increase in Africa's aid from $703 million in FY1999 to an estimated $737 million in FY2000. The FY2001 request aimed to allocate $836 million to Africa, with a focus on HIV/AIDS initiative and other health activities. The Economic Support Fund for political and security purposes also saw a one-third increase in funding. The Economic Support Fund increased by one-third over FY2000, with a focus on democracy and economic growth initiatives for countries in transition. Military aid also saw growth, particularly for stabilizing regional security situations and promoting democratic transition within militaries, with Nigeria being the largest recipient of aid in Africa. Additionally, significant increases in assistance programs were proposed for the Asian region in the FY2001 foreign aid budget. The FY2001 foreign aid budget proposed significant increases in assistance programs throughout the Asian region, with a focus on economic growth programs for southeast Asia. Indonesia would be the largest recipient of U.S. economic assistance, followed by East Timor, India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. The proposed allocations for these countries were roughly 50% higher than those for FY2000. Aid allocations for Latin America increased in FY1999 and FY2000, with a focus on counternarcotics in Colombia. For FY2001, regular economic, anti-drug, and military assistance for Latin America would total $754 million, with counternarcotics aid accounting for 29% of total resources. The primary focus has been the $1.1 billion counternarcotics initiative for Colombia and other drug-producing nations in the region. The \"Plan Colombia\" initiative allocates $1.272 billion over two years, with a major component of $600 million aimed at extending anti-drug efforts in southern Colombia. This includes training new army counternarcotics battalions and purchasing helicopters. Congress approved a $1.3 billion supplemental for Colombia, with Peru and Bolivia also receiving aid in FY2001. In FY2001, Haiti and Guatemala received $51 million and $50 million in aid respectively. Colombia has become a major recipient of U.S. assistance, ranking fifth in FY1999 and third in FY2000. Middle East aid was slightly reduced for FY2001, with Israel receiving $2.82 billion and Egypt receiving $1.996 billion. In FY2001, Middle East aid levels were slightly reduced, with Israel receiving $2.82 billion and Egypt receiving $1.996 billion. Palestinian assistance increased to $100 million from $85 million in FY2000. Egypt requested to receive part of its military assistance early in the fiscal year. The Administration requested early disbursements for Egypt's military aid, but Congress could not accommodate the full amount. Instead, $25 million was added under the Wye River aid package, equivalent to the interest Egypt would have gained. For FY2001, a new mechanism was proposed where Egypt would receive military aid upfront and place it in an interest-bearing account. In FY2001, Egypt would place funds in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve, earning $25 to $30 million. The budget plan would not increase outlays over current projections. Russia's bilateral aid would decrease to $162 million, while Ukraine's assistance would rise to $171 million. Assistance to Armenia and Georgia would also be affected. In FY2001, U.S. foreign aid to Armenia and Georgia would be reduced to $75 million and $86 million, respectively. Russia's aid would decrease to $162 million, while Ukraine's assistance would increase to $171 million. Other former Soviet states, including Azerbaijan, would see increases in aid.

Providing debt relief to poor developing nations was a key foreign aid issue in 1999 and continued as a White House priority in 2000, with enhancements to the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative endorsed by G-7 leaders. In late 1999, Congress approved legislation for U.S. participation in HIPC debt relief, but issues regarding multilateral debts remained unresolved. The White House sought congressional approval in 2000 to address these matters. Over the past decade, the U.S. has canceled about $14.7 billion of foreign debt, with $10.1 billion related to key national interests. Eligible countries must demonstrate a strong commitment to economic stability for debt relief. The HIPC debt relief program requires eligible countries to show a strong commitment to economic policy reforms before receiving debt relief. Congress must appropriate funds in advance for debt cancellation, based on a complex formula considering factors like the loan's present value and likelihood of repayment. Introduced in 1996, HIPC provided relief from debts owed to international institutions like the World Bank and IMF. Multilateral organizations initially resisted debt cancellation, citing increased costs for raising new funds. Forty-one countries, mainly in Africa, are eligible for HIPC, with only those with \"unsustainable\" debt qualifying. Criticism arose in 1999 over HIPC's terms not being deep enough, with calls for more extensive debt cancellation and shorter qualification periods. Critics also found the debt criteria too high and disagreed with the economic reform requirements. Many critics opposed economic reform requirements for debt relief and advocated for unconditional debt reduction. Legislative initiatives in 1999 included bills like H.R. 1095, H.R. 772, H.R. 2232, and S. 1690 aimed at improving the quality of life for the very poor. However, the expansion of debt relief programs faced challenges due to the high costs associated with broadening and accelerating these policies. President Clinton increased debt relief from $120 million to nearly $1 billion over four years in 1999. Congress approved $123 million for bilateral debt cancellation but rejected $600 million for HIPC Trust Fund contributions. Congress authorized the use of a contingency fund for IMF debt relief but restricted the use of profits from a gold transaction for HIPC debt relief. In 2000, the Administration requested Congress to approve various debt relief measures, including a $210 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund, $225 million for bilateral and multilateral debt relief in FY2001, $37 million for tropical forestry debt relief, and a $375 million advance appropriation for FY2002/2003. They also sought authorization for the U.S. to participate in the HIPC Trust Fund and support the use of IMF gold transaction profits for debt relief. Administration officials were particularly concerned about the lack of a U.S. payment to the HIPC Trust Fund, which they believed was causing other creditor governments to withhold their pledges. Critics in Congress argued that multilateral institutions should suspend new lending to HIPC countries after receiving debt relief to prevent them from returning to severe debt. Lawmakers rejected the President's request for a $210 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund in the FY2000 supplemental appropriation. In response to the President's request for the HIPCTrust Fund, Congress rejected the appropriation in H.R. 4425. However, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee supported legislation (S. 2382) authorizing U.S. participation in the HIPC Trust Fund and approval of the IMF off-market gold sale mechanism. S. 2522 provided $75 million for debt reduction in FY2001, below the requested amount. H.R. 4811 allocated $238 million for debt reduction. H.R. 4811 allocated $238 million for debt reduction, with an amendment increasing the allocation by $155.6 million. The bill required the Administration to report to Congress before contributing to the HIPC Trust Fund. The House expressed support for economic reforms in Bolivia and Mozambique, expecting all debt reduction funds to go to these countries. The House bill allocated $448 million for debt reduction, with $13 million reserved for the Tropical Forestry initiative. $75 million will be used for bilateral debt relief, $360 million as a Trust Fund contribution. Countries benefiting from U.S. contributions must agree not to borrow at market rate terms for two years. The limitation on concessional financing was dropped, and consideration was given to expanding grant assistance to HIPC countries. New reporting requirements on implementation were included in the legislation. The legislation includes new reporting requirements for the HIPC initiative to allow closer monitoring by Congress. The Administration is seeking an additional $224 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund in the FY2002 Foreign Operations budget. Congress authorized $435 million of the $600 million Trust Fund pledge, with potential for additional authority in the 107th Congress.
