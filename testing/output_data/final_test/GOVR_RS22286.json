Initially funded through an emergency jobs bill, it was later authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Congress has reauthorized the program multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 1994. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program was established in 1983 and last reauthorized in 1994. Congress has continued to fund the program annually, with a budget of $151.5 million in FY2006. A National Board, consisting of representatives from charitable organizations, oversees the distribution of funds to local jurisdictions. The authorizing statute grants the National Board significant discretion and minimal requirements. The National Board for the Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program is required to be audited annually, release a report to Congress, disburse funds promptly, and establish written guidelines. These guidelines include identifying high-need local jurisdictions, determining funding amounts, eligible program costs, reporting requirements, and ensuring homeless individuals are part of local boards. Funds are distributed directly to eligible local jurisdictions, which then allocate them to service providers. Eligible jurisdictions must be cities of 50,000 or more or high-need counties. The National Board for the Emergency Food and Shelter program identifies high-need local jurisdictions based on unemployment and poverty rates. Funds are distributed based on the number of unemployed persons in each eligible jurisdiction. The National Board for the Emergency Food and Shelter program distributes funds based on unemployment and poverty rates in local jurisdictions. States have a set-aside process to allocate funds to areas that do not qualify for direct funding, allowing them to address specific needs like homelessness, economic changes, or poverty pockets. The Emergency Food and Shelter program helps areas facing economic changes like plant closings or communities with high unemployment or poverty. Each state has a set-aside committee to determine which local jurisdictions will receive funds, prioritizing those with the greatest need. In FY2006, $151.5 million was allocated to the program, with $138 million distributed based on unemployment and poverty measures, and $11.8 million as state set-aside funding. In FY2006, $150,040,072 was distributed to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and four territories as state set-aside funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter program. Only a small percentage of the funds are used for administrative expenses, with limits set by statute. Local boards decide which organizations receive funds within their jurisdiction. The Board directs the United Way to convene local boards in qualifying jurisdictions, comprised of representatives from charitable organizations. Local boards include a government representative as chairperson, and must have a member who is homeless or formerly homeless. They are encouraged to expand membership with representatives from minority populations, non-profits, or government organizations. Local boards distribute funds to local service providers for the Emergency Food and Shelter program. The Emergency Food and Shelter program allows nonprofits and government agencies to apply for funds. Local boards select grantees based on their ability to provide food or shelter assistance. Funds are distributed twice a year, with the second payment after clearing an audit. Local boards monitor grantees, establish appeals processes, and report to the National Board. Eligible expenses include groceries, shelter items, utility assistance, and rental/mortgage aid. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program provides assistance for hotel or motel lodging, rental or mortgage aid, and first month's rent. Local boards can request variances in budgets or waivers for program expenses like building maintenance or equipment purchases. If funds are not effectively used, local boards can reprocess and reallocate them among other organizations. The EFS program targets economic emergencies, not disaster-related ones, and was created in 1983 during a recession to address high unemployment. FEMA oversees the program. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program, overseen by FEMA, provides assistance for lodging, rental aid, and first month's rent during economic emergencies. EFS funds are not distributed for disaster-related purposes, but past precedent shows they can be used to help individuals affected by disasters, as seen after the Los Angeles riots in 1992. Local boards can request variances in budgets and waivers for program expenses. The Board appealed to Congress and the White House for additional funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program due to increasing need before and after riots. Congress did not provide the funds. The President's budget proposed moving the program to HUD, but the House and Senate Appropriations Committees decided to keep it within FEMA. Senator Byrd opposed the transfer in a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. The Senate Appropriations Committee praised the Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFS) for being well-managed by FEMA in hearings for FY2004 and FY2005. Despite the President's request to move the program to HUD, it remained under FEMA in the FY2006 budget."
