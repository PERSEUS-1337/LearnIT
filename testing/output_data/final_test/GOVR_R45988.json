The country's natural gas sector has seen significant growth due to market competition, technological innovation, and increased congressional interest. In 1998, the United States was the 2nd largest producer of natural gas behind Russia, with consumption exceeding production by 1,400 BCF. Natural gas made up 24% of the U.S. energy mix in 1998, with Canada supplying 97% of imports. Between 1998 and 2008, the U.S. had an average annual production-consumption gap of 1,764 BCF. By 2008, natural gas for electricity generation equaled industrial use, and prices quadrupled. The U.S. expanded LNG import capacity during this period. In 2008, the United States increased LNG import capacity to nearly 4,800 BCF, with an additional 2,000 BCF added later. Multiple import projects were planned but not built as the U.S. transitioned to becoming an exporter. Small and mid-size production companies began utilizing hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling to access natural gas trapped in shale formations, leading to fluctuating daily gas prices. The U.S. saw a rise in natural gas prices until the Great Recession reduced demand. Shale gas production increased, causing global prices to plummet. U.S. production and consumption of natural gas grew between 2008 and 2018, while prices fell by 65%. Despite this, production continued to increase annually, with the cost of producing shale gas decreasing due to industry innovation. In 2011, U.S. natural gas production surpassed consumption, leading to interest in exporting. Cheniere Energy was the first to apply for a permit to export LNG from the Sabine Pass facility. Liquefaction facilities like Sabine Pass cool natural gas to -260\" F, turning it into a liquid for economical global shipping. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest producer of natural gas by the end of 2009. Global production of natural gas rose 28% between 2008 and 2018, with U.S. production outpacing other producers. U.S. LNG export capacity increased, with Mexico importing two-thirds of U.S. pipeline exports and half of all U.S. gas exports in 2018. The United States is a major player in the global natural gas market, with significant LNG export capacity. Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Japan, China, and India, are the biggest consumers of U.S. LNG. However, China's imports of U.S. LNG declined in 2019 due to trade disputes. The U.S. is poised to become the world's largest LNG exporter in the next five years, with 36 countries importing U.S. LNG since 2016. Since 2016, 36 countries have imported U.S. LNG, with almost half going to countries with free trade agreements with the United States. South Korea and Mexico are the top importers. U.S. LNG exports have grown by 489% between 2016 and mid-2019, with May 2019 seeing the largest monthly exports. Despite this growth, U.S. natural gas prices have not risen significantly. The price differential between U.S. spot prices and LNG export prices has been around $1.74 since February 2016. Importers also consider the cost of liquefying natural gas. Natural gas is expensive to liquefy and transport, requiring sophisticated technology. Russia is the largest overall exporter of natural gas, mainly through pipeline exports to Europe. Qatar was the largest LNG exporter in 2018, but Australia is projected to surpass it in 2019. The United States, the largest producer of natural gas, has become a net exporter with diminishing imports. U.S. exports are expected to rise significantly, with LNG now accounting for 35% of global natural gas trade. In the 116th Congress, natural gas has become a significant topic of interest with 100 bills introduced covering various related topics such as production, exports, infrastructure, environment, and employment."
