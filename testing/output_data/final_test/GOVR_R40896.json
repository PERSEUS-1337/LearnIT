    "content": "The House passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, establishing a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Kerry introduced S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, which underwent hearings and markup in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Both House and Senate bills aim for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from major sectors. The House passed H.R. 2454, establishing a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Kerry introduced S. 1733, aiming for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from major sectors. Both bills aim to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. The bills grant the EPA authority to set greenhouse gas performance standards for some entities not covered by the cap-and-trade system. The Senate bill contains a more stringent cap-and-trade system compared to the House bill. The Senate and House bills differ in emissions caps, allowances, offsets, and exemptions under the Clean Air Act. The House bill includes provisions on regulating the carbon market and imposing a border measure on countries with inadequate carbon reduction policies. Both bills have placeholders awaiting action by Senate committees. The Senate and House bills have differences in emissions caps and allowances under the Clean Air Act. Between 2017 and 2029, S. 1733 has a stricter cap compared to H.R. 2454. Both bills allocate allowances or auction revenue to support various initiatives. The Senate and House bills differ in emissions caps and allowances under the Clean Air Act. Both bills allocate allowances or auction revenue to support various purposes, with a shift towards more auctions over time. Recipients of direct allocations include entities covered by the cap-and-trade program, such as petroleum refineries, and non-covered entities like states and electric and natural gas local distribution companies. Non-covered entities must use the value generated from the sale of allowances for specific purposes, such as mitigating energy cost impacts or investing in energy efficiency. The Senate and House bills differ in emissions caps and allowances under the Clean Air Act. Both bills allocate allowances or auction revenue to support various purposes, with a shift towards more auctions over time. In the Senate bill, a larger share of allowances is auctioned, with a portion used for deficit reduction. Initially, 10% of allowances are auctioned for deficit reduction, increasing to 25% in later years. In contrast, the House bill auctions roughly 16% of allowances in 2016, with revenues directed at assisting low-income consumers. By 2030, roughly 65% of allowances are auctioned under the House bill. By 2030, around 65% of allowances are auctioned under H.R. 2454 and roughly 75% under the Senate bill. A strategic reserve is set up to provide emergency allowances in volatile markets. The Senate bill allocates more allowances for deficit reduction and state programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assist mid-sized refiners, and train nuclear workers. Under H.R. 2454, a large portion of allowances, such as 17% of 2030 allowances, are auctioned in advance for deficit reduction or consumer rebates. The revenue from these auctions is generated in the year of auction but cannot be used until the \"vintage year\" or later. This forward shift in auction revenue may be challenging to predict due to the delayed use of allowances. The Senate bill also allocates allowances to states early but does not have a similar auctioning process. The House-passed legislation and the Senate bill differ in their approach to allowances and offsets. The House program has a set percentage of offsets tied to emissions caps, while the Senate bill's percentage is based on actual emissions and various factors. EPA estimates show that the House program would have percentages of 27% in 2016, 36% in 2030, and 66% in 2050, while the Senate bill would have percentages of 35% in 2016, 41% in 2030, and 48% in 2050. The House and Senate programs differ in their allowable proportions of domestic and international offsets. In the House program, 50% of allowable offset submissions could come from domestic projects and 50% from international sources. In the Senate, the ratio is 75% from domestic projects and 25% from international projects. Both bills allow EPA to increase the percentage of international offsets annually, with a limit of 1.25 billion tons in the Senate bill and up to 1.5 billion tons in the House bill. The House and Senate bills also authorize different agencies to implement their offset programs. The Senate bill delegates domestic program authority to the President and international program authority to EPA. The House bill creates two offset programs: domestic agriculture and forestry under the Department of Agriculture, and other domestic and international projects under EPA. Concerns include potential market abuse in a U.S. carbon market worth billions annually. H.R. 2454 includes oversight provisions by FERC and enhanced CFTC oversight. The Senate bill aims to enhance oversight of the cash allowance market and allowance derivatives by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It would require clearing of over-the-counter transactions through a clearing house and establish position limits on energy contracts. Concerns have been raised about potential job losses and compromised emission reduction benefits if firms shift investments and production to countries with less stringent carbon policies. The potential impact of carbon leakage on greenhouse gas reductions can be mitigated by allocating allowances to energy-intensive industries or implementing an international reserve allowance scheme. This scheme would require importers of energy-intensive products from countries with weak carbon policies to submit international reserve allowances. The international reserve allowance scheme proposes importers to submit IRAs based on greenhouse gas emissions per unit for products from countries with weak carbon policies. Implementation challenges and potential WTO implications remain unclear. The Senate bill includes a placeholder for this provision, pending action by other committees. The Clean Air Act provides existing authority to limit greenhouse gas emissions, as highlighted by the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA. EPA has initiated the process of regulating greenhouse gases, including issuing an endangerment finding in April 2009 and proposing regulations for new motor vehicles in September 2009. There are five main ways EPA could address greenhouse gases under the Act. The Clean Air Act provides authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. EPA has started regulating greenhouse gases, including issuing an endangerment finding and proposing regulations for new motor vehicles. There are five main ways EPA could regulate greenhouse gases under the Act, including through the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program and Title V permits for stationary sources. The bills aim to limit EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants or under international pollution provisions. The H.R. 2454 provision in the Clean Air Act would exempt new or modified stationary sources from the PSD program solely based on greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the Senate bill would raise the threshold for regulation under PSD to 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases. Similarly, the H.R. 2454 provision would exempt any source from obtaining a Title V permit solely based on greenhouse gas emissions, while the Senate bill exempts sources emitting under 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases."
