    "content": "The U.S. food supply is considered one of the safest in the world, but foodborne illnesses still affect millions of people annually. In 2006, an incident involving contaminated fresh spinach led to public concerns and prompted industry and government initiatives to prevent future contamination. In 2007, large recalls of meat and poultry products occurred due to E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, and other issues. The U.S. FDA announced a nationwide recall of peanut butter brands due to Salmonella contamination. Questions arise about the effectiveness of the current food safety system and whether federal food safety laws have kept pace with changes in the food industry. In early 2007, attention shifted to the safety of food imports when pet food ingredients from China sickened animals. FDA detained imports of certain types of farm-raised seafood from China due to unapproved drug residues. Lawmakers called for changes in the U.S. food safety system and funding increases to protect consumers. Congressional hearings in 2007 explored perceived gaps in federal safeguards. In 2007, federal safeguards and reports called for changes in the food safety system. Bills were introduced to focus on ensuring imported food safety and strengthening federal agencies. Some proposed a complete overhaul, combining food safety responsibilities under a new agency. The Government Accountability Office identified multiple agencies administering food safety laws. The FDA and FSIS oversee food safety laws in the US, with FSIS having a budget of $1 billion, mostly from appropriated funds. FDA's budget for human foods is less than $500 million. FDA ensures the safety of domestic and imported food products, except for most meat and poultry. FDA also shares responsibility for egg safety with FSIS. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of eggs and seafood products, as well as regulating food manufacturers' safety practices. FDA's food safety staff numbers approximately 1,900 in field offices throughout the United States. The FDA focuses on companies' self-interest in producing safe products, improving production practices, and conducting periodic inspections of food establishments. Unannounced compliance inspections occur roughly once every five years, with notifications from the industry or other sources prompting increased inspections. The FDA's headquarters oversee food safety activities, with the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition responsible for research, regulations, and surveillance programs. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine ensures the safety of animal drugs, feeds, and veterinary devices. They work with over 400 state agencies to set safety standards for food establishments and commodities. FDA contracts with states to use their food safety agency personnel for inspections and compliance evaluations. FSIS regulates the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of meat and poultry products for human consumption. FSIS inspects cattle, sheep, swine, goats, and equines before and after slaughter, and oversees their processing into food products. The Poultry Products Inspection Act requires FSIS to inspect domesticated birds before and after slaughter and during processing for human consumption. The FDA has jurisdiction over exotic and alternative meats not inspected by FSIS, while FSIS is responsible for the safety of liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. FSIS personnel inspect all meat and poultry animals at slaughter on a continuous basis, with roughly 8,000 staff, including about 1,000 veterinarians, in meat and poultry processing plants nationwide. At least one federal inspector is present during all hours of operation in slaughter plants. FSIS inspectors monitor meat and poultry processing plants daily to ensure adherence to sanitary standards, ingredient levels, and packaging. They conduct statistical sampling and testing of products to verify safety. FSIS also certifies foreign plants before they can export products to the U.S. Inspectors at U.S. ports of entry sample imported meats and poultry to ensure safety before entry. The FDA oversees the safety of poultry meat from various species before it enters the market. States have their own inspection programs for meat and poultry, with FSIS ensuring they meet federal standards. If a state program is discontinued or deemed inadequate, FSIS takes over inspection to maintain operation of state-supervised plants. Additionally, FSIS has cooperative agreements with some states for inspection. The CDC is responsible for monitoring and investigating foodborne diseases, working with other federal agencies and industry to develop control methods, and evaluating their effectiveness. In 1995, CDC launched \"FoodNet\" to improve data collection on foodborne illnesses. The CDC conducts surveys and research studies to determine the incidence and causes of foodborne illnesses. FoodNet data helps establish baseline data for measuring changes in food safety programs. The Public Health Service Act provides legislative authority for CDC's food safety activities, while the FDA is primarily responsible for seafood safety. The National Marine Fisheries Service offers a voluntary seafood inspection program focusing on marketing and quality attributes of U.S. fish and shellfish. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) focuses on marketing and quality attributes of U.S. fish and shellfish. NMFS has approximately 160 seafood safety and quality inspectors funded by user fees. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for ensuring chemicals used in food production do not endanger public health, including registering new pesticides, evaluating health and environmental data, and analyzing costs and benefits of pesticide use. EPA collaborates with regional offices, state regulators, and other federal agencies involved in food safety. The EPA collaborates with various agencies to inform them of regulatory actions related to food safety. The primary authorities for EPA's activities in this area are the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Other agencies involved in food safety include USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which protect plant and animal resources from pests and diseases. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) coordinates federal preparedness for terrorist attacks, disease outbreaks, and disasters affecting national agriculture and food infrastructure. Congressional oversight of the federal food safety system is complex due to multiple committees with jurisdiction, including those directing FDA activities. The roles regarding FDA oversight are managed by various congressional committees, while FSIS authorization falls under the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Funding decisions are made by the House and Senate appropriations subcommittees. FDA has been part of federal public health agencies since 1940. The Administration released two reports on food safety in 2007. The Action Plan for Import Safety and FDA's Food Protection Plan focus on assessing and prioritizing risks for consumer safety, including food imports. Recommendations include mandatory recall authority, electronic certification of imports, and new user fees for reinspections, requiring congressional authorization. More explicit authority for preventive measures is also recommended. The FDA is recommended to have more authority for preventive controls for high-risk foods and accreditation of third parties for inspections. HACCP is a system for analyzing and controlling hazards in food production. Currently, only a few FDA-regulated food products follow HACCP rules. Many changes will be implemented through administrative action or cooperation with foreign countries. The FDA is recommended to have more authority for preventive controls for high-risk foods and accreditation of third parties for inspections. Changes will be implemented through administrative action or cooperation with foreign countries and industry stakeholders. Some critics have cited shortcomings in the strategy, including the lack of specific funding requests and the plan not addressing food safety improvements on farms or at the retail level. Critics argue that U.S. food safety activities are dispersed among too many agencies, poorly coordinated, and rely too much on voluntary cooperation with industry. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has designated food safety oversight as a \"high risk\" federal program area due to a fragmented system resulting in inconsistent oversight and inefficient resource use. GAO recommends a fundamental reexamination of the system to ensure rapid detection and response to food contamination. The Senate-passed omnibus farm bill includes a provision for a Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission to recommend changes to modernize the food safety system and harmonize requirements across agencies. This initiative could potentially delay further action on companion bills in Congress. The Senate-passed omnibus farm bill includes a provision for a Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission to recommend changes to modernize the food safety system and harmonize requirements across agencies. This initiative could potentially delay further action on companion bills (H.R. 1148 / S. 654) to reorganize federal agencies responsible for food safety and overhaul the safeguards themselves. The companion bills aim to consolidate federal food safety responsibilities under a new Food Safety Administration (FSA) and authorize a new food safety system. The bills H.R. 1148 / S. 654 authorize a new food safety system based on a comprehensive analysis of food hazards. They require registration and regular inspections of establishments, process controls tied to science and health-based regulations, and inspection fundamentals and frequencies. Provisions include prohibited acts, authority to detain unsafe foods, whistleblower protection, certification system for imports, and a mandatory national tracing system for food and food animals. The bill H.R. 3624 proposes changes to the current food safety system administered by the FDA, including the establishment of a new \"National Food Safety Program\" based on a comprehensive analysis of food safety hazards. It would mandate process control regulations, quarterly inspections of processors and importers, and procedures for detaining adulterated products. The bill also includes tolerances for contaminants in food tied to health-based standards. The bill H.R. 3624 proposes changes to the current food safety system, including establishing a new \"National Food Safety Program\" with process control regulations and quarterly inspections. Critics argue that the primary issue is the lack of funding and staff to ensure a safe food supply. FSIS has faced staffing shortages due to factors like new technologies and insufficient funds for hiring inspectors during high demand periods. The FDA is facing a critical lack of resources that has weakened its scientific basis and ability to protect the food supply. This is due to increased demands on the agency from advances in science, complexity of new products, and globalization of industries it regulates, without a proportional increase in resources. The FDA is struggling to meet its regulatory responsibilities, as highlighted in a report by the FDA Science Board. The FDA's food safety centers, CFSAN and CVM, are struggling with crisis management, drawing resources away from developing the science base needed for innovation in the food industry. A low inspection rate hinders FDA's ability to monitor the increasing volume of domestic and imported products, leading to a 78 percent reduction in food inspections over the past 35 years due to decreased funding. The FDA's food safety budget has declined, leading to decreased staffing in programs like food safety. This comes at a time when the agency faces new challenges such as rising food imports. The Administration has proposed modest increases in funding to address these challenges by strengthening scientific programs and improving inspection resources. Some Members of Congress are skeptical about the effectiveness of these efforts. Some Members of Congress expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of proposed funding increases for food safety agencies like FSIS and FDA. These agencies receive funding mainly through appropriations and user fees, with requests for higher appropriations competing with other federal priorities. Efforts to increase funding for food safety agencies face challenges as requests for higher appropriations must compete with other federal priorities. Proposed user fees on the food industry to cover new activities are met with resistance from companies and consumer advocates. Pending food safety bills include user fees for certification of food imports and auditing of food testing laboratories. The Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 3161, S. 1859) faced delays in funding and is now operating under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764). The FDA foods program area received new budget authority of $509.9 million for FY2008, with $28 million allocated for a comprehensive overhaul of FDA's food safety operations. Additionally, nearly $327 million is directed towards food-related field activities. The FDA received new budget authority of $509.9 million for FY2008, with $28 million allocated for a comprehensive overhaul of food safety operations. $18.3 million is to be used for food-related field activities, including hiring additional inspectors with rapid response capabilities. FDA and USDA were directed to submit plans addressing weaknesses in food safety identified by the GAO. The FY2008 budget provides $930.1 million for FSIS, with an increase to hire more inspectors. Concerns about gaps in import safeguards have grown due to the rise in U.S. food imports. Total imports of agricultural and seafood products have doubled from $39 billion in FY1996 to $83.7 billion in FY2007. The Bush Administration's food safety and import safety strategies address the challenge of monitoring imported foods in a global marketplace. Recommendations include FDA's authority to require electronic import certificates for high-risk products. The increase in import volume and variety of products have strained FDA's monitoring capabilities. The FDA is considering implementing a new certification system for imported foods, similar to FSIS foreign equivalency determinations. This system would require government-to-government agreements and additional resources. It would also give FDA authority to block entry of foods from foreign firms that impede inspections. Congressional hearings in 2007 discussed the issue, with some proposing changes to the current system. Opponents argue that imported foods already meet safety standards and do not pose greater risks than domestically produced foods. Several food safety bills pending in late 2007 focus on the import issue, requiring certification from foreign countries to ensure safety standards are met. Several food safety bills pending in late 2007 focus on the import issue, requiring certification from foreign countries to ensure safety standards are met. H.R. 2997 proposes that food imports be certified by the government of their country of origin. Some bills suggest collecting user fees from importers to cover inspection costs, increasing physical inspections and testing, authorizing research into inspection technologies, and restricting imports to specific ports. H.R. 3610 includes a controversial provision to limit FDA-regulated food imports to ports with FDA laboratories. The FDA border inspectors currently cover 326 ports of entry, leading to workforce strain. H.R. 3610 proposes restricting FDA-regulated food imports to ports with FDA laboratories, which some argue would have negative economic consequences. Additionally, a provision in the Dingell bill suggests establishing a voluntary \"Safe and Secure Food Importation Program\" for expedited movement of products in exchange for following HHS food safety guidelines. The Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires an annual report to Congress on FDA-regulated food imports, inspection data, and enforcement actions. Currently, FDA lacks authority to order recalls of adulterated foods, leading to potential consumption of unsafe products. Defenders argue that existing authorities are sufficient to address food safety concerns. Some Members of Congress support legislation to strengthen notification and recall authorities for food safety. FSIS and FDA already have authority to detain and destroy unsafe products, but improved traceability capabilities are needed to quickly identify and prevent contaminated products from reaching consumers. The traceability issue is debated for food safety, agroterrorism protection, and verifying the origin of live animals and products. The FDA seeks mandatory recall authority for firms unwilling to recall products voluntarily. The Grocery Manufacturers Association supports this proposal. The FDA proposed mandatory recall authority, supported by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA). A USDA official stated that FSIS does not need similar authority for meat and poultry products, citing sufficient enforcement tools and the effectiveness of the current voluntary approach. P.L. 110-85 requires FDA to establish a \"Reportable Food Registry\" within one year, mandating detailed reporting of food adulteration cases. Additional provisions in the bill outline record-keeping requirements and collaboration between FDA and companies for recalls. The provision in Title VI of the bill requires FDA to collaborate with various entities to collect and share information on food recalls, with details posted on an accessible FDA website. Pending food safety bills in 2007 also address notification, recall, and traceability, with several bills proposing immediate notification requirements. Several pending food safety bills in 2007, such as S. 1292, S. 2081, and S. 2418, aim to improve food safety measures. These bills would require immediate notification to authorities if a food is believed to be in violation of the law and grant FDA and/or FSIS the power to mandate recalls if needed. Additionally, there are proposals to establish a national system for tracing food and food animals from origin to retail sale. One specific proposal suggests that manufacturers of various products, including foods, must obtain \"recall responsibility certificates\" from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to cover recall costs and liability claims for defects. Many states and small plants are pushing to overturn the ban on shipping state-inspected meat and poultry products across state lines, arguing that their programs are on par with the federal system. Opponents claim that state programs lack the same level of safety oversight as the federal or foreign systems, which undergo U.S. import reinspection at ports of entry. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2419 aim to allow interstate shipment of state-inspected meat and poultry products, replacing the current federal-state cooperative inspection program with new standards aligned with FSIS requirements. This would enable plants under federal inspection to apply for state inspection and continue interstate shipments. The Senate version of H.R. 2419 proposes a new program where state-inspected plants with 25 or fewer employees can opt into federally directed but state-operated inspection to ship interstate. This compromise aims to address food safety challenges linked to increased consumption of fresh produce like spinach and lettuce. The FDA is debating its authority to regulate farm safety in light of recent foodborne illnesses from contaminated spinach and lettuce. California producers have signed a marketing agreement to implement safety standards, with funding from assessments. The USDA is considering new rules for produce safety. The FDA is considering a marketing program for leafy green vegetables to reduce pathogenic contamination. Consumer advocates are concerned it may hinder FDA's regulatory efforts. Bills in Congress aim to improve fresh produce safety, with one comprehensive bill requiring FDA to establish good manufacturing practices. The FDA is considering a marketing program for leafy green vegetables to reduce pathogenic contamination. Consumer advocates are concerned it may hinder FDA's regulatory efforts. A comprehensive bill in Congress aims to improve fresh produce safety by requiring FDA to establish good manufacturing practices and agricultural practices for growers. This bill also includes provisions for research, public education on produce safety, and equivalency procedures for countries exporting produce to the United States. Additionally, there is a provision directing FDA to collaborate with states on programs to enhance food safety, including fresh and processed produce safety. Public health experts have raised concerns about increasing antibiotic resistance among sick patients. The curr_chunk discusses the issue of increasing antibiotic resistance among sick patients, with causes including overuse by medical professionals and nontherapeutic use in food animals. There is debate over restricting nontherapeutic antibiotic use in animals, with a major proposal in late 2007 (H.R. 962 / S. 549) addressing agricultural use of antibiotics. The bills H.R. 962 / S. 549 aim to define nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs and require FDA to withdraw approval within two years if harm to human health is not ruled out. Data collection and reporting requirements for drug manufacturers are also included. In the mid-1990s, U.S. farmers rapidly adopted biotechnologies like GE crops to lower costs and increase yields. Congress members support these technologies, but concerns exist about food safety and the adequacy of current regulations. The Senate-passed farm bill would delay FDA risk assessments and marketing of cloned animal products for further safety studies. The language in H.R. 2764 calls for the FDA to continue the voluntary moratorium on cloned animal products until more studies are completed. S. 414 / H.R. 992 would require labeling of products from cloned animals or their progeny. Another proposal, H.R. 1396 / S. 536, aims to prohibit the use of the \"organic\" label on food products from cloned livestock or their progeny. The proposal aims to prohibit the use of the \"organic\" label on food products from cloned livestock or their progeny."
