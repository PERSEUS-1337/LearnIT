    "content": "The \"Fair Pay Act of 1999\" is the short title of the Act. References in the Act are considered to be made to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Congress finds wage differentials by sex, race, and national origin depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also noted. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has contributed to maintaining a segregated workforce, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown wage differentials between white and non-white workers, with a significant portion being unexplained and potentially a result of discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court's decision in County of Washington v. Gunther extended this prohibition to jobs that do not constitute \"equal work\" as defined in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Further clarification of existing legislation is needed to effectively implement the Court's ruling. Artificial barriers to eliminating discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite legislation from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would have positive effects on the economy, reduce low wages for women and people of color, and promote stable families by ensuring fair pay for working family members. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits employers from discriminating based on sex, race, or national origin by paying different wages for equivalent jobs within the same establishment, except for cases allowed by seniority or merit systems. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issues guidelines for determining if a job is dominated by a specific sex, race, or national origin. Employers cannot reduce an employee's wage rate to comply with wage differential regulations. Labor organizations cannot cause employers to discriminate against employees. For administration and enforcement, withheld employee amounts are considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime. The definition of labor organization and equivalent jobs is provided in this subsection. The definition of labor organization and equivalent jobs is provided in this subsection. Section 13(a) (29 U.S.C. 213(a)) is amended by adding \"sections 6(d) and 6(h)\". SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended to include new paragraphs prohibiting discrimination against individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, assist, or participate in investigations related to section 6(h). It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about, disclose, compare, or discuss wages. The amended Section 15(a) prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about, disclose, compare, or discuss wages. SEC. 5. REMEDIES.\n\nSection 16 (29 U.S.C. 216) is amended to allow expert fees in actions for violation of section 6(h) and permits class actions. Subsection (b) is revised to include additional sections for violations. Section 11(c) is amended to require employers subject to section 6(h) to preserve records documenting wage rate calculations and report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as necessary for enforcement. Every employer subject to section 6(h) with 25 or more employees in the first or second year after the effective date, or 15 or more employees in subsequent years, must submit a report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disclosing wage rates by classification, position, or job title, including information on sex, race, and national origin. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires employers with 25 or more employees to submit reports disclosing wage rates by classification, position, or job title, including details on sex, race, and national origin. The Commission's regulations ensure confidentiality by not including individual employee names in the reports. Additionally, the Commission may publish relevant information and data as needed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can use information obtained for statistical and research purposes. They may compile and publish studies, analyses, reports, and surveys based on the data. Regulations allow for inspection and examination of reports by any person. Copies of reports can be furnished as per regulations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can issue rules and regulations for reporting requirements to prevent circumvention. They may simplify reports for employers to reduce burden. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will conduct studies and provide information on wage rate discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin to help implement section 6(h) provisions. This includes research, education, and technical assistance to correct wage disparities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will conduct studies, provide information on wage rate discrimination, and offer technical assistance to promote compliance with section 6(h) provisions. This includes publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and assisting interested parties in achieving and maintaining compliance.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will conduct studies, provide information on wage rate discrimination, and offer technical assistance to promote compliance with section 6(h) provisions. The biennial report to Congress will include a separate evaluation and appraisal regarding the implementation of section 6(h). SEC. 8. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The text discusses amendments to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 and the Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act regarding remedies for congressional and executive branch employees. The Executive Office Accountability Act (Public Law 104-331; 110 Stat. 4053) is amended to include subsections (a)(1), (d), and (h) of section 6. Section 413(b) of the same title is amended to allow remedies under section 16(f) of the Act. The amendments made by this Act will be effective one year after its enactment."
