    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pesticide Harmonization and Joint Labeling Act\". Definitions are provided in Section 2. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include definitions for \"harmonized country\" and \"interested party\". A harmonized country is one that has negotiated pesticide registration processes with the US, while an interested party can be an individual producer, group of producers, or a nonprofit agriculture organization. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act now includes definitions for \"joint label\" and \"joint registration\", which refer to labels and product registrations approved by both the US and a harmonized country. These terms ensure compatibility and allow for sale and distribution in both countries. Amendment to section 1(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to include new items related to section 2. SEC. 3. JOINT LABELING OF REGISTERED PESTICIDES. This section introduces terms like nitrogen stabilizer, maintenance applicator, service technician, minor use, antimicrobial pesticide, public health pesticide, vector, harmonized country, interested party, joint label, and joint registration. The curr_chunk introduces the concept of joint labeling of registered pesticides and defines the term 'affiliate' in the context of business entities. It outlines the criteria for a business entity to be considered an affiliate, including effective control through a partnership or common control by a third entity. The curr_chunk discusses joint labeling of pesticides with harmonized countries and outlines the process for effectiveness and petitioning the Administrator. The curr_chunk discusses the process for requiring joint labeling of agricultural pesticides in the United States and harmonized countries, with a determination by the Administrator within 120 days of receiving a petition from an interested party. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for joint labeling of agricultural pesticides in the United States and harmonized countries, including identical or substantially similar products, same registrant or affiliate, and sufficient interest from parties. Upon request, the registrant must provide necessary information to the Administrator. The registrant must submit necessary information to the Administrator for determining joint labeling of agricultural pesticides, including product label, formula, and any other relevant details. In response to a determination, the registrant can provide information to disprove it. The Administrator may share a confidential statement of formula with officials in a harmonized country for agricultural pesticides. Notification of joint label requirement is required after a determination is made. After determining the need for a joint label for an agricultural pesticide, the Administrator must notify the registrant to propose a joint label within 90 days. The Administrator will review the proposed joint label with the harmonized country and notify the registrant within 180 days of receipt. The Administrator must notify the registrant to propose a joint label for an agricultural pesticide within 90 days. The registrant will be notified of the approval of the joint label and must use it on all containers by a specified date. If revisions are necessary, the registrant must propose a revised joint label in accordance with Administrator guidance. After the Administrator approves the joint label for an agricultural pesticide, consumers in the United States can use the product registered in a harmonized country with the approved joint label, even if it has not been approved in the harmonized country. The Administrator may initiate suspension proceedings for an agricultural pesticide registration if the registrant fails to comply with joint label requirements. The Administrator may not charge fees for joint registration under this paragraph. The joint registration and labeling provisions may not be used to add new uses to an agricultural pesticide. Interested parties may petition the Administrator for cooperation and prioritization. Interested parties may petition the Administrator for joint registration of agricultural pesticides, either individually or in consultation with others in the harmonized country. Registrants applying for a joint label will receive priority consideration. No fees are charged for joint registration, and new uses cannot be added through this process. SEC. 4. JOINT REGISTRATION OF NEW PESTICIDES OR USES. Interested parties can petition for joint registration of pesticides. Registrants applying for joint label receive priority. No fees for joint registration, and new uses cannot be added. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include a provision for requesting comments on a joint label for pesticides from interested parties. After the comment period, the Administrator will determine if there is significant interest in a joint label for the pesticide. If so, the registrant must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction to register the pesticide. The Administrator may require a joint label for new pesticides or uses after determining significant interest, with the registrant providing sufficient information for the harmonized country to review the application. The Administrator may require a joint label for new pesticides or uses, with the registrant proposing a joint label to the Administrator and harmonized country within 90 days. A technical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may enter into a memorandum of understanding with harmonized countries for joint registration and labeling procedures under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. The memorandum shall address information sharing and protection of confidential business information."
