    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Holocaust Education Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Holocaust Education Assistance Act acknowledges the historical event of the Holocaust, with 6 million Jews and others murdered by Nazi Germany. Several states mandate or recommend teaching the Holocaust in educational curriculum, recognizing the need for appropriate teaching tools and training for educators. The Holocaust Education Assistance Act aims to educate Americans about the lessons of the Holocaust, combat Holocaust denial, and provide resources for accurate historical education programs. The Holocaust Education Assistance Act aims to develop curriculum guides and provide training for teachers to incorporate the study of the Holocaust into mainstream disciplines. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to educational organizations for Holocaust education programs. An educational organization receiving a grant for a Holocaust education program must use the funds solely for that purpose and comply with eligibility and fund supplementation requirements. The Secretary may impose additional terms and conditions for the use of grants awarded for the Holocaust education program. The Secretary will award grants based on competitive criteria and consult with Holocaust educators. Grant amounts will only be given to educational organizations that submit an application with required information. Additionally, the Secretary may impose terms and conditions for grant use. The Secretary will conduct annual reviews of educational organizations receiving grants to ensure compliance with the Act. Sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance. An annual report on Act activities will be submitted to Congress by February 1 each year. The Act defines \"educational organization\" as a tax-exempt entity operating for cultural, literary, or educational purposes. It also defines \"Holocaust education program\" as a program aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of the Holocaust through classes, seminars, or educational materials.
