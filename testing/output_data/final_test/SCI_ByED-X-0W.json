PIBs improve generalization in classification tasks and enhance neural network representations compared to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) principle. The Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework is introduced for stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to optimize compression and relevance of parameters in classification tasks. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive performance in various learning tasks, attributing the learning principle to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) principle. The Information Bottleneck (IB) framework is explored as an alternative to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) principle for learning Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from an information-theoretic perspective. IB aims to extract relevant information from input variables to target variables by constructing a compressed bottleneck variable while preserving relevant information. The optimal representation Z is determined by minimizing a Lagrangian with a positive Lagrangian multiplier \u03b2. The solution involves self-consistent equations that are highly non-linear and non-analytic for most practical cases. The IB framework assumes knowledge of the joint distribution p(X, Y) without specifying concrete models. The MLE principle aims to match the model distribution to the empirical data distribution without considering internal structures of the neural network. It may lead to poor generalization in test sets if there is redundant information in hidden layers. The principle maximizes the likelihood function of the model given the data, and is mathematically equivalent to the IB principle in certain cases. In this work, neural networks are viewed as encoders that modify data space sequentially. A new objective, Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB), considers compression and relevance of all layers in the network. The PIB method optimizes neural network parameters based on the IB principle for deep learning. The intractable generalized IB objective is approximated using variational methods and Monte Carlo estimation, with existing neural network architecture re-used as variational decoders for hidden layers. The Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) method optimizes neural network parameters based on the IB principle for deep learning. It shows better generalization and exploitation of the network's representation compared to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) principle. The IB framework provides a way to extract relevant information from one variable about another variable, with an exact solution represented by nonlinear equations. The IB problem can be efficiently solved when variables are discrete or mutually joint Gaussian with a bottleneck variable. The IB principle has been applied to DNNs, proposing to use mutual information of hidden layers with input and output layers to quantify performance. Analyzing these measures establishes an information-theoretic learning principle for DNNs, optimizing the network layerwise. However, practical challenges in estimating mutual information between variables transformed by network layers and data variables were not addressed. The recent work BID2 uses variational methods to approximate mutual information in neural networks, focusing on a single bottleneck variable. However, their approach treats the network as a whole rather than optimizing it layer-wise. They also impose a variational prior distribution in the code space, which may be too loose compared to the actual marginal distribution. Our work focuses on optimizing neural network architecture using the IB principle to better learn representation layers. We estimate mutual information using variational methods and exploit the network architecture as variational decoders. This section introduces an information-theoretic perspective and defines our PIB framework for neural networks. The text discusses the use of a neural network with a focus on binary bottlenecks for better representation learning. It introduces the concept of stochastic variables in hidden layers and the mapping between them via an encoder. The network architecture is optimized using the Information Bottleneck principle, with a specific focus on binary bottlenecks. The text focuses on binary bottlenecks in a neural network, where an encoder introduces a soft partitioning of the space X into a new space Z. The mutual information I(Z, X) quantifies the quality of the encoding, with a smaller value implying a more compressed representation Z in terms of X. The hidden layers of a multi-layered neural network act as a lossy representation of the data space, encoding the original data into intermediate code spaces. This process follows the data-processing inequality, where the neural network parameters consist of stochastic encoders. The neural network parameters consist of stochastic encoders that encode data into intermediate code spaces. The relevance decoders aim to compress irrelevant information and preserve relevant information. The PIB framework extends the IB framework to optimize all neural network parameters, defining a sequential series of encoders, compression, and relevance in a neural network. The Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework extends the existing Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by preserving hierarchical representations. PIB utilizes neural network parameters to define encoders and variational relevance decoders at each level, giving neural networks an information-theoretic interpretation. This approach enhances the representational power of more complex neural network models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet. The focus in this paper is on binary bottlenecks with defined encoders using the sigmoid function and weights. The Parametric Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework extends the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by preserving hierarchical representations. PIB utilizes neural network parameters to define encoders and variational relevance decoders at each level. The output distribution for classification is modeled with the softmax function. The relevance decoder is uniquely determined by the joint distribution and encoding function. Many stochastic neural networks have been proposed previously. Our framework for stochastic neural networks enables bottleneck sampling from data variables (X, Y) to estimate mutual information. It does not rely on a specific stochastic model and aims to compress intermediate spaces while preserving relevant information at all network layers. The framework for stochastic neural networks enables bottleneck sampling to estimate mutual information between layers, balancing compression and relevance. The learning objective for PIB includes a tradeoff controlled by Lagrangian multipliers, with the super level representing the entire neural network. Minimizing L P IB in DNNs involves tightening \"information knots\" at every layer level, aiming to decrease I(Z l , Z l\u22121 ) and increase I(Z l , Y ) simultaneously. This optimization is more challenging than L IB due to inter-dependent terms and high-dimensional bottleneck spaces, making L P IB intractable. Minimizing L P IB in DNNs involves tightening \"information knots\" at every layer level to decrease I(Z l , Z l\u22121 ) and increase I(Z l , Y ). The relevance encoders are intractable, so we approximate them using a variational decoder. This approximation allows for effective gradient-based training of PIBs. In PIBs, the variational relevance encoder is defined using the higher-level part of the network architecture at each layer. The variational conditional relevance (VCR) is denoted as H(Y |Z l ). The relevance terms in the objective are closely related to the concept of the MLE. The VCR at different levels of the network is related to the MLE principle. Proposition 3.1 states that the VCR at the super level equals the negative log-likelihood function. Proposition 3.2 shows that the VCR at the highest-level bottleneck variable is an upper bound on the NLL. The MLE principle aims to increase the VCR of the network as a whole, while the PIB objective considers the VCR at every level. The VCR for layer l is the NLL function of p(y|z,l). Increasing the Relevance parts of PIB is equivalent to performing MLE for every layer level. PIB framework encourages forwarding explicit information from all layer levels for better exploitation during learning. VCR for a multivariate y can be decomposed into the sum for each component of y. Compression terms in PIB involve computing mutual information between consecutive bottlenecks. The mutual information is decomposed into entropy and conditional entropy terms. The conditional entropy term can be rewritten as DISPLAYFORM1 where DISPLAYFORM2 and H(Z 1,i |Z 0 = z z z 0 ) = \u2212q log q \u2212 (1 \u2212 q) log(1 \u2212 q) where q = p(Z 1,i = 1|Z 0 = z z z 0 ). Empirical samples of z z z 1 generated by Monte Carlo sampling are used to estimate the entropy term H(Z 1 ) as DISPLAYFORM3 where z z z DISPLAYFORM4. The plug-in estimator for entropy is improved with a larger number of samples M, ensuring better accuracy with bias bound BID20 ) DISPLAYFORM5. An upper bound on the entropy is proposed to address numerical instability for large cardinality |Z 1 |. The authors propose an upper bound on entropy using Jensen's inequality to address numerical instability. The upper bound is estimated using Monte Carlo sampling for discrete-valued variables in PIBs. A gradient estimator inspired by BID21 is used for binary bottlenecks to reduce variance despite bias. The authors propose a gradient-based training algorithm for binary bottleneck components in PIBs. The algorithm decomposes the bottleneck into deterministic and noise terms, propagating gradients only through the deterministic term. This approach allows for estimating all information terms in PIB with a single forward pass. The algorithm uses Raiko estimator to update parameters with approximate gradients until convergence. The authors propose a gradient-based training algorithm for binary bottleneck components in PIBs, updating parameters with approximate gradients until convergence using the Raiko estimator. They compare PIBs with SFNNs and deterministic neural networks in image classification tasks on the MNIST dataset. The authors compared deterministic neural networks, PIBs, SFNNs, and other models in image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset. Different models were trained and tested with various prediction methods. The dataset consists of 60000 training and 10000 test examples of grayscale handwritten digit images. The best model configuration was chosen from a holdout set for hyperparameter tuning and retraining. The authors retrained models with the best hyperparameter configuration chosen from a holdout set. They used a fully-connected neural network with two hidden layers and 512 units per layer. The models were optimized with stochastic gradient descent and tested with stochastic prediction methods. The study retrained models with optimal hyperparameters using a fully-connected neural network. Results show that PIB and Model C perform similarly, outperforming other models. Empirical findings suggest deterministic PIB and SFNN versions yield slightly better results. Monte-Carlo averaging of PIB achieves good approximation around M = 30. The information plane visualizes the learning dynamic of each layer in a neural network by characterizing representations in terms of information with a concave curve. The goal is to push the representation closer to its optimal point on the curve. In an experiment with a neural network architecture for an odd-even decision problem in the MNIST dataset, mutual information was computed and plotted over training epochs for both PIB and SFNN. The goal is to encode more information into the hidden layers. The PIB and SFNN neural networks encode information differently, with PIB being more selective and quickly encoding relevant information, while SFNN matches the model distribution to the data distribution, potentially encoding irrelevant information. An empirical architecture analysis of PIB and SFNN is provided in Appendix II.B. In an experiment following BID21, PIB and SFNN neural networks were trained to predict lower MNIST digits using upper half inputs. PIB outperformed SFNN in modeling the output space, generating more recognizable samples with fewer epochs. The experiment compared PIB and SFNN neural networks in predicting lower MNIST digits using upper half inputs. PIB outperformed SFNN by generating more recognizable samples with fewer epochs. SFNN showed discontinuity and confusion in some digit predictions. The proposed information-theoretic learning framework aims to better exploit neural network representations without relying on extra models. The rightmost column averages bottlenecks from predictions, showing PIB and SFNN's ability to model structured output space. Limitation: fully-connected feed-forward architecture with binary hidden layers. Using generated samples to estimate mutual information suggests potential for larger neural network architectures. This work explores the expressive power of large neural networks from an information-theoretic perspective."
