    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"SBIR and STTR Foreign Patent Protection Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the significant role of small business concerns in exporting goods, the challenges they face in obtaining export financing, and the importance of protecting intellectual property in the global market. Small businesses participating in the SBIR and STTR programs may struggle with the high costs of filing for initial patent protection in foreign markets. The Small Business Administration should be authorized to provide grants to cover initial foreign patent application costs for SBIR and STTR awardees to overcome barriers in pursuing international markets and maximize federal investment. The program should eventually become self-funding. Establishment of grant pilot program. The Small Business Act is amended to establish a Foreign Patent Protection Grant Pilot Program, authorizing grants to assist SBIR and STTR awardees in seeking foreign patent protection. The number of grants will increase annually, starting with 100 awardees in fiscal year 2003 and reaching 400 awardees in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. The Foreign Patent Protection Grant Pilot Program authorizes grants to assist SBIR and STTR awardees in seeking foreign patent protection. Grants are used for initial foreign patent applications for technologies developed under the program. Factors considered include applicant size, financial need, potential foreign market, and filing time frames. Grant amounts vary. The SBIR and STTR Foreign Patent Protection Grant Fund is established with a maximum grant amount of $25,000 per awardee. The fund is administered by the Office of Technology and used solely for grants and administrative costs. Each grant recipient must pay a fee to the Administration based on export sales receipts or licensing fees from the product or technology subject to the foreign patent petition. The fee is paid in annual installments and is not required in years with no export sales. The grant recipient must pay a fee based on export sales receipts or licensing fees, with no fee required in years without sales. The fee amount is capped at either 3-5% of total sales receipts and fees, or 4 times the grant received. Administrative provisions must be implemented within 180 days of enactment. The Administrator will issue regulations and establish procedures for the grants authorized under this subsection. A report on grant recipients and foreign sales must be submitted to Congress by January 31, 2006. The SBIR or STTR program includes recommendations for adjustments in fees and percentages to reduce costs to the Administration. The Administrator may also provide recommendations on extending grant authorization and related legislation. Authorization of appropriations is available for the Fund. The Fund is authorized to receive appropriations totaling $2,500,000 for fiscal year 2003, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2005, and $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 and 2007."
