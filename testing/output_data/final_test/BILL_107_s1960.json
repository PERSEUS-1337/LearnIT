    "content": "The \"Biobased Energy Incentive Act of 2002\" is cited as the short title. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 is amended to include the production of biobased energy products. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as biobased energy product (biodiesel or ethanol fuel), biodiesel, eligible commodity (including various crops and cellulosic commodities), and eligible producer (a producer using eligible commodities to produce biobased energy products). The Secretary will establish a biobased energy incentive program to make payments to eligible producers who agree to increase the use of eligible commodities for biobased energy production. A new producer is defined as one who has not used eligible commodities for this purpose in the previous fiscal year. Eligible producers must enter into contracts with the Secretary to qualify for payments. The biobased energy incentive program will make payments to eligible producers who increase the use of eligible commodities for biobased energy production. Producers must enter into contracts with the Secretary and agree to quarterly increases in production to receive payments. The payment amount is determined by multiplying the payment quantity for the fiscal year. The payment quantity for eligible producers under the biobased energy incentive program is determined by the difference between the quantity of eligible commodities agreed to be used for biobased energy production and the quantity actually used in the preceding year. The payment quantity for new producers in the biobased energy incentive program is 25 percent of eligible commodities used for biobased energy production in the first fiscal year. The payment rate is determined by the Secretary to compensate for the local value of eligible commodities like corn. The payment rate for eligible producers in the biobased energy incentive program is determined by the Secretary based on the type of commodity used, with a higher rate for small-scale producers. If the allocated funds for a fiscal year are insufficient, proration may occur. If the allocated funds for a fiscal year under subsection (d)(2)(A) are insufficient, the Secretary will prorate the amount among eligible producers. Overpayments must be repaid with interest, and no producer can receive more than 7 percent of the total amount available. Recordkeeping and monitoring requirements must be met for eligibility. To be eligible for payment, producers must maintain records on biobased energy production for 3 years and comply with federal regulations on biodiesel and ethanol. The Secretary will establish a program to promote biobased energy products for gasoline and diesel consumers. The Secretary will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to promote biobased energy products for gasoline and diesel consumers, with specific fiscal year limitations."
