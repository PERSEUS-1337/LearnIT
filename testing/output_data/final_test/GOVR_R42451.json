    "content": "The decline in corporate tax revenue as a share of GDP has led to interest in taxing large pass-throughs as corporations. Despite the decrease in corporate tax revenue, payroll tax revenue has increased significantly, supporting overall federal tax revenue. Various reasons for the decline in corporate tax revenues have been identified, including a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate over time. The average effective corporate tax rate has decreased over time due to reductions in the statutory rate and changes in tax treatment. Corporate-sector profitability has fallen, leading to a shift in business activity to partnerships and S corporations, eroding the corporate tax base. In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of net business income, but by 2008, they only accounted for 27%. This trend is partly due to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86) increased the attractiveness of pass-through forms over the corporate form by lowering individual income tax rates. Legislative and regulatory changes in the 1990s further enhanced pass-throughs' appeal. Comparing large pass-throughs with corporations involves considering various measures of firm size, such as employment, profits, and assets. Different industries may require different size metrics. The analysis compares large S corporations and partnerships with large corporations based on business receipts. Data is limited to using two measures of firm size - receipt-based and asset-based. The $10 million to $50 million category includes firms that may not be considered large. Size thresholds may need refinement. The IRS has organized data into small and medium-sized business categories, with some larger pass-throughs included. Comparing businesses across size categories, there were more pass-throughs than corporations with receipts above $10 million. The term \"pass-through\" is not always synonymous with \"small business.\" Average receipts of medium to large businesses are highlighted in the data. The data shows that average receipts of medium to large pass-throughs are similar to similar sized corporations. However, there is a noticeable difference in the average receipts of the largest pass-throughs and corporations. The largest corporations have significantly higher average receipts compared to the largest S corporations and partnerships. The largest corporations are over five times larger than the average S corporation and more than twice as large as the average partnership. The concentration of receipts among large firms is higher in corporations compared to pass-through entities. The largest corporations generate 83% of corporate receipts, while the largest S corporations and partnerships generate 30% and 41% respectively. Including firms with receipts between $10 million and $50 million further increases the concentration of activity among large pass-throughs and corporations. This suggests that a small percentage of large pass-throughs and corporations could potentially contribute significantly to tax revenue. The comparison between large pass-through entities and large corporations extends to total assets. In 2008, there were more pass-throughs with assets above $50 million and $100 million compared to corporations of the same size. Despite the general association of pass-throughs with \"small business,\" the largest corporations are much larger than the largest pass-throughs in terms of average assets. The largest corporations have average assets of $3.5 billion, significantly larger than S corporations and partnerships. This difference may be due to corporations' access to larger capital markets. Assets are concentrated among a small number of firms, with 98% of corporate assets held by the largest 1.5% of firms. Large corporations hold 98% of corporate assets, with only 1.5% of firms considered large for tax purposes. Most pass-throughs and corporations are small, with over 95% generating less than $10 million in receipts. The differing tax treatment of smaller businesses raises efficiency and equity concerns. The tax treatment of smaller businesses raises efficiency and equity concerns, which may require comprehensive reform of business taxation. Estimates of pass-throughs that could be taxed as corporations are based on size measures like receipts and assets. Industry-specific estimates are provided, but data for partnerships based on asset size are not available. Table 3 shows estimated numbers of partnerships and S corporations subject to corporate tax based on receipts. Between 0.3% and 1.5% of pass-through entities could be subject to corporate tax if size is measured by receipts. This corresponds to 15,360 to 87,674 pass-throughs. S corporations are more likely to be affected than partnerships, with 0.3% to 1.9% of S corporations potentially subject to the tax compared to 0.2% to 1.1% of partnerships. An asset-based measure of size yields similar estimates. Using an asset-based measure of size results in more partnerships than S corporations being affected by the proposed policy change. Between 0.6% and 1.8% of partnerships could potentially be subject to the corporate tax, compared with 0.08% to 0.4% of S corporations. The estimates suggest that only a small fraction of pass-throughs could be affected, but the largest pass-throughs hold a disproportionate share of assets and receipts. The proposed corporate tax policy change would impact a small number of large firms with significant assets and receipts. Manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade industries would have the highest percentage of firms subject to the tax among S corporations. The corporate tax policy change would affect a small number of large firms in various industries. Manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade would have the highest percentage of firms subject to the tax among S corporations. Mining, transportation, and construction would also be impacted, with utilities and manufacturing being most affected among partnerships. The corporate tax policy change would affect a small number of large firms in various industries, with manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade being the most affected among S corporations. Holding companies would be the most affected, with 5.1% to 9.6% of S corporation holding companies potentially subject to the tax. Manufacturing ranks second, with 0.3% to 1.5% of S corporations in the industry potentially affected. The size threshold affects the number of potentially affected firms across industries, with holding companies being the most affected. The measure of size used impacts which industries are most affected, with manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade being highly impacted. Congress will need to consider various policy choices if it decides to tax large pass-throughs as corporations. This includes determining the size threshold that would trigger the corporate tax, with options such as asset-based, receipt-based, profit-based, employment-based, composite, or industry-specific measures. An asset-based measure for taxing large pass-throughs as corporations offers stability over the business cycle and reduces uncertainty in tax liabilities. It may also deter manipulation of assets to avoid taxes, although firms with intangible assets could still strategically shift assets to avoid corporate taxes. Certain industries, like pharmaceuticals and electronics, may engage in asset-based measures of size. However, this may not accurately reflect the economic size of businesses in all industries. Some industries, like manufacturing and mining, naturally have more assets than service-oriented industries like healthcare and education. Using a composite measure of size based on assets, employment, and revenue could provide a more comprehensive view. The Obama Administration is considering defining a large pass-through as one earning $50 million or more in receipts. They may also use an industry-specific threshold for imposing a financial crisis responsibility fee on large financial institutions, with a set threshold of $50 billion based on assets. Congress could address the issue of identifying large financial institutions by employing industry-specific size thresholds, directing the IRS to develop appropriate thresholds, or relying on methods similar to those used by the Small Business Administration. Alternatively, Congress could legislate the size measures and thresholds for pass-throughs subject to corporate tax, or exempt pass-throughs in certain industries. Economic theory generally calls for uniform tax treatment across industries, but differential tax treatment may be justified for industries with unique societal impacts. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits and costs that industries impose on society, suggesting a uniform income tax with targeted policy tools for spillovers. It also mentions broadening the corporate tax base to potentially reduce tax rates. The analysis does not provide insight into defining large firms for taxation. The analysis in this report provides estimates of the number of firms subject to corporate tax based on size thresholds. Using aggregate and industry-level tax data, it found that 0.3% to 1.5% of S corporations and partnerships could be taxed as corporations depending on size definitions. Asset-based measures yield similar estimates, with 0.3% to 1.0% of pass-throughs potentially subject to corporate tax. The report analyzed the potential impact of changing the tax treatment of pass-throughs based on size thresholds for corporate tax purposes. It found that a small percentage of pass-throughs could be considered large firms, but they contribute significantly to economic activity, suggesting that the proposed policy change could generate substantial revenue. The report also highlighted that individuals would ultimately bear the burden of the corporate tax on pass-throughs, as businesses are legal entities. The report suggests that higher-income taxpayers would bear most of the burden from increased pass-through taxes, as businesses are legal entities. Industry-Level Estimates are provided in Appendices A and B based on different measures of size."
