Regulations under repealed laws remain in effect until new regulations are issued by the Secretary. TITLE IV--FEDERAL COORDINATION\n\nSEC. 401. DEFINITIONS. In this title, \"Action Plan\" refers to the National Invasive Species Action Plan submitted to Congress. \"Alien species\" are non-native species in an ecosystem. \"Control\" includes managing invasive species populations, preventing their spread, and restoring native species and habitats. The Invasive Species Council, defined as the Council established by section 402, aims to protect native species and habitats from invasive species. An ecosystem is defined as a community of organisms and their environment. A Federal agency, as defined in section 551 of title 5, excludes independent establishments. Introduction refers to the intentional or unintentional introduction of a species into an ecosystem due to human activity. An invasive species is defined as an alien species introduced into an ecosystem causing harm, while a native species historically or currently occurs in the ecosystem. A species is a group of organisms with physical and genetic similarity, interbreeding among themselves, and showing differences from allied groups. A stakeholder in invasive species includes government agencies, academic institutions, the scientific community, and environmental organizations. SEC. 402. INVASIVE SPECIES COUNCIL. The Invasive Species Council is established with members including various Secretaries and government officials, with the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and Secretary of Commerce serving as cochairpersons.

The Invasive Species Council, led by key government officials, provides national leadership on invasive species. It works with organizations like the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force and the Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds to encourage planning and action at various levels to achieve the goals of the Action Plan. The Invasive Species Council works with key government officials and organizations to address invasive species. It develops recommendations for international cooperation, provides guidance to Federal agencies on prevention and control of invasive species, and facilitates the establishment of a coordinated network to monitor impacts. The Invasive Species Council utilizes the Internet to facilitate access to information on invasive species, including distribution, impacts, management techniques, laws, and programs.

Public input and coordination with State plans are required in the development process. The first Action Plan submitted under subsection (a) must review existing and prospective approaches for preventing the introduction and spread of invasive species, identify pathways for introduction, recommend measures to minimize risk, and provide for research needs. The Council shall provide a science-based process to evaluate risks associated with invasive species and a coordinated risk-based process to identify pathways for their introduction. If any recommended measure is not authorized by law, legislative proposals will be developed. Biennial updates of the Action Plan will be submitted to Congress, along with evaluations of success.
