The Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin has emerged as a significant tight oil resource play. The Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin, spanning parts of North Dakota, Montana, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, is a vast oil source estimated to hold 10 billion barrels of oil. Technological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made it economically viable for development, increasing production rates. However, environmental concerns surrounding hydraulic fracturing are similar to those of shale gas development. The Bakken Formation in the Williston Basin is estimated to hold 10 billion barrels of oil. The U.S. Geological Survey's mean estimate for the Bakken is 3.65 billion bbls of undiscovered oil, 1.85 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas, and 148 million bbls of undiscovered natural gas liquids recoverable under current technology. The USGS will reassess the resources in the Bakken by the end of 2013. The Bakken Formation in North Dakota holds between 200 to 300 billion barrels of original oil in place (OOIP) with varying estimates of recovery. The pace of oil production in North Dakota has made it a significant new domestic energy resource, producing 575 thousand barrels per day in March 2012. The success of the Bakken development has led to exploration of other tight oil formations like the Eagle Ford Formation in Texas and the Niobrara Formation in Wyoming. The Bakken Formation in North Dakota has contributed to increasing U.S. oil production, reversing a previous decline. It is part of a series of tight oil fields that could add up to 4 million barrels per day of new oil production. The Bakken Formation produces both oil and natural gas, but its potential for oil production has raised its profile. Since 2006, the Bakken Formation has seen increased production due to improved prices and technology. In March 2012, production reached over 510 kb/d, marking a significant milestone. While tight oil production won't make the U.S. a net oil exporter, it will help offset imports, improve the trade balance, and enhance energy security. High oil prices have driven interest in developing tight oil, leading to a shift from gas-rich areas to oil and gas liquids deposits. Oil is significantly more expensive than natural gas in the U.S., prompting producers to apply lessons learned in shale development. Transportation constraints are limiting oil and natural gas production in the Bakken as pipelines are at full capacity. The sector is relying on rail and trucking to bring additional production to market. Bakken production has increased by 1,100% between 2008 and 2012, with expectations of nearly tripling by 2015, exacerbating transportation infrastructure challenges. Bakken production has surged, reaching over 510 kb/d by March, accounting for almost 8% of U.S. total oil production. The number of rigs operating in North Dakota and Montana has significantly increased, with no rigs dedicated to natural gas production. The high oil prices have driven companies to explore new sources like the Bakken Formation. The Bakken Formation has become a significant source of oil production, with a breakeven price of $60 per barrel. Despite its high quality, Bakken oil trades at a lower price due to transportation costs. Pipeline capacity constraints have led to reliance on rail and truck transportation, impacting production and costs. Oil producers are using rail and truck transportation to move Bakken oil production to market, which is more costly than pipelines and hinders future development. A bottleneck at Cushing, OK, affects Bakken oil and other crude oil shipments to Gulf Coast refineries. Projects are underway to address the bottleneck, but competition for pipeline space from Canadian oil sands is a challenge. New pipeline and rail projects are proposed to accommodate growing Bakken output and price discounts. TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline project, initially denied in 2012, has been reconfigured into two parts - the Bakken Marketlink segment from Alberta to Nebraska, and the Gulf Coast Project from Oklahoma to Texas. TransCanada has expanded its connection between Steele City and Cushing to accommodate Bakken oil producers, although not at the full capacity initially offered. This has justified the Bakken Marketlink Project, a pipeline running from Baker. The Bakken Marketlink Project is a pipeline running from Baker, Montana to the Keystone XL pipeline, with a capacity of 100 kb/d and estimated cost of $140 million. It could start operating in 2015 pending regulatory approvals. The project would improve economics for Keystone XL, raising committed capacity to near 90%. Other companies, like Enbridge, are also adding pipeline capacity in the same time frame. Enbridge is building a 145 kb/d pipeline in the same time frame. Sufficient pipeline capacity has been slow to emerge in the region due to smaller players in the Bakken. The Mandan Refinery in North Dakota has a capacity of 58 kb/d and will be expanded by 10 kb/d by 2012. Montana has four refineries with a total capacity of 183 kb/d but would require more pipeline capacity. South Dakota has plans to develop a refinery. Refining is not seen as the primary constraint to tight oil. Plans are in place to develop a refinery in South Dakota. While refining capacity is not the main constraint to tight oil development, more pipelines would be needed to transport the products. In addition to oil, some natural gas is also present in the Bakken region, with total production from Montana and North Dakota being less than 1% of the U.S. natural gas production. However, the lack of natural gas infrastructure means that some gas is vented or flared instead of being transported to market. Other states with increased tight oil production have also seen a rise in flared natural gas. In North Dakota, a significant amount of natural gas is vented or flared due to insufficient infrastructure for processing. This results in waste of a valuable energy resource and poses environmental concerns due to methane emissions. Flaring is preferred over venting, but both methods contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Increased natural gas production will lead to more flaring, despite efforts to reduce percentages. The Bakken formation in North Dakota relies on directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing to extract oil from unconventional resources, requiring a significant amount of water. The extensive development of the Bakken is projected to involve drilling 28,000 new oil wells in the next 15 to 25 years, necessitating over 20 million gallons of water per day. The Bakken formation in North Dakota, along with tight oil formations in the Williston Basin, is expected to increase demands on regional water resources for oil production. Water quality issues have emerged with unconventional oil and gas development, including managing large volumes of wastewater. The geology in the Bakken allows for disposal of produced water through deep well injection, unlike some shale regions where treatment challenges and surface water quality concerns arise. The Bakken tight oil development in North Dakota requires more wastewater injection wells due to highly saline produced water. Concerns about hydraulic fracturing contaminating drinking water supplies have prompted studies by Congress and the EPA, with initial research results expected in late 2012 and a final report in 2014. Over 3,600 Bakken tight oil wells were developed in an 11-county area of North Dakota between 2008 and 2011, with thousands more anticipated in the next two decades. The Bakken Formation in North Dakota requires large amounts of water for hydraulic fracturing operations, with each well typically needing between 0.8 million and 4.0 million gallons. Good quality water is preferred to maintain the effectiveness of the fracturing fluid, and consistent water characteristics improve the consistency of fracturing operations. This concentrated development is raising concerns about depleting local water resources relied upon for irrigation, drinking water, and other uses. The oil and natural gas industry's water demand in western North Dakota was estimated to reach 22 million gallons per day in 2011, with water use concentrated in the early stages of well development. Refracturing after several years may require additional water. Reuse of flowback water from hydraulic fracturing could help extend water supplies and reduce the volume of produced water needing treatment and disposal. The Bakken play in North Dakota disposes of produced water through deep well injection without treatment or reuse. Groundwater and surface water sources are used for developing Bakken tight oil wells, leading to a decline in the region's aquifers. Concerns about depleting limited groundwater supplies are highlighted in a 2010 report by the North Dakota government. The North Dakota State Water Commission has determined that current water availability will not meet the water requirements for energy industries, particularly oil production from the Bakken Formation. Efforts are being made to address water supply constraints for energy, municipal, and agricultural users, including the Western Area Water Supply project. Stakeholders are advocating for direct access to water from Lake Sakakawea for the energy industry. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will process applications for temporary water withdrawals from Lake Sakakawea behind Garrison Dam. Initially, there will be no charge for the contracts as pricing policy is being established. This follows a controversial draft report proposing fees for water storage space, reigniting a dispute with North Dakota interests. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is processing applications for temporary water withdrawals from Lake Sakakawea behind Garrison Dam. North Dakota interests are in disagreement with the Corps over access to Missouri River water, arguing against fees for water that would be freely available. The fee controversy is expected to continue as rulemaking progresses. Additionally, efforts are being made to reduce the amount of freshwater needed by the energy industry, with only a small percentage of injected fracturing fluid being returned to the surface. In the Bakken region, water produced by oil wells is highly saline and costly to treat for reuse. Research suggests treating moderately saline groundwater as a cost-effective alternative. Protecting groundwater quality is crucial in this region where aquifers are a primary water source for various needs. Montana and North Dakota have usable shallow glacial aquifers. The Bakken region in Montana and North Dakota has shallow glacial aquifers and the Fox Hills Sandstone formation as potable aquifers. Concerns have arisen about the impact of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality as oil production increases. As tight oil production increases, there are concerns about hydraulic fracturing introducing contaminants into aquifers. Regulators note that shale formations in North Dakota are deep below freshwater aquifers, reducing the risk of contamination. Reports of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing are often linked to poorly constructed wells rather than fractures reaching aquifers. The development of oil and gas resources in the Bakken region requires sound well construction practices to reduce groundwater contamination risks. Concerns include potential contamination of usable groundwater from surface activities like leaky impoundments, spills, and careless disposal of drilling fluids. Wastewater management issues vary across states, with surface disposal of oil-field wastewater posing a risk of contamination to surface water and groundwater. The development of Bakken tight oil faces different challenges compared to natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale Formation. Unlike the Marcellus region, wastewater disposal in the Bakken region is facilitated by deep well injection due to favorable geology. State laws govern oil and gas production on private or state land, while the Bureau of Land Management oversees development on federal lands. The Bureau of Land Management oversees oil and gas leasing on federal lands, coordinating with other agencies. Operators in Montana and North Dakota need both state and federal permits. Federal water quality laws like the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act regulate wastewater disposal. The Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act regulate wastewater disposal through the NPDES permit program and UIC program. Injection of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing is managed through deep disposal wells, excluding fluids used in hydraulic fracturing from regulation unless diesel fuels are used. EPA can delegate enforcement authority to states for UIC programs. The Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act regulate wastewater disposal through the NPDES permit program and UIC program. EPA can delegate enforcement authority to states for UIC programs, allowing states to implement their own program requirements. North Dakota and Montana have attained primacy for the Class II program by demonstrating effectiveness in protecting underground sources of drinking water. North Dakota oil and gas regulations require wells to have two steel casings and two layers of cement for groundwater protection. State regulators added pressure release valves and testing during hydraulic fracturing operations after well integrity failures in 2008. In North Dakota, regulations require two steel casings and two layers of cement for well integrity. Additional measures include pressure release valves and testing during hydraulic fracturing. State rules also prohibit storing flowback water in unlined pits to prevent contamination of shallow aquifers. Montana's regulations aim to prevent water contamination with various provisions. The Montana gas rules aim to prevent water contamination by requiring detailed information on hydraulic fracturing operations, including chemical usage and well construction specifications. Operators must ultimately dispose of produced water in Class II injection wells and not on the surface. After fracturing operations, operators must disclose specific chemical information to regulators and the public. In the Bakken region, underground injection is the main method for disposing of produced water and flowback. While considered environmentally sound, disposal wells are costly and result in permanent water loss. Treatment and reuse of this water could reduce costs for operators and lessen water demands. Research is ongoing to improve technologies and practices to reduce water consumption in the oil industry. The focus is on reducing water consumption in the oil industry, particularly in the Bakken region. There are debates surrounding the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to transport oil from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. TransCanada has proposed an extension to the pipeline to address the lack of capacity in the Bakken, which currently relies on rail for transportation. The Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL project was initially denied in 2012. The Keystone XL project was denied in 2012 but resubmitted with a different configuration. It would connect to the Gulf Coast pipeline, alleviating a bottleneck in oil transportation at Cushing, OK. The Bakken development faces environmental scrutiny due to hydraulic fracturing. Public concerns over water resources and federal regulatory involvement in oil and gas production activities are raised. The federal government is involved in regulating oil and gas production activities to protect ground and drinking water quality. There is debate over whether hydraulic fracturing should be regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, with some states and industry groups opposing it. Congress has not given the EPA authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing, except when diesel fuel is used. In 2010, the 111th Congress directed EPA to study the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. EPA selected locations for five retrospective case studies, including one in Bakken Shale near Killdeer, ND. The study aims to investigate incidents of drinking water contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress would authorize EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The bills H.R. 1084 and S. 587 aim to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to include hydraulic fracturing and require disclosure of chemicals used. Meanwhile, S. 2248 and H.R. 4322 specify that states have sole authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands within their boundaries. This legislation coincided with the BLM proposing regulations for hydraulic fracturing on public lands, including disclosure requirements and well construction standards. The oil industry is concerned about managing fluids that flow back after hydraulic fracturing, impacting local freshwater supplies. Current water withdrawal levels stress groundwater supplies, leading to competition with existing water uses. Access to Lake Sakakawea, managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, would provide a reliable water source for industry expansion. The Corps is processing oil industry applications for surplus water contracts at the lake, with no fee initially as pricing policy is being established. The Corps completes a pricing policy rulemaking for surplus water contracts, potentially imposing fees for storing Missouri River water. North Dakota stakeholders are concerned about interference with state water rights. Despite infrastructure and water constraints, Bakken production is expected to grow, contributing to rising U.S. oil production. Companies are actively drilling in the formation. Companies are actively drilling in the Bakken formation, with the number of rigs increasing by almost 30% since last year. Recent state regulations have not slowed oil production, but concerns remain about potential future regulations impacting production. Advances in directional well drilling and reservoir stimulation have made previously uneconomical shale resources viable for production. Unconventional shales are now considered a source and reservoir for oil and natural gas. Unconventional shales, such as the Bakken formation, serve as both the source and reservoir for oil and natural gas. These petroleum accumulations are not significantly affected by hydrodynamic influences and are trapped in impermeable cap-rock like shale. Despite their small pore sizes, shales can become permeable to hydrocarbon flow through natural or artificial fractures. The industry distinguishes between reserves and resources when measuring quantities of oil and gas. The industry distinguishes between reserves and resources when measuring quantities of oil and natural gas. Reserves must be producible with current technology, at existing prices, and reach the market, with different levels of probability - proved, probable, and possible. Resources, on the other hand, are not constrained by technology, price, or marketability, leading to larger estimates than reserves. The SEC has modified their classification of reserves to include proved reserves. The SEC has modified their classification of reserves to include proved reserves, probable reserves, and possible reserves for clarity. Drilling techniques have evolved from using \"cable-tool\" rigs to more advanced methods. The introduction of rotary-drill rigs in the 20th century revolutionized drilling with the development of the \"tri-cone rotary bit.\" This method uses a rotating bit to penetrate sediment quickly by adding new sections of drill pipe while the bit turns. Modern drill bits with industrial diamonds can grind through any rock type, but the drill string must be removed occasionally to replace the dull bit. Drilling fluids are essential for lubrication and lifting drill cuttings to the surface. Drilling fluids are crucial for lubricating the drill bit, preventing well bore collapse, and removing cuttings. The mud's composition, based on bentonite clay, keeps cuttings suspended. Mud pits adjacent to the drill rig hold and mix the mud, serving as settling ponds for cuttings. Mud density is adjusted as drilling deepens, with the option to recycle mud but dispose of cuttings. Monitoring the mud's chemistry is essential for successful drilling operations. The latest advancement in drilling allows for directing the drill bit beyond the immediate area under the rig. Early directional drilling used a steel wedge (whipstock) to deflect the drill, but lacked control. New technologies like steerable down-hole drill motors improved directional control by operating on hydraulic pressure. Rotary steerable systems introduced in the 1990s further enhanced drilling direction control. Directional drilling with newer rotary steerable systems in the 1990s eliminated the need to slide a steerable down-hole motor, allowing for continuous rotation from the surface by the drilling rig. This enables a more accurate drilling trajectory, faster drilling rates, and fewer incidents of the drill-string sticking. Directional drilling also increases the surface area for flow into the well in shale formations, often requiring artificial stimulation for flow in sandstone and carbonate formations. Before stimulation or production can occur, the well must be completed and cased with telescoping steel casings to prevent collapse and water infiltration. Proper casing design and cementing also prevent reservoir fluids from infiltrating groundwater aquifers. Shallow casing is installed during the initial drilling phase to reinforce the ground surface, with drilling continuing to the water table. After reinforcing the ground surface, drilling continues to the water table where a second casing string is cemented-in and plugged at the bottom. Special oil-well cement is used to fill the void between the casing and the wellbore. Casing prevents water from flooding the well and protects groundwater from contamination. Drilling then proceeds to the \"pay zone\" where natural gas or oil is produced. The number and length of casings depend on the depth and geologic strata properties. After completing drilling and cementing the final casing, a cement evaluation log is run to confirm proper cement thickness. The well is then ready for completion with a perforating tool used to puncture the casing at the pay zone. Shales may require stimulation treatment for economic production through hydraulic fracturing to release oil or gas from the rock matrix. Artificially stimulating shale to release oil or natural gas involves pumping fluids down wells under high pressure to fracture the rock formation. A frac job is the most complex phase of drilling, requiring weeks to stage with a convoy of trucks delivering equipment. Multiple frac treatments may be needed for a single well, with each frac zone isolated using packers or sliding sleeves. The frac treatment process involves isolating each frac zone along the well and starting the treatment from the farthest section out. Wells in the Bakken Formation are spaced on intervals of 640 to 1,280 square acres and completed by drilling laterally. Fracturing fluid is essential for opening the fracture and transporting the proppant along the fracture. The fluid must have the proper viscosity, low friction pressure, and good fluid-loss control. The fluid chemistry may vary depending on the formation properties. Fracturing fluids can be water-based, oil-based, or acid-based, with water-based fluids being the most common due to their cost-effectiveness and performance. Oil-based fluids are used in hydrocarbon formations prone to water damage, while acid-based fluids use hydrochloric acid to dissolve carbonate formations. Water-based fluids mainly consist of water with additives, and may use hydrochloric acid in the initial fracturing stage. Gelling agents like guar gum are also used in water-based fluids. Frac fluid additives like gelling agents, oxidizers, enzyme breakers, silica flour, biocides, stabilizers, and methanol are used to adjust viscosity, break down fluids, prevent bacterial degradation, and stabilize polysaccharide gels. Service companies customize the proportion of additives for each well's unique conditions. Companies adjust the proportion of frac fluid additives to the unique conditions of each well, with OSHA requiring MSDS for each chemical used. Proppants like silica sands are used to create conductive paths for oil or gas. The hydraulic fracture process involves carefully controlled operations, including cleaning the well with an HCl solution before pumping down the fracture pumps. The hydraulic fracturing process involves pumping fluid and proppant down the well to create fractures in the formation. Multiple treatments may be needed, consuming millions of gallons of water. The high injection pressure not only opens and propagates the fracture but also drives fluid into the formation. The high injection pressure in hydraulic fracturing opens and propagates fractures, driving fluid into shale's pore spaces. Flowback treatment aims to recover fluid without removing proppants, but the water may contain salts and chemicals, requiring disposal. Fractures ideally intersect the well casing vertically and open perpendicular to the direction of least stress underground."
