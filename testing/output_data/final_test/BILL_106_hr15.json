The Congress finds that the Otay Mountain region in California is a pristine location known for its unique plants and plays a critical role in biodiversity conservation. The area also faces challenges related to illegal immigration and fire management due to its proximity to the international border. Certain public lands in the California Desert District are designated as wilderness, known as the Otay Mountain Wilderness, in line with the Wilderness Act. The area covers approximately 18,500 acres and is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A map and legal description are provided for reference.
