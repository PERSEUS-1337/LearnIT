    "content": "The U.S. Government imposes conditions on defense articles and services transferred to foreign recipients, with violations potentially leading to contract termination or delivery suspension. Despite occasional indications of violations, neither the President nor Congress has confirmed substantial violations since the 1976 revision of arms export law. This report examines U.S. laws governing foreign use of defense equipment and services. The Arms Export Control Act governs the permissible uses of U.S.-origin defense equipment and services by foreign nations. It sets standards for eligibility to receive defense articles and services and conditions on their use. Previous actions taken by the United States in response to possible violations are also discussed. The Arms Export Control Act outlines eligibility criteria for countries to purchase defense articles and services from the United States, including restrictions on their use. It also specifies consequences for nations that violate these conditions, such as losing military financing and delivery rights for previously purchased items. The Arms Export Control Act restricts the issuance of credits and guarantees to foreign countries that misuse defense articles or services provided under the Act. Violations can result in the loss of military financing and delivery rights for previously purchased items. The Arms Export Control Act, enacted in November 1999, requires that any agreement for the sale or lease of articles on the United States Munitions List must state that the US Government retains the right to verify reports of unauthorized use. Sales of defense articles and services are authorized for purposes such as internal security and legitimate self-defense. The Arms Export Control Act allows for the sale of defense articles and services for purposes such as internal security and legitimate self-defense. However, critical terms like \"internal security\" and \"legitimate self-defense\" are not clearly defined in the Act, leaving it up to the President or Congress to interpret them in the context of potential violations by foreign countries. The Arms Export Control Act requires the President to report promptly to Congress upon receiving information of a possible substantial violation by a foreign country of an agreement governing the sale of U.S. defense articles or services. The report does not need to reach a conclusion but must indicate that specific information suggests a violation may have occurred. Congress can also determine a violation through a joint resolution. If a foreign country is found to have committed a \"substantial violation\" of an arms sale agreement, they will be ineligible for further U.S. military sales under the Arms Export Control Act. The President can still allow cash sales and deliveries if it is deemed necessary for U.S. security, but Congress can override this decision with a joint resolution. Congress can impose penalties on countries for violations of arms sale agreements, subject to the veto process. A country can regain eligibility by ceasing violations and providing assurances to the President. Alternatively, Congress could pass legislation exempting a country from sanctions under the Arms Export Control Act. The United States has various options to prevent the transfer of defense articles and services, including the authority to suspend deliveries or cancel military sales contracts under the Arms Export Control Act. The Secretary of State, under the President's direction, can determine whether sales or exports should proceed to serve the best interests of U.S. foreign policy. The Arms Export Control Act allows the United States to cancel military sales contracts or suspend deliveries under certain circumstances. The Act also grants the Secretary of State the authority to revoke, suspend, or amend export licenses without prior notice. This gives the Executive branch the power to halt, modify, or terminate government-to-government agreements or licensed commercial contracts for defense articles or services if deemed necessary for the national interest. The Arms Export Control Act grants the President the authority to cancel military sales contracts or suspend deliveries under certain circumstances. The President has never determined a \"substantial violation\" of agreements governing use of U.S. arms, such as in the case of Argentina's occupation of the Falkland Islands in 1982. The United States suspended deliveries of defense articles and services to Argentina in 1978 due to violations of agreements. The Reagan Administration lifted the suspension in 1982. Concerns were raised about Israel potentially violating its Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the U.S. in 1982 during military operations in Lebanon. The 1952 agreement between Israel and the United States raised concerns about Israel potentially violating its Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement during military operations in Lebanon. Key terms such as \"internal security,\" \"legitimate self-defense,\" and \"act of aggression\" were not defined in the agreement. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings on this issue in July and August 1982. In July and August 1982, hearings were held regarding the 1952 U.S.-Israeli agreement. The Reagan Administration initially prohibited new exports of cluster bombs to Israel but later lifted the ban in November 1988. Following the Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor in June 1981, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr., reported to Congress that the use of American-supplied military equipment by Israel may have violated the agreement. As a result, the shipment of F-16 and F-15 aircraft to Israel was suspended temporarily. On August 17, 1981, the Reagan Administration lifted the suspension on deliveries of aircraft to Israel, including 10 F-16 and 2 F-15 planes. Despite concerns of Israeli violations of the 1952 agreement with the U.S., no arms sales or deliveries were suspended by the Carter Administration in 1978 and 1979. In 1985, Israel used U.S.-supplied aircraft to bomb PLO headquarters in Tunis. The Reagan Administration lifted the suspension on deliveries of aircraft to Israel in 1981, including F-16 and F-15 planes. The Israeli raid on PLO headquarters in Tunis in 1985 was deemed an expression of self-defense, but not condoned. The Ford Administration initiated a policy review on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia after their intervention in East Timor in 1975. In 1976, the Ford Administration halted new military assistance to Indonesia but continued deliveries of equipment already in the pipeline. A policy review was completed in May, and assistance resumed in July. No formal finding of substantial violation of agreements was made. In 1974, Turkey used U.S.-origin equipment during its Cyprus intervention, leading to disagreement between the President and Congress. The President suspended new Foreign Military Sales credits and guarantees. The President allowed new military sales for Turkey from late July to October 17, 1974, despite an embargo imposed by Congress. President Ford waived the embargo until December 10, 1974, when it went into effect. The embargo was continued by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974, with the option for temporary waivers until February 5, 1975. President Ford temporarily waived the embargo on Turkey from December 30, 1974, until February 5, 1975. Subsequent laws partially lifted the embargo, with President Carter finally authorizing its end on September 26, 1978."
