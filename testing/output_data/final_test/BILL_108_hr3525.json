    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizen Legislature and Political Freedom Act\". Congress finds that the proliferation of campaign finance laws and government regulations have placed strict limits on contributions, hindering challengers from competing equally with incumbent politicians. Contribution limits force candidates to raise funds in small amounts, giving wealthy and long-term incumbents an unfair advantage and discouraging potential candidates from seeking office. The current campaign finance laws hinder challengers from fully discussing public policy issues and favor institutionalized special interests over grassroots and citizen activity. This regulation of political speech is undemocratic as it eliminates challengers lacking resources from political campaigns before their voices are heard. The current campaign finance laws impose burdensome reporting requirements and spending limits on political parties, giving an advantage to well-financed interest groups and wealthy individuals. The low contribution limits force contributors and activists to operate outside the system, leading to less accountability and irresponsible behavior. To promote robust discourse, free political speech, and protect constitutional freedom, all restrictions on political contributions should be lifted.
