    "content": "The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - are valued U.S. allies with deep historical ties. The U.S. never recognized their annexation into the Soviet Union and strongly supported their independence in 1991. The partnership includes cooperation in NATO and the EU, as well as shared foreign policy goals. The U.S.-Baltic partnership involves diplomatic, security, and economic cooperation. The U.S. provides security assistance to strengthen the Baltic states' military capabilities due to concerns about Russia. Congress supports close relations and security cooperation with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The House Baltic Caucus and Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus aim to maintain and strengthen the U.S.-Baltic relationship. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, while similar, have unique differences in history, language, and culture. Cooperation among the Baltic states is central, but each country has its own political dynamics. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are leaders of democracy among post-Soviet states. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are post-Soviet states that have joined NATO and the EU. Estonia's government is led by the Center Party in coalition with the Conservative People's Party of Estonia and Pro Patria. Juri Ratas is Estonia's prime minister. The Center Party came in second in the March 2019 general election and formed a government with the far-right EKRE party. In the 2019 election, EKRE gained 17.8% of the vote, doubling its share from 2015 and winning 19 seats. The Reform Party won 28.9% of the vote but couldn't secure enough support to form a government. The Center Party, previously Russian-leaning, shifted to a pro-Western stance supporting NATO and the EU. During the 2019 election in Estonia, the Center Party advocated for a progressive tax system, higher social spending, and dual-language education. The Reform Party supported a flat tax, tight fiscal policy, and reducing Russian-language education. EKRE gained support by appealing to antiestablishment sentiment and rural Estonians, opposing immigration, and being nationalist. There is potential for friction between the Center Party and EKRE on citizenship, immigration, and abortion policy. In 2016, Estonia's parliament elected Kersti Kaljulaid as president, the youngest and first female president. She has ceremonial duties and influences Estonia's international image. In Latvia, a fragmented election led to a five-party coalition government taking office in January 2019. In January 2019, a coalition government led by Prime Minister Kri\u00c5\u00a1j\u00c4\u0081nis Kari\u00c5\u2020\u00c5\u00a1 of the New Unity Party took office in Latvia. The coalition includes the National Alliance, Who Owns the State? (KPV LV), New Conservative Party, and Development/For! alliance, holding a combined 61 seats in the Saeima. The government is expected to maintain center-right, fiscally conservative, and pro-European policies, reflecting public dissatisfaction with corruption. The recent election in Latvia saw a shift in power, with three parties from the previous coalition government losing nearly half of their seats. The Harmony Social Democratic Party remained the largest party in parliament. Egils Levits was elected as Latvia's next president on May 29, 2019, and formally took office on July 8, 2019. The next general election is scheduled for 2022. Egils Levits became Latvia's president on July 8, 2019, succeeding Raimonds Vejonis. Lithuania has a centrist coalition government led by the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union. Saulius Skvernelis is the prime minister, chosen by the LV\u00c5\u00bdS party. In 2016, Saulius Skvernelis and the LV\u017dS won the election due to being untainted by corruption scandals. The LV\u017dS formed a coalition government with the LSDP, but tensions led to the LSDP leaving in 2017. Skvernelis then led a minority government with the LSDDP. In 2019, a new coalition government was formed with the LV\u017dS, LSDDP, Order and Justice Party, and Electoral Action of Poles. The current coalition in Lithuania consists of four parties controlling a parliamentary majority. Their domestic agenda focuses on boosting social programs, with increased spending on social insurance and benefits for families, students, and the elderly. The opposition parties include the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats and the Liberal Movement. The next general election is scheduled for October 2020. Gitanas Naus\u0117da, a pro-European centrist, won the May 2019 presidential election, replacing Dalia Grybauskait\u0117. The Lithuanian presidency, held by Gitanas Naus\u0117da from 2009 to 2019, is influential in shaping foreign policy, national security, and combating corruption. Special prosecutors were appointed in 2018 to investigate political corruption cases. The Baltic states faced severe economic contraction during the 2008-2009 global crisis. The Baltic economies experienced a significant economic contraction in 2009, leading to increased poverty rates, income inequality, and emigration. However, they have since rebounded, with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania all experiencing GDP growth and declining unemployment rates. Estonia's GDP grew by 5.8% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2018, Latvia's GDP grew by 4.6% in 2017 and 4.8% in 2018, and Lithuania's GDP grew by 4.1% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. Unemployment rates have also decreased in all three countries. The Baltic states experienced economic growth and declining unemployment rates from 2010 to 2018. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania adopted the euro as their currency during this period. Public finances in the Baltic states met EU guidelines, with Estonia having the lowest government debt. Foreign direct investment in the region remains below precrisis levels, with Sweden being the largest investor in the financial services sector. Estonia has been the most successful Baltic country in attracting FDI, with FDI equivalent to approximately 100% of gross value added in 2015. Concerns have been raised about the practices of banks in the region catering to nonresidents, with scandals in 2018 highlighting money-laundering challenges. ABLV Bank in Latvia was designated as a primary money laundering concern by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. ABLV Bank in Latvia faced allegations of bribery and violating UN sanctions, leading to self-liquidation. The Latvian government prioritized banking sector reforms and anti-money-laundering practices. Danske Bank in Denmark was implicated in suspicious transactions totaling $220 billion from 2007 to 2015 through its Estonian branch, despite regulatory warnings. Estonian authorities ordered Danske Bank to cease operations in 2019. Danske Bank was ordered to cease operations in Estonia, leading to its decision to also cease activities in Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic states are described as strong allies of the United States, with a relationship seen as crucial for security against potential threats from Russia. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined NATO and the EU in 2004 with strong U.S. support. The Baltic states have a pro-NATO and pro-EU orientation, supporting U.S. foreign policy and security goals. They have contributed troops to NATO-led missions in Afghanistan and have been part of the Global Coalition to Defeat the Islamic State. The Trump Administration and Congress have shown support for strong U.S. relations with the Baltic states, hosting summits to deepen security cooperation and expand economic ties. During the 115th Congress, the Senate adopted a resolution congratulating Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on their 100th anniversary of independence and commending their commitment to NATO, democracy, and human rights. The United States provides significant security assistance to the Baltic states, including defense articles sold under the Foreign Military Sales program. Since 2014, the Baltic states have received over $150 million in defense articles through Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Financing, aimed at enhancing their defensive capabilities in various areas. Additionally, they receive approximately $1.2 million annually per country in International Military Education and Training funds and $290 million in Department of Defense funding for train and equip programs. The Baltic states have also been participating in the U.S. National Guard State Partnership Program since 1993. The United States signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with each of the Baltic states in 2017, enhancing defense cooperation. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 authorized a security assistance program to improve Baltic states' interoperability and capacity to deter aggression. In November 2018, the US and the Baltic states agreed to develop bilateral defense cooperation strategic road maps. The United States signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with the Baltic states in 2017, enhancing defense cooperation. In April and May 2019, road map agreements were signed with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to strengthen security cooperation in various areas. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 extended security assistance to the Baltic states through 2021, with a spending limit of $125 million. The Senate committee recommends allocating $400 million for a Baltics regional air defense radar system to deter Russian aggression. A House resolution reaffirms U.S. support for Baltic states' sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Baltic Reassurance Act emphasizes U.S. commitment to Baltic security. The U.S. has limited economic ties with the Baltic states, but there are growing commercial opportunities. In 2018, U.S. goods exports to Estonia were $346.1 million, with top exports being computer products, chemicals, and machinery. U.S. affiliates employ 3,570 people in Estonia, and U.S. FDI was $100 million in 2017. Goods exports to Latvia were $510.4 million in 2018. In 2018, U.S. goods exports to Latvia were valued at $510.4 million and imports from Latvia at $727.1 million. Main U.S. exports to Latvia include transportation equipment and computer products, while top imports from Latvia are beverage products and transportation equipment. U.S. affiliates employ around 1,325 people in Latvia, with U.S. FDI at $71 million in 2017. U.S. exports to Lithuania in 2018 were valued at $706.4 million, with imports at nearly $1.268 billion. Main U.S. exports to Lithuania are used machinery, chemicals, computer products, and transportation equipment, while top imports from Lithuania are petroleum products, chemicals, and furniture. U.S. affiliates employ about 2,250 people in Lithuania, with Lithuania not attracting significant levels of U.S. FDI. Officials in the Baltic region have expressed concerns about increasing signs of Russian foreign policy assertiveness. Defense experts are concerned about Russian military buildup near the Baltic states, including advanced air defense systems. Russia's actions are seen as testing NATO solidarity and credibility, with the potential to close off the Baltic Sea and skies to NATO reinforcements. RAND war games suggest a quick Russian strike could reach the capitals of Estonia and Latvia. The Baltic states, Estonia and Latvia, are vulnerable to a quick Russian strike due to their limited military capabilities. They heavily rely on NATO for defense and have increased their defense budgets in response to Russia's actions. Lithuania has the largest military among the Baltic states and has significantly increased its defense spending. Lithuania's defense spending is expected to reach $1.084 billion in 2019, equivalent to 1.98% of GDP. The country has acquired new artillery systems and anti-aircraft missiles, reintroduced compulsory military service, and has 3,000 personnel joining the armed forces annually. Estonia's defense spending is projected to be 2.13% of GDP in 2019, totaling $669 million. The country has 6,600 active personnel, 12,000 reserves, and a volunteer territorial defense force with 15,800 members. Estonia is upgrading its air defense system and modernizing ground warfare equipment, including anti-tank weapons. Men aged 18-27 are required to serve eight months in the military. Latvia's armed forces have 6,210 active personnel and have increased defense spending to 2.01% of GDP. Acquisition priorities include self-propelled artillery, armored reconnaissance vehicles, helicopters, anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-tank missiles. The United States has enhanced security cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe through the European Deterrence Initiative. The United States has not increased its permanent troop presence in Europe but has focused on rotating additional forces into the region, including nine-month deployments of a third Brigade Combat Team based in Poland. Approximately 6,000 U.S. military personnel are involved in the Atlantic Resolve mission at any given time, with units operating in the region under rotational deployments. The Fourth Infantry Division Mission Command Element is also based in the region for enhanced security cooperation. The Fourth Infantry Division Mission Command Element in Pozna\u00c5\u0084, Poland oversees rotational units in Europe. EDI funding increased under the Trump Administration but decreased in FY2020 due to completed projects. $3.6 billion was deferred for military construction projects to fund the U.S.-Mexico border wall, affecting Baltic states' initiatives. At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, the alliance agreed to deploy battalion-sized multinational battle groups to Poland and the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression. Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom lead the multinational battalions in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia respectively, with troop contributions from various countries. The United Kingdom leads in Estonia, with contributions from Denmark, France, and Iceland. NATO resists calls to deploy troops permanently in countries that joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union due to concerns about violating the NATO-Russia Founding Act. The Baltic states rely on NATO allies for airspace defense, with the Baltic Air Policing mission launched in 2004 and increased deployments after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In September 2019, Belgium took over as the lead nation for the Baltic Air Policing mission, with aircraft from Belgium, Denmark, and the Czech Republic stationed in Lithuania and Estonia. Tensions between Russia and the Baltic states have been heightened by accusations of spying, cyber attacks, and propaganda targeting Russian speakers in the region. Tensions between Russia and the Baltic states have been exacerbated by the Baltic states' support for EU sanctions on Russia and Russian retaliatory sanctions. Concerns have been raised about Russia targeting the Baltic states with hybrid warfare tactics, especially due to the large ethnic Russian population in the region. Russia claims to defend the rights of Russian-speaking people wherever they live, accusing Estonia and Latvia of violating the human rights of Russian-speaking minorities. Some Russian-speaking minorities in Latvia and Estonia face discrimination in official language usage. Noncitizen residents, mostly ethnic Russians, are unable to vote or hold public office without passing a citizenship test. Russian media dominates the information market in Russian-speaking regions, leading to concerns about integration and influence. Russian media outlets like Rossiya and Sputnik have faced fines and bans in Latvia and Lithuania for biased reporting. Russia uses traditional and social media to spread disinformation in Baltic states, portraying them negatively. Russian outlets fabricate stories to oppose NATO deployments in the region. There is no movement for Russian-speaking communities in the Baltic states to join Russia. Russian-speaking communities in the Baltic states are not unified in their views on political narratives. Most prefer living in Estonia or Latvia due to benefits like visa-free travel and higher wages. Concerns exist about Russia inciting tensions or cyberattacks in the region. Estonia faced cyberattacks in 2007, some believed to be from Russian government servers. In 2007, Estonia experienced cyberattacks from Russian government web servers and other locations worldwide. The attacks, believed to be coordinated, prompted Estonia to strengthen its cyber defenses. Estonia hosts the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, promoting cybersecurity cooperation among NATO countries. In 2018, Lithuania established a National Cyber Security Centre to enhance its cyber defenses. In 2018, Lithuania's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) registered over 53,000 cybersecurity incidents. The country ranked fourth in the Global Cybersecurity Index, prompting efforts to diversify natural gas sources and improve integration with European networks. A floating LNG terminal in Klaip\u00c4\u0097da became operational in 2014 to reduce dependence on Russian gas. The Independence, a 300-meter-long vessel at the Lithuanian port of Klaip\u00c4\u0097da, supplies 100% of Lithuania's natural gas needs and 90% of the Baltic countries' needs. Litgas signed a deal with Statoil for gas supply, leading to a price cut by Gazprom. The US started exporting LNG to Lithuania in 2017. Currently, Lithuania imports 58% of its natural gas from Russia, while Estonia and Latvia rely entirely on Russian gas. Oil shale is a significant energy source for Estonia, with natural gas playing a minor role. Latvia's primary energy consumption relies on hydropower, with Russian natural gas accounting for 24%. Initiatives to reduce energy dependence on Russia include the completion of pipelines linking Baltic states to the EU and the opening of LNG terminals in Poland and Finland. The Baltic states' power grids are connected to Russia and Belarus, with a control center in Moscow managing reserve capacity. The Baltic states' electricity supply is regulated by a control center in Moscow. Integration projects with the European electricity market include the LitPol link and the NordBalt cable. Plans are in place to synchronize the electricity grids of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania with the rest of Europe by 2025. U.S. officials are concerned about Russian energy dominance affecting transatlantic unity on other issues. The United States has encouraged EU member states to reduce energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply. In the 116th Congress, related bills include the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019 and the Protect European Energy Security Act. The Baltic states are expected to remain strong U.S. allies and important security partners in Europe, with close cooperation in areas such as deterring Russian aggression and ensuring energy security. Efforts to deter Russian aggression, future of NATO, energy security, and economic issues are key concerns for the Baltic states. The United States is expected to provide leadership on foreign policy and security matters. Congress may focus on activities and funding for defense cooperation, NATO presence, and security assistance for the Baltic states. Energy security and potential security threats from Russia, including hybrid threats like cyberattacks, are also of interest to Members of Congress. Members of Congress are interested in assessing how Baltic states and other NATO and EU members can develop capabilities to counter hybrid threats like disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks."
