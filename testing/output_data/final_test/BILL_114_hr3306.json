Congress finds that Cuba has limited domestic oil production, relies heavily on oil imports from Venezuela, and has potential oil reserves in its deep waters that have yet to be fully explored. Exploration efforts have now shifted onshore to areas along Cuba's northern coast. Cuba has four refineries owned by Cuba Petroleos, with a total crude oil refining capacity of 301,400 barrels per day. The country aims to produce 24% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, currently only at 4.3%. Union Electrica plans 13 wind projects, 755 MW of biomass-fired capacity, 700 MW of solar capacity, and 56 MW of hydroelectric power to meet this goal. The end of trade restrictions could create a new market for various supplies and services from the US energy industry, including 56 megawatts of hydroelectric power. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the Natural Gas Act are amended to allow the export of oil and LNG to Cuba. Additionally, there is a provision for the export of energy resources, technologies, and services to Cuba. The President is authorized to permit the export of energy resources, technologies, and services to Cuba, including establishing facilities and conducting transactions.
