    "content": "The House adopts rules of procedure at the beginning of each Congress, with some changes made for each new Congress. Rules X-XIII govern House committees and subcommittees, which must comply with House directives. Committees have some autonomy in conducting business and must adopt written rules within House limitations. This report summarizes House rules affecting committee powers, authority, activities, and operations. The report summarizes House rules that apply to most or all House committees, covering general requirements and prohibitions. It does not include rules specific to individual committees or certain appropriations hearings. Rule XI provides that the rules of the House are applicable to its committees and subcommittees. The application of these rules can sometimes be unclear in practice. The House Parliamentarian notes that procedures in the House generally apply to committee proceedings. Members and staff are advised to consult the text of the appropriate standing rule or provision of law for more details. The rules of the House are applicable to its committees and subcommittees, with procedures in committees generally following House proceedings. Committees conduct business under the five-minute rule and may use motions to limit debate. Subcommittees are subject to the authority of the committee they belong to. Each committee must follow House rules and applicable laws, adopting written rules that align with Rule XI. Committee rules must be made public within thirty days of members being elected. Committees must submit a report on their activities at the end of each Congress, distinguishing between legislative and other activities. The activities report is to differentiate between the committee's legislative and oversight activities. A committee chair may file the report after Congress adjourns sine die, without formal approval, as long as it has been available to committee members for at least seven days. Committee records must be kept separate from the chair's personal office records, and are accessible to all House Members. Certain records of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct require prior approval for non-committee Members. Noncurrent records are preserved at the National Archives. The National Archives and Records Administration stores noncurrent committee records transferred by the chair at the end of each Congress. These records are preserved by the Archivist of the United States but remain the property of the House. Archived records are made publicly available following specific rules, with some records becoming available after 50 years. The Committee on House Administration may establish guidelines and regulations governing the applicability and implementation of House Rule VII on noncurrent records. An archived record of a committee may not be available to the public if the Clerk of the House deems it detrimental to the public interest or inconsistent with the rights and privileges of the House. The Clerk notifies the Committee on House Administration of determinations regarding the availability of archived records. Committees can change these determinations later. Committees must include standards for availability of records in their written rules, specifying procedures for making records available to the public. Nonavailability of records beyond House rules requires committee approval. Rule XI, clause 2(e)(4) states that committees should make their publications available to the public electronically. Rule X, clause 1 establishes nineteen standing committees with specific jurisdictions. Committees may have up to five subcommittees, with exceptions for certain committees. H.Res. 5 waived the limit on subcommittees for the Transportation and Infrastructure and Armed Services Committees.

In \"extraordinary circumstances,\" the Speaker can designate more than one committee as primary or create a special ad hoc committee.

Compliance with subpoenas can only be enforced by the House. The House Rules allow minority party members to request witness testimony during committee hearings, witnesses must submit written statements before testifying, and each committee member has five minutes to question witnesses. The House Rules allow witnesses to be questioned by committee members for up to one hour, with time divided equally between majority and minority parties. Witnesses can have counsel present for advice on constitutional rights, and breaches of order can result in punishment or contempt citations. Witnesses in House hearings can submit sworn statements, obtain transcripts of open session testimony with committee authorization, and hearings are generally open to the public unless closed for national security or legal reasons by a majority vote. The committee may vote to close a hearing if testimony may defame, degrade, or incriminate a person, or to discuss resuming the hearing in closed session. Witnesses can request additional witnesses, and evidence from closed sessions requires committee approval for public release. Most committees or subcommittees can vote to close one day of hearing and the following day. Certain committees can close up to 5 consecutive days of hearings. House members can attend but not participate in hearings of committees they do not serve on, unless authorized by the House. Committees are authorized to have their hearings printed and bound.
