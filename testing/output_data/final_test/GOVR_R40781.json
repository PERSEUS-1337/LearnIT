Established by HERA in 2008, key features include rental housing production, support for first-time homebuyers, and focus on extremely low-income households. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was established in 2008 to provide formula funds to states for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing production and support for first-time homebuyers, especially those with incomes at or below 50% of the area median income. Funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the HTF faced funding challenges after the GSEs entered conservatorship in 2008, suspending their contributions for several years. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was established in 2008 to provide formula funds to states for affordable housing activities, funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After facing funding challenges due to the GSEs entering conservatorship in 2008, they resumed contributions in 2015. The GSEs transferred $174 million to the Housing Trust Fund, and HUD announced formula allocations to states in May 2016. Many states and localities have created housing trust funds to provide dedicated sources of funding for affordable housing activities. Affordable housing trust funds are permanent funding streams dedicated to affordable housing activities for low-income households. Real estate transaction fees are a common funding source for state or local trust funds. Nearly 700 state, city, and county housing trust funds have been established in 47 states. Advocates pushed for a national housing trust fund to complement state and local efforts before the federal Housing Trust Fund was established in 2008. Advocates pushed for a national housing trust fund to be capitalized with new resources for affordable housing activities, separate from other federal programs. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to provide dedicated funding for affordable housing initiatives. The Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund were established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to provide dedicated funding for affordable housing initiatives. Both funds were to be funded through contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that provide liquidity in the mortgage market. The Housing Trust Fund received its first funding in 2016 after contributions were suspended for several years. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to set aside 0.042% of the dollar amount of mortgages they purchase each year. This contribution is divided with 25% going towards the Hope for Homeowners program, 65% to HUD for the Housing Trust Fund, and 35% to Treasury for the Capital Magnet Fund. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot pass these costs on to mortgage lenders. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to set aside funds for affordable housing programs. If the contributions to the affordable housing funds are deemed to threaten the financial stability of the GSEs, the Federal Housing Finance Agency can suspend them. In 2008, concerns about the financial status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led to the GSEs entering voluntary conservatorship and receiving financial support from the Department of the Treasury. Treasury provided financial support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through the purchase of senior preferred stock. In 2008, FHFA instructed the GSEs to halt contributions to affordable housing funds, leaving the Housing Trust Fund without funding. In 2014, FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to resume setting aside funds for affordable housing programs due to their improved profitability. The GSEs were required to transfer funds to the affordable housing funds by the end of 2015. Affordable housing advocates and lawmakers praised the decision to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contribute to housing funds, citing the need for more affordable housing. However, some criticized the move due to opposition to the Housing Trust Fund and concerns about the GSEs contributing while still in conservatorship. FHFA stated that contributions will not be required if the GSEs draw funds from Treasury agreements. HUD published a proposed rule governing the contributions. HUD published a proposed rule governing the allocation formula for the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) on December 4, 2009 and a proposed rule governing program requirements on October 29, 2010. On January 30, 2015, HUD published an interim rule governing both the HTF formula and program requirements. HUD administers the program by transferring GSE contributions to provide formula grants to states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and four insular areas. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) provides funding to states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and four insular areas. The allocation of funds is based on factors such as the shortage of affordable rental units for extremely low-income and very low-income renter households. The formula prioritizes states with the highest need for affordable housing. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) allocates funding to states based on factors like the shortage of affordable rental units for low-income households. The formula considers the number of households spending over 50% of income on housing costs and rent, multiplied by the state's construction cost. HUD has discretion in weighting these factors, with priority given to extremely low-income households. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) allocates funding to states based on factors like the shortage of affordable rental units for low-income households. The formula factors are weighted with the first factor receiving the highest weight (50%) and the third factor receiving the second-highest weight (25%). States must designate an entity to administer the funds, such as a housing finance agency or housing and community development agency. If HTF funding is insufficient for each state to receive a minimum grant of $3 million, HUD will publish an alternative allocation method for public comment. Grantees and subgrantees of the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) must submit plans to HUD detailing how they will distribute funds to recipients, who are for-profit or nonprofit entities with relevant experience in affordable housing development. Recipients of funding for rental housing or homeownership activities from the Housing Trust Fund must have experience in affordable housing development. They must also demonstrate financial expertise and knowledge of relevant housing programs. States are required to prioritize rental housing support, with some funding available for first-time homebuyers. The focus is on assisting extremely low-income families. The Housing Trust Fund provides funding to benefit low-income families through grants, equity investments, and loans for housing assistance. Housing must meet specific standards for quality, accessibility, and energy efficiency. At least 80% of funds must be used for rental housing activities, with grants available for production, preservation, rehabilitation, or operation of rental housing. HUD's interim rule states that 80% of Housing Trust Fund (HTF) funds must be used for rental housing activities, with up to 10% for homebuyer activities and administrative purposes. Grantees can allocate no more than one-third of their annual grant for operating assistance, which covers ongoing costs like utilities and maintenance. There is debate among housing advocates about allowing more funds for operating assistance, but HUD is concerned it could shift focus away from rental housing production. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) allows up to 10% of a state's grant to be used for owner-occupied housing, including down payment assistance and closing cost assistance for first-time home buyers. The assisted housing must be \"modest\" with resale or recapture provisions in place. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) allows up to 10% of a state's grant to be used for owner-occupied housing, with resale and recapture provisions in place. HTF funds cannot be used for political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling services, travel expenses, or tax advice. HUD's interim rule specifies additional ineligible uses of HTF funds. HUD sets a limit of 10% for administrative costs of programs funded by the Housing Trust Fund grant. All funds must benefit extremely low-income (ELI) or very low-income (VLI) households. At least 75% of rental housing funds must benefit ELI households or those below the poverty line, with the remaining for VLI households. HUD's interim rule for the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) requires that all funds benefit extremely low-income (ELI) households or those below the poverty line. When HTF funding is less than $1 billion, all funds must benefit ELI households. When funding exceeds $1 billion, at least 75% of a state's grant must benefit ELI households. HTF-assisted housing must meet affordability requirements, including maximum rents and affordability periods. Rents for ELI households in HTF-assisted units are capped at 30% of income or the federal poverty line. Some housing advocates argue that rents in HTF-assisted units should not exceed 30% of tenants' actual incomes, rather than a specified percentage of area median income. This is because for ELI households earning significantly less than 30% of AMI, rents set at 30% of AMI may be unaffordable. HUD notes that other federal affordable housing programs generally cap rents at 30% of a tenant's income. HUD notes that HTF units do not have a separate source of funds for operating assistance, leading to fixed rents being necessary for underwriting and financing. HTF-assisted housing must remain affordable for a specified period, with rental housing required to remain affordable for 30 years and owner-occupied housing for 10, 20, or 30 years depending on the assistance provided. HERA requires states or state-designated entities administering grants from the Housing Trust Fund to develop allocation plans describing how grant money will be distributed. The allocation plan is part of the Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan that grantees must submit to receive HUD block grant funds. Plans must address priority housing needs, distribution of HTF funds, performance goals, and consider public comments. Grantees awarding funds directly must outline geographic distribution and other prioritized factors. The Housing Trust Fund requires states or designated entities to develop allocation plans for distributing grant money. These plans must address priority housing needs, distribution of funds, performance goals, and consider public comments. Grantees may prioritize specific populations or subgrantees in their allocation plans, which must align with the state's plan. Both grantees and HUD have oversight responsibilities for the funds. HUD oversees HTF funds and states or designated entities monitor fund usage. Improperly used funds must be repaid or future grants will be reduced. Grantees must inspect properties, maintain records, and monitor subgrantees. Annual reports on fund usage are required. HUD oversees the use of HTF funds, with grantees required to submit annual performance reports detailing fund usage and compliance with allocation plans. Noncompliance can result in HUD taking actions such as requiring corrective plans or withholding funding. Funds must be committed within two years and spent within five years, or they will be recaptured and reallocated by HUD. The GSEs began contributing to the HTF in 2015. The GSEs contributed $174 million to the Housing Trust Fund in 2015, with funds allocated to states in 2016. Most states received a minimum allocation of $3 million, while California received the largest allocation of $10 million. The Housing Trust Fund is a topic of current debate, with arguments for and against its funding and potential implications. Supporters advocate for a national affordable housing trust fund to address a shortage of affordable housing for low-income households, while opponents raise concerns about funding and potential uses. A national housing trust fund is needed to address the shortage of affordable rental housing for low-income households, particularly those with incomes at or below 30% of the area median income. Current federal housing assistance programs focus on making existing housing more affordable through rental assistance, but there is a need for funds to produce or rehabilitate additional housing units for low-income households. The current funding for federal housing assistance programs is insufficient to serve all eligible individuals. Current federal housing assistance programs are not sufficient to serve all eligible households, with only a quarter of low-income rental households receiving assistance. Programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and HOME Investment Partnerships Program aim to develop rental units for households with incomes at or below certain thresholds. However, there is a need for a national housing trust fund to address the shortage of affordable rental housing for low-income households, especially those with incomes at or below 30% of the area median income. The Housing Trust Fund must benefit households with incomes below 80% of area median income or 60% for rental housing. It can be used for various purposes like homebuyer assistance and rehabilitating homes. Critics argue that it duplicates existing federal funding programs like the HOME program. Some concerns have been raised about the funding process for affordable rental housing activities, including worries about funds being provided outside of the appropriations process and potential misuse of funds from the Housing Trust Fund. Critics have also questioned the decision to require contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while they are still in conservatorship. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to make contributions to housing funds while in conservatorship and under agreements with Treasury. Despite paying dividends to Treasury exceeding the support received, they have not fully repaid. The GSEs can draw additional funds from Treasury if needed, but their capital buffer decreases annually and will reach zero in 2018, potentially leading to the need for future Treasury funds. The financial performance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has implications for the Housing Trust Fund, as their contributions may be suspended if they draw funds from Treasury. Discussions on housing finance reform have included the GSEs' support for affordable housing and the Housing Trust Fund, but there is no consensus on how to reform the system. In the 113th Congress, housing finance reform bills were proposed in the House and Senate. The House's PATH Act aimed to phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without a government guarantee, while the Senate's Johnson-Crapo bill suggested replacing them with a new entity with federal reinsurance on certain mortgage-backed securities. The Housing Trust Fund was addressed differently in each bill. In the 114th Congress, no comprehensive housing finance reform legislation has been considered by committee. However, the Housing Trust Fund is likely to be part of the debate regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's status in the future. HERA allows for other funds to be allocated to the Housing Trust Fund. Affordable housing advocates have been searching for a new dedicated source of permanent funding for the Housing Trust Fund. FHFA directed the GSEs to contribute to the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund in December 2014, but additional funding sources are still being sought. In 2014, housing advocates are looking for additional funding sources for the Housing Trust Fund. Suggestions include changes to the mortgage interest deduction to lower tax expenditures. Bills like the Common Sense Housing Investment Act and the Pathways out of Poverty Act aim to provide more funding for the Housing Trust Fund and other housing programs. The Pathways out of Poverty Act of 2015 (H.R. 2721) and the Ending Homelessness Act of 2016 (H.R. 4888) in the 114th Congress proposed funding the Housing Trust Fund with $1 billion per year from general Treasury funds. Other bills in previous Congresses also aimed to provide funding for the Housing Trust Fund from various sources. Some bills proposed using funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to finance the Housing Trust Fund. TARP was established in 2008 to address the financial crisis by purchasing troubled assets from financial institutions. However, no annual appropriations or other legislation has provided funding for the Housing Trust Fund besides the original mechanism in HERA. Critics argue that the fund may be duplicative, funded outside the appropriations process, or at risk of misuse. Additionally, some believe that Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) should not allocate funds to affordable housing. Some bills in Congress aim to restrict funding from Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) to the Housing Trust Fund while they are under government conservatorship. For example, the Pay Back the Taxpayers Act of 2015 would prohibit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from providing funding to the Housing Trust Fund or the Capital Magnet Fund in such circumstances. Additionally, the House-passed version of the FY2016 HUD appropriations bill would redirect funding from the Housing Trust Fund to HUD's HOME program. The Housing Finance Restructuring Act of 2016 (H.R. 4913) aims to end the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requiring them to rebuild capital before resuming contributions to the Housing Trust Fund and Capital Magnet Fund. The New Fair Deal Banking and Housing Stability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3550) in the 113th Congress sought to eliminate various government housing and mortgage market policies, including repealing the Housing Trust Fund. The Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011 (H.R. 2441) aimed to eliminate the Housing Trust Fund and transfer funds to reduce the federal budget deficit. Previous legislative proposals have been introduced to establish a national affordable housing trust fund, with funding being a major question. The Housing Trust Fund Elimination Act of 2011 aimed to eliminate the Housing Trust Fund and transfer funds to reduce the federal budget deficit. Legislation proposed using contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a potential funding source for an affordable housing trust fund. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, chartered by Congress, purchase mortgages from private lenders, guarantee payments, and oversee by an independent federal regulator. In 2008, HERA created the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund, funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There was debate over whether it was appropriate for the government to require the GSEs to contribute to affordable housing funds. Opponents argued that GSEs should not have to balance public policy objectives with shareholder interests, while proponents justified contributions based on the special privileges and statutory affordable housing goals of the GSEs. HUD announced the first state allocations from the Housing Trust Fund in May 2016, funded by contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Most states received a minimum allocation of $3 million, with allocations organized from largest to smallest in Table B-1. Puerto Rico and insular areas were not subject to the minimum allocation requirement."
