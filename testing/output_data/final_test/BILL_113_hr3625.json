    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the International Space Station, Space Launch System, and Orion crew capsule are crucial for space exploration, but funding delays have caused setbacks in reaching milestones. Contractors are holding program funding worth hundreds of millions. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Administration terminates very few contracts, with only 28 out of 16,343 active contracts terminated in fiscal year 2010, representing a termination rate of about 0.17 percent. Implementing processes requiring congressional action for termination of high-priority programs would allow contractors to utilize taxpayer dollars more effectively to achieve technical goals and schedule milestones. NASA termination liability is addressed in Section 2. Termination liability costs for covered programs must be provided only as outlined in this section. The Administrator and prime contractors are prohibited from reserving funds for potential termination costs. Congress intends for funds allocated to covered programs to be used for technical goals and schedule milestones. Any contractual provisions for termination costs not in line with this section are void. The Administrator is restricted from terminating contracts for convenience without proper congressional action and notice. The Administrator must follow specific procedures for terminating prime contracts on covered programs, including obtaining authorization from Congress. If termination is necessary due to cause, notification to relevant committees is required. In cases where termination costs exceed available appropriations, a supplemental appropriation request is needed. The Administrator must notify Congress 120 days in advance if additional authorization of appropriations is needed for termination liability costs on prime contracts for covered programs. Congress intends to provide necessary appropriations for contract terminations if deemed appropriate. The Administrator is required to report termination liability costs for prime contracts on covered programs every 6 months to the relevant congressional committees. The basis for determining these estimates must also be provided. In this Act, key definitions include the Administration as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Administrator as the head of the Administration, covered programs such as the International Space Station, Space Launch System, and Orion crew capsule, Orion crew capsule as a specific vehicle, prime contractor as a direct contractor with the government on covered programs, and Space Launch System as a specific launch system. The Space Launch System is a Government-owned launch system developed by the Administration to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit. Termination liability costs refer to costs incurred by contractors due to contract termination for which the Federal Government is liable."
