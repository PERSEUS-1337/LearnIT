    "content": "Three need-based student financial aid programs, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs, are collectively known as the \"campus-based\" programs. These programs provide funds directly to institutions of higher education to administer and match federal funds. The mix and amount of aid awarded to students are determined by institution-specific criteria. The authorizations for these programs expired in FY2015. The campus-based programs, including FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan, expired in FY2015. FSEOG and FWS have been funded through annual appropriation bills, while the Perkins Loan program was extended through FY2017. Federal aid has shifted towards portability, allowing students to receive aid at any participating institution. The campus-based programs, such as FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loan, have played a smaller role in federal student aid compared to Direct Loans and Pell Grants. Lawmakers are considering reauthorization of the HEA, with focus on the unique aid provided by campus-based programs, fund allocation formulas, and their future role. The report discusses the history and allocation of funds for campus-based aid programs, including FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loans. It also addresses issues related to institutional and student participation in these programs compared to other federal aid programs, highlighting potential areas of focus for the 115th Congress during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The Federal Perkins Loan program is the oldest campus-based aid program, established in response to national security concerns during the space-race era. It offers low-interest rate loans to full-time undergraduate, graduate, and professional students with financial need. The Federal Perkins Loan program, established in response to national security concerns, provided low-interest loans to full-time students with financial need. The loans, originally known as National Defense Student Loans (NDSLs), required special consideration for students with superior academic backgrounds in certain fields or intending to teach. Loan amounts were determined by the institution and capped at $1,000 per academic year or $5,000 total. Repayments were deferred while the student was enrolled full-time and for up to three years during military service, with potential loan forgiveness for teachers. The Federal Perkins Loan program, initially named National Defense Student Loans (NDSLs), provided low-interest loans to full-time students with financial need. Borrowers could have 50% of their loan principal and interest repayments cancelled, with additional cancellations for those who died or became permanently disabled. The program's funding was authorized through FY1966, with institutions receiving Federal Capital Contributions (FCC) not exceeding $250,000 annually. Institutions were required to match FCC with an Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) of at least $1 for every $9 received. The program aimed to be self-sustaining post-FY1966 by using repayments from pre-1966 loans to fund future loans. The Federal Perkins Loan program, initially named National Defense Student Loans (NDSLs), provided low-interest loans to full-time students with financial need. Borrowers could have 50% of their loan principal and interest repayments cancelled, with additional cancellations for those who died or became permanently disabled. The program aimed to use repayments on loans awarded before 1966 to fund future loans, but the program grew faster than expected, leading to continued Federal Capital Contributions (FCCs) beyond FY1966 until FY2004. Additionally, the NDEA required reimbursement for Perkins Loan cancellations for students engaged in public service, initially funded through appropriations for FCCs but later amended under the 1972 HEA amendments to require separate appropriations for loan cancellation reimbursements. The Federal Perkins Loan program underwent several revisions over the years, including changes to award recipient selection, increased Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) requirements, expanded loan cancellation and deferment provisions, eligibility for part-time students, and allowance for using funds for program administration. Funding for Perkins Loan cancellations was last provided in FY2009. The Federal Perkins Loan program underwent revisions over the years, including changes to award recipient selection, increased Institutional Capital Contribution (ICC) requirements, and expanded loan cancellation provisions. The program's authorizations were extended through FY2015, but operations were curtailed in 2015. The Extension Act allowed IHEs to make new Perkins Loans to eligible students through 2017. The Extension Act allowed IHEs to make new Perkins Loans to eligible students through September 30, 2017. It also amended provisions related to student eligibility and fund distribution. The Federal Work-Study program was originally authorized in 1964 to provide part-time employment for students from low-income families. The Federal Work-Study program, authorized in 1964, allowed student employment on-campus or off-campus for educational or public interest. Institutions had to provide a match of 10% initially and 25% subsequently. The program was later incorporated into the HEA in 1968 with a 20% match requirement. Revisions included the creation of the Job Location and Development program and the Work Colleges program. The Work Colleges program supports work-learning-service programs at select institutions. The Federal Work-Study program now includes community service as a requirement, with institutions needing to allocate at least 7% of their funds for community service projects. Additionally, the institutional match for most FWS jobs has been increased to 25%. The Education Opportunity Grants aim to assist students with exceptional financial need in attending higher education institutions. The FSEOG program, originally part of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, provides supplemental grants to help qualified students with financial need access postsecondary education. Priority is given to Pell Grant recipients and students with exceptional need. Awards range from $200 to $1,500, with a maximum total aid of $4,000 over four years. The FSEOG program, part of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, provides grants to students with financial need. Awards range from $200 to $1,500, with a maximum total aid of $4,000 over four years. Under the 1986 amendments, institutions had to match federal funds, award limits changed to $100 to $4,400, and part-time students became eligible. In the mid-1970s, the FSEOG program required institutions to match federal funds, with award limits ranging from $100 to $4,400. Funds were allocated to states based on student population and then distributed to institutions based on financial need. The application process for funding was criticized as complex and time-consuming. In the mid-1970s, a panel of experts recommended new allocation procedures for campus-based programs due to criticism of the complex and inequitable panel review process. The current formula allocates funds to institutions through a two-stage process, with a base guarantee given to each participating institution based on prior funding received. Any remaining funds are then allocated based on formula-based procedures known as the fair share. The current formula for allocating funds to institutions through campus-based programs involves a two-stage process. Institutions receive a base guarantee based on prior funding, with any shortfall eligible for additional funding known as fair share increase. The sum of the base guarantee and fair share amount makes up the institution's allocation. Base guarantee is determined by the year of participation in the programs, with adjustments for first-time participants. The base guarantee for institutions in campus-based programs is determined by prior funding, favoring long-term participants over new ones. In AY2016-2017, base guarantees made up over 60% of total allocations, providing a funding advantage for some institutions. In campus-based programs, funds are allocated to institutions based on base guarantees and fair share increases. The fair share allocation procedures involve determining each institution's institutional need, which is calculated based on the relationship between the institution's cost of attendance and students' expected family contribution. The cost of attendance includes tuition, fees, living costs, and books and supplies. In AY2016-2017, the living cost allowance per student was $11,370. In AY2016-2017, the living cost allowance per student was $11,370, and the books and supplies allowance was $600. Each student at an IHE is assigned an EFC for fair share calculations based on dependency status and class level. Average EFCs are calculated for student categories grouped by income bands and dependency status, instead of using actual EFCs, to simplify the process. This methodology was adopted to reduce administrative burden and assumes students with similar incomes will have similar EFCs. ED calculates average EFCs for students categorized for fair-share formulas. Institutions have flexibility to transfer funds between campus-based programs, with limits on transfers between programs. Work Colleges may transfer up to 100% of their Perkins Loan FCC or FWS allocation. Institutions participating in campus-based programs can transfer funds between programs, with Work Colleges able to transfer up to 100% of their Perkins Loan FCC or FWS allocation. Institutions are entitled to an administrative cost allowance (ACA) for program administration, calculated based on a percentage of campus-based expenditures. The ACA can be withdrawn from the institution's annual authorization for FSEOG and FWS programs or from available cash in Perkins Loan funds. In AY2016-2017, 6,733 postsecondary institutions in the US participated in Title IV programs. Approximately 56% awarded FSEOG aid, 49% employed students in FWS, and 21% made Perkins Loans. Participation in campus-based programs declined from AY2007-2008 to AY2015-2016. These data are relevant for Congress to consider reauthorizing or amending the programs. In AY2016-2017, there was an increase in participation in the FSEOG and FWS programs among U.S. Title IV institutions. Nearly 12 million students received aid through Title IV federal student aid programs in FY2015. Campus-based aid recipients make up a small portion of federal student aid recipients. Approximately 1.5 million students received aid through the FSEOG program, 635,000 through the FWS program, and 422,000 through a Perkins Loan in AY2015-2016. The analysis of campus-based aid recipients' characteristics and the impact of aid on covering higher education costs is based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study for AY2011-2012. The analysis focuses on undergraduate students in AY2011-2012, exploring factors affecting aid received. 10% received campus-based aid, while 57% received federal student aid. Private nonprofit institution students were more likely to receive campus-based aid. In AY2011-2012, students attending private nonprofit institutions were more likely to receive campus-based aid compared to students at other types of schools. Dependent students with incomes under $20,000 received FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loans. Students at institutions with high costs of attendance were more likely to receive campus-based awards. The average award amounts for FSEOG, FWS, and Perkins Loans were $541, $2,213, and $1,824 respectively. The average award amount for all campus-based programs was $1,676. In AY2011-2012, the average award amount across campus-based programs was $1,676, covering less than 10% of the COA for recipients. Exceptions included FWS awards covering 22% for students at public two-year institutions and 16% for independent students with incomes between $20,000 and $40,000. There is a growing interest in reforming federal student financial aid programs for better service. The discussion around redesigning federal student aid programs includes simplifying aid programs, increasing transparency in awarding aid, targeting aid to students with high financial need, and linking aid eligibility to program quality. The President's FY2018 budget proposes eliminating the FSEOG program, winding down the Perkins Loan program, and reducing funding for the FWS program. Congress may debate the purpose and effectiveness of campus-based programs during HEA reauthorization. When the campus-based programs were created, they aimed to provide financial aid to students with demonstrated need for postsecondary education costs. However, they now operate alongside other federal aid programs that offer portable aid, allowing students to choose among participating institutions. Campus-based programs differ in that they do not have statutorily specified methods for determining aid levels. Some proposals suggest eliminating campus-based federal student aid programs like FSEOG and Perkins Loan due to potential overlap with other aid programs. IHEs have discretion in awarding aid under campus-based programs, leading to debates on the efficiency of maintaining these programs. The FSEOG program serves a student population similar to that of the Pell Grant program, with 99% of FSEOG recipients also receiving a Pell Grant. Similar arguments can be made for the Perkins Loan program, as there are other federal loan programs with similar terms. For example, the interest rate on Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans is lower than that of Perkins Loans. Some proposals suggest streamlining federal student aid programs by eliminating the FSEOG and Perkins Loan programs to simplify the system and reduce administrative work. This could potentially benefit students by providing more transparency and efficiency in loan servicing. The FSEOG and Perkins Loan programs could be eliminated to simplify federal aid programs, potentially benefiting students and reducing administrative burden. Policy questions include the impact on individual student aid amounts and potential budgetary savings. Supporters argue that campus-based programs have unique qualities despite similarities to other federal aid programs. The campus-based programs require institutions to provide a partial match of federal funds, increasing aid available to students. Institutions face financial risk with Perkins Loans due to capital contributions. Eliminating these programs could reduce student aid and access. If campus-based programs were eliminated, institutions might lose flexibility in awarding aid to meet students' needs. Financial aid administrators play a crucial role in determining aid distribution, but statutory targeting procedures ensure consistency and alignment with congressional priorities. The campus-based aid approach has limitations such as lack of aid portability and limited availability of funds. The amount of aid available to students depends on the institution they attend and funding received based on a formula established decades ago. Institutions have discretion in awarding aid, which is different from other federal aid programs like the Pell Grant. Campus-based aid programs differ from portable federal aid programs like the Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs. While Pell Grants and Direct Loans operate as entitlement programs with set award rules, campus-based aid is heavily dependent on institutional discretion and appropriations. The campus-based aid programs are heavily dependent on institutional discretion and appropriations. One issue during HEA reauthorization is the allocation formula for funds, which is criticized for not considering current student demographics and need, leading to funds not being distributed based on student need. Some argue that current allocation procedures for campus-based aid favor long-term participants over new ones, as funds are initially allocated based on institutional history. Concerns exist that aid may not effectively target low-income students due to the use of cost of attendance in need calculations, leading to higher need levels for high-cost institutions. Additionally, the methodology for determining Expected Family Contribution has not kept up with inflation, potentially inaccurately reflecting individual student EFC. Some proposals aim to change the formula for allocating campus-based funds to better reflect current student demographics and financial need. Recommendations include eliminating the base guarantee, adjusting income bands for EFC, and prioritizing funds for institutions with positive student outcomes or high numbers of low-income students. The reauthorization of campus-based programs may involve targeting funds based on outcome metrics like graduation rates and limiting student eligibility to undergraduates. One consideration is improving the targeting of FSEOG funds to low-income students. Financial aid administrators are required to prioritize Pell Grant recipients for FSEOG awards. Congress could consider amending FSEOG award rules to specify targeting preferences for funds and address issues related to the FWS program, such as the requirement for community service and waivers. Congress could consider altering or eliminating the community service requirement for the FWS program and redefining what types of employment constitute community service. Additionally, there is a need to ensure that FWS employment aligns with students' career or education goals as required by HEA Section 443. Currently, there is a lack of ongoing evaluation of the FWS program, with the last national study completed in 2000. Only 27% of institutions were able to report the extent to which FWS jobs related to a student's academic program, with an average of 51% of FWS students working in academically related jobs. The 2000 FWS study found that less than 10% of students felt their job negatively impacted academic performance. Recent research on FWS effects on academics has mixed results, with methodological limitations. Ongoing evaluation could help policymakers understand FWS support for students' career interests and identify adverse effects on academic performance. Perkins Loans authorization for IHEs expired in 2017. The authorization for IHEs to make new Perkins Loans expired on September 30, 2017. Congress may consider extending the program or incorporating its features into other federal student loan programs. Institutions must distribute Perkins Loan funds and return the federal share to the Secretary. During the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program, institutions have the option to assign loans to ED or continue servicing them. If an institution assigns loans to ED, it forfeits all rights to the loan without reimbursement. Institutions can no longer use Perkins Loan funds for administrative costs. During the wind-down of the Perkins Loan program, institutions will no longer be allowed to charge administrative costs against their funds. This may lead some institutions to assign loans to the Department of Education (ED) and forgo future payments. Additionally, there is a concern about reimbursement for Perkins Loan cancellations, as current law requires ED to reimburse institutions but no appropriations have been provided since FY2009. The FCC will cover cancellation reimbursements for IHEs, but unreimbursed cancellations won't be considered. It's uncertain if Congress will authorize funds for Perkins Loan cancellations. Under the Extension Act, new loans are prohibited after September 30, 2017. Eligible students can receive Perkins Loan disbursements until June 30, 2018. Once final disbursements are made, undergraduates will lose access to aid under the Perkins Loan program. Direct Subsidized Loans have similar terms but have loan limits that prevent students from accessing aid. Access to Perkins Loans provides additional borrowing capacity for students to cover their COA. Without Perkins Loans, it is uncertain if students can access other forms of aid to cover the same expenses. Congress may need to address the issue of providing additional borrowing capacity during reauthorization, possibly by extending the Perkins Loan program. Extending IHEs' authority to make awards to undergraduate students could also be considered. Extending IHEs' authority to make awards to undergraduate students could enable borrowing additional loans to cover COA. Cost implications and offsets for extension are unclear. Some suggest creating a new Federal Direct Perkins Loan program managed by ED, with IHEs having lending authority. The proposal suggests retaining the current interest rate and borrowing limits of Perkins Loans, while aligning the terms and conditions with Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The program aims to maintain Perkins Loan features, encourage lower tuition, and reward IHEs for graduating Pell Grant recipients."
