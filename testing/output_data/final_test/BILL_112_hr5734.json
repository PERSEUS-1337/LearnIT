Congress finds that Pakistan, through the ISI, maintains control in Afghanistan via militant networks like the Haqqani Network to expand its influence in the region, including Kashmir and against India. A 2011 report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point highlights Pakistan's historical support for the Haqqani network, which has had a significant impact on Pakistan's security and the jihad in Kashmir. Pakistan, through the ISI, has long supported the Haqqani Network, which has been involved in various attacks in Afghanistan, including on the United States Embassy and NATO Headquarters in 2011. This support has allowed Pakistan to maintain control in Afghanistan and expand its influence in the region, including Kashmir and against India. Attacks in Afghanistan include: Kabul Bank in 2011, US-funded road projects, Forward Operating Bases Chapman and Salerno, Khost Governor's office, Afghan Ministries, Germany Embassy, and Afghan Intelligence Headquarters. In December 2008, journalist David Rohde was kidnapped in Khost. Other incidents in 2008 include the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul, an assassination attempt on Hamid Karzai, the kidnapping of British journalist Sean Langan, an attack on Sabari district center in Khost, and an attack on Kabul Serena Hotel. On September 17, 2011, the Voice of America reported suspicions of Pakistan's intelligence agency having ties to militant groups in Afghanistan, including the Haqqani network. NATO blames the Haqqani network for attacks on U.S. and NATO troops, including the 2011 strike on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, stated that the Haqqani network, with ISI support, was behind various attacks in Kabul. Mullen also mentioned that the Haqqani network acts as an arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. The ISI has a longstanding relationship with the Haqqani network, which is responsible for attacks on Kabul and other cities. The United States Ambassador to Afghanistan called for Pakistan to do more to stop the group's activities. Miram Shah in North Waziristan, Pakistan is where they are made, not in Afghanistan. The United States will limit foreign assistance to Pakistan if its military or intelligence services support organizations targeting US citizens. The United States will withhold $50,000,000 for each US citizen killed by Pakistan's ISI or its support to other groups. The Secretary of Defense must monthly certify the number of US citizens killed for this reason. The withheld funds will be administered by the Department of Defense to provide payments to the survivors of these US citizens. The Department of Defense will provide payments to survivors of US citizens killed by Pakistan's ISI or its support to other groups."
