It includes public transportation corridors, intercity transportation systems, major bus and rail corridors, the National Highway System, and airports. The National Transportation System includes the National Highway System, airports, ports, inland waterways, passenger terminals, ferry systems, and other major intermodal transportation facilities. The Secretary must designate the National Transportation System within 2 years of enactment, based on submissions and subject to modification by Congress or law. The Secretary designates the National Transportation System based on submissions from States and metropolitan planning organizations. Proposed new routes or facilities cannot be included in nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide until they are in conformity with State implementation plans under the Clean Air Act. The National Highway System must be included in a metropolitan or State long-range plan and transportation improvement program that complies with the Clean Air Act before becoming part of the National Transportation System. States or metropolitan planning organizations can request changes to the National Transportation System components, which the Secretary must review every two years. The Secretary can make grants to cover 80% of costs for processes and procedures that support the National Transportation System's goals, such as operating agreements, public-private partnerships, traveler information systems, and intelligent vehicle highway and transit systems. SEC. 2. METROPOLITAN PLANNING. Amends Section 134(g)(2)(A) of title 23, United States Code to include airport, port, inland waterway, and railroad in the transportation system. The system serves as the National Transportation System in the metropolitan area unless the Secretary determines otherwise. SEC. 3. STATEWIDE PLANNING. \"The plan shall identify transportation facilities that should function as an integrated State transportation system, emphasizing those serving important national and regional functions. The system will serve as the National Transportation System in the State, unless the Secretary decides otherwise.\" Section 104(c) of title 23, United States Code, is amended to set aside funds for grants under section 103(j)(4) and for intermodal connections to the National Highway System. Each State is required to allocate 10 percent of their apportionment for this purpose. The State can allocate funds for intermodal connections to the National Highway System and other components of the National Transportation System. No funds can be used for projects adding new capacity for single-occupant vehicles, except for reducing their use. States can transfer up to 50% of their apportionment to another state under certain conditions. The State can transfer up to 90 percent of its apportionment to urbanized areas over 50,000 population with approval from the Secretary. At least 75 percent of the remaining funds must be obligated in urbanized areas after a set-aside.

Additionally, a special rule applies for rural areas where funds must be obligated in areas other than urban areas with a population greater than 5,000. The State must allocate funds to urbanized areas with a population over 50,000, with a special rule for rural areas to prioritize areas with a population greater than 5,000.
