The global proliferation of MANPADS and conventional weapons poses a direct threat to US national security, hindering peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over two dozen terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, are known to possess MANPADS. A failed al-Qaeda attack in 2002 in Kenya involved two shoulder-fired missiles aimed at a civilian airliner. A successful attack with such a missile would have severe human and economic consequences. The Government Accountability Office estimates that there are 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide, with many vulnerable to theft due to inadequate security. Countries with surplus weapons lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The Government Accountability Office estimates 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide, many vulnerable to theft due to inadequate security. Countries with surplus weapons lack means to eliminate or secure them. Sense of Congress. The sense of Congress is that the US should assist countries in securing and eliminating stocks of MANPADS and other weapons that pose a proliferation threat. The Secretary of State should negotiate with host countries to offer assistance in this regard. The US Government should prioritize combating the illegal trade in conventional weapons due to its links to global terrorism networks. The United States has a consistent focus on combating the proliferation of MANPADS and conventional weapons as part of its nonproliferation strategy. The United States aims to assist other countries in securing and eliminating stocks of MANPADS and conventional weapons that pose proliferation, security, or humanitarian threats. This is part of a global program for safeguarding and eliminating these weapons. The Secretary of State is authorized to carry out a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate MANPADS and conventional weapons that pose proliferation, security, or humanitarian threats. This program may include assisting countries in safe handling and storage of these weapons, as well as cooperative programs with international organizations. The Secretary of State is authorized to carry out a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate MANPADS and conventional weapons that pose proliferation, security, or humanitarian threats. This includes assisting countries in safe handling and storage of these weapons, as well as ensuring proper management, inventory, and accounting procedures at locations where United States funds have been used for security purposes. Actions are also taken to ensure that equipment and funds continue to be used for authorized purposes, including security upgrades at locations for the storage, removal, or elimination of these weapons. SEC. 7. Imposition of sanctions to deter the transfer of MANPADS. Congress declares the policy of the United States to hold foreign governments accountable for knowingly transferring MANPADS to state-sponsors of terrorism or terrorist organizations. If the President determines such transfers, sanctions will be imposed on the transferring foreign government. The United States will impose sanctions on foreign governments that have repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including termination of government assistance under certain acts. The United States will impose sanctions on foreign governments that support acts of international terrorism, including termination of defense sales, licenses, and foreign military financing. Sanctions may be waived if the President certifies to Congress that providing assistance is necessary. The furnishing of assistance, sales, licensing, or financing that would otherwise be suspended due to sanctions is crucial for US national security interests. Definitions for terms like defense article, defense service, and design and construction services are provided in this section. The term \"foreign government\" includes any agency or instrumentality of a foreign government. The United States Government is working in multilateral forums to limit the availability and transfer of MANPADS worldwide. However, there is a lack of mechanisms to assess member countries' compliance with these commitments. Congress believes that diplomatic efforts should be strengthened to reduce the threat of MANPADS and conventional weapons proliferation. The Secretary of State must submit a report to congressional committees on MANPADS and conventional weapons threat reduction efforts, including a country-by-country implementation of a global strategy. The report to congressional committees outlines the global strategy for storage, removal, and elimination of MANPADS and conventional weapons, prioritizing efforts based on proliferation sensitivity and local security impact. It also includes multilateral efforts to limit availability and transfer of MANPADS, with a strategy to monitor countries' commitments and their impact. The report required by congressional committees evaluates the access of terrorists and state sponsors to MANPADS, methods of acquisition, and strategies to disrupt future access. It also assesses the integration of US conventional weapons threat reduction efforts with policy goals in recipient countries. The report is unclassified but may contain a classified annex. Authorization of appropriations for activities related to securing, removal, or elimination of MANPADS and conventional weapons. $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2008. Amounts authorized to be made available regardless of other laws and remain available until expended."
