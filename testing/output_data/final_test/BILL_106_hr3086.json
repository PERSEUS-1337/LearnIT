Congress finds that American taxpayers should receive equal Medicare services regardless of residence. Medicare managed care plans are crucial for seniors' health, providing coordinated care and access to medications. The loss of these plans can be devastating, as hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries have been dropped in recent years. In 1999, Medicare managed care plan withdrawals affected nearly 407,000 beneficiaries, leaving 51,276 with no other option. Starting January 2000, 327,000 enrollees will need alternative coverage, with 79,000 having no other plan available. Beneficiaries can switch to Medicare fee-for-service, but it lacks comprehensive outpatient pharmaceutical coverage. Managed care plans vary in costs and benefits for beneficiaries. A growing body of data shows significant variations in medical practice and Medicare spending across hospital regions, with little evidence that higher spending leads to better health outcomes. Adjusting Medicare reimbursement rates based on factors like age and severity of illness can promote more equitable and efficient healthcare for the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, encouraging cost-effective medical practices.

MEDICARE CLINICAL PRACTICE AND PAYMENT PATTERN ADJUSTMENT.
