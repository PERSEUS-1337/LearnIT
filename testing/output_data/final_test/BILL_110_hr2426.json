    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ethanol Infrastructure Expansion Act of 2007\". Congress finds that it is in the national interest to increase ethanol use in transportation fuels due to its clean, renewable nature, economic benefits to agricultural and biofuels producers, and its positive impact on national security by reducing reliance on imported petroleum. Ethanol can also help lower fuel prices for consumers by extending fuel supplies. Ethanol faces shipping challenges in pipelines that transport other liquid transportation fuels. Additional research and development can provide solutions to overcome these barriers. Currently, ethanol is shipped by rail tanker cars, barges, and trucks, which may encounter capacity limits as ethanol production expands. There is a need to evaluate the feasibility of new construction of dedicated ethanol pipelines to transport ethanol from the Midwest to the Eastern and Western United States. The Act highlights the absence of dedicated ethanol pipelines in the US, the importance of addressing technical barriers for ethanol transportation in existing pipelines, and the need for a study on ethanol pipeline construction due to the lengthy timeline for completion. The Act defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy and includes provisions for feasibility studies. The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation, will allocate up to $1,000,000 for feasibility studies on dedicated ethanol pipelines. The studies will be conducted through a competitive process with firms experienced in pipeline planning and construction. Funding will be awarded promptly if firms are selected. The Secretary will award funding for feasibility studies on dedicated ethanol pipelines within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Recipients must submit a feasibility study within 360 days. Studies will consider barriers to ethanol pipelines and potential development pathways. The feasibility studies for dedicated ethanol pipelines will address market risks, regulatory options, financial incentives, production quantities, technical factors, and safety measures for transportation. The Secretary will review feasibility studies for ethanol pipelines and submit a report to Congress within 15 months of the Act's enactment. Recipients of funding can request confidentiality for sensitive information, and the Secretary may enter into a confidentiality agreement to protect it. The Secretary will provide information on the benefits of dedicated ethanol pipelines and recommendations for legislation to support their construction. SEC. 5. EXISTING PIPELINE TECHNICAL AND SAFETY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary will spend up to $1,000,000 on research to enable the transportation of ethanol and biodiesel in hazardous liquid pipelines. This includes selecting firms with pipeline expertise to carry out the program. The program funded by the Secretary aims to research stress corrosion cracking prevention in pipelines and ensure product quality assurance. Funding must be awarded within 120 days of the Act's enactment, and recipients must submit findings within 360 days. The Secretary's program aims to research stress corrosion cracking prevention and product quality assurance in pipeline transportation of ethanol and biodiesel. Recipients of funding can request confidentiality for sensitive information in their reports. The Secretary must review and submit a report to Congress within 15 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing the benefits of modifying hazardous liquid pipelines for ethanol and biodiesel transportation, along with recommendations for necessary legislation. SEC. 6. FUNDING. $1,000,000 each for fiscal year 2008 authorized to the Secretary for sections 4 and 5 of the Act."
