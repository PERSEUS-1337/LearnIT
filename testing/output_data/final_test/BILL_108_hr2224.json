    "content": "The Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's violations of the Third Geneva Convention in mistreating US prisoners of war during the First Gulf War. Despite these resolutions, Iraq continued to abuse prisoners. The United States District Court took historic action against Iraq, the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and Saddam Hussein for torturing prisoners of war during the First Gulf War. Default judgment was entered against the defendants in 2002, and detailed evidence of brutal torture was submitted in 2003. Sworn affidavits revealed shocking brutality against US prisoners of war by Iraq. The Congress enacted section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code, allowing suits against terrorist states for torture. Iraq had $1.73 billion in blocked assets in the US at the start of the Second Gulf War, vested for Iraq's reconstruction by Executive Order 13290. Approximately $300,000,000 of blocked assets were initially set aside for civil judgments obtained by US hostages in Iraq during the First Gulf War. Plaintiffs in a case against Saddam Hussein and Iraq, who were US prisoners of war, have established a nonprofit Foundation to assist prisoners of war and missing in action personnel and their families. They have pledged a substantial amount of any noncompensatory damages for this cause. The Republic of Iraq has significant national wealth with proven oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia. Other nations have not absolved Iraq of its state obligations under the Third Geneva Convention, including the treatment of US prisoners of war during the First Gulf War. Iraq has not accounted for one US prisoner of war held during the conflict. During the Second Gulf War, Iraq violated the Third Geneva Convention by using coerced propaganda on US prisoners of war. Reports also indicated mistreatment and killings of US prisoners by Iraq, leading to strong condemnation in Senate and House resolutions. The US has a critical interest in protecting its prisoners of war and ensuring compliance with the Geneva Convention. Immediate action is needed to safeguard US prisoners of war. The United States policy is to search for and prosecute individuals who have committed grave breaches of the Third Geneva Convention against US prisoners of war. This includes acts like willful killing, torture, and inhumane treatment. The policy will be vigorously implemented towards those who mistreated US prisoners during the First and Second Gulf Wars, including Iraqi Government officials. The United States policy is to hold countries accountable for grave breaches against US prisoners of war, such as willful killing and torture, in accordance with the Third Geneva Convention. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay judgments from blocked funds of Iraq for Civil Action No. 02-0632. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of United States prisoners of war and their families in a case against Iraq, the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and Saddam Hussein for torturing prisoners during the First Gulf War. The United States will be reimbursed by Iraq for any payments made in this case. SEC. 5. POLICY WITH RESPECT TO PRISONERS OF WAR IN SECOND GULF WAR.\n\n     If it becomes evident that US prisoners of war were killed, tortured, or mistreated during the Second Gulf War, or the unaccounted for US prisoner of war from the First Gulf War was harmed by Iraq, the US will support their claims against Iraq for resolution based on the same policy as in section 4.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITION.\n\n     The term \"Third Geneva Convention\" in this Act refers to the Geneva Convention of 1949 regarding the Treatment of Prisoners of War."
