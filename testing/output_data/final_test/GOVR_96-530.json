The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 and the STOCK Act of 2012 also impact Members of Congress' pensions for criminal conduct while in office. Congress enacted legislation in 1954 to prohibit federal retirement annuities for federal officers and employees, including Members of Congress, convicted of offenses related to disloyalty, national defense, conflicts of interest, bribery, or abuse of authority. The law, known as the \"Hiss Act,\" was prompted by the case of Alger Hiss. In 1961, Congress amended the statute to focus on more serious offenses of disloyalty and national security. The 1954 legislation, known as the \"Hiss Act,\" prohibited federal retirement annuities for federal officials convicted of offenses related to disloyalty, national defense, and other serious crimes. Congress later amended the law in 1961 to focus on more serious offenses, withdrawing coverage for minor violations. This change aimed to prevent undue punishment for former officials and their families, ensuring that those convicted of espionage or treason forfeit their retirement benefits. The \"Hiss Act\" prohibits federal retirement annuities for officials convicted of offenses related to disloyalty, national defense, and serious crimes. This includes disclosure of classified information, espionage, sabotage, treason, misprision of treason, rebellion, seditious conspiracy, harboring or concealing persons, gathering or transmitting defense information, perjury, and other offenses related to secrets and national security. The curr_chunk discusses various offenses related to espionage, sabotage, treason, rebellion, seditious conspiracy, and activities affecting the armed forces, as outlined in different chapters and sections of title 18 and the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The curr_chunk discusses offenses related to espionage, sabotage, treason, rebellion, and activities affecting the armed forces under various statutes, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The curr_chunk discusses perjury committed under federal statutes, including falsely denying offenses related to espionage, sabotage, treason, and activities affecting national security or defense. The curr_chunk outlines offenses related to perjury committed in connection with activities endangering national security or defense, including false testimony before congressional committees. The curr_chunk discusses offenses related to national security, including intent to injure the United States or benefit a foreign nation, communication of restricted data, and conspiracy involving classified information. These offenses may result in severe penalties under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Hiss Act specifies offenses that can result in the loss of federal pension for executive officials, Members of Congress, or employees, regardless of resignation or impeachment. Expulsion from Congress or impeachment of a federal executive officer does not impact pension loss. The Hiss Act specifies offenses that can lead to the loss of a federal pension for certain officials, regardless of resignation or impeachment. Current law allows for the denial of pension benefits to those convicted of disloyalty and national security offenses, but individuals can receive back their own contributions upon proper application. The Hiss Act provisions allow for the forfeiture of annuities for employees convicted of covered offenses, including the loss of government contributions and earnings in the Thrift Savings Plan under current law. Under the Hiss Act provisions, individuals convicted of covered offenses can forfeit their annuity and lose government contributions and earnings in the Thrift Savings Plan. However, spouses may be eligible for spousal pension benefits if they fully cooperate with federal authorities in a criminal investigation. The spouse cooperated with Federal authorities in a criminal investigation leading to forfeiture. Legislation aims to prevent Members of Congress from receiving annuity payments after convictions for abusing their position. The government proposed legislation to expand the list of criminal offenses that would result in the loss of federal pensions for convicted individuals. This included crimes related to public corruption, false statements, fraud, conspiracy, bribery, and illegal gratuities. The pension forfeiture provisions were initially part of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. The House of Representatives passed a bill on pension reform, disallowing credit for service time if a Member of Congress committed acts leading to a felony conviction. This approach was adopted in the final legislation signed into law. The STOCK Act amended pension forfeiture provisions for Members of Congress, adding federal criminal laws and expanding the time period for loss of creditable service for felony convictions. The STOCK Act expanded pension forfeiture provisions for Members of Congress, including loss of creditable service for felony convictions during their time in office. The STOCK Act expanded pension forfeiture provisions for Members of Congress, including loss of creditable service for felony convictions during their time in office. Any former Member of Congress convicted of certain criminal offenses related to their official duties will lose their federal pension annuity earned while in office. The changes made in 2007 and 2012 to pension laws for Members of Congress mean that felony convictions for specific offenses related to their official duties could result in the loss of federal pension annuity earned during their time in office. This is different from the Hiss Act, where conviction of national security offenses would lead to the loss of the entire federal annuity payment. The curr_chunk lists specific offenses under title 18 that could result in penalties for Members of Congress, including compensation, practice in federal courts, acting as agents of foreign principals, conspiracy to defraud the government, false claims, expenditures to influence voting, promise of appointment, and solicitation of political activities. The curr_chunk lists various offenses under title 18 that could lead to penalties for Members of Congress, including solicitation of political contributions, intimidation for contributions, theft or bribery involving Federal funds, frauds and swindles, and false statements. The curr_chunk lists offenses under title 18 that could lead to penalties for Members of Congress, including obstruction of proceedings, tampering with witnesses, and racketeering activities. Offenses under title 18 that could result in penalties for Members of Congress include racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations, tax evasion, foreign corrupt practices, securities fraud, commodity trading fraud, and conspiracy to commit various offenses. The curr_chunk discusses perjury and subornation of perjury under section 1621 and 1622 of title 18, relating to false denials of committing offenses. Under the HLOGA provisions, individuals convicted of corruption offenses may lose their contributions to the retirement system and Thrift Savings Plan. Members of Congress may also retain government contributions to their TSP accounts. This differs from the Hiss Act provisions, where government contributions are forfeited only under specific circumstances. Under the HLOGA provisions, individuals convicted of corruption offenses may lose their contributions to the retirement system and Thrift Savings Plan. Members of Congress may retain government contributions to their TSP accounts. The Hiss Act, which was not amended, does not require forfeiture of pensions. An exception can be made by the Office of Personnel Management to provide annuity payments to spouses or children in certain cases of hardship. Changes in pension provisions for Members of Congress due to official misconduct may result in loss of government pensions for convicted individuals. However, legislation cannot retroactively cut off or reduce annuities as a penalty for past criminal behavior. The HLOGA and STOCK Act increase penalties for specific crimes, potentially leading to the loss of federal annuities. Any legislation that retroactively increases penalties for past actions raises constitutional concerns regarding ex post facto laws. The Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws, which make an action criminal after it was committed. Chief Justice Marshall defined ex post facto laws as those that punish an act in a way not punishable when committed. While Congress cannot increase penalties for past actions, certain regulatory legislation may affect rights without being punitive. The lower federal court in the Alger Hiss case found that the Hiss Act, if applied retroactively to deny Alger Hiss his pension, was punitive and not regulatory, violating the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto laws. The application of a provision to deny a pension to a Member of Congress for a felony under federal law could only be prospective, as retroactive application would violate the Constitution's ex post facto clause. Questions have been raised about potential contract issues regarding changes in annuity provisions for convicted Members of Congress. Judicial precedents indicate that future annuity payments do not create a current property right, but rather an \"expectancy\" that can be modified by the government through legislation. Federal courts have ruled that pension rights can be revised or revoked by subsequent laws. The Hiss Act allows for forfeiture of federal annuity payments for certain crimes, even those accrued before the crime was committed. This is similar to the loss of creditable service under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 includes pension forfeiture provisions that took effect in September 2007 for crimes committed after that date. The 27th Amendment to the United States Constitution does not require a delayed effective date for these provisions. The 27th Amendment does not require a delayed effective date for pension forfeiture provisions under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. The provision allows for changes in compensation for Members of Congress, but the law would not take effect until after the next election. This could impact retired Members seeking to protect their pension annuities. The 27th Amendment may not apply to changes in pension laws for former Members of Congress, as it specifically pertains to compensation for current Senators and Representatives. The intent behind the amendment was to prevent current Members from increasing their own salaries, suggesting it may not cover future annuities or pensions for retired Members. The 27th Amendment does not cover congressional pensions for former Members of Congress, as it focuses on compensation for current Senators and Representatives. The amendment aims to prevent current Members from raising their own salaries, indicating it may not extend to future retirement benefits for retired Members. The 27th Amendment has made the issue irrelevant for HLOGA since the end of the 110th Congress and will do the same for the STOCK Act amendments after the end of the 112th Congress."
