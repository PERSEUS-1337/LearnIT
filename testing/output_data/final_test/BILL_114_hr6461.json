The Secretary of Transportation may award grants to States for school bus seat belt programs to purchase or equip type 1 school buses with lap/shoulder seat belts. States must submit an application with specific assurances, including compliance with certain regulations and a list of selected educational agencies to receive the seat belt equipped buses. The State selects agencies to receive school buses with seat belts, requiring local educational agencies to develop plans for seat belt usage and safety education. Grants must be sufficient for program requirements, funded using specific sources. The term \"type 1 school bus\" refers to a school bus weighing over 10,000 pounds. Within a year of this Act's enactment, the State must report to the Secretary on the effectiveness of the lap/shoulder seat belt program in local educational agencies, including student seat belt usage and impact on school bus seating capacity.

The motion-activated detection system on school buses alerts the driver when a moving target is detected near the bus."
