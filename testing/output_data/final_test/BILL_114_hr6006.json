During the 21-year civil war in Sudan, many people fled their homes, including at least 20,000 orphaned children aged 5 to 17. These children faced attacks from various threats and many died from starvation or thirst during their flight. During the civil war in Sudan, 20,000 orphaned children aged 5 to 17 fled to a refugee camp in Ethiopia. They were later forced to leave and cross the Gilo River, where at least 1,000 children drowned or were eaten by crocodiles. The United Nations determined repatriation was not an option, and 3,800 children were resettled in the United States with assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services. These children, known as the \"Lost Boys,\" faced numerous challenges during their journey. The \"Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan\" have gained a reputation for resilience and motivation, with many finding employment and pursuing higher education in the United States. Despite the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, they express interest in returning to contribute to reconstruction efforts. The \"Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan\" in the United States express interest in returning to South Sudan to assist in rebuilding the country's infrastructure. SEC. 3.
