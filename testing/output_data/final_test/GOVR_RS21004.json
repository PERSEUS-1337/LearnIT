    "content": "The fast-track process allows expedited congressional consideration of trade agreements, granting the President authority to negotiate tariff and non-tariff barriers with other countries. Congress must consider implementing bills within set deadlines, with limited debate and no amendments, if the President meets specified requirements. This authority originated from the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and was expanded by the Trade Act of 1974 to include nontariff barriers, requiring increased reporting and consultations between Congress and the President during negotiations. In the years following the expiration of fast-track authority in 1994, there were several legislative proposals to reauthorize trade authority procedures. In the 107th Congress, the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act passed by one vote on December 6, 2001. Another bill, H.R. 3009, was amended in both the House and Senate before being signed into law as P.L. 107-210. The President signed H.R. 3009, known as the Trade Act of 2002, on August 6, 2002. This legislation included Trade Promotion Authority provisions and applied to trade agreements before July 1, 2007. Despite TPA expiring in 2007, four U.S. free trade agreements were signed under its procedures in the 110th Congress with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was passed in 2007, and implementing legislation for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement was introduced in the same Congress. In the 111th Congress, no legislation for the proposed U.S. trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea was introduced. The fate of these agreements is uncertain in the 112th Congress. More information on congressional and executive procedures for trade agreements can be found in the \"Resources for Additional Information\" section at the end of this report. The Trade Act of 1974 is one of many trade provisions, including the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and the Trade Act of 2002. Fast-track legislative procedures have been used by Congress to approve reciprocal bilateral and multilateral trade agreements since 1979. Several free trade agreements were signed into law, including the U.S.-Singapore, U.S.-Australia, U.S.-Morocco, CAFTA-DR, U.S.-Bahrain, and U.S.-Oman agreements. In 2006, the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act was signed into law. Despite the expiration of TPA in 2007, FTAs with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea were signed in time for consideration by Congress. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act was passed in 2007, while the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement did not see further legislative action in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, no further legislative action on H.R. 5724 occurred. In the 111th Congress, no implementing legislation for proposed FTAs with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama was introduced. The fate of these proposed FTAs in the 112th Congress is uncertain.
