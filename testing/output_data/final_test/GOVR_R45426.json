    "content": "The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) aims to improve outcomes for vulnerable expectant or new parents and their children. Administered by the Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) in the Department of Health and Human Services, PAF was established by the ACA with $25 million in annual funding for 10 years. Grantees can use the funds to provide pregnancy or parenting services through subgrants to institutions of higher education, high schools, or community service providers. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) provides funding for pregnancy and parenting services for vulnerable individuals, including those experiencing domestic violence or sexual assault. HHS has awarded PAF funding to 30 states, DC, and 5 tribal entities, with grantees using the funds for case management, referrals, workshops, and home visiting services. The report provides background on the Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) program, discussing its history, challenges faced by vulnerable expectant and new parents, program requirements, data on participants and services provided in FY2016, and findings from an early evaluation. It also examines the role of PAF in relation to other federal programs and offers considerations for Congress on extending program funding beyond FY2019. The PAF program was established under Section 10212 of the ACA to support pregnant and parenting teens and women. The legislative language for PAF was included in an amendment to H.R. 3590, agreed to by the Senate in December 2009. It aimed to provide support for pregnant youth and women considering abortion. Senator Casey played a key role in introducing the PAF provision. The PAF program, established under the ACA, supports pregnant and parenting teens and women to reduce the number of abortions. It focuses on meeting the needs of vulnerable expectant and parenting individuals, including teens, college students, and those experiencing domestic violence. Teen pregnancy has high costs for families and society. Teen pregnancy has high costs for families and society. Teen parents have lower education levels, higher poverty rates, and children of teenage mothers face poorer outcomes. Teen births result in societal impacts like healthcare costs and lost tax revenue. Parenthood can affect postsecondary education pursuits, with single young mothers being more likely to drop out of college. PAF program supports pregnant and parenting teens and women, including those experiencing domestic violence. Research indicates that 3% to 9% of pregnant women experience domestic violence, with a higher risk among low-income women. Domestic violence is linked to increased sexual risk-taking and poor maternal health outcomes. Babies born to victimized women have higher chances of low birth weight and pre-term birth. The HHS found that state and tribal grantees used needs assessments to identify limited support for pregnant and parenting populations eligible for the PAF program. Grantees focused on avoiding service redundancy and building connections across agencies and providers. The HHS distributes PAF funding to fill gaps in services for vulnerable expectant and parenting individuals, enhance existing services, and improve coordination across agencies. Funding is awarded competitively to address vulnerabilities in these populations and their children. States, DC, territories, and tribal entities are eligible to apply for PAF funding. State grantees, including state public health departments, determine how to use PAF funding to serve expectant and parenting populations and their children through various purpose areas. Funding flows from the federal government to state grantees for this purpose. PAF funding flows from the federal government to state grantees, who then provide subgrants to high schools, community service centers, and IHEs to support pregnant and parenting teens/students and their children with education, social services, health, and public awareness activities. Each purpose area specifies certain activities, which are generally the same for high schools/community service centers and IHEs. The law defines \"high school\" as schools operating grades 7 through 12, \"community service centers\" as nonprofit organizations providing social services, and \"eligible institution of higher education\" as vocational schools or colleges. Institutions of higher education must establish an office for pregnant and parenting students. Subgrantees can conduct activities on campus and in the community, such as needs assessments and goal-setting for improving resources. The subgrantees can use funds to improve resources and access for pregnant and parenting students, including maternity coverage, child care, parenting education, and basic provisions. Institutions of higher education must provide a 25% match for grant awards, while high schools are not required to match funds. Subgrantees may also assist in locating services for prenatal care, delivery, infant care, or adoption. State grantees partner with offices of state attorneys general to provide intervention services, accompaniment services, and supportive social services targeted to individuals who are pregnant or have been pregnant in the past year and are victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Intervention services include 24-hour telephone hotline services for police protection and referral to shelters, while accompaniment services involve assisting women in seeking judicial relief for various issues. The term \"supportive social services\" includes transitional and permanent housing, vocational counseling, and counseling to prevent domestic violence, sexual violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Training and technical assistance are provided to specified entities, such as government agencies and nonprofit organizations. State grantees can fund public awareness activities for vulnerable expectant and parenting individuals. State grantees are responsible for setting guidelines on funding usage for public awareness activities, excluding information about abortion services. Requirements for state grantees and subgrantees are outlined in the PAF statute and grant announcements. Grantees must describe their approach for serving expectant and parenting populations, outline intended outcomes, and detail participant recruitment methods. State grantees must specify recruitment methods and service locations for participants. They do not need to identify subgrantees in the application but must outline selection criteria. Grantees must monitor subgrantees and partnerships to ensure coordination in serving expectant and parenting populations. Monitoring systems include management information systems, online platforms, referral forms, participant surveys, and intake forms. Subgrantees must provide annual expenditure reports to state grantees. The annual report to HHS by grantees includes a review of subgrantee performance in serving expectant and parenting individuals, their achievements, and the frequency of service utilization. Grantees are required to collect performance data from all sites and submit selected data to HHS every 12 months to improve program quality. The annual report to HHS by grantees includes data on the implementation of the grant, including the number of sites, individuals served, referrals provided, services for pregnant individuals, training, and partnerships. State grantees must also submit demographic information on participants, services, referrals, training, and partnerships. State grantees receiving PAF funding must submit quarterly financial reports and have oversight plans. They are directed to include funding amounts from various sources in their application. Grantees must detail available resources at program sites and explain how PAF-funded services will enhance existing services. Reporting on interactions with other payment sources is not required. State grantees receiving PAF funding must ensure that materials used are medically accurate and referenced to peer-reviewed publications. OAH has awarded funding to 30 states, DC, and five tribes across five rounds, with funding levels ranging from $380,000 to $1,500,000 annually. Grant periods have varied from 1 to 4 years. HHS has varied grant periods for PAF funding, ranging from 1 to 4 years. Cohort 3 grant period was shortened from 5 to 3 years. State grantees can fund multiple subgrantees and purposes but not solely for public awareness. In FY2016, 20 state and tribal grantees were supported, engaging in various activities like subgrants to schools, partnerships with attorney general's offices, and public awareness efforts. HHS collects data on expectant and parenting individuals and their children who receive PAF. In FY2016, 20 grantees served 16,053 expectant and parenting individuals. 55% were mothers, 37% were children, and 8% were fathers. Most participants were ages 16-19, with some under 15 and others 20-24 or 25+. Race data shows nearly half were white, one-third were black, and the rest were another race or multiracial. About 46% of participants reporting on ethnicity were Hispanic. In FY2016, most participants received services through high schools and community service providers. The majority were expectant or parenting mothers, followed by children and fathers. Nearly all high school seniors graduated, and over half were accepted into an IHE. Only a small percentage of high school participants dropped out. Additionally, 3,479 participants received services through IHEs, with most being children, followed by expectant or parenting mothers and fathers. The majority of parents were ages 20 or older. In FY2016, 666 participants received services related to domestic and sexual violence. Almost 71% were expectant or parenting mothers, and 28% were their children. HHS emphasized serving marginalized populations in certain grant cohorts, including youth involved in child welfare or juvenile justice, runaway and homeless youth, immigrants, individuals with disabilities, and LGBTQ youth. The fifth cohort funding announcement does not mention marginalized populations. PAF grantees should provide supports to young fathers only if they provide broader support to pregnant individuals. In FY2016, PAF participants received various services, with the majority receiving educational services, parenting skills training, and case management. Health care services were provided to one-third of participants. Some services were directly provided by grantees or subgrantees, while others were provided through referrals to organizations. In FY2016, state grantees provided services to PAF participants, including educational services, parenting skills training, and case management. Health care services were given to one-third of participants, with referrals made for other services like supportive social services, accompaniment services, and intervention services for domestic violence victims. State grantees also trained new facilitators and professionals on domestic or sexual violence against pregnant women. The PAF program in FY2016 provided services to pregnant women, including educational and parenting skills training, health care services, and referrals for other support services. State grantees worked with numerous formal and informal partners to support their programs. HHS contracted with Mathematica Policy Research to conduct a process and impact evaluation of the program's effectiveness in shaping youth outcomes, including outcomes related to subsequent pregnancy and sexual risk behaviors. The PAF program in FY2016 provided services to pregnant women, including educational and parenting skills training, health care services, and referrals for other support services. In DC, PAF-funded services were provided in nine high schools through a program called New Heights. Teen mothers in the program showed improvement in school engagement and credits earned per year compared to those who did not participate. The program included one-on-one case management, weekly educational workshops, and incentives for achieving personal goals. The PAF program in FY2016 provided services to pregnant women, including educational and parenting skills training, health care services, and referrals for other support services. PAF participants had fewer unexcused absences, attended more days of school, and had higher graduation rates. The program may overlap with other programs serving broader populations and can refer individuals to these programs. PAF grantees offer services to help expectant and parenting individuals complete their education, with over 3,000 participants receiving child care services in FY2016. The Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program (CCAMPIS) provides child care services to low-income parents in postsecondary settings. PAF grantees offer social services to improve self-sufficiency, parenting skills, and address domestic violence. Home visiting services are a common support provided by PAF grantees, as well as other federal programs like the MIECHV program. In FY2016, a home visiting program in Texas for teen mothers showed promise in reducing repeat pregnancies. PAF grantees can provide adoption referrals and funding for infant adoption awareness training. Federal laws like FVPSA and VAWA support victims of domestic violence, reaching a broader population than PAF. Various federal programs offer health care services to wider populations. The Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant Program and Medicaid provide health care services to mothers, children, and low-income populations. Congress may consider reauthorizing the PAF program based on impact evaluations showing positive outcomes for pregnant and parenting students in the District of Columbia. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) program aims to inform policymakers about its effectiveness and the role it plays in supporting participants. Grantees are required to provide evidence-informed or evidence-based services, with most using models for home visiting and parenting education. However, some grantees face challenges in finding programming tailored to expectant and parenting populations. One potential reauthorization question is whether the PAF statute should have more specific parameters for program implementation. The law requires grantees of the Pregnancy Assistance Fund program to submit reports to HHS on subgrantee expenditures and performance. There is a lack of guidance on how subgrantees should be monitored and whether specific performance outcomes need to be met. Congress may need to consider providing more explicit guidance on oversight and establishing uniform definitions of service categories for the program. Congress may need to consider establishing guidelines for how the Pregnancy Assistance Fund program should interact with other federal programs. Grantees have reported using assessments from other programs and leveraging public and private supports to enhance their PAF programming. Congress might also explore requiring more formal linkages with similar federal programs to avoid duplication and improve coordination. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund program may need guidelines for coordinating with other federal programs and reporting on funds. Congress may want to know if PAF has helped grantees sustain support for participants after funding ends. Former grantees have diversified funding sources and formed partnerships to continue services."
