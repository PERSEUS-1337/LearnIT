    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges the underutilization of research in education policy compared to other sectors, with minimal funding allocated for research on effective educational techniques. The 1997 PCAST report recommended increasing research investment in education to 0.5 percent for rigorous evaluation of educational hypotheses. A significant body of research exists on the science of learning, but educational materials and practices are often not aligned with this knowledge. There is a cultural divide between education researchers and practitioners, with a recommendation for more research focused on issues important to practitioners. The current education research effort lacks coordination and is in need of more rigorous evaluation. The current education research effort lacks coordination and focus on important questions, as recommended by a 1999 report from the National Research Council. The National Science Foundation will support research on learning in various areas, including brain research, behavioral aspects, STEM learning, and complex educational systems. $29 million, $33 million, and $37 million are authorized for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively. Research on learning centers will be supported by the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation will establish up to 5 Centers of Research on Learning to integrate multidisciplinary teams for education research priorities developed in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences. The Centers of Research on Learning, established by the National Science Foundation, will focus on specific education research priorities. They will promote collaborations among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to conduct and synthesize research in relevant areas. Grant awards will be given through a peer-reviewed competition. The National Science Foundation will establish Centers of Research on Learning to focus on education research priorities, promote collaborations among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, plan future research, disseminate research results, and assess the impact on student performance. $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 are authorized for this purpose. SEC. 4. EDUCATION RESEARCH TEACHER FELLOWSHIPS. The Director will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education for fellowships to elementary and secondary teachers. The program aims to enhance teachers' understanding of human learning aspects and facilitate the transfer of research results into education systems. Grant recipients will recruit and select teachers for participation in research programs. The program will recruit teachers for research in brain research, human learning aspects, science and mathematics learning, and complex educational systems. Fellowship recipients will have mentors and support for their research experience. Programming and guidance will ensure dissemination of research information. The fellowship program aims to recruit teachers for research in education, providing scholarship stipends and possibly room and board for residential programs. Funds are limited to 25% for programming support, and teachers can participate for up to 1 year or 2 summers. Institutions seeking funding must apply for the program. The research institution applying for funding must submit an application to the Director, detailing research opportunities for teachers, recruitment methods, scholarship offerings, and programming support. The National Science Foundation provides funding to enhance teachers' research experience and improve education. The Director evaluates applications based on the applicant's ability to carry out the program effectively, commitment to making it a central focus, and the potential impact on elementary and secondary education. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004 for this program. The National Science Foundation is authorized to appropriate funds for the Interagency Education Research Initiative, with $28,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $31,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $33,000,000 for fiscal year 2004."
