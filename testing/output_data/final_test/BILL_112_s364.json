    "content": "Establishment of Small Business Savings Accounts under section 408B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A Small Business Savings Account is treated like an individual retirement plan, with no deduction allowed for contributions and a contribution limit set by the Secretary. Business Savings Accounts for individuals have a $10,000 limit, with an aggregate limit of $150,000 for all accounts. The $10,000 limit will be adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases. Contributions to a Small Business Savings Account can be made after age 70\\1/2\\. Rollovers from retirement plans are not allowed. Distributions are limited to a single business. The Small Business Savings Account allows for qualified distributions for business expenses such as operating capital, equipment, marketing, training, incorporation, and accounting fees. Nonqualified distributions are subject to taxation. Nonqualified distributions from the Small Business Savings Account are treated as made from contributions to the account, as long as the total distribution does not exceed the total contributions. Any remaining amount in the account after a specified date is treated as distributed in the following taxable year and is not considered a qualified distribution. Rollovers to a Roth IRA are also allowed. Excess contributions to Small Business Savings Accounts are defined as the amount contributed exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year. This is determined by subtracting the allowable contribution under section 408B(c)(2) from the total amount contributed to all accounts maintained for an individual. The text discusses excess contributions to Small Business Savings Accounts, which are defined as the amount contributed exceeding the allowable contribution limit for the taxable year. This is determined by subtracting the allowable contribution under section 408B(c)(2) from the total amount contributed to all accounts maintained for an individual. Additionally, there is a conforming amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 related to this issue. The amendments made by this section regarding Small Business Savings Accounts will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
