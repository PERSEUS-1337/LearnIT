The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 aims to improve access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries through specific policy objectives and assistance programs. It also aligns with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to reduce water-related issues by half between 1990 and 2015. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation to recognize the impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, and social development. Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318 in August 2008 to support the goals of the International Year of Sanitation and acknowledge the importance of sanitation on public health and economic development. The lack of access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services affects over 884 million people worldwide. Unsafe water and poor sanitation account for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease and over 2 million deaths annually. Climate change is expected to worsen water availability for 2.8 billion people in the future. The future management of water resources is a growing concern, with 2.8 billion people in over 48 countries facing severe shortages by 2025. Reports predict that rapid urbanization, population growth, and climate change will exacerbate water access issues, particularly in agriculture-based economies. The effects of climate change are projected to lead to long-term droughts and rising sea levels for the next 1,000 years. The United Nations reports that over 1/5 of the world population relies on polluted or excessively withdrawn freshwater. Water scarcity has led to conflicts in regions like Darfur, Sudan. To address these challenges, the United States must expand foreign assistance for safe water and sanitation efforts. The curr_chunk discusses foreign assistance and diplomatic deliberations on global health, food security, the environment, global warming, and maternal and child mortality. The United States should lead a global effort to provide sustainable access to clean water and sanitation for poor people worldwide.
