Additional legislation has added protections for fianc\u00e9(e)s and their children. The K-1 visa drew attention after a mass shooting in San Bernardino in 2015 involving individuals who came to the U.S. on this visa. Congress and the public have since raised questions about the K-1 visa. After a mass shooting in San Bernardino in 2015 involving individuals who came to the U.S. on the K-1 visa, questions have been raised about the visa's security screening. President Obama requested a review of the U.S. visa program, with some members of Congress suggesting the inclusion of social media screening for visa applicants. This report will provide information on the K-1 visa program, its requirements, application procedures, national security screening, admission to the U.S., and adjustment of status to lawful permanent residency. Statistics on visa issuance will also be included. The K nonimmigrant visa category was established in 1970 for fianc\u00e9s, fianc\u00e9es, and their derivative children. There are four subcategories within the K visa category: K-1 visa for noncitizens marrying a U.S. citizen, K-2 visa for their children, K-3 visa for noncitizens married to a U.S. citizen abroad, and K-4 visa. The K-4 visa is for noncitizens who married a U.S. citizen abroad and want to enter the United States while waiting for their immigration petition or immigrant visa. Legislation like IMBRA and the Adam Walsh Act provide protections for fianc\u00e9(e)s and their children, requiring disclosure of criminal convictions and providing information on domestic violence and rights. The K-1 visa prohibits U.S. citizens with certain convictions from petitioning for it. The petitioner must be a U.S. citizen, prove they have met the fianc\u00e9(e) in person, intend to marry, and can legally marry within 90 days. Admissibility under the INA must also be determined. A U.S. citizen petitioner must file Form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fianc\u00e9(e), with DHS's USCIS, along with supporting documents. IMBRA mandates providing criminal records for certain crimes and disclosing the use of an international marriage broker. Waivers may be required for certain circumstances, and USCIS approval leads to visa eligibility determination at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the foreign national's home country. The K-1 visa process requires the petitioner and beneficiary to provide various documents, undergo interviews, and meet eligibility criteria for admission to the United States. The consular office treats the K-1 visa as an immigrant visa due to the beneficiary's intention to stay in the U.S. DOS has issued instructions regarding the process. The K visa applicant must provide personal data, photograph, and fingerprints for screening in the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD), which links with other databases like IDENT and IAFIS to flag any issues that may affect visa issuance. DOS also uses facial recognition technology for screening. DOS uses facial recognition technology and the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database to screen visa applicants against a \"watchlist\" of known and suspected terrorists. About 70% of CLASS records come from other agencies. Consular officers also run names against the CCD for prior visa application checks. Consular officers rely on the Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) system for greater review of visa cases. Concerning information about K visa applicants is sent to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) for evaluation. The FBI conducts name checks based on suspect names provided by consular officers. The \"Terrorist Exclusion List\" (TEL) includes individuals associated with terrorist-supporting organizations. The \"Kingfisher Expansion\" (KFE) initiative with NCTC enhances interagency counterterrorism screening of all visa applicants. The K visa applicants' electronic visa applications are submitted to the NCTC for vetting. The NCTC compares the applications with its holdings, including the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE). A \"hit\" in KFE triggers a Washington-based interagency review of the visa application. Post-issuance reviews of valid visas are conducted to check for new information on emerging threats. Questions arose after the San Bernardino attack about whether immigration officials should be monitoring the social media accounts of visa applicants. The consultant to ABC News stated that DHS did not review social media accounts of visa applicants during his tenure. FBI was criticized for not finding pro-jihadist messages in Malik's emails. FBI Director Comey mentioned no evidence of social media postings by San Bernardino shooting suspects. DHS started pilot programs in 2015 to include social media review in vetting. K-1 visa is valid for six months, and CBP officers screen visa holders against databases and watch lists upon arrival in the US. From FY2000 to FY2014, DOS issued a total of 430,900 K-1 visas, with an additional 65,833 K-2 visas issued to the children of K-1 visa beneficiaries. K-1 visa holders must marry the U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days and can work in the U.S. during this time with employment authorization. If the marriage occurs within 90 days, the foreign national is eligible for lawful permanent residence as an immediate relative. If not, the K visa expires, and the individual must leave the U.S. FY2014 saw the peak year for fianc\u00e9(e) visas, with 35,925 K-1 visas issued. In FY2014, the Department of State issued 35,925 K-1 visas, the highest number in the 21st century. The Philippines led with 8,525 K visas, followed by China with 2,177 visas and Mexico with 2,101 visas. Asia received the most K visas at 46%, followed by North America and Central America at 19%, and Europe at 18%."
