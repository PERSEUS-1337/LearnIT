    "content": "Beginning with early colonial settlements in America, benefits have been provided to those who have suffered physical disabilities in service to the nation. In 1718, Rhode Island enacted legislation to support officers, soldiers, and sailors, as well as their families. The physically disabled were to have their wounds tended to at the colony's expense, with an annual pension provided for their maintenance. These benefits were continued by the Continental Congress in 1776, with disabled veterans receiving half of their. Since 1776, Congress has debated and revised benefits for veterans, who are eligible for disability compensation if their condition is linked to military service. Veterans can prove service-connected disabilities through military records detailing the injury, illness, and resulting disability. Since the early 1920s, Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs have used presumptions to ease the burden of proving service connection for veterans with disabilities not clearly linked to their military service. Scientific evidence is now relied upon to establish these presumptions, but challenges arise when evidence is incomplete or when other factors like natural aging could also contribute to disease causation. Congress and the VA face the challenge of establishing transparent and fair presumptions to compensate veterans for service-connected conditions. The VA and the Institute of Medicine have conducted studies on the historical development and decision-making process of presumptions. Much attention has been on Vietnam veterans' exposure to Agent Orange. The current process of making presumptions has raised potential issues. The current process of making presumptions for compensating veterans, particularly Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, has raised concerns about the validity of presumptive service connection for conditions like diabetes and prostate cancer. The report aims to address the complex and controversial policy issues surrounding this topic. The report examines the policy issue of establishing presumptive service connection, based on VA and IOM reports. It discusses disability compensation, legislative history, and presumptions for conditions related to Agent Orange. The report discusses disability compensation for veterans with service-connected injuries, the historical background leading to the Agent Orange Act of 1991, and options for improving the presumptive decision-making process. It clarifies that not all military personnel are considered veterans for benefits and outlines five ways to establish service-connected disabilities. Service-connected disabilities can be established in five ways: through direct service connection, aggravation during service, proximity to a service-connected disease or injury, caused by VA medical care or vocational rehabilitation, or through application of specific criteria. The VA can provide disability compensation to veterans through statutory presumptions, which consider certain diseases as service-connected even without evidence during service. A presumption relieves veterans of proving a disability was caused by specific exposure in the Armed Forces. The VA uses statutory presumptions to provide disability compensation to veterans, shifting the burden of proof from the veteran to the VA to prove a disease or disability was caused by service. Presumptions are applied to chronic diseases that may manifest years after service, relieving veterans from proving specific exposure in the Armed Forces. The burden of proof shifts to the other party to prove nonexistence of the presumed fact in the law of evidence. Presumptions in veterans' disease legislation date back to 1921, easing the decision-making process in VA disability compensation adjudications. The 1921 amendment to the War Risk Insurance Act established presumptions of service connection for certain diseases in World War I veterans, shifting the burden of proof in VA disability compensation adjudications. The War Risk Insurance Act of 1921 established presumptions of service connection for certain diseases in World War I veterans, allowing the agency to promulgate regulations for chronic constitutional diseases manifesting within one year of separation from active service. The World War Veterans Act of 1924 made significant changes to existing laws regarding service connection presumptions. The Act of 1924 made important changes to laws on presumptions related to tuberculosis and mental illness, adding dysentery, paralysis agitans (Parkinson's disease), and encephalitis lethargica to the list of presumptive diseases. It also removed requirements for a veteran to show diagnosis by a specific medical officer, expanding eligibility for compensation and medical care to thousands of veterans. The Veterans Act of 1924 expanded presumptive diseases list, adding dysentery, Parkinson's disease, and encephalitis lethargica. P.L. 80-748 in 1948 further expanded chronic and tropical disease categories through regulation and executive order, allowing VA to add more diseases. Administrator of VA believed VA was better suited than Congress to decide on presumptive diseases. The Veterans' Administration believes that determining diseases for inclusion under regulations should be handled administratively rather than through statutory lists. They suggest that Congress should avoid introducing statutory presumptions for specific diseases. The Veterans Benefits Act of 1957 codified laws affecting veterans benefits, including presumptions for chronic diseases and expanded the list. In 1970, P.L. 91-376 established a presumption of service connection for seven categories of diseases for POW veterans of World War II, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam War. The Former Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 1981 modified statutory presumptions for POW veterans of World War II, the Korean conflict, or the Vietnam War. Congress passed subsequent acts in 1984, 1986, and 1988 to further improve veterans' compensation and benefits. The Veterans' Health Care, Training and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) elevated Vietnam veterans' priority status for health care at VA facilities by recognizing a veteran's own report of exposure as sufficient proof to receive medical care unless there was evidence to the contrary. Congress passed subsequent acts in 1984, 1986, and 1988 to expand benefits for former POWs and recognize diseases related to Agent Orange exposure. The Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-542) required the VA to develop regulations for disability compensation for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. It also authorized disability compensation payments for chloracne and established a program for radiation-exposed veterans. In response to complaints from atomic veterans about the difficulty of receiving compensation under P.L. 98-542, Congress enacted the Radiation-Exposed Veterans' Compensation Act (P.L. 100-321) in 1988. This act established a presumption of service connection for 13 specified types of cancer, which was later expanded to 21 cancers. The Agent Orange Act (P.L. 102-4) in 1991 established a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure, eliminating the need for veterans to provide proof of exposure. The VA was authorized to contract with the IOM for a scientific review of medical conditions linked to herbicide exposure. P.L. 102-578 added two cancers to the presumptive list based on the BEIR V report. Congress also examined disability compensation for Persian Gulf War veterans in the mid-1990s. In 1994, Congress passed the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act (P.L. 103-446) to provide compensation for Gulf War-related disabilities. This act included presumptions for certain cancers and diseases caused by herbicide exposure. Subsequent laws in 1998 and 2001 further expanded benefits and mandated reviews of scientific literature on Gulf War veterans' health. The Veterans Benefits Acts of 2001, 2003, and 2006 expanded benefits for qualifying chronic disabilities, added presumptions for certain conditions in former POWs, and included additional diseases presumed to be service-connected. The Veterans Benefits Acts of 2001, 2003, and 2006 expanded benefits for chronic disabilities and added presumptions for conditions in former POWs. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 established a presumption of service connection for Persian Gulf War veterans with mental illness, and the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 established a presumption for osteoporosis in veterans with PTSD. The first list includes diseases associated with mental and physical trauma, allowing presumptive service connection for POWs with any length of captivity. The second list requires a 30-day internment period and includes diseases related to nutritional deficiencies like osteoporosis. Section 106 of P.L. 110-389 provides a presumptive service connection for osteoporosis in veterans with PTSD, bypassing the 30-day requirement. The controversy over Agent Orange and its link to illnesses in Vietnam veterans and their offspring persists, with extensive congressional hearings and debates on establishing presumptions of service connection. The legislative history leading to the passage of the Agent Orange Act in 1991 (P.L. 102-4) is discussed, including the authorization of defoliation testing in Vietnam by President Kennedy in 1961. Operation Ranch Hand, a large-scale spraying program, began in 1962, with nearly 19 million gallons of herbicides sprayed by the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971. The U.S. Air Force sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of herbicides in Vietnam, with at least 11 million gallons being Agent Orange, the most widely used herbicide in the war. In 1977, Congress became aware of a possible link between disabilities in Vietnam veterans and Agent Orange exposure. Veterans have attributed various illnesses to Agent Orange, including skin conditions, cancers, chronic diseases, birth defects, and other ailments. Since the late 1970s, veterans have urged the VA for medical treatment and disability compensation for these disorders. Initially, the Department of Defense maintained that only a limited number of military personnel were exposed to Agent Orange in South Vietnam. The Department of Defense initially denied ground troop exposure to Agent Orange in South Vietnam, but later acknowledged it after a 1979 GAO report. The VA refused compensation for diseases linked to Agent Orange due to scientific uncertainty. The VA policy aims to resolve doubts in favor of claimants, but there is no medical basis to link late-post-exposure health effects to Agent Orange. Congress addressed compensation, health effects, and access to care related to Agent Orange through legislative measures starting in 1979. The Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 mandated the VA to conduct a study on the health effects of exposure to dioxin in Vietnam veterans. This study was later expanded to include other environmental factors. In 1983, the responsibility for the study was transferred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, certain health-care services were authorized for Vietnam veterans exposed to dioxin or toxic substances. The VA did not acknowledge a link between Agent Orange and diseases, except for chloracne. P.L. 97-72 allowed veterans to receive health care even without sufficient medical evidence. Congress enacted this legislation to ensure care for veterans exposed to toxic herbicides in Vietnam. Numerous scientific studies were conducted related to Agent Orange and the Vietnam experience, involving various government agencies. Congress addressed the issue of disability compensation for veterans exposed to Agent Orange in 1983, with several measures introduced in the 98th Congress. One bill, the Vietnam Veterans Agent Orange Relief Act (H.R. 1961), aimed to create presumptions of service connection for specific diseases. The Orange Relief Act (H.R. 1961) proposed presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure, including chloracne, soft tissue sarcomas, and porphyria cutanea tarda. It allowed for the addition of other conditions through regulations. The bill included a sunset clause tied to a study mandated by the Veterans Health Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979. Witnesses had differing views on the bill, with the VA Administrator opposing it, emphasizing the need for a connection between Agent Orange exposure and resulting disorders. The House passed H.R. 1961 to provide VA disability compensation for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure, including soft tissue sarcoma, porphyria cutanea tarda, and chloracne. Benefits would end one year after a CDC study on the matter. The Programs Extension and Improvement Act of 1979 (P.L. 96-151) was submitted to Congress, and a different version of H.R. 1961 was passed by the Senate in 1984. The final version, enacted as the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act (P.L. 98-542) on October 24, 1984, required the VA to establish regulations for determining service connection of disabilities for veterans exposed to herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam. The Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 established the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to evaluate scientific studies on the health effects of exposure to dioxin. VA was directed to issue regulations for evaluating the risk of adverse health effects from herbicides containing dioxin or ionizing radiation. The Administrator of Veterans Affairs would make evaluations based on the Advisory Committee's advice. The Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act of 1984 established the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to evaluate the health effects of exposure to dioxin. Congress and the VA evolved in their responses to Agent Orange exposure as more information became available, leading to the recognition of a nexus between exposure and certain illnesses in veterans seeking compensation. In response to veterans' concerns about illnesses related to Agent Orange exposure, Congress directed the VA to conduct a study in 1979. Subsequently, legislation was enacted to provide priority healthcare to Vietnam veterans suffering from illnesses believed to be caused by Agent Orange. In 1984, guidelines were established for disability compensation claims brought by Vietnam veterans. The VA established guidelines for disability compensation claims by Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The new law mandated compensation payments for veterans with specific diseases for a two-year period. The 99th Congress focused on studies affecting veterans' health, while the 100th Congress continued to address health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. Despite the passage of the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, concerns about attributing health problems to Agent Orange exposure persisted. In response to concerns among Vietnam veterans about herbicide exposure, the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-4) was enacted by Congress. This law addressed issues with determining the linkage between Agent Orange exposure and diseases, ensuring veterans were given the benefit of the doubt in disability compensation claims. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-4) codified presumption of service connection for certain diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure and transferred the responsibility of reviewing scientific literature to the National Academy of Sciences. It established a new process for evaluating health effects and establishing presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to herbicide exposure. The Act requires the VA Secretary to conduct rulemaking proceedings to determine associated diseases. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 transferred the responsibility of reviewing scientific literature to the National Academy of Sciences and established a process for evaluating health effects and presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to herbicide exposure. The law requires the VA Secretary to conduct rulemaking proceedings to determine diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure for veterans to receive a presumption of service connection. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 tasked the Secretary to consider positive associations between diseases and herbicide exposure based on credible evidence. The National Academy of Sciences was required to review scientific evidence and assess the strength of the association between dioxin exposure and suspected diseases. The Academy was to submit periodic reports every two years. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 required periodic reports from the National Academy of Sciences every two years. The Secretary had to determine if a presumption of service connection was warranted for each disease covered in the report and issue regulations accordingly. The Act also included a sunset date for the provisions regarding service-connected diseases. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 mandated reports from the National Academy of Sciences every two years to determine service connection for diseases. In 2001, Congress extended the Secretary's authority to designate service-connected ailments for 13 more years. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued multiple reports on health outcomes and Agent Orange exposure since 1994. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 established presumptions of service connection for certain diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam, streamlining the VA's disability claims process for Vietnam veterans. It also created a new process for evaluating health effects of exposure to dioxin and other chemicals in herbicides. The VA Secretary can rebut presumptions of service connection for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure by providing evidence that the veteran was not exposed, the disability was caused by an injury after service, or the disease was due to the veteran's misconduct. Appendix A lists presumptive disease conditions related to Agent Orange. The process for establishing presumptions involves Congress, the VA, and the Institute of Medicine. Decisions on presumptive disability involve Congress, the VA, the Institute of Medicine, and other stakeholders like veterans service organizations. Congress has the power to create presumptive disability decisions through legislation or delegate authority to the VA. Some decisions have been challenged in court, leading to revisions in statutes governing disability compensation administration. For example, the Dioxin Act authorized the VA Secretary to determine diseases warranting a presumption of service connection related to Agent Orange exposure during the Vietnam War. The Dioxin Act authorized the VA Secretary to establish a presumption of Agent Orange exposure for Vietnam veterans and chloracne as a service-connected disorder. However, a federal court invalidated this regulation in 1989 due to the VA's requirement of proof of a causal relationship between dioxin exposure and diseases. The process of establishing presumptions for disability benefits from the VA involves constituents bringing issues to Congress, VSOs lobbying for certain presumptions, and the Secretary of the VA having authority to establish regulatory presumptions. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 introduced a new process for evaluating health effects of herbicide exposure and establishing presumptions of service connection for associated diseases. P.L. 102-4 directed the Secretary to work with the National Academy of Sciences to review scientific evidence on disease associations. The National Academy of Sciences collaborates with the VA to review scientific evidence on disease associations related to herbicide exposure in Vietnam. The Institute of Medicine provides reports to the VA, which are used to determine presumptive service connections for specific health outcomes. Congress requires the VA to respond to these reports with decisions on presumptive service connections. The National Academies conduct studies using a systematic process involving expert panels and open public meetings. The Institute of Medicine conducts studies on herbicide exposure in Vietnam, with committee deliberations closed to the public. Reports are peer-reviewed by the National Academies, categorizing evidence into associations with health outcomes. The VA follows an internal review process to evaluate study findings from the Institute of Medicine and make recommendations to the VA Secretary on granting presumptive status to specific conditions. A working group reviews the IOM findings, academic literature, and stakeholder input to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support special consideration for any diseases. The VA internal review process evaluates scientific evidence for disability presumptions. The working group generates recommendations for the VA Task Force, which reviews and may recommend new disability presumptions to the VA Secretary. If approved, the VBA submits cost estimates and regulations to OMB for review and publication. The VA internal review process evaluates scientific evidence for disability presumptions. Recommendations are generated for the VA Task Force, which may recommend new disability presumptions to the VA Secretary. If approved, the VBA submits cost estimates and regulations to OMB for review and publication in the Federal Register. The VBA then prepares a final rule after the public comment period, with a detailed discussion of VA's review of IOM's findings in Appendix B. Stakeholders expressed concerns about IOM's guidance on non-military exposures and alternate causes of diseases in the 2008 study on presumptive disability decision making process. Challenges in establishing service connection include limited epidemiologic studies and uncertainty about exposure measurements. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) faces limitations in establishing causal relationships between military exposures and long-term health effects due to various factors such as lack of contemporaneous exposure measurements, uncertainty about exposure to agents, and significant confounders. Recommendations have been made to the Department of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to improve evidence on exposures and veterans' health status. The narrowed scope of IOM research poses a challenge for VA policy makers in determining presumptive disability benefits based on study results. The VA faces challenges in establishing direct cause-and-effect relationships between military exposures and veterans' health conditions due to lack of exposure data for individual veterans. This hinders the VA from considering evidence on exposure magnitude or duration when determining health effects. The current process for establishing presumptions related to exposure is discussed, highlighting two major policy options. The current process for establishing presumptions related to exposure to Agent Orange presents two major policy options: retain or revise the process. Retaining the current process may lead to conditions associated with age and lifestyle being presumptive, rather than chemical exposure. This could disadvantage veterans of more recent conflicts like Gulf War I, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) compared to Vietnam veterans. Unlike Vietnam veterans, Gulf War veterans lack a substantial body of scientific literature to evaluate the association between diseases and specific exposures. The VA struggles to apply findings to Gulf War veterans due to various environmental hazards. Veterans have complex undiagnosed conditions, and military exposures mirror those of all Americans. The disability presumptions process needs refinement for service-connected conditions. The VA disability presumptions process may benefit from improvements such as creating independent panels to review illnesses for presumptive status, using causation as the standard, and imposing time limits on veterans' claims. Independent advisory panels could increase transparency in the process, currently initiated by the VA Secretary based on input from various stakeholders. An advisory committee of independent experts could annually review proposed conditions for further study based on scientific evidence connecting exposure to health outcomes. Public input would be considered, and the committee would charge an independent entity like the IOM to conduct studies. The VA would then internally review the study results before making decisions. The Agent Orange Act of 1991 established a threshold for determining a presumption based on a positive association between herbicide exposure and health outcomes. IOM committees use an association framework rather than direct causal mechanisms to identify health outcomes related to herbicide exposure. The VA Secretary may be restricted to only implementing presumptions for conditions with a clear causal link to military service based on scientific evidence. Conditions not meeting the causal threshold should trigger further research before being made presumptive. A supplemental study comparing the prevalence of the condition among deployed veterans to a control group may be necessary. A supplemental study comparing the prevalence of a condition among deployed veterans to a control group could help determine if the condition is more common among affected veterans. Data and technical experts from federal agencies like NIH, CDC, and EPA could assist in this study. Lifestyle, genetic heritage, and aging can influence the development of medical conditions, factors not currently considered in the presumption process. The VA utilizes scientific knowledge to set time limitations on when a condition can be considered \"service-connected\" to reduce the influence of extraneous factors. The VA follows a three-tiered review process for IOM reports, involving a Working Group of VA employees. The VA utilizes a three-tiered review process for IOM reports, involving a Working Group of VA employees who prepare a summary of assessment and recommendations for high-level VA officials. The Task Force then provides recommendations to the Secretary, who determines if a presumption of service connection is warranted for any disease. The Working Group, comprised of VHA personnel and other specialized members, convenes after receiving a briefing from the IOM committee. They identify diseases for special consideration based on the IOM report, providing additional information on these diseases at their initial meeting. This includes scientific studies, disease course, causes, risk factors, and related health effects. The Working Group discusses the IOM's findings to determine if they warrant a presumption of service connection for specific diseases based on scientific evidence and legal standards. They aim to reach a consensus on recommendations regarding the presumption of service connection for diseases. The Working Group relies on scientific evidence and legal standards to make recommendations on establishing a presumption of service connection for specific diseases. If there is ambiguity, they will present a range of options for VA policy-making officials to decide. They discuss factors that prevent a clear recommendation, such as statutory standards and limited IOM findings. They also consider decision options available to the Secretary and relevant factors for their decision. The Working Group relies on scientific evidence and legal standards to make recommendations on establishing a presumption of service connection for specific diseases. They discuss policy considerations relevant to the Secretary's decision among permissible courses of action and prepare a written report summarizing issues, findings, legal standards, analysis of medical evidence, and recommendations or options identified. No cost estimate is prepared for the options. The Working Group provides general information on disease prevalence rates and options to the Secretary, focusing on scientific and legal considerations. The VA Task Force, comprised of key officials, advises the Secretary based on the Working Group report, offering recommendations on available options. The Task Force advises the Secretary based on the Working Group report, recommending actions on establishing presumptions for discussed diseases. The Secretary then decides on implementation based on the Task Force's recommendations."
