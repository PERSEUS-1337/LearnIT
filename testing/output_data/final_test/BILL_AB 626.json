    "title": "AB 626",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9204 is added to the Public Contract Code to ensure timely and full payment for construction work on public projects, applying to claims by contractors. A \"claim\" is a separate demand sent by registered or certified mail for specific items. Section 9204 of the Public Contract Code provides provisions for contractors working on public projects, including time extensions, relief from penalties for delays, payment for disputed amounts, and payment for work not otherwise provided for in the contract. The term \"contractor\" refers to any contractor under Chapter 9 of the Business and Professions Code who has a direct contract with a public entity for a public works project. A public entity, as defined in the Public Contract Code, includes various state agencies, universities, cities, counties, districts, and public corporations. However, it excludes specific departments such as the Department of Water Resources, Department of Transportation, and Department of Parks and Recreation for projects under their jurisdiction. The Public Contract Code defines public entities, including state agencies, universities, cities, counties, districts, and public corporations. Excluded are specific departments like the Department of Water Resources, Department of Transportation, and Department of Parks and Recreation for projects under their jurisdiction. Public works projects encompass construction, repair, or improvement of public structures, buildings, roads, or other public improvements. Subcontractors are contractors in direct contract with a contractor or lower tier subcontractors. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Military Department, Department of General Services, and High-Speed Rail Authority have jurisdiction over various projects. Upon receipt of a claim, the public entity must review it within 45 days and provide a written statement identifying disputed and undisputed portions. The claimant must provide supporting documentation. The claimant must provide documentation to support their claim. If the public entity's governing body needs approval to provide a written statement identifying disputed and undisputed portions of the claim, and they do not meet within 45 days, the entity has three days after the next meeting to provide the statement. Payments for undisputed portions must be made within 60 days of the entity issuing the written statement. If the claimant disputes the public entity's response or if there is no response within the specified time, they can request an informal conference for settlement. The public entity must schedule a meet and confer conference within 30 days upon receiving a written demand sent by registered or certified mail. Within 10 business days after the meet and confer conference, if any part of the claim remains disputed, the public entity must provide a written statement to the claimant specifying the disputed and undisputed portions. Payment for undisputed portions must be made within 60 days. Disputed portions are to be submitted to nonbinding mediation, with costs shared equally between the public entity and claimant. If a mediator cannot be agreed upon, each party selects one and those mediators choose a neutral third party for mediation. If mediation is unsuccessful, a qualified neutral third party will mediate the disputed portion of the claim, with each party bearing their mediator's fees. Any remaining disputed parts of the claim will be subject to procedures outside this section. (C) Mediation, including neutral evaluation or dispute review board, involves an independent third party assisting parties in resolving disputes through negotiation or evaluation. Mediation must adhere to specified timeframes. \n(D) Mediation under this section excuses further obligation to mediate after litigation, unless agreed otherwise in writing by the public entity and contractor.\n(E) Public entities can still require arbitration if mediation does not resolve the dispute. Failure to respond to a contractor's claim within specified timeframes results in claim rejection. Denied claims due to public entity delays do not reflect on claimant's merits. Unpaid amounts accrue 7% interest annually. If a subcontractor lacks legal standing to assert a claim against a public entity, the contractor can present the claim on their behalf. The subcontractor must provide documentation to support the claim and the contractor must notify them within 45 days if the claim was presented or provide reasons for not doing so. The text of this section or a summary of it must be included in plans for public works projects that could lead to a claim. Waivers of rights granted by this section are void, except parties can agree in writing to skip mediation and go straight to a civil action or arbitration. Public entities can establish additional dispute resolution procedures as long as they don't conflict with the timeframes in this section. This section applies to contracts from January 1, 2017 onwards. This section applies to contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017 and shall remain in effect until January 1, 2020 unless extended by a later statute. The Legislature requires charter cities, counties, or city and counties to follow a specified claims resolution process for uniform procurement practices. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as outlined in the Government Code."
