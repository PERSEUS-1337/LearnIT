    "content": "The federal excise tax on tires was initially adopted during World War I to meet revenue needs. It was imposed on tires and tubes at 5% of the retail price. The tax was extended in 1921 and later reduced to 2 \u00bd percent in 1924 before being repealed in 1926. The tax was re-instituted in 1932 at 2 1/4 cents per pound on tires and 4 cents per pound on inner tubes. The tax structure changed to a tax on weight rather than price. Subsequent acts in 1940 raised the tax rates to 2 \u00bd cents and 4 \u00bd cents per pound. The First Revenue Act of 1940 raised excise tax rates on tires and tubes to make up for reduced income tax revenues during the Great Depression. The Revenue Act of 1941 further increased the rates, and the Revenue Act of 1943 redefined rubber to include synthetic and substitute rubber. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 expanded federal funding for highways. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 expanded the Interstate Highway program, raised tire taxes, and established the Highway Trust Fund. It provided for rate adjustments and rescheduling to support the ongoing construction of the interstate highway system. In 1960, the Excise Tax: Laminated Tires Act provided a lower tax rate for laminated tires made of scrap rubber not used on highway vehicles. Congress recognized the heavy tax burden on this new industry. In 1961, the Federal-Aid Highway Act increased excise tax rates for highway vehicle tires, inner tubes, and tread rubber. Rates for other types of tires remained unchanged. Subsequent laws postponed rate reductions scheduled for 1972. The Highway Trust Fund was extended through several public laws, postponing rate reductions from 1972 to 1984. In 1980, the tire excise tax rate was reduced as part of the Determination of Second Tier Taxes. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 aimed to stimulate job creation. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 aimed to redistribute highway costs between car and truck users by changing excise taxes on tires. The act established a new tax structure for heavy tires with graduated rates based on weight, exempting tires under 40 pounds from tax. Excise tax rates on heavy tires ranged from 15 to 90 cents a pound. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 included minor refund provisions for tire stock and tread rubber floor stock. Excise tax rates remained unchanged from 1982 to 2004, with adjustments made for taxes paid on unsold dealer stock. The federal tire excise tax was modified in 1997 to be based on weight rather than retail selling price. Additionally, a 12% federal retail excise tax is imposed on heavy highway trucks, trailers, and tractors. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 changed the method of taxing tires from a graduated weight structure to a tax based on the load capacity of the tire. The tax rate is set at 9.45 cents for each 10 pounds of tire load capacity in excess of 3,500 pounds. This change was estimated to increase federal revenues by $452 million during the FY1997-2002 period and $979 million during the FY1997-2007 period. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 changed the tire tax to be based on tire load capacity, with a lower rate for super single or bias ply tires. This change was estimated to have a negligible impact on federal revenues. Bias ply tires are reported to be used more on construction and farm equipment vehicles, which travel less frequently on highways supported by the tire tax. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended the tire tax to be based on load capacity, with a lower rate for super single tires wider than 13 inches. These tires are designed to replace two tires in a dual fitment and are not considered steering tires. The revenue impact was deemed negligible. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended the tire tax to be based on load capacity, with a lower rate for super single tires wider than 13 inches. The revenue impact was deemed negligible. The legislation also requires the IRS to collect revenue data for each class of taxable tire starting January 1, 2006, with a report due to Congress by July 1, 2007. The tire excise tax is set to expire on October 1, 2011, but may be extended based on past trends. Congress is considering highway reauthorization proposals, with funding levels expiring on May 31, 2005, and the federal excise tax on tires expiring on September 30, 2005. The House of Representatives approved the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (H.R. 3) in March 2005. The House of Representatives and the Senate passed bills extending the tire tax through September 30, 2011. The Senate's bill adds $11.2 billion in additional revenues to ensure all states receive as much federal highway aid as they pay in gasoline taxes. The White House is committed to a funding level of $283.9 billion over six years and may veto the legislation if this level is not met. During World War II, an excise tax was imposed on tires based on weight to discourage domestic consumption of rubber, a necessary commodity for the war effort. This tax incentivized the use of tires with less rubber content and led to the development of synthetic tires. An excise tax was placed on synthetic tires based on weight or load capacity for revenue needs and easier administration. The tax is collected from manufacturers to simplify the process and reduce administrative expenses for the IRS. The proposed change to a tax based on load capacity does not alter the collection point for this manufacturers tax. The excise tax on truck tires, known as a \"user tax,\" is based on load capacity and funds highway construction. Heavier vehicles like trucks cause more damage to roads and bridges, so the tax serves as a proxy for wear-and-tear charges. While currently applying only to heavy tires, it generates significant revenue for the Highway Trust Fund. Repealing the tax would necessitate imposing additional taxes elsewhere to maintain funding levels. The tax is easy to administer, keeping collection costs low. The excise tax on truck tires is easy to administer and keeps collection costs low. Arguments against the tax include its association with luxury items, discrimination against industries, and its impact on lower-income individuals. Excise taxes, particularly the excise tax on truck tires, disproportionately affect lower-income individuals as they spend a larger portion of their income on these goods. Revenues from this tax go to the Highway Trust Fund, but currently contribute less than 2% of its receipts. Tread Rubber collection figures from various sources for fiscal years 1933 to 1999. Collection figures for fiscal years 2000 to 2003 are sourced from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income Bulletin, v. 24, no. 3, Winter 2004-2005, pp. 152."
