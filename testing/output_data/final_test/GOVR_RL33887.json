    "content": "The Librarian of Congress announced six exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's prohibition on circumvention of technological measures controlling access to copyrighted works. These exemptions allow users to bypass access control devices for specific purposes, such as making video compilations for film studies, archiving obsolete computer programs, using read-aloud functions with e-books, connecting wireless telephone handsets to networks, and testing security flaws in works distributed on compact discs. These exemptions will be in effect for three years until a new determination is made in fall 2009. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits circumvention of access control devices, but exemptions are granted every three years. Copyright law protects original works, giving authors exclusive rights. The DMCA was passed in 1998 to combat infringement facilitated by digital technologies. The DMCA prohibits circumvention of access control devices like password codes and encryption used to protect copyrighted works. Exceptions allow circumvention in limited circumstances, such as for libraries, law enforcement, and lawful investigations. The DMCA prohibits circumvention of access control devices to protect copyrighted works, with exceptions for lawful investigations, interoperability studies, encryption research, and disabling access control devices collecting personal information. The DMCA also allows for exemptions through a rulemaking proceeding conducted by the Librarian of Congress. The DMCA prohibits circumvention of access control devices to protect copyrighted works, with exceptions for lawful investigations, interoperability studies, and encryption research. Triennial exemptions allow temporary waiving of the prohibition on circumvention in response to market changes, but do not affect the prohibition on trafficking in circumvention devices. Making and distributing technology that enables circumvention is still prohibited, even during exemptions. The DMCA prohibits circumvention of access control devices to protect copyrighted works, with exceptions for lawful investigations, interoperability studies, and encryption research. Triennial exemptions allow temporary waiving of the prohibition on circumvention in response to market changes, but do not affect the prohibition on trafficking in circumvention devices. Exemptions only apply to noninfringing uses, and individuals engaging in copyright infringement will still be liable. The Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights determine exemptions through a \"rulemaking proceeding\" conducted through \"notice-and-comment.\" The Copyright Office initiated a fourth \u00a7 1201 rulemaking in 2008 to determine the 2009 exemptions. The Copyright Office initiated a fourth \u00a7 1201 rulemaking in 2008 to determine the 2009 exemptions. Content users can propose exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition on circumvention, with hearings in spring 2009. Proponents must identify technological measures causing issues and show they control access to copyrighted works. The Copyright Office's rulemaking process for exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition on circumvention requires proponents to demonstrate how technological measures restrict access to copyrighted works and adversely affect non-infringing activities. The measures must directly lead to substantial adverse effects, supported by first-hand knowledge of verifiable marketplace problems. Proponents seeking exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition on circumvention must provide well-documented evidence of verifiable marketplace problems, especially for future harm. Non-infringing activities must be shown to be restricted by access control measures, and existing exemptions must be justified as if new. Demonstrating adverse effects on non-infringing uses does not guarantee automatic exemption approval. The Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights consider various factors when granting exemptions to the DMCA's prohibition on circumvention. These factors include the availability of copyrighted works, impact on access control devices, market effects, and other relevant considerations to balance the adverse and positive effects of access control devices. The Register of Copyrights consults with the Department of Commerce before recommending exemptions to the Librarian of Congress under the DMCA. Exemptions are granted based on the impact on a \"class of works\" and must show adverse effects. The definition of a \"class of works\" was discussed in the 1999-2000 rulemaking. The Register of Copyrights defined a \"class of works\" as a subcategory of copyrighted works based on their attributes, not on external criteria like intended use or users. This definition was used in granting exemptions in 2000 and 2003. The Copyright Office expanded the definition of \"class of works\" in 2006 to include classes based on uses or users, citing potential harm to users or copyright owners with broad class definitions. Film and media studies professors faced challenges in making compilations of DVD clips for teaching due to access controls. The Copyright Office expanded the definition of \"class of works\" in 2006 to include classes based on uses or users, citing potential harm to users or copyright owners with broad class definitions. The recent \u00a7 1201(a)(1) rulemaking process resulted in the Librarian of Congress granting six exemptions, including one that allows film and media studies professors to create compilations of DVD segments for teaching purposes. Professors and students can now create compilations of DVD segments for teaching purposes under an exemption granted by the Librarian of Congress. This allows seamless transitions between materials from different DVDs, saving time previously lost during class. Additionally, archivists can now work around access control devices to preserve computer programs and video games for future generations. The DMCA exemption allows archivists to bypass access control devices like dongles to preserve software. This helps consumers facing issues with dongles to still use their programs. People who are blind or visually impaired rely on read-aloud programs, but some e-books have disabled these functions. This exemption ensures access to the content for those individuals. The DMCA exemption allows visually impaired individuals to bypass access control devices for e-books that disable read-aloud or screen reader functions. It also permits cell phone users to unlock their devices for use with other carriers. Additionally, it addresses concerns regarding Sony-BMG selling music CDs with rootkit software that concealed data from computer operating systems. The DMCA exemption allows researchers to investigate and fix problems related to rootkit software that conceals data from computer operating systems. This exemption is effective through October 27, 2009 and is the largest group of exemptions granted by the Librarian to date. The 2006 DMCA exemption allows circumvention for e-books with disabled read-aloud function or screen reader. Only 6 out of 74 proposed exemptions were granted, including space-shifting and region-coded DVDs. The 2006 DMCA exemption denied many requests for exemptions, including those for devices preventing back-up copies and broadcast flags for audiovisual works. Proponents complained of inconvenience, but exemptions were rejected due to lack of evidence of harm or outdated information. The 2006 DMCA exemptions were denied due to lack of evidence of harm or outdated information. Supporters saw them as beneficial for consumers and specific user groups, predicting they would challenge DMCA authority. Critics felt the exemptions didn't go far enough in protection. Some critics faulted the exemptions for not adequately protecting consumers, noting they are tailored to specific user groups and do not address key consumer needs like space-shifting. Industry groups criticized the exemptions for potentially harming specific industries, with the cell phone exemption facing significant opposition from carriers and associations. TracFone Wireless, Inc., even filed a lawsuit challenging this exemption in 2006. TracFone withdrew its lawsuit challenging the cellphone exemption in 2007 after experiencing success in suing resellers who unlocked and sold their handsets overseas. Some question the narrow interpretation of the exemption by federal courts, with concerns that it has rendered the exemption \"useless.\" Representative Rick Boucher introduced the FAIR USE Act of 2007 to address these issues. The FAIR USE Act of 2007, introduced by Representative Rick Boucher, aimed to codify and expand exemptions for circumventing technological protection measures, including allowing instructors to use audiovisual works for educational purposes and consumers to skip commercials or objectionable content. The FAIR USE Act of 2007 introduced exemptions for circumventing technological protection measures, including allowing consumers to skip objectionable content in audiovisual works. These exemptions also apply to transmitting works over personal networks, accessing public domain works, and preserving copies in libraries or archives. The 2006 exemptions to the DMCA allow users to circumvent access controls for various purposes such as making video compilations, archiving obsolete programs, using read-aloud functions with e-books, and testing security flaws. These exemptions will be replaced by new ones in 2009. H.R. 1201 in the 110th Congress aimed to codify the 2006 exemptions to the DMCA and authorize six new exemptions to Section 1201. The outcome of the fourth \u00a7 1201 rulemaking proceeding, expected to be completed by fall of 2009, may impact future legislation on DMCA exemptions in the 111th Congress."
