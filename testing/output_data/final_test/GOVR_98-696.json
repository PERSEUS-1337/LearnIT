    "content": "The process of resolving legislative differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate is a critical and complex stage in the legislative process. Each chamber follows its own rules and practices but must also consider the preferences and procedures of the other. This report summarizes the procedures used by Congress to resolve these differences, based on rules, precedents, and recent practices. It is not exhaustive or an official statement but can serve as a useful guide. Before Congress can submit a bill or joint resolution to the President for approval, the Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on each provision. It is essential to study House and Senate rules, precedents, and procedures to understand the process of resolving legislative differences between the two chambers. Before a bill can be sent to the President for approval, the Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on every provision. Both chambers must pass the same measure in the same form for it to become law. This process requires agreement on the identity and text of the measure. During the legislative process, both the House and Senate must pass the same measure in the same form for it to become law. If one chamber amends the bill, they must resolve the differences between their versions. Revenue measures must originate in the House according to the Constitution. The Constitution requires revenue measures to originate in the House, which also extends to appropriations and tax laws. The House typically acts first on these measures, presenting a House-numbered bill to the President. Proponents may choose which house acts first based on support levels, hoping for political momentum. Alternatively, one house may wait for the other to pass a bill to overcome expected opposition. The House leadership may delay investing time in controversial bills until after a Senate filibuster is avoided. Major legislative proposals are often introduced in both houses simultaneously. When one house passes a bill, the other may have its own version ready for consideration. When one house passes a bill, the other may have its own version ready for consideration, which can lead to the second chamber acting on its own bill if it differs significantly from the first chamber's approach. The selected text for floor consideration sets the frame of reference for debate and amendments, with the House or Senate usually modifying rather than wholly replacing the legislative approach. It is advantageous for a committee to push for floor consideration of its approach over the other house's proposal, even if both chambers have bills on the same subject. When one house passes a bill, the other may have its own version ready for consideration. The second chamber often acts on its own bill first before considering the other chamber's bill on the same subject. The House customarily debates, amends, and passes its bill before taking up the counterpart Senate bill. The floor manager then replaces the text of the Senate bill with the House bill's full text. When one house passes a bill, the other may have its own version ready for consideration. The House often agrees to consider the Senate bill and approves the House substitute routinely. A special rule may allow the House to pass two bills on the same subject with identical provisions, but it is the Senate bill that is the subject of further action. The Senate acts in a comparable fashion by debating and amending its bill before further action. The Senate follows similar procedures as the House when considering bills, including debating, amending, and passing bills by unanimous consent. In some cases, the Senate may start with a House-numbered bill to avoid the need for unanimous consent at the end of the process. If a bill has been referred to committee in the second chamber, the committee may need to be discharged before further consideration. This is typically done through unanimous consent or a special rule. The Speaker may leave a Senate bill on \"the Speaker's table\" to avoid the need for action, if the House is expected to act on a companion House bill soon. The House and Senate can act on the same bill with different texts using certain procedures. Complications can arise if amendments are not germane in the House, unlike the Senate. The Senate allows nongermane floor amendments on most measures unless a germaneness requirement is imposed. Unrelated legislative vehicles are used to include provisions on different subjects. Differences between House and Senate versions of a bill can be resolved through a conference committee or other methods. The process of resolving differences between House and Senate versions of a bill can involve sending the bill to a conference committee or relying on amendments between the houses. Various methods, including a combination of both, may be used to reach an agreement on the final version acceptable to both chambers. The legislative process of resolving differences between House and Senate versions of a bill can be complex and unpredictable. The two chambers may create a conference committee, but it may only resolve some differences. If disagreements remain, they may exchange amendments. Either house can refuse to act, leading to the bill's failure. The procedures at this stage are difficult to predict with certainty. The legislative process of resolving differences between House and Senate versions of a bill involves sequential action by each chamber to address amendments. The chambers may accept each other's amendments or propose new ones until an agreement is reached. If disagreements persist, one house must ultimately accept the other's position. The legislative process involves resolving differences between House and Senate versions of a bill through sequential actions with amendments. If disagreements persist, one house must ultimately accept the other's position to avoid the bill dying for lack of agreement. Alternatively, a conference can be requested to resolve differences. Amendments between the houses can be made in two degrees, with the second chamber's amendments subject to further amendments. When the Senate receives a bill with amendments from the House, it can either concur with the House amendments or propose further amendments. If the Senate proposes additional amendments, it becomes a second-degree amendment. The bill and accompanying papers are then returned to the House, which can either agree to the final Senate amendment or disagree, leading to a resolution of differences. When the House and Senate reach a stage of disagreement on a bill, they can either reach agreement by one chamber receding from its position, or the bill is likely to die unless one house concedes. This process can start in either chamber, with actions reversed. Agreement can be reached if one chamber concurs with the other's amendment or recedes from its own. When the House and Senate reach a stage of disagreement on a bill, they can either reach agreement by one chamber receding from its position, or the bill is likely to die unless one house concedes. The process can start in either chamber, with actions reversed. Agreement can be reached if one chamber concurs with the other's amendment or recedes from its own. Alternatively, a stalemate could be reached more quickly if the chambers refuse to alter their original positions and proceed directly through the stages of disagreement, insistence, and adherence. The House may consider House-passed measures with Senate amendments on the floor instead of sending the bill to a conference, in the process of sending it to conference, or after it has been considered by a conference. When the House and Senate disagree on a bill, they can either reach agreement or the bill may die. The bill usually remains at \"the Speaker's table\" until taken up on the House floor. Referral to committee is rare, especially if Senate amendments are major and nongermane. The bill and Senate amendments are not privileged for floor consideration by the House at this stage. The House can only consider Senate amendments to a bill on the floor if they do not include certain provisions required by House rules. Once the House reaches a stage of disagreement, a motion to go to conference with the Senate can be made. This motion can take different forms depending on whether the Senate passed a House bill with amendments or disagreed to House amendments to a Senate bill. The House can insist on its amendments and request a conference, with the motion entertained at the Speaker's discretion and authorized by the relevant committee. Unanimous consent is often used to achieve the same result. Moving to concur in Senate amendments or proposing new House positions is not in order unless by unanimous consent. The House floor manager may seek unanimous consent to take a bill with Senate amendments from the Speaker's table and concur in the amendments. The minority-party member of the committee can object to Senate amendments but usually withdraws the objection after discussion. The House can concur with Senate amendments by unanimous consent, resolving differences between the two chambers. If there is objection, a motion cannot be made if the amendments require consideration in Committee of the Whole. The Speaker may recognize the floor manager to move to suspend the rules and concur in Senate amendments, with motions to suspend the rules considered on specific days or by unanimous consent. Alternatively, the Rules Committee may report a special rule for a motion to concur in Senate amendments. The House may use a self-executing rule to agree to Senate amendments quickly, bypassing certain rules and precedents. This process can occur through unanimous consent, suspension of the rules, or special rules. When the Senate receives a bill with House amendments, it is held at the desk and can be laid before the Senate without debate. Consideration of these amendments suspends the pending business, as per Rule VII. When the Senate receives a bill with House amendments, the pending business is suspended. The majority leader presents the House message on the bill, which may include amendments or a request for a conference. Consultations and negotiations typically occur before House amendments are discussed on the Senate floor. Floor managers collaborate to determine if the amendments are acceptable, and seek general concurrence from other Senators. When the Senate receives a bill with House amendments, the majority leader presents the House message on the bill for discussion. If general concurrence is not reached, parliamentary options are available for acting on House amendments, including motions to arrange for a conference committee with the House. This motion can take two forms depending on whether the House has passed a Senate bill with amendments or disagreed to Senate amendments on a House bill. The Senate has options to dispose of House amendments, including motions to concur with Senate amendments, concur with House amendments, disagree with House amendments, or table the House amendments. These motions are debatable and subject to filibuster. The Senate has options to dispose of House amendments through various motions, including to concur, concur with an amendment, disagree, or table the amendments. These motions have different levels of precedence, with a motion to table being of the highest precedence. Multiple motions can be pending at the same time, and the order of precedence determines which motion is voted on first. The Senate has options to dispose of House amendments through various motions, including to concur, concur with an amendment, disagree, or table the amendments. When the Senate receives multiple amendments from the House, it considers them in the order that they affect the Senate text. The majority leader has used his right of preferential recognition to offer a motion to concur in House amendments, a process known as \"filling the tree.\" The majority leader can \"fill the tree\" in the Senate to block other Senators from proposing alternative methods of acting on House amendments until a motion is disposed of. This does not expedite the final disposition of the amendments unless cloture is invoked with a coalition of at least 60 Senators. The majority leader can \"fill the tree\" in the Senate to block other Senators from proposing alternative methods of acting on House amendments until a motion is disposed of. If the Senate agrees to invoke cloture on a motion to dispose of the House amendments, all other pending motions of a higher precedence fall. The two chambers may use the process of sending amendments between the houses as an informal alternative to a conference committee. The two chambers may use sending amendments between the houses as an informal alternative to a conference committee, where negotiations can occur through informal discussions among interested Representatives and Senators and their staffs. Staffs compare bill versions and seek grounds for settling differences, with committee leaders becoming involved if necessary. If informal conversations are productive, a tentative agreement may be reached without the need for a conference committee. The majority floor manager can propose that the House or Senate concur in the second chamber's amendments with some amendments, presenting it as a compromise agreeable to both houses. Confidence is expressed that if one chamber accepts the amendments, the other will also accept. If the first house accepts amendments, the second chamber will likely agree as well, resolving differences without a formal conference committee. Disagreement between the House and Senate triggers the need for a conference committee. The House and Senate reach a stage of disagreement where they cannot agree without first receding from their disagreement. Amendments are couched in terms of one chamber concurring in the other's amendments. Crossing the threshold of disagreement has significant procedural consequences. The House and Senate reach a stage of disagreement where they cannot agree without first receding from their disagreement. This has significant procedural consequences, especially in the House, where the order of precedence among motions changes after reaching the stage of disagreement. Before disagreement, motions favor perfecting the measure, while after disagreement, motions prioritize promoting agreement between chambers. For example, a motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence before disagreement, but after disagreement, a motion to recede and concur with an amendment takes precedence. After reaching a stage of disagreement, the precedence among motions changes in the House. If differences cannot be resolved through exchanging amendments, two options remain: legislation may die in a stalemate or a conference committee can be created to find a resolution. Major bills historically go to conference for resolution. Historically, major bills are sent to conference for resolution after attempts to resolve differences through amendments between houses. The process can begin once the second house passes the bill with amendments or a substitute. The second house may return the bill with its amendments to the first house if there is a chance of acceptance, or if amendments can be used as an informal alternative to conference. Alternatively, the second house may act first on a conference report. When one chamber requests a conference, the other house normally agrees to the request. If the second chamber returns the bill without insisting on its amendments, the first house may disagree and request a conference. The first house has the option to refuse to act, concur with amendments, or agree to a conference. When disagreements arise between the two chambers over amendments, they can request a conference to resolve the differences. This process can be initiated by either chamber, with strategic considerations influencing the decision on how to proceed to conference. The Senate and House may choose how to proceed to conference, with strategic considerations influencing their decision. Proponents of legislation may prefer one route over the other to avoid facing challenges such as filibusters or difficult votes. The Senate and House may choose how to proceed to conference, with strategic considerations influencing their decision. Proponents of legislation may prefer one route over the other to avoid facing challenges such as filibusters or difficult votes. The Senate has rules in place to expedite the process of arranging for a conference committee with the House, including a new motion and an expedited cloture process. If cloture is invoked by three-fifths of the Senate, a simple majority could approve the motion to authorize a conference committee. After a House bill with amendment(s) is passed by the Senate, a new motion to authorize a conference committee would require unanimous consent. The selection of conferees, appointed by the Speaker in the House, is crucial as they determine the final form of major legislation. The Speaker appoints members to select, joint, and conference committees, with guidelines to follow. The Speaker may remove or add members as needed. When appointing members to conference committees, the Speaker must include a majority who supported the House position, those responsible for the legislation, and proponents of major provisions. These guidelines give the Speaker discretion in committee appointments. In the Senate, the presiding officer is authorized to appoint managers on the part of the Senate for conferences. Consultation before the formal announcement of conferees gives influence to the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee. They usually serve as conferees and play a significant role in deciding the number of conferees, party ratio, and committee representation. In the House and Senate, the selection of conferees for a conference committee is typically determined by the committee leaders. If a bill has been considered by multiple committees, chairmen and ranking minority members from those committees are usually involved in selecting conferees. Party leaders may also play a role in determining the total number of conferees and their division among committees. The Speaker has the authority to appoint conferees as needed. The Speaker appoints Representatives for successful floor amendments, even if not on the reporting committee. House and Senate conferees may be appointed for limited purposes, protecting the influence of standing committees. Each house determines the size of its delegation to the conference committee, which may not be equal between the two chambers. The conference report requires approval by a majority of House and Senate conferees, who are usually appointed immediately after a decision to go to conference. Instructions to conferees are not binding but serve as guidance for their negotiations. Instructions to conferees are advisory expressions of position or preference and are not binding. In the Senate, a motion to instruct is debatable and amendable, while in the House, it is debated under the one-hour rule. Conferees cannot be instructed to exceed their authority, and only one valid motion to instruct is allowed in the House before conferees are named. In the House, a Member of the minority party is entitled to recognition to move to instruct on a subject. The Speaker looks to senior minority-party members of the committee for this. Motions to instruct are also allowed after House conferees have failed to report an agreement. House conferees are limited to resolving disagreements between the House and Senate, with restrictions on policy agreements. The Speaker may designate a time for consideration of motions to instruct, with no preferential recognition for the minority party. House conferees can only address disagreements between the House and Senate, with their authority limited by the scope of differences. They must stick within the options defined by the House and Senate positions on each matter in disagreement. For example, if the House proposes $1 billion for a purpose and the Senate proposes $2 billion, the conferees can only agree on $1 billion, $2 billion, or an amount in between. House conferees must adhere to the scope of differences between the House and Senate positions when resolving disagreements. They can agree on figures between $1 billion and $2 billion but not less than $1 billion or more than $2 billion. The scope refers to specific differences in the versions of the bill, not the implications of those differences. Conferees can choose the higher or lower amount for each appropriation item, even if the total exceeds the amounts proposed in either the House or Senate versions. If one chamber proposes amending a law and the other does not, the scope of differences is generally limited. House conferees must adhere to the scope of differences between the House and Senate positions when resolving disagreements. The differences are bounded by proposed amendments and existing law, with restrictions on the conferees' authority. Defining the scope becomes challenging when differences are qualitative, not quantitative. The difficulty also depends on how the second chamber has framed the disagreements. When resolving disagreements in conference, the matters in disagreement are cast in terms of discrete amendments approved by the second house. The two versions of the measure are compared to identify identical provisions and disagreements. The second chamber may present its version as an amendment in the form of a substitute for the entire text passed by the first house, resulting in only one amendment submitted to conference. When in conference to resolve disagreements, the second house may present a substitute amendment encompassing various differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill. This can lead to profound policy disagreements and make it challenging to identify specific matters in disagreement. Conferees must have flexibility to address these differences effectively. When in conference to resolve disagreements, the conferees may create a conference substitute to address differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill. This substitute can introduce new approaches not previously considered by either house, leading to potential policy disagreements. House Rule XXII clause 9 allows for a substitute that is a germane modification of the matter in disagreement to prevent the introduction of unrelated language. The conference committee must ensure that any modifications made in the conference report are germane to the matter in disagreement and do not include new matter not previously committed by either House. If the House conferees exceed their authority in agreeing to a conference report, the entire report is considered tainted and can be challenged on the House floor. The House conferees usually stay within their negotiating limits to avoid exceeding their authority. They have more discretion when presented with second chamber substitutes. If their agreement goes beyond their authority, they can protect the report by reporting back amendments in technical disagreement. The House conferees can report amendments back to the House and Senate in technical disagreement. The House can approve a conference report by a two-thirds vote under suspension of the rules. The House Rules Committee may propose waiving points of order against a conference report. The Senate's rules are similar regarding restrictions on agreements. The Senate's rules on conferees state that they cannot add new matter not agreed upon by both Houses or remove agreed-upon matter from a bill. If new matter is inserted, a point of order can be made against the report. The Senate's rules on conferees allow for considerable latitude in reaching agreements with the House. Conference reports must not include new irrelevant matter and may only include germane modifications of subjects in disagreement. Under current Senate rules, conferees have broad discretion in considering the subject matter of bills, as long as it is germane. However, their authority is limited by rules against new directed spending provisions. The Senate Rule XLIV applies to discretionary and mandatory spending provisions in conference reports. Discretionary spending funds federal programs and agencies, while mandatory spending funds entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. The Senate can waive these restrictions with a three-fifths vote. The rules governing conference committees are minimal, with members able to choose their own chairmen and decide on formal rules for debate, quorums, proxy voting, and amendments. The only requirements are approval of the conference report by a majority of House and Senate managers and meetings being open to all conferees and the public. Decisions are not made by a vote among all conferees. The conference report must be approved and signed by a majority of House and Senate managers. Votes are taken within each delegation, not collectively. Conference meetings are now open to the public unless a decision is made to close them. Senate Rule XXVIII allows for closure of meetings by a majority vote of managers present. The House and Senate have different rules regarding the closure of conference committee meetings. The House requires a majority vote on the House floor to close a meeting, while the Senate allows closure by a majority vote of managers present. Efforts to close meetings are usually related to national security matters. House rules also have additional requirements for conference committee meetings. According to House Rule XXII, conference meetings must ensure all House managers are notified and given the opportunity to attend. Matters in disagreement are open for discussion at these meetings. If a violation of the rule is found, the conference report is rejected, and a further conference with the Senate is requested. The Senate also emphasizes the importance of holding regular, open meetings with adequate notice for all conferees to participate in debates. Few other rules govern conference proceedings. The conference committee operates without many rules, allowing negotiators to decide on proceedings freely. Conferences can be formal with proposals and counter-proposals or more informal discussions leading to compromises. Sub-conferences may be formed for omnibus bills. Conference bargaining in the conference committee can be facilitated by preliminary staff work, such as preparing side-by-side comparisons of House and Senate versions. Senior staff may engage in preliminary negotiations to seek agreements before the members focus on more challenging disagreements. Once full agreement is reached, a conference report is prepared to show how each amendment in disagreement has been resolved. The conference report proposes resolutions for disagreements on amendments between the House and Senate, including receding from certain amendments, concurring with amendments, and signing the report with majority support from both chambers. No additional or minority views are allowed in the report. The conference report must be signed by a majority of House conferees, and a joint explanatory statement is required to accompany it. This statement provides details on the disagreements faced by the conferees. The joint explanatory statement, required by Senate and House rules, summarizes the positions on amendments in disagreement. It is signed by House and Senate conferees and accompanies the conference report. The order of consideration can be reversed for strategic reasons. The order of consideration for a conference report can be strategically reversed, such as delaying action in the House until after the Senate has voted to avoid a filibuster. The first house to consider the report can vote to recommit it to conference, discharging its conferees. The second house then only has the option to accept or reject the report. Conferees must ensure that the house they want to act first on the conference report takes the papers out of the conference. If they cannot agree on amendments or all matters, they may report back in disagreement. The House and Senate can resolve differences through a second conference or exchange of amendments. Conferees may report in total disagreement if they reach an agreement that violates their authority. After the House receives or the Senate agrees to the report in disagreement, the conferees' actual agreement is presented as a floor amendment to the amendment in disagreement. The conferees may submit their report to the House and Senate even if it violates their authority, and the Rules Committee in the House can propose a resolution protecting the report. Conference reports can be presented at any time the House or Senate is in session, except during certain sessions. They are unlikely to be considered immediately due to layover and availability requirements. The House has a 72-hour layover requirement for conference reports, with availability requirements for the report and joint explanatory statement. Waivers can be granted by adopting a resolution from the Rules Committee. The report is considered read when called up for consideration in the House. The House considers conference reports read when called up for consideration, with waivers possible through a resolution from the Rules Committee. Conference reports are highly privileged and may be called up at any time in the House under the one-hour rule, with time divided between majority and minority parties. Floor managers explain agreements reached in conference before yielding time to other Members to speak on the report. In the House, floor managers support the report, allowing debate time for opposing Members. The majority floor manager can move to end debate with the previous question, leading to an immediate vote on the conference report. Points of order must be raised before debate begins. Senate Rule XXVIII requires the conference report to be available before consideration. The Senate Rule XXVIII requires that a conference report must be available on each Senator's desk before it can be considered. The report must also be available to Members and the general public for at least 48 hours before a vote, with waivers possible under certain circumstances. The report is considered available to the general public if it is posted on a congressional website or a website controlled by the Library of Congress or the Government Publishing Office. Conference reports in the Senate are privileged and can be considered without debate. The reading of a conference report is no longer required if it is available in the Senate. When debated on the Senate floor, a conference report is subject to extended debate unless time is limited by unanimous consent, cloture, or expedited procedures. When debated on the Senate floor, a conference report is subject to extended debate unless time is limited by unanimous consent, cloture, or expedited procedures. Senate Rule XXVIII states that time for debating a conference report is equally divided between the majority and minority parties. A point of order can be made against a conference report at any time it is pending on the Senate floor. If a Senator objects to a conference report for including \"new matter\" or \"new directed spending provisions,\" a special procedure allows for striking out the offending parts and continuing consideration of the rest of the compromise. The presiding officer rules on the validity of the objection, and separate decisions can be made for each provision if multiple objections are raised. Senate rules dictate that if a point of order is sustained against a conference report violating the rules, the debate can proceed without the problematic sections. If a Senator objects to a conference report for including \"new matter\" or \"new directed spending provisions,\" a special procedure allows for striking out the offending parts and continuing consideration of the rest of the compromise. The matter is to be stricken from the conference recommendation, and the Senate can consider a motion to send a proposal to the House without the offending provisions. Amendments to this motion are not allowed, and the terms for consideration are the same as those for the conference report itself. If the Senate agrees to the motion, the altered conference recommendation would be returned to the House. The Senate can waive restrictions on conference reports by moving to waive points of order against provisions. A motion to waive all points of order is not amendable, and debate time is limited to one hour. If the motion to waive is supported, the Senate agrees to keep the provisions. If the motion to waive garners the necessary support, the Senate agrees to keep the potentially rule-violating matter in the conference report. A three-fifths vote is required to sustain an appeal of the chair's ruling, limiting debate to one hour. This ensures that a three-fifths vote is needed for either method of applying the rules. Conference reports cannot be amended on the floor, and conferees negotiate differences between versions of a bill passed by both houses. The delegations return to their chambers with identical recommendations in the form of a report proposing a package settlement of differences between the House and Senate. The settlement can be accepted or rejected but not amended directly, making the resolution process smoother. If the first house agrees to the report, the second house only has to act accordingly. If the first house agrees to the report, the second house can only approve or disapprove it. The defeat of a conference report may kill the legislation, but further action like requesting a second conference or proposing a new position can be taken. A second conference may not be practical near the end of a Congress due to time constraints. The vote to agree to a conference report completes that house's action on the measure assuming the other house also approves it. House rules include special procedures for coping with conference report provisions originating in the Senate that would not have been germane floor amendments to the bill in the House. It is generally in the interests of both the House and Senate managers for the conferees to reach full agreement, but sometimes they cannot reach agreement on all the amendments in disagreement. In such cases, the conferees may return to the house for further action. The conferees may return to the House and Senate with a partial conference report dealing with agreed amendments, excluding those still in disagreement. The House debates and votes on the partial report, insisting on disagreement to certain amendments to support its original position. The House may move to recede from its disagreement to Senate amendments and concur, or recede and concur with a House amendment, supporting the negotiating position of its conferees. It then sends all papers to the Senate with a message describing its actions. If the Senate agrees to the partial conference report and the House position on amendments, the bill can be enrolled for presidential action. The Senate may disagree on some amendments, insist on its original position, or propose a new bargaining position. If the House recedes from its disagreement to a Senate amendment, the Senate may disagree or concur with further amendments. The process of resolving disagreements between the House and Senate on amendments involves multiple steps, including messaging amendments back and forth, requesting further conferences, and appointing new conferees. Only the amendments in disagreement are submitted to the new conference, and the partial conference report cannot become law until all remaining disagreements are resolved. If the second conference is successful, the managers submit a second report for action on the House and Senate floor. If not, the legislation, including the partial conference report, is probably dead for that Congress. Amendments in true disagreement rarely arise when conferees are presented with a second chamber substitute. The conferees either reach agreement or they may not; they may not report only part of the substitute as an amendment in disagreement. If the conferees report back in total disagreement, the House and Senate can then vote to insist on their original positions or propose new versions of the legislation. Amendments in true disagreement generally have arisen when. Amendments in true disagreement can complicate the conference process, especially when the second chamber passes a bill with separate amendments. This often occurs with general appropriations bills originating in the House. The House typically acts first on partial conference reports and amendments in disagreement, making it challenging to predict the outcome of a measure sent to conference. Conferees may reach agreements on some amendments but not on others, leading to uncertainty on how to proceed with the unresolved amendments. When the House and Senate have amendments in disagreement, new possibilities arise that were not available in conference. The scope of differences between the two chambers is not a restriction on amendments between them. This allows for the House to introduce new positions that go beyond the original positions of either chamber. The conferees could report an amendment in disagreement, leading to new positions being proposed by each chamber, potentially resulting in a second conference to resolve differences. Various complications can arise in the House as it acts on each amendment in disagreement. The House faces complications when acting on amendments in disagreement, with different motions having varying precedence before and after reaching the disagreement stage. This is particularly common during actions on amendments to general appropriations bills. The motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence in perfecting a measure. If the House agrees to this motion, the straight motion to concur falls without a vote. A motion to recede and concur in a Senate amendment has precedence over a motion to recede and concur with an amendment. The motion to recede and concur promotes agreement more directly. The motion to recede and concur is divisible in the House. The House may divide a motion to recede and concur with an amendment into two proposals: first, recede from disagreement to the Senate amendment; second, concur in the Senate amendment. If the House votes to recede, a motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence. The possibilities on the House floor depend on the motion made, precedence of motions, and attempts to change the order of precedence. The House may divide a motion to recede and concur with an amendment into two proposals: first, recede from disagreement to the Senate amendment; second, concur in the Senate amendment. If the House votes to recede, a motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence. The possibilities on the House floor depend on the motion made, precedence of motions, and attempts to change the order of precedence. When the House recedes from its disagreement, it crosses back over the threshold of disagreement, and the order of precedence among motions is reversed. When the House recedes from disagreement, the order of precedence among motions is reversed. The motion to concur with an amendment now has precedence over the original proposal to concur in the Senate amendment. If the House votes to recede, the motion to concur with an amendment takes precedence. The motion to concur with an amendment has precedence over the divided motion to concur in the House. In the Senate, the order of precedence of motions remains unchanged after disagreement. Senators cannot demand the division of motions like in the House. Amendments in true disagreement are rare, and the House usually accepts the floor manager's motions to dispose of them. The House usually accepts the floor manager's motions to dispose of amendments in true disagreement, as the complexity of parliamentary maneuvers may deter Members from attempting them. Predicting the outcome of a measure submitted to conference is difficult due to the various options for dealing with amendments. Conference reports must adhere to restrictions on content, only addressing disagreements between the House and Senate within the scope of their differences. Conferees may exceed their authority by using amendments in disagreement to address changing circumstances or include provisions not in the original bills, avoiding a point of order on the entire report. Conferees can address changing circumstances or include new provisions by using amendments in disagreement to exceed their authority. This allows them to present a partial conference report and an amendment in technical disagreement, which is considered outside of the conference report for technical reasons. The first house considers the partial conference report and then the amendment in technical disagreement, ultimately making a decision in conference. The conference report allows for amendments in technical disagreement to be considered, even if they exceed the scope of differences or propose new subjects. The process involves the first house voting on the motion, followed by the second chamber acting on the partial conference report and the first house's amendment. If the Senate concurs with the House amendment, the resolution is completed. Conferees used this method to finalize congressional action on general appropriations bills until the mid-1990s. The Senate may consider floor amendments to general appropriations bills that would not have been in order in the House, creating a potential problem for the House. Conferees could present the House with a conference report that includes matter not previously approved by the House. The House can address potential issues with Senate amendments to appropriations bills by using amendments in technical disagreement, as outlined in House Rule XXII. House conferees must not agree to Senate amendments that violate House rules without specific authority, otherwise the amendment must be reported back to both Houses for separate disposition. House conferees handle Senate amendments to appropriations bills using amendments in technical disagreement, following House Rule XXII. The House agrees to partial conference reports and considers amendments individually, while the Senate typically disposes of them en bloc. The House responds to Senate amendments to appropriations bills by considering them individually, using amendments in technical disagreement. Unlike the Senate, the House typically votes on these amendments separately rather than en bloc. This process allows the House to protect its own rules and make decisions on each amendment independently. The House and Senate have options for dealing with amendments in technical disagreement, which can be used to address differences in rules governing appropriations bills. This device has been convenient for appropriations conferees, allowing them to report necessary amendments. However, in recent Congresses, there have been fewer amendments in technical disagreement accompanying appropriations conference reports. In recent Congresses, there have been far fewer amendments in technical disagreement accompanying appropriations conference reports. The House Rules Committee has waived points of order against many of the appropriations conference reports, allowing conferees to include all agreements without fear of vulnerability to points of order on the House floor. This contrast in rules between the House and Senate poses challenges for bicameral relations during the legislative process. The House and Senate have different rules regarding the germaneness of amendments, with the House requiring amendments to be germane unless waived by a special rule, while the Senate only requires germaneness for certain types of measures or after invoking cloture. Senate may also impose germaneness requirements through unanimous consent agreements with exceptions for specific nongermane amendments. The House and Senate have different rules on amendment germaneness. The Senate may pass a House bill with nongermane amendments, which can be included in a conference report. This could lead to the House voting on nongermane matters not debated or considered by House committees. The House has a remedy in House Rule XXII, clause 10. Clause 10 of House Rule XXII allows the House to address nongermane matter from the Senate separately. A Member can raise a point of order against such matter in a conference report or motion related to a Senate amendment. If the point of order is sustained, the Member can move to reject the nongermane matter. The House may reject nongermane matter in a conference report, with the motion being debatable for 40 minutes. If the House votes to reject, the report is considered rejected. The decision to retain nongermane language can be based on support from Representatives or to avoid jeopardizing the entire bill due to Senate insistence. The House can reject nongermane matter in a conference report, leading to a vote on amending the Senate amendment with the remainder of the conference agreement. If the Senate accepts the House amendment, resolution is reached; if not, a new conference may be requested. This process allows for separate consideration of nongermane Senate matter without imposing one chamber's will on the other. Members may make motions if the House rejects nongermane matter in a conference report or in a motion to recede and concur in a Senate amendment. These motions allow the House to amend the Senate amendment or request a new conference to resolve disagreements."
