One theory suggests that these collapses are cyclical and may be inevitable during prolonged bull markets, where fraud can thrive due to less investor monitoring and regulatory vigilance. Eventually, investor skepticism and regulatory oversight return, restoring balance until the next cycle. The corporate scandals of the early 21st century have led to speculation on their causes and efforts by legislators and regulators to implement reforms. One theory suggests that these collapses are cyclical and may be inevitable during prolonged bull markets, where fraud can thrive due to less investor monitoring and regulatory vigilance. The \"perfect storm\" theory attributes the fraud to a confluence of historical circumstances in the late 1990s, including the booming new technology sector, new financial strategies, demographic changes, and an irrational exuberant stock market. This report focuses on internal controls on American corporations. The report examines controls on American corporations to prevent corporate fraud, including corporate governance, ethics, managerial structure, and external regulations. It discusses competing explanations for corporate scandals: the cycle theory vs. the perfect storm theory, which influences public policy responses. If fraud is seen as cyclical, post-Enron scandals reveal weaknesses in laws and regulations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed by Congress in response to corporate scandals, seen as either an over-reaction or a necessary first step. The 109th Congress may consider laws affecting various financial institutions. Boards of directors oversee corporations, with laws mandating approval for major decisions. The board of directors approves major company decisions, such as stock issuance, dividends, mergers, and executive pay. They can also take action in times of crisis to protect shareholders' interests. Shareholders elect directors based on the number of shares held. Legislative and regulatory activity has focused on the board's role in preventing fraud, but limitations exist due to part-time members relying on management. Management has been allowed to \"capture the mechanics of corporate governance\" and has created a power dynamic \"relatively unchecked by weak exit and non-existent voice.\" Corporate actors are reluctant to walk away from a corporation engaged in improper practices. Shareholders often approve directors nominated by management without opposition. Attempts to replace management through electing a new slate of directors are rare. Boards of directors are criticized for providing rubber stamp approval for management due to the selection process. Directors may have conflicts of interest due to their relationships with management or serving on multiple boards. The selection process for board members may lead to conflicts of interest and hinder effective monitoring of management. CEO-directors are less likely to challenge current management, making change difficult as more CEOs serve on the board. Personal relationships often influence board appointments, making it challenging for directors to protest managerial actions. The need for a collegial atmosphere on the board conflicts with the necessity for tough questioning in cases of suspected fraud. Consensus between management and directors is crucial for company planning, but forcing directors into a stronger monitoring role may create discord. Independent directors, required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, are meant to provide impartial judgement. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that a board's audit committee must consist entirely of independent directors. The Nasdaq and NYSE require companies to have a majority of independent directors on their boards, with strict criteria for independence. Directors must have no material relationship with the company, and disclosures are necessary. The independence of a director is not established until three years after the end of any employment relationship with the company. This includes receiving over $100,000 per year in compensation, being affiliated with an auditor, or having a family member employed by the company. A director is not considered \"independent\" until three years after the end of any employment relationship with the company, if they or their family member is an executive officer of another company where the listed company's executives serve on the compensation committee. Additionally, if a director or their family member is an executive officer of a company that makes significant payments to or receives payments from the listed company, they are also not considered \"independent\" until three years after falling below a certain threshold. CALPERS has a broader definition of \"independence\" compared to the NYSE. CALPERS guidelines define independence for directors, including restrictions on relationships with the corporation and not-for-profit entities. SEC Commissioner Glassman questions the effectiveness of independent directors in overseeing corporate management. The effectiveness of independent directors in overseeing corporate management is questioned by SEC Commissioner Glassman. The heightened independence of the Board has not prevented subsequent crises, and there is no clear correlation between independence and performance. Reform efforts have produced mixed results, as there is no one optimal configuration for a board. Regulators must consider the various ways boards can function within a corporation, as they serve dual roles as managers and monitors. SEC Commissioner Glassman emphasizes the importance of balancing the dual roles of boards in a corporation as managers and monitors. Regulatory reforms should ensure that boards can effectively provide strategic guidance while also being able to ask tough questions and take independent action when necessary. Continued focus on director independence may hinder a board's ability to fulfill managerial duties and recruit the best-fit board members. The focus on director independence may hinder a board's ability to recruit the best-fit members, especially in specialized industries where relevant experience is limited. The dual role of CEO and chairman poses a threat to board independence. The dual role of CEO and chairman poses a threat to board independence as it may lead to a lack of oversight and monitoring of management decisions. Appointing a director with power to offset the CEO or appointing other directors to represent management's views can help relieve the CEO of certain responsibilities while still allowing for constructive dialogue. Despite the emphasis on independence post-Enron, independent directors were unable to prevent Enron's collapse, even with a board composed mostly of outside directors. The board of Enron, despite being composed of independent directors, failed to prevent unethical practices such as suspending the code of ethics for personal gain and ignoring whistleblower concerns. The Senate Subcommittee found the board guilty of breaching fiduciary duty, approving conflicting situations, tolerating risky accounting policies, and creating excessive compensation plans. The Enron board failed to challenge management's devastating actions and lacked independence in financial ties with directors. They also neglected to monitor the outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. Corporate officers play a crucial role in daily operations, setting long-term goals, and shaping the organization's culture and employee behavior. In corporate governance, the behavior of corporate officers and managers is influential, as they hold significant power and autonomy. The challenge lies in creating incentives that promote ethical behavior among managers. The agency problem, as explored by Berle and Means, arises from the separation of management and ownership in corporations. The Enron scandal highlighted the importance of independent oversight and monitoring of corporate actions. In closely-held corporations, owners' and managers' interests are aligned, unlike in publicly held corporations where ownership is dispersed. To ensure ethical behavior, corporate governance practices and securities laws provide incentives and penalties to align managerial interests with shareholder wealth creation. The problem of division between ownership and control in corporations can be addressed by giving managers company stock. Stock-based executive compensation is supported as a corporate governance tool, with CEOs receiving significant amounts of stock. Research on the impact of this shift on corporate performance is mixed. The post-Enron scandals suggest that executive pay policies have not deterred fraud by corporate managers. The failure of pay practices to improve ethical standards in corporations is attributed to the significant bargaining power of CEOs in negotiating their employment contracts. The oversight of CEO contract negotiations by the board of directors is limited, leading to a conflict of interest between the board and top management. This can result in a propensity for corporate managers to engage in fraud due to agency problems. Directors in large corporations have a strong incentive to secure their reappointment to the board, with average compensation reaching $102,000 in 2003. In cases like Enron, directors were paid up to $380,000 annually. The relationship between CEOs and boards is mutually determined, with CEOs often influencing board membership through the nominations process. Directors represent shareholders, but shareholders do not have a meaningful say in selecting directors. Directors in large corporations have a strong incentive to secure their reappointment to the board, with average compensation reaching $102,000 in 2003. In cases like Enron, directors were paid up to $380,000 annually. The relationship between CEOs and boards is mutually determined, with CEOs often influencing board membership through the nominations process. Shareholders do not have a meaningful say in selecting directors, as the slate proposed by management generally passes by a near-unanimous vote. Directors must maintain good relations with management to keep their positions, leading to limited control over CEO behavior through pay-setting powers. Stock-based compensation is common in large U.S. firms to align managerial interests with shareholder interests. Stock-based compensation has become common in large U.S. firms to align managerial interests with shareholders. However, excessive stock-based pay can lead to managers prioritizing their own financial interests over the company's long-term success. This was evident in cases like Enron, where managers issued false accounting statements to protect their substantial equity stakes before the company's financial problems became public. In the 18 months after January 1, 2001, the 25 highest-paid insiders at the 25 largest U.S. businesses that declared bankruptcy had earned $3.3 billion since 1999, highlighting the potential conflicts of interest that can arise with excessive stock-based compensation. Insiders earned $3.3 billion since 1999, while shareholder value declined by $211 billion and 94,000 jobs were lost. Stock and options as incentives have drawbacks, with managers needing new options or shares after selling stock. Restrictions on cashing out equity incentives vary among companies, with some allowing managers to unload holdings during trading windows. Bonus pay based on financial performance can create incentives. Some argue that bonus pay based on financial performance creates better incentives than stock-based compensation, as it may lead to less risky behavior. Critics of bonus pay claim that it can result in short-term thinking and hinder long-term growth. Sanders and Hambrick's study on CEO pay structure found that reliance on bonus pay does not negatively impact long-term investment or firm performance. Executive stock option plans show a nonlinear pattern in their effects. Sanders and Hambrick discovered a nonlinear pattern in the effects of executive stock option plans on firm performance. While moderate levels of option plans have a positive impact, higher levels can lead to significant costs for stockholders. The imbalance of power between CEOs and shareholders allows managers to influence their pay, resulting in compensation arrangements that may generate worse incentives than arm's length contracts. This managerial influence can lead to the adoption of compensation packages with weak or perverse incentives, ultimately reducing shareholder value. The economic impact of CEO pay can be significant, with studies showing CEO compensation averaging 7.89% of corporate profits in 2000. Public outrage can serve as a check on excessive CEO compensation, leading to reductions in pay for criticized CEOs. Efforts to \"camouflage\" executive pay packages have been observed, with examples like Jack Welch's retirement package at General Electric drawing criticism. The current executive compensation landscape is criticized for its frequent issues. Some argue that lack of transparency in executive compensation leads to unethical conduct. Critics believe CEO pay has become excessively high, creating a sense of entitlement among executives. Paul Volcker criticizes corporate greed despite some improvement in discipline post-Sarbanes-Oxley. Corporate officers have a legal duty to act in the best interest of the company. Corporate officers have a legal fiduciary duty to the corporation and its owners, with shareholders expecting decisions to prioritize profit maximization. Some argue for expanding the fiduciary concept to include stakeholders beyond owners, such as suppliers, customers, employees, and the local community. Management must address stakeholder protection issues as corporate agents. Stakeholder protection is crucial in corporate management, with managers having a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of stakeholders and the corporation. However, this relationship can lead to ethical conflicts and be used to justify unethical behavior. The balance between stakeholders' interests and the corporation's survival is essential but often challenging to maintain. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act increased accountability for CEOs and CFOs in SEC reporting and fraud-related offenses. Stakeholder theory emphasizes balance among stakeholders for the firm's survival, with no group given primacy. Management must foster an environment that acknowledges all parties' stake in the firm's survival. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act increased accountability for CEOs and CFOs in SEC reporting and fraud-related offenses. Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 require the company's CEO and CFO to certify the accuracy of financial statements and establish disclosure controls and procedures. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates CEOs and CFOs to certify financial statements and establish disclosure controls and procedures to ensure material information is disclosed. Certifying officers must evaluate and disclose any significant deficiencies in internal controls that could impact financial reporting. Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires CEOs and CFOs to certify financial statements, disclose internal control weaknesses, and report any fraud involving key employees. Failure to comply can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million fine, 10 years in prison, or both. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes severe penalties for non-compliance, including fines of up to $5 million and imprisonment for up to 20 years for CEOs or CFOs who certify false financial statements. The Act also prohibits fraud against shareholders and increases penalties for corporate fraud. Auditors ensure financial statements adhere to GAAP, and SEC-regulated companies must have their financial statements certified by an independent auditor. The SEC delegates accounting standards responsibility to the private-sector FASB. FASB has been criticized for slow standard promulgation and industry closeness. Sarbanes-Oxley Act funds FASB independently. AIPCA oversaw auditors and standards before Enron. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act created the PCAOB to oversee auditors and enforce auditing standards. The PCAOB issues rules for auditing practice, ethics, and independence, monitors compliance, and investigates violations with fines or suspensions. The SEC can also discipline accountants for unethical conduct. The Professional Ethics Division within the AICPA can investigate allegations of unethical conduct and bar accountants from membership. State boards of accountancy have varying approaches to discipline, with limited resources for monitoring professionals. The AICPA may not act aggressively against accountants in established firms. Auditors play a crucial role in certifying financial statements of corporations, ensuring effective risk management and internal control systems are in place. They provide \"reasonable assurance\" that financial statements are fairly represented, acting as \"watchdogs\" for investors and creditors. The benefits of effective monitoring include transparent financial statements and the ability to use unbiased financial accounting numbers in contracts. An audit provides reasonable assurance against material misstatements in financial statements, but does not guarantee error or fraud prevention. Investors often mistakenly believe audits provide absolute assurance against fraud, leading to expectations exceeding actual assurance provided. Scholars debate whether auditors may have an incentive to certify false financial statements. Maintaining a high professional reputation is seen as a strong incentive for auditors to not endorse questionable statements. Judge Easterbrook and Professor John Coffee emphasize the importance of auditors' reputation for honesty and careful work in preventing fraud. In 1990, Columbia law professor John Coffee discussed the importance of auditors vouching for a corporation's statements, highlighting their credibility and reputational capital. Despite the gatekeeper rationale, there is evidence that auditors may acquiesce in managerial fraud for profit. Auditors may acquiesce in managerial fraud for profit, either unintentionally due to biased judgments or intentionally to maintain profitable relationships with clients. The auditor's business interests in fostering long-term relationships with clients encourage them to provide misleading audit opinions. Barrett highlights the pressure on auditors to provide 'clean' audit opinions to maintain client relationships and secure future business. The audit process involves the internal audit committee overseeing the firm's financial reporting, selecting the external auditor, and questioning all parties involved to ensure the firm's best interests are being served. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a role in approving final audit reports. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) approved final corporate governance rules for companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ on November 4, 2003. The rules outline responsibilities of internal audit committees, including overseeing external auditors, handling complaints, reviewing reports, discussing financial statements, evaluating risk policies, and establishing hiring policies. The NASDAQ rules require the internal audit committee to review and approve related-party transactions. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that the audit committee must have at least three independent members, with one being a financial expert. Financial literacy is essential for all audit committee members to understand accounting judgments and issues. The internal auditor provides ongoing assessment of a company's accounting methods and results, with a focus on important accounting judgments and decisions made by management. Charles Elson argues that the internal auditor should report to the audit committee, emphasizing the need for oversight and understanding of management's discretion in affecting reported income. The internal audit function should report to the audit committee, composed of independent members. The audit committee can outsource internal audit to an accounting firm, but not to the same firm as the external auditor. External auditors certify that financial statements follow GAAP and have not misled investors. External auditors, like internal auditors, assess financial reporting and provide an outside check. Firms must hire an external auditor to certify financial statements, as mandated by law. Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC regulations have led to changes in auditor oversight since the Enron scandal. Debate continues on reform steps, including prohibiting external auditors from also serving as internal auditors. The SEC rule effective May 6, 2003, prohibits external auditors from serving as outsourced internal auditors to maintain independence. There is debate on whether outsourcing internal audits to external audit firms should be allowed, with proponents citing improved services at lower costs as a reason. External auditors are believed to have updated expertise and resources that can lead to cost-effective internal audits. Outsourcing internal audits to external auditors can lower costs for companies and allow management to focus on directing the company. However, some argue that in-house auditors are more likely to uncover fraud within the organization, as shown in a 1998 KPMG survey. Key factors in detecting fraud include customer and employee notification and anonymous letters. Outsourcing internal audits to external auditors may not be as effective in detecting fraud compared to in-house auditors. A survey found that external auditors were less proactive and focused on adding value. Opponents argue that external auditors do not understand the business as well as internal auditors, leading to a lower likelihood of fraud detection. Additionally, outsourcing may not save costs in the long term due to limited price competition in the accounting industry. The new school of thought suggests expanding auditors' role to include non-financial risk management to detect fraud beyond financial statements manipulation. This approach emphasizes the importance of a strong external audit for fraud detection and financial discipline, advocating for an expanded audit scope to verify management statements on internal controls and performance indicators. Allen Blewitt, CEO of ACCA, and Dawn-Marie Driscoll, chair of the audit committee for Scudder Funds, emphasize the importance of non-financial indicators, risk management strategies, corporate governance practices, and human capital data in annual reports. They highlight the broadened responsibilities of audit committees to include managing risk and maintaining organizational integrity. The Sarbanes-Oxley auditor independence provisions restrict outside auditors from certain activities. The Sarbanes-Oxley auditor independence provisions prohibit outside auditors from performing various non-audit services for their audit clients to prevent conflicts of interest. Strengthening auditor independence rules was a key recommendation following the post-Enron scandals. The law prohibits accounting firms from providing certain non-audit services to their audit clients to maintain independence. However, they can still offer approved services like tax work. There is concern that this practice may compromise the external auditor's independence, as seen in the case of Enron's tax practices involving Arthur Andersen. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act aims to maintain auditor independence by restricting accounting firms from providing certain non-audit services to their audit clients. However, concerns remain about potential compromises, such as auditors being hired by the audit committee but still influenced by management in the hiring process. The hope for a more central role for audit committees in the auditor-client relationship may lead to dashed expectations. The audit committee's role in fee disputes, scope questions, and reporting debates needs clarification. There may be conflicts between independence standards and the need for financial experts with auditing experience on the committee. Auditors and audit committees must be vigilant against potential compromises. Corporations hire legal counsel for compliance with laws and regulations, including transactional work and litigation purposes. Directors may have close relationships with audit firms, increasing the risk of conflict of interest. Auditors and audit committees must be vigilant against potential compromises. The role of attorneys in preventing and detecting fraud is discussed in relation to state and federal regulations, self-regulation methods, civil malpractice suits, and criminal prosecution. Inside and outside corporate attorneys are governed by the same rules, but in-house attorneys have a unique perspective due to their role within the organization. State and local bar associations play a key role in setting ethical standards for attorneys. The American Bar Association (ABA) is a leading organization in developing ethical standards for lawyers, with 400,000 members representing half of all practicing lawyers in the US. Founded in 1878, the ABA aims to achieve high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct through the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The ABA's Canons of Professional Ethics, adopted in 1908, have been enforced by courts as binding legal rules. The ABA Model Rules, adopted in 1908, have been enforced by courts as binding legal rules. At least 39 states have adopted the Model Rules, which can be altered by states. In 1997, the ABA began a project to revise the Model Rules, and changes were recommended after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The ABA leads in ethical behavior rules, but it's up to state bar associations and courts to adopt and enforce them. Most states have mandatory bar associations that license attorneys and provide professional discipline, including disbarment for serious offenses. Attorneys can be sued for malpractice and are subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or breaking laws. The governance of lawyers involves the ABA, state bar associations, judiciary, civil lawsuits, criminal and civil laws, and government regulations. This section focuses on ethical rules, federal legislation, and agency regulations. The ABA Model Rule 1.6 governs attorney-client confidentiality, allowing disclosure only in specific circumstances like defending against malpractice or preventing imminent harm. Financial crimes do not typically warrant disclosure unless they pose a threat of imminent death or substantial bodily harm. The ABA amended MR 1.6 in 2003 to allow attorneys to disclose confidential client information in cases involving financial crimes that could result in substantial injury to others' financial interests. This expansion of exceptions to client confidentiality was a response to corporate scandals like Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco. The ABA expanded the exception to client confidentiality in cases of financial crimes causing substantial harm to others' financial interests. Attorneys can now disclose client information without consent if the client used their services for fraud. This change was made in response to corporate scandals like Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco. The duty of confidentiality under MR 1.6 may conflict with obtaining future business from corporate clients if financial fraud is disclosed. The duty of diligent representation under MR 1.3 requires advising clients of potential illegality and investigating allegations thoroughly. Identifying the client, especially for corporate attorneys, can be complex. The client for a corporate attorney is unclear under current ABA ethical rules. Issues of diligence in representation arise in the context of legal representation of Enron, where lack of accounting knowledge was used as an excuse for not catching fraud. Some argue that corporate attorneys need better knowledge of accounting principles post-Enron. Vinson & Elkins, the law firm representing Enron, may argue that they did not have a complete picture of Enron's fraudulent activities as the company used multiple outside firms for legal work. Despite a decrease in their share of Enron's legal work, V&E remained the go-to firm for sensitive projects. They were hired by Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to investigate whistleblower allegations, raising concerns about the independence of their investigation. V&E's investigation into whistleblower allegations at Enron, approved by General Counsel Jim Derrick, raised concerns about their diligence. Despite V&E's conclusion of no fraudulent acts, subsequent events cast doubt on the adequacy of their representation. Enron's significant financial contribution to V&E in 2001 further questions the independence of their investigation. V&E received roughly $35.6 million from Enron in 2001, raising concerns about their ability to provide independent legal advice. Conflicts of interest arose, such as allowing Enron's board to waive conflict rules for CFO Fastow and conducting a review of whistleblower memo without insisting on an unbiased law firm. Enron's internal counsel also faced conflicts, like Enron attorney Kristina Mordaunt receiving a significant return on an investment in an Enron-related entity. Mordaunt received a $1 million return on a $5,800 investment in an Enron-related SPE, raising concerns about her ability to provide independent legal advice. Recent changes in attorney rules may impact behavior regarding reporting financial fraud. The American Bar Association amended MR 1.13, allowing attorneys to report illegal actions to the highest authority in the organization. The attorney can disclose confidential client information if the highest authority in the organization does not address concerns promptly and if the lawyer believes the violation will cause significant harm to the organization. Disclosure is optional, not mandatory, and exempt from confidentiality requirements under the amended MR 1.13. The new MR 1.13 exempts information disclosure if the organization's highest authority doesn't act promptly and harm is imminent. ABA MR 1.16 discusses attorney withdrawal provisions. Corporate attorneys face ambiguity balancing obligations to the corporation and its constituents. Sarbanes-Oxley Act led to SEC rule changes in 2003. The SEC rules adopted in 2003 require attorneys to report evidence of fraud within the client corporation. If no action is taken, the attorney must withdraw from representing the issuer and notify the Commission promptly. The SEC rules adopted in 2003 require attorneys to report evidence of fraud within the client corporation. If no action is taken, the attorney must withdraw from representing the issuer and notify the Commission promptly. The attorney must report evidence of a material violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty by the issuer up-the-ladder within the company, and if necessary, to the audit committee. The \"noisy withdrawal\" provisions were controversial but not included in the final rule. Proposed Part 205 aims to ensure attorneys report evidence of misconduct to the audit committee or board of directors to protect investors. The \"noisy withdrawal\" provision, which would require attorneys to inform the SEC when withdrawing from representing a client, is still under consideration and has faced opposition from many attorneys. The \"noisy withdrawal\" rule would force attorneys to disclose large-scale corporate client fraud, potentially leading to loss of clients and disrupting the attorney-client relationship. Many corporate law firms oppose this rule, fearing it could harm their trust-based relationships with clients. Despite its potential benefits in SEC investigations, the rule has not been formally proposed since 2003. Attorneys play a crucial role as gatekeepers against corporate fraud, but their options for reporting suspicions are limited. Recent changes to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct have made it easier for attorneys to disclose confidential client information regarding financial fraud. However, attorneys are not required to report such crimes, and fear of job loss or damage to their reputation may prevent many from doing so. The SEC rules direct attorneys to report securities violations up the corporate ladder but do not address fraud prevention within corporations involving officers, managers, and boards of directors. The proposed SEC \"noisy withdrawal\" rule aims to address fraud prevention in corporations with corrupt management by requiring attorneys to alert the SEC if withdrawing due to unaddressed allegations of financial fraud. However, negative feedback from corporate law firms may hinder its adoption. The controversy highlights the challenges of attorneys acting as whistleblowers or gatekeepers against corporate fraud, given the strong tradition of attorney-client confidentiality. Examples like Enron demonstrate the risks faced by corporate lawyers in such situations. The Enron scandal shows the consequences of corporate lawyers prioritizing dishonest corporate officers over the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. Employees play a crucial role in preventing fraud by feeling responsible to report any wrongdoing within the company. A supportive corporate culture that protects whistleblowers and takes their reports seriously is essential in fostering a transparent environment. Individuals in organizations may feel their personal responsibility is limited, reducing perceived complicity in unethical behavior. Pressure tactics like threats of termination or reminders of imminent performance reviews can be used to ensure compliance with questionable decisions. Compensation packages often depend on performance measures that could be negatively impacted by revealing wrongdoing. Enron employees, including Sherron Watkins, raised concerns about the company's questionable business practices and accounting methods. Despite objections from various departments and even Enron's legal counsel, those who spoke up were often pressured to stay silent or transferred to different divisions. The focus at Enron was on future growth and profits, even at the expense of ethical considerations. Enron's corporate culture valued risk-taking and pushing boundaries, with a focus on future deals and profits. Whistleblower protections have since been enhanced at federal and state levels, with Sarbanes-Oxley offering remedies for employees wrongfully discharged for participating in federal investigations. However, these protections are limited to publicly traded companies under the SEC's jurisdiction. The recent wave of corporate scandals has renewed focus on government agencies' role in detecting and preventing corporate fraud. State laws vary in whistleblower protection, with Texas ruling that state employees are protected but not private company employees. Despite limited legal recourse, whistleblowers like Sherron Watkins can pursue legal action to expose wrongdoing. The objective of government regulation is to change behavior to protect consumers, competitors, suppliers, distributors, and workers. Congress and the President decide on agency resources for carrying out their legal mandate. Critical issues include fraud detection and prevention by federal regulatory agencies like the SEC and FERC. The Enron scandal highlights the limited role of federal agencies in recent corporate scandals. The SEC, FERC, CFTC, and DOJ have been criticized for their role in detecting fraud and preventing corporate scandals. Critics point to problems in agency mission, authority, regulatory capture, and capacity. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) aims to link agency budgets to concrete outcomes. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) helps regulatory agencies define their mission and link budget requests to outcomes. However, GPRA has been criticized for not identifying extreme risks, such as inter-agency matters. The SEC, FERC, and DOJ failed to prioritize fraud detection in their strategic plans from 1993 to 2001. The DOJ branches responsible for investigating white-collar crimes also did not prioritize corporate fraud. The DOJ's Tax Division, FBI, and U.S. Attorney's Office handle civil and criminal matters under internal revenue laws. The DOJ's strategic plan did not initially prioritize corporate fraud, but after corporate scandals, it refocused on prosecuting white-collar crime. The President's Corporate Fraud Task Force was created in 2002 to improve the discovery and prosecution of corporate fraud. The DOJ's Enron Task Force, established in January 2002, promotes interagency cooperation in investigating and prosecuting criminal matters related to the collapse of Enron. It includes prosecutors, FBI agents, and IRS agents coordinating with the SEC, CFTC, and other government agencies. Some Enron managers and employees have been indicted for criminal offenses. Regulatory agencies may lack authority to prevent fraud in certain financial markets like foreign exchange and hedge funds due to limited federal regulation. In unregulated markets, wealthy, sophisticated, and professional investors are presumed to protect themselves from fraud. Congress and regulators are hesitant to impose government regulation that could increase costs without clear public benefit. However, scandals can lead to calls for stricter federal oversight, as seen in the Treasury and municipal securities markets in the 1990s. After Enron, there were proposals for more regulations on dealers in unregulated energy derivatives. U.S. financial markets have evolved with new instruments and trading markets in recent decades. In recent decades, U.S. financial markets have seen the emergence of new instruments and trading markets, some of which are unregulated. Regulatory agencies struggle to pursue fraud in these new markets due to unclear authority and lack of advance detection mechanisms. The SEC has proposed a rule to require hedge funds to register as investment advisers to address investor protection issues, but there is opposition due to concerns about costs outweighing benefits in improving antifraud capabilities. There is a trade-off between free markets with some fraud and government regulation that protects market participants but may hinder financial innovation. Policy makers adjust regulations in response to massive fraud, while turf wars among regulatory agencies can lead to less effective enforcement. Coordination issues among regulators holding shared jurisdiction can result in duplicate efforts or regulatory gaps. Some regulators are unsure when to involve the Department of Justice in fraud investigations. Senate investigators found that federal energy regulators failed to intervene in Enron's power market manipulations and financial weakness during the California energy crisis of 2001 due to confusion over legal jurisdiction. The issue of unclear regulatory jurisdiction has been extensively studied, with suggestions to consolidate agencies into a single regulator to adapt better to changes in financial markets. Critics argue that the current U.S. regulatory structure leads to regulatory balkanization. Some argue that regulatory balkanization is beneficial competition, reducing government intervention in free markets. Enron exploited regulatory gaps among FERC, SEC, and CFTC, as FERC failed to communicate with other agencies. With energy markets transforming due to deregulation, no agency could prevent fraud effectively. The CFTC had limited jurisdiction over futures exchange trading. The CFTC had limited authority over over-the-counter derivatives and unclear jurisdiction over fraud in physical commodity markets. FERC was slow to regulate deregulated energy markets, leading to challenges in monitoring trading during the Enron and California electricity crises. Multiple federal agencies brought charges against firms for price manipulation, highlighting the difficulty in overseeing rapidly evolving markets. Regulators face challenges in keeping up with rapidly evolving markets, risking outdated regulations or missed opportunities for fraud prevention. Regulatory capture can occur when industry values influence regulatory agencies, leading to ineffective oversight. Regulatory capture occurs when industry gains control over regulatory agencies, leading to ineffective oversight. Interest groups use various means to influence government decision-making, such as monetary bribes, future employment opportunities, personal relationships, and catering to the agency's desires. Regulatory agencies may refrain from strict oversight to support industry growth, potentially leading to ineffective regulation. Turf wars between agencies can also result in actions that benefit their respective industries. In the 1980s, the CFTC and SEC clashed over jurisdiction regarding stock index products, leading to a deadlock that spilled into Congress. The outcome would determine whether these products were traded on stock exchanges or CFTC-regulated futures exchanges, impacting large sums of money for the industries involved. Regulatory agencies may face challenges during times of tight fiscal policy or when there is a push for less government intervention. During times of tight fiscal policy, regulatory agencies may face budget constraints or hiring freezes, leading to cutbacks in anti-fraud activities. This includes a decrease in \"scouting\" investigations within the agency itself. Underfunded agencies tend to focus on high-profile cases rather than launching expensive probes into potential fraud areas. The scouting function is crucial for detecting and preventing fraud. The SEC is a notable example of a regulatory agency facing these challenges. The SEC faced challenges due to inadequate system capacity, limited staff resources, high turnover, and low pay, which hindered their ability to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The agency struggled to review filings and applications adequately, with only about 8% of overall filings being reviewed by 2000. SEC chairmen regularly requested more funds to retain qualified personnel who could earn higher salaries on Wall Street. The SEC faced challenges with inadequate system capacity, limited staff resources, high turnover, and low pay. Congress approved a \"pay parity\" plan in 2001, but funding was delayed. The SEC's budget increased significantly after the Enron scandals, reaching $913 million for FY2005. The regulatory failure to prevent fraud cannot be attributed to any single policy, agency, or individual. Future attempts to reform regulatory agencies may be more effective by considering the full range of current and potential problems, rather than seeking a \"silver bullet\" solution. The separation between investment bankers and analysts has been required by SEC regulations since the 1960s to avoid conflicts of interest in selling securities to the public. The \"Chinese Wall\" regulations enforced a separation between investment bankers and analysts to maintain objectivity. This arrangement limited contacts between the two departments, with most firms ensuring they were located on different floors. Questions about analyst objectivity arose after the collapse of tech stocks and scandals like Enron in 2001. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer launched an investigation into analyst conduct. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer investigated analyst conduct at New York investment banks using the Martin Act. He alleged that Merrill Lynch analysts issued positive reports on technology companies they were selling, despite negative private opinions. Internal emails revealed discrepancies in their ratings, with top-rated companies being described as \"a piece of junk\" internally. The SEC launched an inquiry into conflicts of interest among Wall Street analysts following charges against Merrill Lynch by Spitzer. This led to a global settlement with major investment banking firms, including fines of $1.4 billion and reforms in analyst compensation practices and disclosures. Sarbanes-Oxley Act's Title V aimed to address analyst conflicts of interest by restricting prepublication clearance of research or recommendations. The SEC adopted new rules to restrict prepublication clearance of research by investment bankers, limit supervision of research personnel, and protect securities analysts from retaliation. Regulation AC requires disclosure of stock ownership, income from discussed companies, business dealings, and compensation tied to investment banking revenue. Regulation AC mandates that brokers, dealers, and certain associated persons include certifications by research analysts in research reports to ensure the accuracy of their views. Analysts must disclose compensation received for specific recommendations. A 2004 study shows that SEC reforms have reduced the optimism bias of analysts employed by investment banks compared to independent analysts. The issue of bias in corporate scandals and stock market fluctuations highlights how abusive practices can persist as an \"open secret\" among market participants. Questions arise about the SEC's lack of aggressive action and whether it reflects a systemic problem of regulators focusing on individual acts of misbehavior rather than hidden systemic issues. Criminal prosecutions related to corporate fraud are intriguing due to the puzzlement surrounding the actions of corporate managers. White-collar crime, coined by Edwin Sutherland in 1939, involves crimes committed by individuals of high social status in their occupations. Some argue it is a form of organized crime, making prosecution challenging due to wealth and respectability. Officials argue that white-collar crime is a form of organized crime, defined as economically motivated illicit activity involving two or more individuals. This definition aligns with corporate fraud, highlighting factors like ongoing criminal activity, conspiracy, and corruption. Other definitions distinguish organized crime from white-collar crime by emphasizing the non-violent nature of the latter, focusing on financial gain through deception by individuals in professional or entrepreneurial roles. White-collar crime involves deception for financial gain by individuals with professional skills, not necessarily violent, and is a subset of organized crime. It often involves ongoing deceitful acts in corporate fraud, leading to distorted risk/reward calculations in financial transactions due to moral hazard. The risk/reward calculus is distorted by moral hazard, where gains from risks benefit one party while losses are borne by another. This phenomenon is often seen in cases of deposit insurance and government safety nets. Moral hazard is linked to the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s and is a factor in corporate fraud cases. It raises questions about distinguishing between moral hazard and criminal intent in risk-taking behavior. White-collar crimes involve breaching fiduciary duty of loyalty and are difficult to detect and prosecute due to their complexity. Detecting vulnerabilities in the system attractive to criminals is crucial, but infrequent prosecution and resource allocation to anti-terrorism programs pose challenges in combating these crimes. Many investigators experienced in tracking financial schemes of white-collar crime now focus on terrorist group finances. Complex corporate structures and jurisdiction issues pose challenges. White-collar criminals' access to legal resources makes prosecution costly and less likely. Prosecutorial agencies prioritize successful prosecution with minimal cost, leading to reluctance in taking legal action even after uncovering crimes and identifying perpetrators. White-collar criminals are less averse to risk, making deterrence challenging. They often have high status and no criminal records. Anonymity in computer fraud allows for little deterrence and low detection probability. Sociologically, a person's identity within a company can influence their risk aversion. The integration of self-worth with employee identification motivates individuals to maintain valued business relationships within an organization. Deviating from accepted behavior may lead to isolation and ostracism, with whistleblowers often viewed as deviant. Prosecution is seen as a \"no lose\" proposition for politicians seeking elected office. Prosecution is a growth industry for politicians seeking office, with a focus on illegal drug activity. White-collar crime prosecutions are not growing, and success in the courtroom is crucial for advancement. Federal sentencing guidelines have shifted power to prosecutors from judges, impacting sentencing decisions. The shift in federal sentencing guidelines over the past two centuries has led to a change in the discretion of punishment from judges to prosecutors. This change aimed to address the disparity in sentencing for white-collar criminals, who typically received lighter sentences due to their social status. However, this shift has also reduced transparency in the decision-making process, with prosecution and sentencing strategies often predetermined before entering the courtroom. Attorney General William F. Smith during the Reagan Administration prioritized addressing violence over white-collar crime, a stance that has evolved in subsequent administrations. White-collar crime has been ranked lower in priority by administrations, despite more victims being identified compared to violent crime. In 2000, 24 million people were victims of fraud, but only 82,077 fraud offenses were prosecuted. The cost impact of white-collar crime is significant due to low chances of getting caught and high expenses in prosecution. In fiscal 2003, the FBI received $4.3 billion, with $540.3 million for Counter-Terrorism, Counterintelligence, Cybercrime, and other programs. The National White Collar Crime Center reported FBI actions recovered $383 million and referred $330 million in tax fraud cases to the IRS. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spent $182 million in FY2001, recovering $1.385 billion, but estimates show over $12 billion in improper payments, with $10.6 billion paid to undeserving providers in one year.

Criminal justice policy is driven by public perception of crime, leading to record incarceration levels and significant costs to taxpayers. Media coverage of blue-collar crimes influences policymakers to focus on retribution rather than rehabilitation, while white-collar crimes receive less attention in terms of tough strategies. The lack of a \"get tough\" strategy for white-collar crimes raises important research questions about the vulnerability of the criminal justice system, regulatory agencies, and corporate governance procedures. White-collar crimes involving money and lacking easily identified victims make it challenging to address with punitive tactics. The economic harm is spread over many individuals or firms, reducing political motivation for action. Options to address white-collar crime need to consider these complexities. The lack of a \"get tough\" strategy for white-collar crimes raises questions about increasing punishments. Observers suggest sentencing guidelines have caused imbalance in the court system, with less transparency in decision-making. More research and data collection are needed to determine the real impact of fraud on American citizens. The lack of a \"get tough\" strategy for white-collar crimes raises questions about increasing punishments. More research and data collection are needed to determine the real severity of the impact on American citizens. Existing instruments for measuring crime often fail to accurately assess white-collar crime rates due to survey construction and limited data collection mechanisms. Prosecution by the criminal justice system and civil litigation act as deterrents against fraud. The government can launch civil litigation against corporations or individuals, and private civil actions can also be taken for breaches of contract or other legal issues. Civil suits act as a deterrent to corporate fraud, with potential penalties including monetary fines, loss of employment, and disbarment. Recent trends have increased protections for corporate officers and boards from civil liability, but the impact of recent scandals like Enron remains to be seen as pending civil suits reach trial. Private actors can bring civil actions based on contract or tort against individuals or entities in response to corporate wrongdoing. In response to corporate wrongdoing, civil suits in tort are more common, based on the violation of legal duties. These actions can be brought against corporate managers or directors for breaches of legal duties owed to shareholders and the corporation. Corporate laws governing directors and officers vary among states, but some civil actions are based on federal securities laws. Shareholders are the most common plaintiffs in corporate fraud cases. In corporate fraud cases, shareholders are the most common plaintiffs. They can bring direct suits for injuries suffered as shareholders, join class-action suits, or file derivative actions on behalf of the corporation. Medical patients harmed by fraudulent practices can also be plaintiffs. The main defendants are corporate officers and board members. The SEC has the authority to create rules related to securities trading, such as Rule 10b-5 established in 1942. SEC Rule 10b-5, established in 1942, prohibits fraudulent statements by sellers of securities. It covers making untrue statements or omitting material facts in connection with securities trading. Litigation under this rule increased significantly until the Supreme Court's involvement. Litigation under Rule 10b-5 became more common until the Supreme Court began limiting its scope in 1975. The rule was broadly interpreted to cover various types of fraud and deception in securities issued by both private and public corporations. However, court decisions in 1975 and 1976 restricted the use of Rule 10b-5 in private securities litigation, requiring plaintiffs to prove intentional wrongdoing by the defendant. The Supreme Court rulings in 1977, 1991, and 1992 established limitations on Rule 10b-5, specifying that it only applied to cases involving deception, setting the statute of limitations, and requiring proof of causation for plaintiff's losses. Despite these limitations, private securities litigation under Rule 10b-5 remained common, partly due to a 1979 SEC amendment encouraging disclosure of forward-looking information. Congress acted in 1995 to further limit frivolous securities lawsuits. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) was passed by Congress to limit securities-related private litigation. It provided a safe harbor for corporate defendants regarding forward-looking statements and made procedural changes to securities lawsuits. Despite its implementation, the number of securities fraud cases has not significantly decreased, and class action suits have increased. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was passed in response to corporate fraud scandals like Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom. It created protections for whistleblowers in securities fraud cases and extended the statute of limitations for private suits. While it didn't introduce new private causes of action, some parts of the act could lead to civil lawsuits. 18 U.S.C. \u00a71350 requires CEOs and CFOs of publicly-held corporations to certify the accuracy of financial reports filed with the SEC, with criminal penalties for false certification. Shareholders could potentially bring civil actions against CEOs and CFOs for falsely certifying reports, as seen in precedent cases allowing private causes of action under federal securities law. The Supreme Court recognized the SEC's limited resources and allowed private civil actions for damages under federal securities law. However, recent Supreme Court decisions have restricted the creation of private causes of action. It is uncertain if Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will lead to private actions. State laws and the Model Business Corporations Act determine legal duties for corporate officers and directors. Directors of publicly-held corporations, whether independent or connected, are elected by shareholders and owe duties to the corporation and shareholders. The Model Business Corporations Act (MBCA) outlines these duties, including acting in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation. The duty of care requires directors to act with the care a reasonable person would in similar circumstances, with the common-law business judgment rule often protecting them even if this duty is breached. The business judgment rule presumes that directors act in good faith, shifting the burden to the plaintiff to prove otherwise in civil actions. Courts are hesitant to hold directors liable unless there is gross negligence, fraud, illegality, or a conflict of interest. In response to a 1985 Delaware Supreme Court ruling, legislatures passed \"raincoat statutes\" to protect directors from personal liability if they acted in good faith and did not breach their duty of loyalty or derive improper benefits. The recent trend is to shield directors from liability for breach of duty of care unless actions involve illegality, bad faith, or conflicts of interest. Directors can rely on expert opinions but cannot escape liability by knowingly relying on incorrect information. Directors have a duty of loyalty to the corporation, which includes being liable for self-dealing transactions and usurping corporate opportunities. Courts have recently allowed self-dealing transactions if terms are fair or approved by a majority of uninterested directors. Officers must act in the best interests of the corporation and disclose any conflicts of interest. MBCA \u00a78.42 outlines officers' duties to the corporation. Officers, like directors, owe duties to the corporation including acting in good faith, with care, and in the best interests of the corporation. They can rely on the opinions of experts and are protected by the business judgment rule. Both directors and officers are shielded from civil liability by various provisions. The curr_chunk discusses the business judgment rule, officers' and directors' reliance on employee and expert information, and raincoat statutes that shield directors from liability. It also touches on indemnification, insurance, and requirements for shareholder derivative suits as further protections. The business judgment rule is a key aspect of protecting directors and officers from personal liability in the corporate form. The business judgment rule is a common law concept that protects corporate directors and officers from liability by not scrutinizing their business decisions closely. It does not shield them from liability in cases of incompetence or fraud. The business judgment rule excuses directors and officers from liability for their decisions, as long as due care was used in the decision-making process. It provides a presumption of good faith, shifting the burden of proof to the plaintiff in civil cases. Indemnification and insurance further protect directors and officers. Indemnification and director and officer insurance protect directors and officers from personal expenses related to lawsuits in their official capacity. The MBCA addresses indemnification and insurance for officers and directors of a corporation, reimbursing them for defense expenses and legal fees. This protection is essential to attract qualified individuals to serve on corporate boards and as officers. Indemnification for officers and directors is essential to attract qualified individuals to serve on corporate boards. While officers and directors should be reimbursed for expenses in defending lawsuits, indemnification when found liable may go against public policy, according to the SEC. State laws govern indemnification, with most following the provisions of the MBCA. The MBCA provides conditions for a corporation to indemnify a director who is successful in defending a proceeding. The director must have acted in good faith and believed their actions were in the best interests of the corporation. The MBCA allows for indemnification of directors and officers under certain conditions. Directors must have acted in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification is mandatory in specific circumstances and permissive in others, with restrictions if the individual received an undue financial benefit or intentionally harmed the corporation. Under the MBCA, directors and officers can be indemnified unless they received an undue financial benefit, intentionally harmed the corporation, or violated a criminal law. Indemnification may not be available if found liable in a derivative suit, but some states allow it despite this, raising concerns about fraud prevention. D&O insurance can also provide protection for negligence, misconduct not involving dishonesty, and false statements, with exclusions for certain conduct. Recent corporate scandals and higher monetary settlements in class action suits have led to increased costs for D&O insurance premiums. Exclusions from D&O policies include conduct that is self-serving or egregious, insurable by other policies, and industry-specific \"laser exclusions.\" Derivative suits can be brought by individual shareholders on behalf of the corporation for harm done to the entity, providing a last protection from personal liability for officers and directors. Derivative suits can be brought by individual shareholders on behalf of the corporation for violations of securities laws and legal duties by officers and directors. Requirements must be met for a derivative suit, including making a demand on the current board of directors. This process is governed by state laws and has been subject to conflicting jurisprudence. In derivative suits, shareholders must make a demand on the corporation to bring a suit, which can be refused by the board of directors. Courts typically apply the business judgment rule when reviewing the board's decision to disallow a derivative suit. The board can also seek dismissal of a derivative suit if it believes it is not in the corporation's best interests. Shareholders are required to make a demand on the board before initiating a derivative suit, giving the board significant power in the process. Directors implicated in the suit usually do not participate in the decision to continue the suit. In derivative suits, shareholders may not participate in the vote to continue the suit if the majority of the board of directors are defendants. A Special Litigation Committee can be formed by uninterested directors to decide on the suit's continuation, with the possibility of asking the court to dismiss it. The application of the good faith presumption of the business judgment rule to the SLC's decision varies among jurisdictions, placing the burden of proof on the board of directors. The burden of proof in derivative litigation falls on the board of directors if the majority are interested, while shareholders must disprove the business judgment rule if the majority are not interested. Since 1984, boards have mostly decided against pursuing derivative suits, leading to debates about frivolous lawsuits and potential bias among directors. The culture of boards of directors and the self-interest of directors result in few derivative actions being pursued, leading to a decline in the number of derivative suits brought on behalf of corporations. This has raised concerns about potential bias among directors and the failure of corporate governance. Enron is facing numerous civil suits in federal and state court, with over 70 cases consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The suits include class action and derivative suits related to securities violations and breaches of legal duties. Key defendants include top executives like Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, as well as board members, accountants, and attorneys. Bankruptcy proceedings are also ongoing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Enron is facing a large number of civil suits related to securities violations and breaches of legal duties. Directors may argue reliance on expert opinions to avoid liability. D&O insurers are seeking to rescind coverage due to alleged inaccurate disclosures. Recent legislation and jurisprudence restrict private lawsuits and personal liability of corporate directors and officers to encourage accountability for corporate fraud. The liability of corporate directors and officers is restricted to encourage qualified individuals to sit on boards. Protections like raincoat provisions, business judgment rule, expert opinions, indemnification, D&O insurance, and directors' power in derivative suits limit accountability in civil litigation. Recent scandals like Enron may prompt a review of these protections. Systemic problems in recent corporate scandals involved failures within companies and regulatory bodies. Enron's case revealed issues such as auditors, analysts, and regulators being influenced, capacity problems at regulatory agencies, and media's inability to act as a watchdog. The Enron scandal involved biased analysts, incomplete information, management withholding documents, a pressure cooker corporate culture, a cutthroat peer review system, discouragement of whistleblowing, and hubris. Enron's downfall was fueled by hubris and a lack of oversight from the board, who allowed management to make risky decisions. The long bull market enabled companies to engage in control fraud, leading to the scandal. During this period, the long bull market allowed companies to hide financial troubles, while the technology boom fueled investor demand for new companies with optimistic forecasts but no revenue. Financial innovations and the shift towards consulting over auditing incentivized accounting firms to overlook irregularities. This environment contributed to accounting and management scandals. Some believe that accounting and management scandals are common when a period of market exuberance ends. The unique circumstances of the 1990s may have influenced the scope of the scandals, but similar dynamics have occurred before and may return. Others argue that the post-Enron reaction shows the system working to remove bad actors."
