    "content": "With recent high energy prices, there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting greater use of alternatives to petroleum fuels, particularly biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Federal support for biofuels, including tax incentives and grant programs, has been significant but many incentives expired in 2011. The ongoing congressional debate over budget deficits makes extending these incentives less likely. The report outlines federal programs providing incentives for biofuels, with six incentives expiring in 2011 and two set to expire in 2012. Administered by EPA since 2005, the Energy Policy Act established a renewable fuel standard for automotive fuels, requiring the use of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires the use of renewable fuels in transportation fuel, including ethanol and biodiesel. Fuel suppliers must include increasing amounts of renewable fuel in the national transportation fuel supply, reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. The RFS mandates the use of \"advanced biofuels\" with lower greenhouse gas emissions, with at least 21 billion gallons required to be advanced biofuel by 2022. EPA has issued rules for compliance and trading renewable fuel credits between suppliers. The EPA issued final rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in 2010, which included lifecycle analysis methods for categorizing fuels as advanced biofuels. The program is not a direct subsidy for biofuels plants but creates a guaranteed market to stimulate industry growth. Various tax credits and incentives for biofuels production expired at the end of 2011. Before the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, biofuels incentives were set to expire, including tariffs on ethanol imports and tax credits for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and ethanol. These incentives were extended through 2011, but support for further extensions was limited. Administered by the IRS, the program was established in 2005 and modified in 2008. Gasoline suppliers who blend ethanol benefit from this program. Gasoline suppliers blending ethanol eligible for 45 cents per gallon tax credit until December 31, 2011. Administered by IRS, established in 1990, extended and expanded in subsequent acts. The small ethanol producer credit, valued at 10 cents per gallon, expired on December 31, 2011. It could be claimed on the first 15 million gallons produced by producers with capacity below 60 million gallons per year. Established in 2005, extended and amended by subsequent acts, it was administered by the IRS. For more information, refer to IRS Publication 510, Chapter 2: Fuel Tax Credits and Refunds. The biodiesel tax credit, established in 2005, was valued at $1.00 per gallon for biodiesel producers until December 31, 2011. It was extended retroactively to cover fuel produced in 2010 by P.L. 111-312. The credit applied to biodiesel made from virgin agricultural products or recycled fryer grease. Administered by the IRS, more information can be found in IRS Publication 510, Chapter 2. The small agri-biodiesel producer credit, established in 2005, is valued at 10 cents per gallon for agri-biodiesel producers with production capacity below 60 million gallons per year. It can be claimed on the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced by a small producer in a given year until the end of 2011. The credit was extended by P.L. 111-312 to cover fuel produced in 2010. For more information, refer to IRS Publication 510. Producers of biomass-based diesel fuel (or producers of diesel/renewable biodiesel blends) with production capacity below 60 million gallons per year can claim a $1.00 per gallon tax credit until the end of 2011. Renewable diesel, produced through different processes, is ineligible for the biodiesel credits. The tax credit was expired at the end of 2009 and was extended by P.L. 111-312. The tax credit for producers of cellulosic biofuel, established in 2009, was extended by P.L. 111-312 to apply retroactively to fuel produced in 2010. Producers can claim $1.01 per gallon tax credit for cellulosic biofuel, with a reduced value of 46 cents per gallon for cellulosic ethanol. The credit applies to fuel produced after December 31, 2008. The tax credit for cellulosic biofuel producers, established in 2009, allows for a credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic biofuel, with a reduced value of 46 cents per gallon for cellulosic ethanol. The credit applies to fuel produced after December 31, 2008 and is administered by the Internal Revenue Service. The accelerated depreciation for cellulosic biofuel plants was expanded to include all cellulosic biofuel plants, not just those using enzymatic processes. The provision applies to plants acquired after December 20, 2006, and placed in service before January 1, 2013. Plants with binding acquisition contracts before December 20, 2006, do not qualify. The program was established in 2005 and has been extended and expanded through various acts. For more information, refer to the Senate Finance Committee's summary of the House-Senate agreement on tax, trade, health, and other provisions from December 7, 2006. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 provided a 30% credit for alternative fuel infrastructure installation, up to $30,000, including E85 infrastructure. Residential installations qualified for a $1,000 credit. Administered by the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the program had annual funding of $74 million in FY2009 and $245 million in FY2010, with an additional $150 million annually authorized for FY2009-FY2012.
