    "content": "The United States economy entered a recession in December 2007, deepening significantly in 2008. The government responded with various tools including monetary and budgetary policies, as well as the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 signed by President George W. Bush on February 13, 2008. In 2008, the government enacted the Economic Stimulus Act, providing \"recovery rebates\" for individuals and investment incentives for businesses. Additional responses included the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act creating the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Congress also passed the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act as a supplemental appropriations measure. The Creation and Unemployment Relief Act of 2008 (H.R. 7110) was introduced but faced a veto threat from President Bush. In 2009, President Obama and congressional leaders prioritized an economic recovery bill, using a supplemental appropriations act with mandatory spending and revenue components. This act was one of three major appropriations acts for FY2009, with another expected for overseas military operations. The Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) funded three regular appropriations acts for FY2009 for the full fiscal year. Continuing appropriations were provided through March 6, 2009, for activities covered by the remaining nine appropriations acts. An omnibus appropriations measure addressing the status of the remaining acts was postponed until after the economic recovery supplemental appropriations measure (ARRA) was completed. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105), was signed into law by President Obama on March 11, 2009, as P.L. 111-8. The House and Senate quickly passed the ARRA legislation in early 2009, with the House passing it on January 28 and the Senate on February 10. This swift action was facilitated by similar legislation introduced in the previous session. During the lame-duck sessions in late 2008, an economic stimulus proposal, the Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S. 3689), was introduced with $100.3 billion for infrastructure and other stimulus activities. The 110th Congress ended without further action on economic stimulus legislation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, H.R. 1, was introduced by Representative David Obey on January 26, 2009. It combined various legislative components approved by House committees, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. The House Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the broadband communications, energy, and health-related provisions on January 22, approved by unanimous consent. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 679, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, on January 21, approved by a vote of 35-22. The House began consideration of H.R. 1 on January 27 under a special rule reported by the House Rules Committee. The House adopted a special rule, H.Res. 92, with changes to the bill under a \"self-executing\" feature and limited further amendments. The amendments addressed state certification, the COPS program, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the National Mall Revitalization Fund, and family planning. Eight out of 11 amendments were accepted. The House accepted eight out of 11 proposed amendments to H.R. 1, while rejecting three others and a motion to recommit. The bill was passed on January 28 with amendments. Senate consideration took place over eight days starting on February 2. The first amendment offered was a substitute amendment incorporating previously approved legislative proposals. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 350, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, on January 27. The Senate considered 42 amendments, adopting 22 and rejecting 13, with final resolution addressed by amendment 570. Cloture was invoked on the amendment on February 9, and the Senate passed H.R. 1 on February 10. On February 10, the House and Senate agreed to hold a conference on the bill and appointed conferees. The House passed a motion to instruct conferees to not approve the final conference agreement unless the text has been available for 48 hours. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 1 had significant differences in scope that needed to be resolved. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the House version would increase the deficit by $820 billion over FY2009-FY2019, while the Senate version would increase it by $838 billion. The Senate version had a $19 billion higher deficit increase compared to the House version, with differences in discretionary outlays and funding for education. The conference report on H.R. 1 (H.Rept. 111-16) was filed on February 12, showing compromise levels between the House and Senate positions on spending decreases and revenue reductions. The overall impact of the bill on the deficit was lessened to $787 billion, below the initial House and Senate levels. The House took up the conference report on February 13. On February 13, the House and Senate both voted to approve the conference report on H.R. 1, with President Obama signing it into law on February 17, 2009 as P.L. 111-5. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) totaled over 400 pages and included a mix of discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue provisions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) included discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue provisions totaling almost $800 billion. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory spending funds entitlement programs. Revenue laws fall under the jurisdiction of specific committees in the House and Senate. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $800 billion for various programs to save or create 3.5 million jobs. Funding went to Cabinet-level departments, independent agencies, states, localities, and individuals through grants and direct assistance.

The estimated deficit impact of the act includes spending increases of $575.3 billion and revenue reductions of $211.8 billion. By the end of FY2011, 80.9% of total outlays are expected to occur. Mandatory spending occurs more quickly compared to discretionary spending. By FY2011, 91.3% of mandatory outlays ($243.8 billion) and 71.9% of discretionary outlays ($221.8 billion) are expected to occur. Revenue reductions totaled $64.8 billion in FY2009 and $180.1 billion in FY2010, exceeding the net reduction of $211.8 billion over 11 years. Modest revenue reductions occur in FY2011, followed by increases in subsequent years. ARRA consists of opening sections and two major divisions, with Division A covering supplemental appropriations for FY2009 and later years. Division A covers discretionary spending provisions and some significant substantive provisions, while Division B includes mandatory spending and revenue provisions. Division B also includes two non-budgetary titles: Broadband Technology Opportunities Program and Limits on Executive Compensation. Related provisions are discussed together in the summary sections, regardless of the division. Table 3 provides a contents listing of ARRA, with page references to the legislative text and explanatory statements. Division A of ARRA allocates $311.20 billion for various agencies and programs, following the structure of annual appropriations bills.

The appropriations are designated as emergency funding and available for obligation until September 30, 2010. Most accounts funded in Division A do not have different periods of obligation, except for some like the Inspectors General funding which typically has a longer period. The ARRA provides funding with varied periods of obligation for agencies, requiring them to notify Congress on how the money is spent. Each agency must submit a general plan within 30 days of enactment and a detailed project report within 90 days.

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 prohibited CSE incentive payments, but ARRA allows states to use them to draw down additional federal funds. ARRA also provides for a one-time economic recovery payment of $250 to eligible individuals who received benefits under specific programs. Eligible individuals, including disabled children of certain veterans, can receive a one-time economic recovery payment of $250.

The COBRA premium subsidy under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act covers 65% of the premium for eligible individuals, with the remaining 35% paid by the individual. The subsidy is available for those with a modified AGI of up to $125,000 for single filers ($250,000 for joint filers) and phases out for higher income individuals. If income exceeds specified levels, the subsidy amount will be recaptured during tax filing unless individuals waive their rights to the subsidy and pay the full premium. Division B of ARRA introduces incentive payments for healthcare providers adopting electronic health record (EHR) technology. Medicare and Medicaid providers could receive $32.7 billion in bonuses over 10 years. Starting in 2011, Medicare offers bonuses to physicians and hospitals using EHR technology, with physicians eligible for up to $44,000 in bonus payments. In addition to Medicare bonuses, ARRA authorizes a 100% federal match for Medicaid providers for the acquisition and meaningful use of EHR technology. Physician payments cover up to 85% of allowable EHR technology costs, capped at $63,750 over six years. The HITECH Act under ARRA authorizes Medicaid payments for EHR technology costs, with physicians required to pay 15% and waive Medicare incentives. Hospitals can receive Medicaid incentives based on patient share, and both Medicare and Medicaid incentives are available. The Act aims to promote HIT adoption for data sharing among healthcare providers. The HITECH Act codifies the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) within HHS to promote HIT adoption for data sharing among healthcare providers. ONCHIT focuses on developing technical standards for interoperability, certifying HIT products, ensuring privacy and security of electronic health information, and facilitating health information networks. The goal is to exchange standards-based health care data securely. The HITECH Act requires the HHS Secretary to issue initial HIT standards by December 31, 2009. The HITECH Act provides financial incentives for HIT use among healthcare providers, including grants for HIT infrastructure, certified EHRs, training, and best practices dissemination. It also includes privacy and security provisions that amend federal standards under HIPAA. The HITECH Act incentivizes HIT use in healthcare, including grants for infrastructure and EHRs, with privacy and security provisions amending HIPAA standards. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) reimburses states for Medicaid services based on income levels, with a minimum of 50% and maximum of 83%, also used for other programs like CHIP. During the recession adjustment period from FY2009 to FY2011, the ARRA provisions provide fiscal relief to states by increasing their regular FMAPs by 6.2 percentage points. Qualifying states also receive an additional unemployment-related increase. Territories can choose between an FMAP increase of 6.2 percentage points with a 15% spending cap increase or their regular FMAP with a 30% spending cap increase. The temporary FMAP increase applies mainly to Medicaid and partially to Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance, accounting for nearly 98% of the FMAP provisions. States must meet specific requirements to qualify for the FMAP increase. The FMAP provisions in the state fiscal relief title of ARRA include increasing Medicaid payment adjustments for hospitals serving low-income patients, extending moratoria on certain Medicaid regulations, continuing Transitional Medical Assistance and QI-1 programs, and providing protections for Indians under Medicaid and CHIP. Division B also includes two titles not related to Medicaid. Title VI authorizes the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program at NTIA, funded by discretionary appropriations. Title VII imposes restrictions on executive compensation for companies with TARP obligations, requiring the Treasury Secretary to develop standards and set up a Compensation Committee. Shareholders of TARP recipients must have a nonbinding vote on compensation plans. Title VII of ARRA imposes restrictions on executive compensation for TARP recipient companies, requiring shareholder approval of executive compensation plans. ARRA also includes tax provisions aimed at individuals, families, and businesses, as well as public finance measures to promote economic development and energy efficiency. Additionally, ARRA enacts temporary changes to individual income tax provisions, providing incentives for families, individuals, education, and housing. The Making Work Pay Tax Credit under ARRA provides a temporary refundable tax credit of up to $400 for individuals and $800 for married couples for tax years 2009 and 2010. The credit is calculated at 6.2% of earned income and phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. Employers will adjust withholding to increase take-home pay, and taxpayers can claim the credit on their 2009 tax return if not withheld by an employer. Private pension recipients are not eligible unless they have earned income. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increases the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit in 2009 and 2010, reducing the threshold to $3,000 and increasing the earned income tax credit for working families with three or more children. This allows more taxpayers to use the additional child tax credit and receive higher payments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increases the eligibility for the refundable child tax credit in 2009 and 2010, reducing the threshold to $3,000. It also raises the earned income tax credit for working families with three or more children. Additionally, ARRA includes a temporary deduction for state and local sales and excise taxes paid on purchases of new cars, light trucks, recreational vehicles, and motorcycles through 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increases income exemption amounts for taxpayers under the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) for 2009. The AMT provides alternative rules for calculating income tax and exemption amounts are adjusted upward to $46,700 for individuals and $70,950 for joint filers. ARRA also expands the Hope education tax credit for 2009 and 2010, increasing its value and making it partially refundable. The American Education Opportunity Tax Credit, a temporary version of the tax credit, increases the maximum value from $1,800 to $2,500. 40% of the credit is refundable, with a phase-out for taxpayers earning over $80,000 ($160,000 for couples). The modifications are estimated to cost $13.907 billion over 10 years. Section 529 Programs cover qualified education expenses, including tuition, room and board, mandatory fees, and books. ARRA expands eligible expenses for these programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) expands qualified education expenses to include computer technology, equipment, and Internet access. It also modifies and expands the first-time home buyer credit, eliminating the repayment obligation for taxpayers purchasing homes after January 1, 2009, and increasing the maximum credit value to $8,000. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) expands the first-time home buyer credit to $8,000, costing $6.638 billion over 10 years. It includes over $20 billion in energy-related tax incentives, with $14.1 billion for renewable energy, $2.3 billion for energy efficiency, and other allocations for transportation, manufacturing, and state and local government energy bonds. ARRA also provides incentives for alternative energy investment and production, expanding the energy production tax credit for wind facilities and other qualifying facilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) extends the time to claim investment tax credits by three years. It also introduces enhancements to tax-advantaged bond programs like Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) and Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs). Nonprofit entities are authorized $1.6 billion in new CREBs to finance facilities generating electricity from various sources. QECBs, initially authorized in 2008, can be used to finance capital projects. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) can finance energy-saving projects in publicly owned buildings, green community programs, rural development for renewable electricity production, research on nonfossil fuels, carbon capture technologies, efficient nonfossil fuel production, transportation and building energy reduction technologies, mass commuting facilities, green building technology commercialization projects, agricultural waste fuel conversion, advanced battery manufacturing, and other energy-saving technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) authorizes $2.4 billion of Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) to finance state, municipal, and tribal government programs for energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, and green community programs. Incentives for energy efficiency improvements in existing homes include an expanded 10% investment tax credit with caps of $50 for fans, $150 for furnaces and boilers, and $300 for shell improvements. The investment credit rate is increased to 30% and available through 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) modifies investment tax credits for residential energy efficiency and renewable energy equipment, eliminating caps on residential wind, geothermal, and solar thermal equipment. It also repeals the subsidized financing reduction for residential solar, geothermal, wind, and fuel cells. Additionally, ARRA increases tax credits for alternative fuel refueling systems, including ethanol, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increases the Alternative Fuel Refueling Infrastructure Tax Credit for calendar years 2009 and 2010. The credit is raised to 50% for all fuels except hydrogen, with limitations of $50,000 for retail systems and $2,000 for residential systems. For hydrogen, the credit limit is raised to $200,000. ARRA also modifies the tax credit for new plug-in vehicles, capping the per-vehicle credit at $7,500 for both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles up to 14,000 pounds gross weight. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) introduces changes to tax credits for electric vehicles. It establishes a per-manufacturer limit of 200,000 vehicles for the credit phase-out and eliminates the credit for heavier vehicles after 2009. Additionally, ARRA offers a credit of up to $2,500 for low-speed four-wheeled vehicles and two- and three-wheeled electric vehicles. It also provides a $4,000 credit for converting existing vehicles to battery power. Furthermore, ARRA allows taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) to claim plug-in credits. Qualified transportation fringe benefits provided by employers are excluded from employees' gross income for income tax purposes. Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), employer-provided parking up to $230 per month and transit, vanpools, and bicycle commuting benefits up to $120 per month were excludable from income. ARRA increased the benefit for transit, vanpools, and bicycle commuting to $230 per month. The act also enhanced existing investment tax incentives and introduced temporary provisions for capital acquisitions. Businesses can expense up to $250,000 of certain depreciable assets placed in service in 2009, with a phaseout threshold of $800,000. Additionally, a bonus depreciation allowance of 50% is available for qualified assets placed in service in 2009.

Other incentives include deferment of income from discharged business debt, special rules for qualified small business stock, temporary reduction in recognition period for built-in gains tax, and clarification of regulations on built-in losses after ownership change. ARRA allows certain businesses to recognize cancellation of debt income (CODI) over 10 years, deferring taxation. Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a 50% exclusion for the gain from the sale of certain small business stock held for more than five years. The exclusion is limited to individual investments and not the investments of a corporation. The non-excluded portion of section 1202 gain is taxed at the lesser of ordinary income rates or 28%. ARRA increases the rate of exclusion to 75%. ARRA increases the exclusion rate to 75% for individuals on the gain from the sale of certain small business stock held for more than five years. Two provisions in ARRA focus on enhancing manufacturing, expanding eligibility for manufacturing facilities under industrial development bonds and enacting a new 30% advanced energy investment credit for facilities engaged in manufacturing advanced energy property. Certain manufacturing facilities are eligible for tax-exempt bond financing. The definition of a manufacturing facility for financing purposes is expanded to include tangible or intangible property. The new law clarifies which physical components qualify as \"ancillary\" and establishes a 30% investment tax credit for facilities producing advanced energy property. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) expands economic recovery tools such as investment and bond finance measures. It increases authorization for the new markets tax credit by $1.5 billion annually for 2008 and 2009, totaling $5 billion each year. ARRA also expands existing bonds for tribal economic development and high-speed rail projects. Additionally, it creates a certification program for renewable energy projects to allocate credits up to $2.3 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) authorizes $10 billion in recovery zone economic development bonds and $15 billion in recovery zone facility bonds to be issued during 2009 and 2010. States receive allocations based on job losses in 2008, with municipalities using the bonds for infrastructure, job training, education, and economic development in areas with significant poverty, unemployment, or home foreclosures. Bonds issued by tribal governments must fund projects under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ARRA, tribal governments are temporarily allowed to issue $2 billion in tax-exempt bonds for projects without the \"essential governmental function\" requirement to promote economic development on tribal lands. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to study whether this restriction should be permanently repealed. States can issue private activity bonds for high-speed rail facilities, with the definition of vehicles now including trains capable of speeds over 150 miles per hour. Infrastructure financing tools, including bond programs, have been modified to broaden finance options. The ARRA enacted waivers for financial institutions to deduct interest expense on tax-exempt municipal bonds issued in 2009 and 2010. New categories of tax credit bonds, such as qualified school construction bonds and Build America Bonds, have been added with increased authorization amounts. Financial institutions can now deduct interest expense on tax-exempt bonds. ARRA excludes investments in tax-exempt municipal bonds issued during 2009 and 2010 if they are less than 2% of the financial institution's assets. Bonds issued by a \"qualified small issuer\" are not considered for interest disallowance. The threshold for a \"qualified small issuer\" is increased from $10,000,000 to $30,000,000 for tax-exempt obligations issued in 2009 and 2010. The small issuer exception applies to tax-exempt obligations issued in 2009 and 2010 if all ultimate borrowers qualify for the exception. A 3% withholding requirement on certain governmental payments for goods and services is delayed for payments to contractors made after December 31, 2010. Government entities with less than $100 million in annual expenditures for property or services are exempt from the withholding requirement. The ARRA delays the 3% withholding requirement on government payments for goods and services until December 31, 2011 to study its impact. Tax-exempt bonds and tax credit bonds provide subsidies to municipalities by reducing costs. Tax credit bonds and tax-exempt bonds reduce cash interest payments for state and local governments. Private activity bonds' interest is not deductible under the AMT, increasing costs for issuing these bonds. ARRA temporarily waives the AMT interest exclusion for bonds issued in 2009 or 2010 to encourage investment. It also provides AMT relief for current refunding of private activity bonds issued after 2003 and refunded during 2009 and 2010. ARRA creates new tax credit bonds for school construction and allows additional QZAB issuing authority for renovations and training in 2009 and 2010. National limits are set for qualified school construction bonds issued by state, local, and tribal governments. The ARRA created tax credit bonds for school construction and allowed additional QZAB issuing authority for renovations and training in 2009 and 2010. Qualified Zone Academies (QZABs) are public schools designed to cooperate with businesses to enhance the academic curriculum and increase graduation and employment rates. QZABs offer a federal tax credit instead of interest, and state and local governments have the option of issuing tax credit bonds instead of tax-exempt governmental obligation bonds. The ARRA included an increase in the debt limit to address the economic slowdown in 2008, raising it multiple times within a year due to federal deficit spending. The debt limit was raised for the third time in less than a year to $12,104 billion through the passage of ARRA. Grants in lieu of tax credits were introduced, with oversight and transparency provisions included in Divisions A and B of ARRA. Various tax credits aimed at attracting private capital investment were modified to allow entities to request grants instead. The oversight provisions in ARRA mainly focus on appropriations to oversight entities like IGs, GAO, and RATB, with 23 IGs receiving $254.75 million in total. These provisions are primarily found in Division A of the law. IGs in all 15 executive departments receive appropriations from ARRA, with funding amounts varying. Some IGs have funds available until the end of FY2010, FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, or \"until expended.\" GAO receives $25 million until the end of FY2010, and RATB receives $84 million until the end of FY2011. Some appropriations are specifically for ARRA oversight, while others are supplemental with no restrictions on use. RATB can transfer funds as needed. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) has the authority to transfer funds to oversight entities like the Office of Inspector General and the General Services Administration. These oversight provisions under ARRA total $363.75 million and establish new entities for coordinating and conducting oversight to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of funds. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) oversees the transfer of funds to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. RATB is comprised of at least 10 IGs and a chairperson appointed by the President. Its functions include reviewing contracts and grants, establishing a website for transparency, and conducting reviews with IGs and GAO. State and local governments receiving funds must meet certification and reporting requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided guidance on ARRA implementation, including reporting requirements and flexibility for federal agencies to adjust administrative expenditures. President Obama issued a memorandum on responsible spending of Recovery Act funds, directing agencies on allocation and spending. OMB later issued updated guidance to agencies. OMB issued updated guidance to agencies on ARRA-related funding on April 3, 2009.
