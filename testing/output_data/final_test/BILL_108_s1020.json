State educational agencies can receive up to $10,000,000 annually to assist eligible schools in initiating or expanding breakfast programs, with a minimum of $7,000,000 allocated for expansion grants. Grants supplement other payments to the agencies and must be used for expenses related to starting or expanding breakfast programs. Eligibility for grants requires a plan for implementation. State educational agencies must submit a plan to the Secretary to receive grants for school breakfast programs. Preference is given to agencies with fewer schools participating in the school breakfast program compared to the school lunch program. The Secretary will reallocate unused funds to other State educational agencies or States promptly.

The State educational agency must give preference for assistance to schools with the greatest need for a school breakfast program.

Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to require the Secretary to deliver commodities to each State participating in the school lunch and breakfast programs by a specified deadline. The school breakfast program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 will have the value of donated foods set at 5 cents, adjusted annually based on the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions. The Producer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics determines the value of food assistance for each meal, adjusted annually based on the Price Index for Foods Used in Schools and Institutions. The adjustment is computed to the nearest 1/4 cent. The total amount of commodity assistance or cash available to a State for the school breakfast program is calculated based on the number of breakfasts served in the previous school year multiplied by the established rate. After each school year, the Secretary reconciles the number of breakfasts served by schools in each State.

State agencies receiving grants will then distribute funds to school food authorities to conduct the pilot projects. The pilot projects described in paragraph (1) will be conducted by school food authorities over a 3-year period, with the Secretary having the authority to waive certain requirements to enable the grants for the projects. The Secretary may not waive requirements if it would prevent participants from receiving benefits. States must submit an application to participate in the pilot project.
