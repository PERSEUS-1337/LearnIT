    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, education, vocational rehabilitation, home loan guarantees, and burial benefits. These programs are administered nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans' Appeals. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans cemeteries, provides grants for state veterans cemeteries, and offers headstones for eligible persons. The VHA provides health care services to veterans, serves as a backup during national emergencies, and supports national crises. VA medical centers are prepared for public health emergencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) identified a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China, linked to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a new strain of coronavirus. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and later characterized as a pandemic. The VHA plays a significant role in the domestic response to the pandemic. The VHA, a large healthcare system, responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by caring for millions of patients and providing outpatient visits. With a workforce of over 337,000 employees, the VHA also contributes to federal emergency response capabilities. This report outlines VA's and Congress's actions in response to the pandemic, focusing on VHA's, VBA's, and NCA's activities, as well as VA's emergency preparedness efforts. The VA's response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes providing medical care to veterans, implementing mitigation strategies, testing, and treating diagnosed or suspected cases. Information on positive cases was shared with congressional oversight committees, and later made public. The VA began publishing COVID-19 information publicly on its website on March 13, 2020. They have provided updates to congressional oversight committees and released two documents: a COVID-19 response plan and Coronavirus Frequently Asked Questions for patients. The response plan includes details on health system capacity, guidance for patients, mitigation at VHA sites of care, and testing and treatment for COVID-19. As of April 14, 2020, veterans and VHA employees across the United States have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Most are being treated in outpatient settings, with a minority in VA inpatient ICU and acute care settings. The VA increased ICU and acute care bed capacity in response to the pandemic, with 12,215 beds available as of April 29, 2020. Vet Centers are being deployed to locations with large outbreaks. The VA is providing counseling services in areas with high COVID-19 cases and has sufficient PPE, including N95 respirators. Recent reports of PPE shortages were addressed in an April 16, 2020 memo confirming the VA received a significant number of N95 respirators and is securing more masks. Staff are instructed to follow CDC-based contingency strategies for supply management. The memo provides guidance on using N95 respirators for staff providing direct care to COVID-19 patients. Surgical masks can be used for low-risk care if N95 respirators are in short supply. Staff in specified institutional settings will receive one mask per day. VISN directors are advised on implementing contingency and crisis strategies based on CDC guidelines. Medical facility directors have authority to allocate resources and set crisis standards of care. The VA is allocating equipment as needed and increasing pharmaceutical inventories for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The VA has taken actions to ensure adequate staffing and protect employees during the pandemic. They received approval to waive salary reduction for rehired retirees and are asking retired clinicians to register online to join the workforce as surge capacity if needed. The VA is registering reemployed retirees online to join the workforce as surge capacity. They are exploring various hiring authorities for appointments in critical areas and have onboarded 3,107 new hires. The Disaster Emergency Medical Personnel System allows for deployment of personnel to areas with high COVID-19 impact. As of April 29, 2020, over 2,200 VA employees have been diagnosed with COVID-19, resulting in 20 deaths. The VA has implemented measures to protect employees, such as following CDC guidelines and encouraging telework. Staff are advised to stay home if symptomatic, seek health checks at work, and report symptoms promptly. Personal and family disaster plans are encouraged to ensure continued work capability. The VA has implemented measures to protect employees from COVID-19, including telework and following CDC guidelines. VA medical centers have specific treatment areas for COVID-19 patients and a two-tiered system to mitigate the spread of the virus. Elective surgeries have been canceled, and routine appointments are limited to critical needs. Mitigation efforts are also in place at community living centers and spinal cord injury/disorder centers. The VA has implemented measures to protect employees from COVID-19, including telework and following CDC guidelines. VA facilities have different screening processes and pandemic responses based on care settings. Inspections were conducted to assess readiness, with restrictions on visitors at nursing homes and spinal cord injury centers. No new admissions are being accepted at nursing homes. The VA has implemented enhanced screening procedures at all sites of care to screen for respiratory illness and COVID-19 exposure. The majority of CLCs tested were found to be in compliance with the no-access policy, but nine CLCs allowed OIG staff to enter despite the policy. The VA has standardized screening questions for each facility, including asking about symptoms and recent travel history. The VA's COVID-19 response plan includes specific screening questions for different care settings, such as virtual triage. Screening procedures at medical centers and community-based clinics were evaluated by the OIG, with 71% of medical centers having generally adequate processes. If individuals are determined to be at risk, they are isolated or transferred to the emergency department. The OIG found that most CBOCs had screening processes in place, with only a few lacking such procedures. The VA made changes to community care guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting access under the Veterans Community Care Program. Non-VA providers may have longer wait times due to COVID-19 precautions, impacting veterans' access to care. The VA issued guidance for community providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, recommending telehealth appointments and following safety protocols. Veterans' care can be extended by 60 days, and enrollment in the community care network can be expanded. The VA promotes a Coronavirus FAQ document for guidance on COVID-19, access to care, and mental health. The VA advises veterans with flu-like symptoms to avoid VA facilities and use online tools or telehealth appointments instead. Patients should expect enhanced screening measures and budget additional time for appointments. The VA also recommends using online tools first due to high call volumes at some facilities. The VA policy on COVID-19 testing and treatment is described. Testing is based on symptoms and exposure, with samples sent to various labs. Diagnostic testing is covered for all enrolled veterans. The VA provides a benefits package for veterans enrolled in the health care system, with exemptions for copayments on routine lab tests. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act prohibits copayments for COVID-19 testing and medical visits. The VA has not specified a treatment plan for COVID-19 patients, handling coverage and costs as for any other non-service-connected condition. Treatment for COVID-19 is covered under the VA standard medical benefits package, with some veterans possibly needing to pay copayments for care. Eligible veterans must be enrolled in the VA health care system and have received VA care in the past 24 months to qualify for urgent care. If care is obtained from noncontracted providers or services not covered, veterans may have to pay the full cost. Certain veterans may need to pay copayments for care at VA-contracted urgent care facilities or walk-in retail health clinics. Normal rules apply for veterans seeking care at non-VA emergency departments. To be eligible for VA payment or reimbursement, the emergency care must have been provided in a hospital emergency department or similar facility, and the condition must have been of a nature where immediate medical attention was necessary to prevent harm to life or health. VA or other federal facilities/providers must not have been feasibly available, and attempting to use them beforehand would not have been considered reasonable by a layperson. At the time emergency care was provided, the veteran must have been enrolled in the VA health care system, received medical services within the past 24 months, and been financially liable for the treatment. If the emergency treatment was due to an accident or work-related injury, the veteran must pursue claims against a third party first. It is uncertain if veterans will be charged copayments for a FDA-approved vaccine. The VA is prohibited from charging copayments for preventive screening and immunizations for veterans. Veterans experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to COVID-19 due to living conditions. The VA administers programs to assist homeless veterans with housing and services. The VA administers programs to assist homeless veterans with housing and services, including the Supportive Services for Veteran Families program (SSVF) and Contract Residential Services (CRS). The HUD-VA Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH) provides Section 8 vouchers for permanent housing. Guidance released by the VA on March 13, 2020, advises grantees to develop response plans and coordinate with local entities for staff health and response planning. Plans for addressing staff health, potential shortages, and acquiring supplies to assist veteran clients should be developed by VA medical providers and Continuums of Care. Infection prevention measures recommended by the CDC, such as handwashing and surface cleaning, should be implemented. In congregate living facilities, beds should be spaced at least three feet apart, with options for barriers or head-to-toe sleeping. Screening questions should be used to assess client health needs, with interviews conducted before entry if possible. Clients at risk of COVID-19 should be isolated and facilities cleaned regularly. The VA has provided specific guidance for SSVF providers, allowing funds to be used for emergency housing in hotels and motels for high-risk veterans. PHA closures may cause delays for veterans with HUD-VASH vouchers in receiving rental assistance. SSVF grantees can use funds to cover rental assistance for veterans with HUD-VASH vouchers until PHAs complete necessary tasks for move-in. HUD has waived the requirement for HQS inspections for Section 8 rental assistance, allowing owner certification in lieu of inspection. PHAs must conduct inspections by October 31, 2020. HUD has waived HQS inspection requirements for Section 8 rental assistance, allowing alternative inspection results. PHAs can change inspection schedules to biennial without updating plans. Residents should report income changes to PHAs for rent adjustments. Third-party verification for income changes is waived. Section 8 recipients cannot be evicted for nonpayment for 120 days from CARES Act enactment. VA administers guaranteed and direct loans for veterans. The CARES Act provides forbearance and a foreclosure moratorium for federally backed single-family mortgages, including guaranteed VA loans. Borrowers can request forbearance for up to 180 days, with a possible 180-day extension, due to COVID-19 financial hardship. The foreclosure moratorium is in effect for 60 days starting March 18, 2020. Direct VA loans are not covered by the CARES Act. For more information, refer to CRS Insight IN11334. The Veterans Benefits Administration has adjusted operations due to the CARES Act, ensuring continued delivery of benefits. Regional offices are closed to the public but remain open for processing claims. Veterans are directed to use IRIS or call 1-800-827-1000 for assistance. VA Under Secretary for Benefits, Dr. Paul Lawrence, confirmed benefits are still being processed with telework capabilities in place. The VBA has adjusted operations to process claims with 90% of employees teleworking. Dr. Lawrence mentioned using telehealth for compensation and pension exams due to travel restrictions. VA announced changes to in-person meetings for safety. The VBA has made changes to in-person meetings and programs for safety, including providing online and telephone counseling, using teleconferencing for case management, and conducting exams through Tele-C&P. In-person C&P exams have been suspended until further notice. The VA announced that claimants can request extensions for filing paperwork without needing to proactively ask in advance. Over 900,000 individuals are expected to receive veterans educational assistance in FY2020. COVID-19 may disrupt training and education for participants, leading to lower benefits or none at all. Some students and beneficiaries may face disruptions in their education or training due to COVID-19, leading to changes such as stopping out, reduced hours, or transitioning to distance learning. Individuals in foreign countries may also be affected and may need to return to the United States. The VA has been sending direct emails to GI Bill recipients since mid-March. The VA has been providing guidance to GI Bill participants and school certifying officials regarding COVID-19 disruptions. School certifying officials were asked to refrain from adjusting enrollment certifications for courses transitioning to distance education. Prior approval was required for courses to remain GI Bill-eligible, but this requirement was temporarily lifted due to the emergency. Recently enacted legislation has alleviated limitations on courses not previously approved as online courses. The VA announced a 60-day suspension on debt collection for institutions and veterans, with a request for suspension of repayment plans for those unable to make payments. Approximately 25% of GI Bill participants may need to resolve overpayment-related debts. The VBA Education Service is transitioning away from paper correspondence and requests GI Bill participants to provide or update their email addresses. The National Cemetery Administration has announced the discontinuation of committal services and military funeral honors at VA national cemeteries due to the national emergency. Visitors are advised to follow local restrictions and be prepared for certain areas of the cemetery to be closed. VA National Cemeteries will remain open for interments. The National Cemetery Administration has limited attendance for direct interments to immediate family members, up to 10 individuals. They have also changed the floral arrangement policy, allowing only two arrangements per gravesite and no longer accepting them with direct interments. Families can place floral arrangements after 4:30 pm on the day of interment or any time after. The National Cemetery Scheduling Office in St. Louis will continue to provide scheduling services, and the NCA has set up an \"Alerts\" web page for cemetery operating status updates. The Veterans Administration has authority to provide health care backup during emergencies and disasters, including caring for nonveterans and providing medical counter measures to VA employees. They utilize their infrastructure, resources, and expertise to contribute to the federal emergency response effort. The Veterans Administration has the authority to provide health care backup during emergencies and disasters, including caring for nonveterans. This authority applies in situations where a national emergency has been declared, allowing VA to use this authority. The VA released its COVID-19 Response Plan on March 27, 2020, outlining national level roles and responsibilities, such as providing personal protective equipment and medical screening for Federal response personnel. The Veterans Administration provides vaccination services to minimize stress on local communities during emergencies. They offer hospital care, medical services, ventilators, and supplies to responders and military personnel. The VA National Acquisition Center provides logistical support, while the NCA offers burial services for eligible veterans and dependents during national security emergencies. During national security emergencies, the VA prioritizes care for service-connected veterans, Armed Forces members, and individuals affected by disasters. Care is based on clinical need, with urgent conditions treated first. The CARES Act provided funding for the VHA to respond to COVID-19 and provide medical care for nonveterans. The HHS Secretary must certify to Congress that funds from the Stafford Act are insufficient before reimbursing the VHA. States can request assistance from the federal government through the HHS regional emergency coordinator. The VA cannot directly receive requests for assistance from state and local governments. The VHA, as part of FEMA's NRCC, has accepted \"fourth mission\" assignments from FEMA/HHS to assist with COVID-19 response. This includes admitting nonveteran patients at VA medical centers in New York and New Jersey, providing laboratory services, pharmaceutical supplies, and mobile pharmacy units as requested. Congress passed measures to provide the VA with additional funding for pandemic response. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) provided $30 million for VHA's medical services account and $30 million for VHA's medical community care account for COVID-19 related health services. It also waived copayments for COVID-19 testing and medical visits. Additionally, P.L. 116-128 allowed the VA to continue providing GI Bill benefits for courses during the pandemic until December 21, 2020. The VA can pay the Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance for courses converted to distance learning due to emergencies until December 21, 2020. Participants exclusively in distance education can receive half the national average housing allowance. The Administration requested $16.6 billion for VA's COVID-19 response in FY2020, including $13.1 billion for medical services. The VA requested additional funding for healthcare treatment costs, testing kits, ICU bed expansion, and protective equipment in response to COVID-19. The request also included funds for community care and emergency management coordination. The CARES Act allocated $175 million for upgrading VA medical facilities and $1.2 billion for improving telehealth technology. Title X of Division B provided $19.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for certain VA accounts in FY2020. Funding breakdown includes $13 million for VBA telework support and cleaning contracts, and $14.4 billion for VHA telehealth services and medical services. The CARES Act allocated $14.4 billion for increased telehealth services, medical equipment, testing kits, and support for homeless veterans in the VHA account. Additionally, $2.1 billion was designated for emergency room and urgent care usage in the community, $100 million for emergency management coordination, and $606 million for mobile treatment facilities and facility improvements in the medical facilities account. The general administration account received $6.0 million for crisis response operations, while $2.2 billion was allocated for information technology systems for increased telework capacity. The VA received $12.5 million for increased oversight of COVID-19 response, $150 million for state extended care facilities, and the ability to transfer funds between different accounts for COVID-19 response. The VA received funding for increased oversight of COVID-19 response and state extended care facilities. Transfers exceeding 2% of total appropriations require congressional approval. Monthly reports on fund usage are mandated. Telehealth services are provided nationwide, including U.S. territories and Puerto Rico. The VA Secretary can enter short-term agreements with telecommunications companies to expand veteran patients' access to telemental health care services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Telecommunications technologies like internet and videoconferencing are used for this purpose. During the COVID-19 outbreak, veteran patients can access VA telemental health care services through the VA Video Connect (VVC) mobile application. The VA Secretary can prioritize eligibility for isolated veterans with low incomes, living in underserved areas, rural areas, or at higher risk of suicide. Expansion of eligibility for telemental health care services may also be considered for veteran patients. VA may expand eligibility for telemental health care services to veteran patients currently receiving VA care but ineligible for mental health care services and other health care services through telehealth and/or the VVC. The state veterans' home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home, domiciliary, and adult day health care facilities. VA provides financial assistance to states for construction, per diem payments for eligible veterans' care, and support for hiring and retaining nurses at state veterans' homes. The section modifies the treatment of state homes during the public health emergency by waiving requirements for per diem reimbursements and authorizing the Secretary to provide equipment to state homes. It also waives occupancy rate requirements, allows per diem payments for absent veterans, removes the percentage of veteran residents requirement, and authorizes the Secretary to provide medication, personal protective equipment, and other supplies to state homes. The Veterans Directed Care Program provides assistance to isolated veterans at high risk of nursing home placement to live in their own homes. Modifications during the public health emergency include accepting telephone or telehealth enrollments, stopping suspensions or disenrollments without request, waiving paperwork requirements, and allowing payments to continue. During the public health emergency, the Veterans Directed Care Program has made modifications to assist isolated veterans, including accepting telephone or telehealth enrollments, waiving paperwork requirements, and allowing payments to continue. Additionally, VHA prosthetics staff are responsible for providing prosthetic appliances to eligible veterans, and the Secretary can waive limitations on pay for VA employees during the emergency period. The Secretary can waive limitations on pay for VA employees during a public health emergency for work done in support of the emergency. VA home health workers must be provided with personal protective equipment. The CARES Act excludes the recovery rebate from a veteran's annual income for VA pension eligibility calculations. The CARES Act excludes the recovery rebate from a veteran's annual income for VA pension eligibility calculations. Formerly homeless veterans in the HUD-VASH program receive assistance from VA case managers, who now have access to telehealth capabilities. The SSVF program, providing rental assistance to homeless veterans, is authorized at $380 million through FY2021. The provision removes the SSVF funding limitation during public health emergencies. The GPD program provides grants and per diem payments for facilities serving homeless veterans, with funding authorized at $258 million per year. Additional appropriations are allowed for the GPD program during public health emergencies, exceeding the FY2020 authorization level. The Student Veteran Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-140) allows the VA Secretary to waive discharge requirements for veterans in GPD housing who are absent for more than 72 hours and reimburse providers for their care. This addresses concerns about the impact of sudden closures on educational benefits for eligible beneficiaries. The Veterans Work-Study Program under the Student Veteran Coronavirus Response Act of 2020 provides additional financial assistance for GI Bill and VR&E participants through the VA in exchange for employment, even during emergency situations. The VA has authority to pay GI Bill and VR&E allowances for up to four weeks when an educational institution closes due to an emergency situation. GI Bill entitlement is restored for incomplete courses due to educational institution closures. The VA can restore GI Bill entitlement for incomplete courses due to educational institution closures, including lost training time. Entitlement must be used within a specified time period, with exceptions to the time limitation.
