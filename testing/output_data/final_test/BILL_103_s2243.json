FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that international law guarantees the right of passage to vessels through the Inside Passage off the Pacific Coast of Canada. Canada's requirement for US fishing vessels to pay a fee for transit is inconsistent with international law and threatens the safety of US commercial fishermen. The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 allows reimbursement for vessel owners who pay a license fee to release a seized vessel. Canada requires the fee to be paid in person or in advance by mail at specific ports, causing significant expenses and delays for US commercial fishing vessels. The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 may need amendment to allow reimbursement for fees required by foreign governments for vessel navigation. The US should seek to recover payments made to vessel owners for transit license fees to Canada. Additionally, a review of anchorage policies for Canadian fishing vessels in US waters, including near the Dixon Entrance, is recommended. The President should ensure that the US Coast Guard has adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to protect US citizens, enforce US law, and maintain peace in disputed waters. Additionally, all agreements between the US and Canada should be reviewed to address the issue of transit license fees. The President should take immediate action against Canada's transit license fee and convey strong opposition to any restrictions on US vessel passage. Efforts should be intensified to reach agreements with Canada on fishery conservation through the Pacific Salmon Treaty. AMENDMENT TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT. The Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 is amended to include a new section stating that the Secretary of State will reimburse vessel owners for fees charged by foreign governments for passage through U.S. waters if deemed inconsistent with international law. Vessel owners must provide payment receipts and an affidavit to seek reimbursement. The Secretary of State will reimburse vessel owners for fees paid under protest with an affidavit and a copy of the vessel's documentation certificate. Requests for reimbursement must be made within 120 days of payment or within 90 days of the enactment of this section. Funds for reimbursement may come from existing funds or through appropriations if needed. The Secretary of State will take necessary actions as required. The Secretary of State will take action to collect claims against foreign countries for reimbursed fees. The term 'owner' includes vessel charterers. This section will be in effect until October 1, 1995. SEC. 3.
