    "content": "The debate in the United States revolves around consular identification cards, particularly the matr\u00edcula consular issued by the Mexican government. Other countries like Guatemala, Ecuador, and Brazil also issue similar cards, with more nations considering such programs. Honduras, Peru, and Poland are considering similar programs. Mexico has been issuing consular identification cards since 1871, with demand increasing significantly in recent years. The number of cards issued has grown under President Vicente Fox's administration, especially after the 9/11 attacks. Mexico redesigned the matr\u00edcula consular to enhance security, calling it the \"high security consular registration\" (MCAS). The \"high security consular registration\" (matr\u00edcula consular de alta seguridad, MCAS) was first available in the United States in March 2002. The cards include the bearer's photograph, name, signature, date and place of birth, U.S. address, serial number, date of issue and expiration, and issuing consulate name. To obtain a card, an applicant must provide documentation proving Mexican citizenship, identity, and a U.S. address, and pay a $26 fee for a five-year period. The Mexican Embassy developed a national database to prevent duplicate and fraudulent consular ID cards. They issued 2.2 million high-security cards from 2002 to 2004, estimating almost 4 million Mexicans in the US have the cards. By 2007, all old cards will be replaced. The matr\u00edcula consular is accepted as valid identification in numerous cities, counties, states, financial institutions, and police departments in the United States. It is also recognized as a proof of identity for obtaining a driver's license in 12 states and accepted by various other establishments. However, some entities like the New York City Police Department have declined to recognize it due to security concerns. The matr\u00edcula consular is not recognized by the Department of Motor Vehicles in New York and Colorado's law only accepts identification documents issued by state or federal jurisdictions. The Treasury Department issued regulations in May 2003 requiring banks to obtain specific customer information, including an identification number, as directed by the USA PATRIOT ACT. The Treasury Department issued regulations in May 2003 requiring banks to obtain specific customer information, including an identification number, as directed by the USA PATRIOT ACT. For non-U.S. persons, this identification number can be one or more of four specified numbers, one being the \"number and country of issuance of [a] government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard.\" The rule became effective on June 9, 2003, and banks had to be in compliance by October 1, 2003. In an October 2002 report to Congress mandated by Section 326 of the Patriot Act, the Treasury Department specifically addressed the acceptance of the matr\u00edcula consular. The Treasury Department issued regulations in May 2003 requiring banks to verify customer identity with foreign government-issued identification. A notice of inquiry was published on July 1, 2003, seeking input on recordkeeping provisions. After reviewing over 34,000 comments, the Treasury Department decided not to recommend any changes to the rules in September 2003. A federal interagency working group is expected to provide further developments on the acceptance of consular identification cards. The Department of Homeland Security is developing recommendations for a federal policy on identity cards, following the 9/11 Commission's suggestion to set standards for birth certificates and identification sources. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandates minimum standards for identification documents for airline passengers and federal facilities. The REAL ID Act of 2005 aims to establish identity card standards for driver's licenses, potentially excluding the use of consular identification. The REAL ID Act of 2005 set standards for driver's licenses, potentially excluding the use of consular ID cards. It was attached to H.R. 1268 in March 2005 and signed into law as P.L. 109-13 in May 2005. The acceptance of consular IDs in the U.S. has raised policy questions discussed in oversight hearings since June 2003. The debate over the matr\u00edcula consular revolves around addressing unauthorized immigration to the United States. Supporters argue that the card is solely for identification and does not confer legal immigration status. The issue has implications for immigration, public safety, law enforcement, and homeland security, especially in light of the REAL ID Act of 2005. Supporters of the matr\u00edcula consular argue that acceptance of the card is necessary in a post-September 11 America where photo identification is required for daily business. They believe it is beneficial for holders, banks, and institutions. Some supporters also address the issue of unauthorized immigration, advocating for integration into society to prevent fraudulent activities. Opponents argue that the card is only needed by illegal aliens in the US. Opponents argue that the matr\u00edcula consular is only needed by illegal aliens in the US and helps them live and conduct business by providing quasi-legal status, which undermines US immigration law. They believe widespread acceptance of the card is part of a strategy to legalize unauthorized Mexicans in the country, impacting future immigration policy. Public safety and law enforcement concerns are also raised regarding the card's domestic acceptance. Supporters argue that the matr\u00edcula consular is a secure document that reliably identifies the bearer, with Mexican officials maintaining that the documents used to obtain the card are properly authenticated. They claim that Mexico has developed a comprehensive database to prevent duplicate and fraudulent cards, and can verify the applicant's identity against the Mexican voter registration database and a \"stop list\" of non-acceptable persons. They assert that the card is as secure as, if not more secure than, many U.S. documents. Supporters argue that acceptance of the matr\u00edcula consular by law enforcement agencies and other entities improves public safety by helping identify individuals, reducing the need for resources to identify them, and encouraging cooperation in police investigations. Additionally, they highlight the benefits of using the card for financial activities, such as opening bank accounts and participating in economic activities at a reduced cost. Opponents of domestic acceptance of the matr\u00edcula consular argue that the card is not secure due to concerns about the authentication process and the potential for multiple cards to be issued to the same person. They question the security of the Mexican birth certificate used to obtain the card and claim that visual inspection by consular personnel is inadequate. Opponents of the matr\u00edcula consular argue that its acceptance by law enforcement agencies poses a threat to public safety. They believe that the card can be used to conceal criminal activity, create false identities, and facilitate obtaining fraudulent documents like driver's licenses. This could potentially encourage criminals, including drug traffickers, to obtain the cards for illicit purposes. Supporters of the matr\u00edcula consular argue that the card improves homeland security by helping authorities identify Mexican nationals in the US. They believe that marginalized individuals pose a greater security threat when unknown. Opponents claim that the card can be used to create false identities, facilitating criminal acts and threatening homeland security. The use of the Matricula Consular in the United States raises security concerns, as it can be used to create false identities for terrorists to move freely and transfer funds. Opponents argue that lax issuance procedures have allowed non-Mexicans, including individuals of Middle Eastern descent, to obtain valid cards, setting a dangerous precedent for other countries to issue similar identification cards to their nationals in the US. During the 2000 Mexican presidential campaign, the status of Mexican migrants in the United States became a top concern. President Fox of the National Action Party (PAN) proposed legalizing undocumented Mexican workers in the US through amnesty or guest worker arrangements, aiming to improve relations in trade, drug control, and foreign policy cooperation. During the 2001 presidential meetings, cabinet-level negotiations were launched to address migration and labor issues between the US and Mexico. However, after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the migration talks stalled. President Bush proposed immigration reform in 2004, and both major candidates called for it during the 2004 campaign. President Bush reiterated his commitment to immigration reform in his second term, including providing temporary legal status for foreign guest workers. Despite the lack of progress in bilateral migration talks, some observers criticize the Mexican government's efforts. The Mexican government's campaign to issue consular identification cards aimed to provide benefits to the migrant population in the United States, such as access to banking services, cheaper money transfers to Mexico, and normal access to activities. Supporters believe the cards have improved US-Mexico relations by enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas like drug trafficking control and border security. Despite the lack of a desired migration agreement, the cards have had positive impacts. Opponents of the matr\u00edcula consular argue that regulations are necessary to achieve U.S. goals of immigration policy control and defense against terrorism. They criticize Mexican officials for promoting acceptance of the cards, stating it interferes with domestic affairs. The traditional practice of consulates abroad, including U.S. consulates, is to register and maintain records of their nationals for notification and protection, protected under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Institutions in one country often accept official documents from another country for various transactions. The Department of State issues documentation other than passports for U.S. citizens abroad. The Department of State issues documentation other than passports for U.S. citizens abroad, such as identity cards or travel documents like the matr\u00edcula consular. Proponents argue for acceptance to ensure reciprocal treatment, while critics focus on potential restrictions on American citizens abroad. Consular identification cards are beneficial as they help notify foreign consulates when their nationals are detained for suspected illegal activity, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. This notification is easier when detainees have identification cards, but it becomes challenging when they lack documentation. Consular notification is a serious issue for the Department of State, working to ensure compliance for informing U.S. consulates when citizens are detained abroad. Mexican officials have long complained about lack of consular assistance for Mexican citizens facing execution in the United States. President Fox cancelled a meeting with President Bush to protest the execution of Javier Suarez Medina by Texas authorities. In 2003, Mexico filed a case against the United States in the International Court of Justice for not providing consular assistance to Mexican citizens sentenced to death. The court found the US in breach of the Vienna Convention and ordered a review of the cases of 51 Mexican suspects on death row. President Bush directed state courts to comply with the court's decision in 2005. In 2005, President Bush directed state courts to review cases of Mexicans to comply with ICJ decision. US withdrew from Optional Protocol giving ICJ jurisdiction. Supreme Court heard case of Mexican inmate on death row. Proponents of matr\u00edcula consular argue for easier notification of foreign nationals' detention. In 2005, President Bush directed state courts to review cases of Mexicans to comply with ICJ decision. US withdrew from Optional Protocol giving ICJ jurisdiction. Supreme Court heard case of Mexican inmate on death row. Proponents of matr\u00edcula consular argue for easier notification of foreign nationals' detention. Legislation related to consular identification cards was considered by the 108th Congress, with measures related to acceptance of the cards for banking purposes. The major measure in that area was the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations for FY2005, incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 (H.R. 4818/P.L. 108-447) approved in November and December 2004. In December 2004, funding was restored for Treasury Department to allow financial institutions to accept matr\u00edcula consular cards as identity documents for banking. Legislation was passed to set conditions on the issuance of consular cards by foreign missions. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required the Secretary of Homeland Security to propose minimum standards for identification. Security proposed minimum standards for identification documents for airline passengers and entry to federal facilities. Measures were introduced regarding the acceptance of consular identification cards for banking purposes, including authorizing financial institutions to accept matr\u00edcula consular cards and prohibiting the use of foreign government-issued identification for opening bank accounts. The Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill was passed without prohibitions on funding, allowing the Treasury Department to continue permitting financial institutions to accept matr\u00edcula consular cards as valid identification for opening bank accounts. H.R. 773, introduced in 2003, aimed to authorize the acceptance of matr\u00edcula consular issued by the Mexican government for banking purposes, enabling Mexican immigrants to access financial services. H.J.Res. 58, introduced in 2003, aimed to disapprove Treasury Department regulations allowing financial institutions to accept unverifiable forms of identification from non-United States persons, in violation of the USA PATRIOT Act. H.R. 3674, introduced in 2003, sought to amend Section 5318 to prohibit the use of foreign government-issued identification, other than passports, for verifying identity at financial institutions. It included the 'Matricula Consular' card. The FY2005 Appropriations Act included funding for Treasury Department regulations on matr\u00edcula consular cards. An amendment by Rep. Culberson aimed to prohibit financial institutions from accepting these cards as identification, citing support from Homeland Security, FBI, and Justice Department. The amendment aimed to end the use of unreliable consular cards for identification, with arguments for and against its safety and necessity. The Appropriations Committee approved the measure, maintaining the prohibition on Treasury funding for financial institutions to accept the cards. Representative Culberson raised concerns about the cards being used by terrorists, while Representative Pastor believed they were reliable and could be regulated by the Department of Homeland Security. The House approved an amendment to restore funding for Treasury Department regulations on identity cards for banking services, despite concerns about the use of easily forged documents by terrorists. The amendment was supported by the Administration and argued to be effective, while opponents believed the regulations were too lax. The House passed a measure on September 22, 2004, to restore authorities regarding consular ID cards, which was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005. An amendment to restrict the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions in the United States was approved by the House on July 15, 2003, but the Senate did not take similar action during the 108th Congress. The House passed a measure to restrict the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions in the United States. The amendment added to the bill would establish restrictions on the issuance of consular ID cards and require foreign missions to maintain accurate records. The House passed a measure to restrict the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions in the United States. The proposed regulations require foreign missions to notify the mission of any address changes, maintain records of all cards issued, and allow audits upon request. Violations that threaten national security or facilitate fraudulent acts would result in suspension of card issuance until compliance. Failure to comply could lead to the State Department ceasing visa issuance to nationals of that country. Supporters argue that some foreign governments misuse consular ID cards to circumvent regulations. Opponents of the proposed restrictions argue that consular identification cards, particularly the Mexican matr\u00edcula consular, are being unfairly targeted. They claim that the cards are not a reliable form of identification due to potential issues with forgery, sharing, and fraudulent use. Critics also argue that the restrictions could negatively impact individuals of Hispanic heritage. The proposed restrictions on consular identification cards, such as the Mexican matr\u00edcula consular, are seen as unreasonable and harmful to bilateral relations. Critics argue that the penalties for non-compliance are excessive and could make consular notification more difficult. The restrictions could also lead to reciprocal actions by other nations, impacting the U.S. government's ability to register and monitor U.S. nationals abroad. The Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (S. 2845 / P.L. 108-458) aimed to reform intelligence services and implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. It included measures to restrict the use of consular ID cards, establish minimum standards for identification documents for airline passengers and federal facilities entry, and set standards for driver's license issuance. Additionally, it prohibited acceptance of non-federal or state-issued documents for federal benefits and foreign government-issued identification for federal employees. The Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to reform intelligence services and implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. It included measures to restrict the use of consular ID cards and set standards for driver's license issuance. Section 3006 of the Act would have established identity requirements for federal employees, excluding the Mexican consular ID as a valid document. Section 3052 would have prohibited federal agencies from accepting non-compliant driver's licenses or identification documents. The Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to reform intelligence services and implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. It included measures to restrict the use of consular ID cards and set standards for driver's license issuance. S. 2845 and H.R. 10 were among the measures to reform intelligence services and implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Proponents argued that specified immigration provisions were necessary to prevent terrorists from acquiring identity documents. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to prevent terrorists from acquiring identity documents. After lengthy negotiations, the conference report was approved by the House and Senate, and signed into law by the President on December 17, 2004. Section 7220 of the enacted legislation requires the Secretary of. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, signed into law on December 17, 2004, requires minimum standards for identification documents for airline passengers and federal facilities entry. H.R. 502, introduced by Representative Tancredo, aims to restrict federal government acceptance of non-verified identification documents for public benefits or services. H.R. 687, introduced by Representative Gallegly, would prohibit federal employees from accepting foreign government-issued identification for establishing identity, with passports being exempt if authorized by federal law. H.R. 4440, also introduced by Gallegly, aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. H.R. 4440, introduced by Representative Gallegly in 2004, would make possession of a consular identification card by an alien prima facie evidence of deportability and inadmissible for entry for 10 years if used for federal identification purposes. Legislation related to consular ID cards is being considered in the 109th Congress, including the REAL ID Act of 2005 (H.R. 418) which passed the House and was attached to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY2005. H.R. 1268 was passed into law on May 11, 2005, with provisions related to the acceptance of consular ID cards by federal and state entities. H.R. 418, attached to H.R. 1268, established identity card standards for driver's licenses, requiring lawful presence in the U.S. and specifying official passports as the only accepted form of identification. H.R. 368, introduced by Representative Tom Davis, aims to establish identity card standards for federal recognition and driver's licenses. It is similar to provisions in H.R. 418 and the REAL ID Act of 2005. H.R. 418, the REAL ID Act of 2005, introduced by Representative Sensenbrenner, aims to establish identity card standards for federal purposes, including driver's licenses. The bill was approved on February 10, 2005, with amendments. The REAL ID Act of 2005, H.R. 418, was approved on February 10, 2005, and signed into law on May 11, 2005.

The Act specifies that federal agencies may not accept driver's licenses or identification cards from states unless they meet certain standards. The REAL ID Act of 2005 sets standards for driver's licenses, including proof of identity, birth, residence, social security number, and lawful status in the country. It prohibits the acceptance of foreign documents, except for official passports, and requires the use of a national automated system to verify the legal presence of non-U.S. citizens. The Identification Integrity Act of 2005, H.R. 925, introduced by Representative Gallegly, aims to prohibit federal agencies from accepting foreign government-issued identification, except for passports authorized for specific uses by federal law. This bill clarifies that consular ID cards would not be accepted. H.R. 925 was referred to multiple House committees for further consideration.
