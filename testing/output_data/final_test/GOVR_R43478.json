    "content": "The U.S. Congress is deeply concerned about Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in the Ukraine crisis. There are calls for a reassessment of NATO's commitment to defending member states and its relationship with Russia. Security concerns in Central and Eastern European NATO member states and territorial disputes in countries like Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia are also highlighted. Discussions about NATO's future focus on its ability to defend member states and its relationship with Russia. The crisis in Ukraine has brought questions about NATO's future to the forefront, with tensions arising over the alliance's strategic focus since the end of the Cold War. NATO's transformation from territorial defense to global military operations was based on the belief that Russia was no longer a threat. However, some members fear this shift may compromise NATO's commitment. These issues will be key topics at the upcoming NATO summit in Wales. The NATO alliance is facing a transformation that could impact its ability to uphold its commitment to collective defense. Some allies are calling for a renewed focus on collective defense due to concerns about economic stagnation in Europe and insufficient defense spending. Only a few NATO allies meet the goal of spending 2% of GDP on defense, with the US accounting for a growing share of total allied defense spending. Defense spending in European countries has increased from 63% to 72%, with concerns raised about inefficiencies and high personnel costs. Only four allies met NATO's guideline to allocate 20% of defense expenditures to major equipment purchases in 2013. This has led to significant shortfalls in key military capabilities. NATO Secretary General and others advocate for increased defense cooperation among European allies to address budgetary constraints. The \"Defense\" initiative calls for cooperation, prioritization, and specialization in pursuit of needed defense capabilities. Critics argue that past efforts have had mixed success due to limited public support for military engagement and divergent threat perceptions in Europe. Differences in priorities, such as territorial defense capabilities versus flexible units, are amplified by budget constraints and concerns about the security threat from Russia. U.S. officials emphasize their commitment to transatlantic security and collective defense. The Obama Administration's defense budget cuts and \"rebalance\" to Asia have raised questions about future U.S. commitments to European security. Russia's actions in Ukraine have heightened concerns, leading NATO to focus on supporting Ukraine, defending Central and Eastern European allies, and rebuking Russia. NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has called Russia's military aggression the most serious crisis in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall. NATO announced the suspension of cooperation with Russia, focusing on supporting Ukraine and strengthening military cooperation with Kyiv. New NATO trust funds were created to develop Ukrainian defense capacity. NATO has established trust funds to enhance Ukrainian defense capabilities in logistics, command and control, cyber defense, and supporting retired military personnel. The total contributions to these funds have not been publicly disclosed. While NATO has not provided military hardware to Ukraine, individual allies may offer bilateral military assistance. All NATO allies have rejected providing lethal military aid to Ukraine to avoid escalating the conflict. NATO's focus since Russia's annexation of Crimea has been on reinforcing defense commitments in central and eastern Europe through air defense, surveillance, maritime deployments, and military exercises. NATO's efforts in central and eastern Europe have focused on air defense, surveillance, and military exercises. Additional fighter jets have been deployed to the Baltic Air Policing mission, with NATO increasing the mission from four to 16 fighter jets in April. The mission, led by rotating NATO allies since 2004, aims to protect Baltic airspace. Countries like Denmark, France, Poland, and the UK are contributing fighter aircraft, while Canada has deployed jets to Romania for training exercises. NATO AWACS surveillance aircraft have been conducting daily flights since mid-March 2014. NATO has been conducting surveillance flights over Ukraine using AWACS aircraft to monitor Russian troop movements. Maritime deployments include patrols in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas with mine clearance vessels and frigates from various NATO countries. Additionally, NATO participated in naval exercises in the Black Sea with ships from Italy, Turkey, and the UK. NATO member states, including Greece, Italy, Romania, Turkey, and the United States, have conducted military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe. A major exercise in Ukraine is planned for September. In Estonia, 6,000 allied troops participated in a military exercise aimed at repelling potential attacks. The U.S.-led Rapid Trident 2014 exercise in Ukraine has been postponed until mid-September, with up to 14 nations expected to participate. Last year's Rapid Trident exercise in Ukraine featured a combined U.S.-Ukrainian battalion headquarters practicing peacekeeping operations. Some NATO allies in Central and Eastern Europe are calling for permanent troop deployments on their territories to demonstrate NATO's willingness and capacity to defend them. However, other allies, like Germany, caution against further militarization of NATO relations with Russia, citing a 1997 pledge to refrain from permanently stationing substantial combat forces in countries that joined NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Obama Administration has taken military measures to reassure Central and Eastern European allies in response to the situation with Russia. This includes enhanced troop rotations, joint military exercises, and deployments of additional fighter jets and personnel to various countries in the region. The United States has increased military activities with NATO allies in Central and Eastern Europe, suspending all military-to-military activities with Russia. This includes land-based military exercises, enhanced naval presence in the Black and Baltic Seas, and deployments of U.S. naval vessels for exercises in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea. Concerns have risen in the region due to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Geographical proximity and historical relationships in Central and Eastern Europe shape attitudes towards Russia, with concerns about Putin's intentions heightened. Countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, who are NATO members, view the alliance as crucial for their national security. They feel their past warnings about Putin's ambitions were ignored by the US and Western Europe. The Visegr\u00e1d Group (V4) countries, including Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, heavily rely on Russian natural gas. Russia has been increasing its influence in the region through energy deals and infrastructure acquisitions. In addition to natural gas, Hungary also agreed to a nuclear power plant upgrade financed by a loan from Moscow. The V4 foreign ministers expressed strong support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The V4 countries supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They agreed to limited EU sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea and conflict in eastern Ukraine. After the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, they joined wider financial and trade sanctions against Russia. Debates within the V4 revealed differences on responding to the Ukraine crisis. The Ukraine crisis exposed differences within the V4 group, with Poland advocating a robust response to Russia while the other countries were more reserved. Critics noted inaction by the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and pro-Russian stances by Hungary's prime minister. Poland has the most difficult relationship with Russia among the V4 countries. Despite a temporary thaw in the relationship after a 2010 airplane crash, Polish suspicions of Putin's Russia persist. Poland, the most populous V4 country, is modernizing its military with increased equipment expenditures. Poland is a leading NATO participant in Afghanistan. Poland has been a key participant in NATO's mission in Afghanistan and has called for NATO to focus on territorial defense. They have requested the stationing of two NATO brigades in Poland for security. Poland also hosts U.S. forces and participates in the U.S./NATO missile defense system. Aegis-ashore interceptors are set to be deployed in Poland in 2018 to address the missile threat. Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania, houses a significant Russian military presence, including the Baltic Sea Fleet and Iskander short-range nuclear missiles. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia have smaller militaries with budget constraints, but are well-structured and capable according to military experts. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia have well-structured and capable militaries. Czech plans to increase defense spending to 1.4% of GDP by 2020, focusing on replacing Soviet-era equipment and developing niche capabilities. Hungary aims to increase defense spending to 1.4% by 2022, focusing on replacing transport aircraft and helicopters, maintaining special operations forces, and light infantry units. Slovakia faces challenges in replacing aging equipment, with as much as 75% past its life. Slovakia's defense equipment is aging, with up to 75% past its life cycle, and the military heavily relies on Russian armaments. The Visegrad Group (V4) countries are expanding cooperation in security and defense, aiming for a unified stance within NATO and the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy. Plans for an EU Battlegroup and increased military and industrial cooperation are in progress, aligning with NATO's Smart Defense and the EU's Pooling and Sharing initiative. The Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were formerly part of the Soviet Union, gaining independence in 1991 and joining NATO and the EU in 2004. They view Russia as a threat due to their size, location, and energy dependence. Recent events in Ukraine have heightened their concerns. The Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO and the EU in 2004. They view Russia as a threat due to their size, location, and energy dependence. Recent events in Ukraine have heightened their concerns, with anxiety in the Baltics due to minority populations of ethnic Russians. Language issues have caused tensions between Russia and Latvia, while Estonia faced clashes over a Soviet war memorial and a cyberattack. Lithuania was singled out by Russia for trade sanctions in 2013. In late 2013, Lithuania faced trade sanctions from Russia over energy issues and the EU's Eastern Partnership. The Baltic countries, including Lithuania, condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea but were cautious about imposing harsh EU sanctions due to economic concerns. Despite potential economic repercussions, Baltic leaders supported the EU sanctions as a political necessity. The Baltic countries heavily rely on NATO for defense due to their small national militaries. Recent events in Ukraine are prompting them to deepen their commitment to NATO. They lack fighter aircraft and depend on NATO allies for airspace defense. Calls have been made for NATO to establish a permanent base in the region to enhance security. NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, launched in 2004, plays a crucial role in safeguarding Baltic airspace. NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, launched in 2004, is based in Lithuania and involves about a dozen NATO members rotating four fighters every four months. The Baltic countries have pledged to increase their contribution to the mission financially. Estonia, compared to other NATO members, spends a relatively high percentage of GDP on defense and plans to enhance its military capabilities by 2022. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all working to modernize their defense systems and equipment. Latvia aims to double its defense spending by 2020 and procure new equipment. Moldova's government is concerned about recent events in Ukraine. Moldova and Ukraine are concerned about armed men from Transnistria trying to cross the border to participate in demonstrations against Ukraine's government. Transnistria is seeking Russia's recognition for its independence, which could potentially link the region directly with Russia. Russia has shown hostility towards Moldova, especially after it signed an Association Agreement with the EU in June 2014. Most observers believe Russia will use indirect tactics to influence Moldova away from a pro-Western orientation, such as trade sanctions, support for separatism, and backing the Communist opposition. The US supports Moldova's European integration, anti-corruption efforts, border security, exports, and energy security. Moldova participates in NATO's Partnership for Peace program but does not seek NATO membership. NATO cooperates with Moldova in defense strategy, planning, and military education. Moldova receives modest U.S. security assistance, with a potential increase due to the European Reassurance Initiative. Ukraine faced challenges opposing Russia's invasion in Crimea and pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. Since June 2014, Ukrainian forces have overcome weaknesses and inflicted defeats on pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. They aim to surround rebel strongholds in Donetsk and Luhansk to cut off their Russian supplies, avoiding urban combat to prevent casualties. Ukrainian military believes they can defeat separatists in weeks if Russia does not intervene. Ukrainian leaders aim to negotiate the peaceful withdrawal of Russia-backed separatists from Ukraine as part of a peace plan for the region. US officials claim Russia is supplying heavy weapons to the separatists, including the missile used to shoot down MH17. Concerns are raised about Russia's potential to send more sophisticated weaponry to eastern Ukraine. Analysts are concerned about Russia's potential reactions to the separatists in eastern Ukraine. NATO reports an increase in Russian troops on the border. Ukraine has requested military aid from the US, including arms, ammunition, and other supplies. The US has not yet provided lethal military aid to Ukraine. The US has declined to send lethal military aid to Ukraine but has provided non-lethal assistance, including $18 million in security aid. This includes meals, health and welfare assistance, explosive disposal equipment, radios, body armor, night vision goggles, and communications equipment. Additional funding of $5 million and $10 million was announced for security assistance. The United States announced an additional $10 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total aid since the crisis began to $33 million. Assistant Secretary of Defense Derek Chollet testified that various supplies were delivered to Ukraine, with more to come in July and August, including night-vision devices, thermal imagers, helmets, robots, and radios. Some Members of Congress are advocating for lethal military aid and real-time intelligence support for Ukraine's armed forces. The United States provided $10 million in security assistance to Ukraine, totaling $33 million since the crisis began. Some Members of Congress advocate for lethal military aid to deter Russian aggression. NATO suspended cooperation with Russia due to their actions in Ukraine. NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow expressed concerns about Russia's actions in Crimea, questioning the security of the Euro-Atlantic region. Some NATO members in Central and Eastern Europe worry about Russia's hostility and attempts to sow disunity within the alliance. While there is condemnation of Russia's actions, some in Europe and the US stress the importance of cooperative relations with Russia for long-term security. Concerns have been raised about a military response hindering future cooperation with Russia. The NATO-Russia Council (NRC) established in 2002 has not fully realized its potential due to Russian suspicion of NATO's intentions, especially regarding countries like Ukraine and Georgia. Despite aspirations for cooperation, analysts expect continued contention and mistrust in NATO-Russia ties. Moscow objects to NATO and US military responses to the crisis, questioning NATO's commitment not to permanently station combat forces in countries that joined after the Soviet Union's collapse. EU member states commit to ending future arms sales to Russia, but previously agreed sales are exempt. Critics have raised concerns about Russian arms sales despite their relative insignificance compared to other European sales. Some critics have raised concerns about high profile deals, such as France's 2011 agreement to sell Russia two amphibious assault warships worth \u20ac1.2 billion. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has affirmed the contract, despite criticism from Members of Congress and European leaders. There have been calls for NATO to purchase the ships from France. Congress have called on NATO to purchase the Mistrals built for Russia from France, following Germany's cancellation of a military training facility sale to Russia. The UK and United States have also halted military cooperation with Russia. Some U.S. observers and Members of Congress are urging NATO to expand eastward in response to Russian actions in Ukraine. They argue that enlargement would deter Russian aggression in neighboring countries. Despite these calls, analysts believe NATO is unlikely to make significant progress in expanding. Most analysts believe NATO is unlikely to expand significantly in the next few years due to concerns about the alliance enlarging too quickly and the need to address complex issues like managing relations with Russia. Ongoing territorial disputes with Russia in countries like Georgia and Ukraine could deter membership invitations. Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Georgia are formal aspirants for NATO membership, with Montenegro being the most advanced candidate but requiring security and defense sector reforms to meet NATO standards. Security agencies and the defense sector in Montenegro, Bosnia, and Macedonia require reforms to meet NATO standards. Efforts are needed to combat corruption and organized crime. Bosnia's MAP acceptance is pending resolution of defense property issues. Public support for NATO membership in Montenegro is questioned. Macedonia's NATO candidacy is stalled due to a dispute with Greece. Bosnian Serb leaders have shown mixed signals on NATO membership, with strong opposition among the Bosnian Serb population. In 2008, Ukraine's NATO candidacy has been stalled due to a dispute with Greece over its official name. The country's government has shown indifference towards NATO membership, with former President Yanukovych renouncing ambitions to join. Public support for NATO membership in Ukraine remains divided, with some increase in support due to the ongoing conflict. The government is cautious about expressing ambitions to join NATO. The Ukrainian government is cautious about expressing ambitions to join NATO due to public opinion and possible opposition from some NATO countries. In 2008, NATO and Georgia established the NATO-Georgia Commission to oversee NATO assistance to Georgia and progress towards eventual membership in the alliance. Georgia has deepened cooperation with NATO, especially in defense and security sector reform. Georgia has contributed to ongoing NATO operations, deploying the second-largest non-NATO contingent in Afghanistan. However, the unresolved situation in Georgia's breakaway regions could hinder its possible NATO membership. Some allies may oppose setting a timeline for membership as long as the territorial dispute persists. Administration officials may support granting a Membership Action Plan to Georgia at NATO's September summit. Recent Russian military aggression could indirectly increase support for NATO membership in Sweden and Finland. Since joining NATO's Partnership for Peace Program in 1994, Finland and Sweden have modernized their militaries while maintaining military \"nonalignment\" due to sensitivities regarding relations with Russia. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned of a response if either country joined NATO, leading to Russian military exercises near their territories. Recent actions have prompted calls for a defense policy shift in Sweden and increased support for NATO membership in Finland, despite public opposition. Both governments may increase defense spending regardless. The crisis in Ukraine has renewed focus on the U.S. commitment to European security and force posture in Europe. Some allies express concerns about reduced U.S. military presence, while others support the shift due to other security challenges. About 67,000 U.S. forces are stationed in Europe, down from a Cold War high of 400,000. The adjusted U.S. force posture in Europe has coincided with calls for European allies to enhance their military capabilities. The Obama Administration asserts that the U.S. remains prepared to honor its commitments to NATO member states, including drafting contingency plans for defense and establishing an Air Force Aviation detachment in Poland. The U.S. has deployed 12 F-16s to Poland as part of an agreement established in 2011. The Department of Defense has committed a rapid reaction force to rotate to Europe for joint training exercises. The U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense program, known as EPAA, serves as the cornerstone of NATO's missile defense capability in Europe. Missile defense ships are deployed in the Mediterranean, and a radar is based in Turkey. The U.S. has deployed F-16s to Poland and committed a rapid reaction force for joint training exercises in Europe. NATO's missile defense system includes interceptor sites in Romania and Poland. Critics argue for more support for Ukraine and increased NATO troop deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. In March 2014, NATO requested the deployment of two heavy brigades on its territory. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon and other Members of Congress urged President Obama to increase U.S. forces' alert posture in Europe. Assistant Secretary of Defense Derek Chollet mentioned the possibility of forward deployments to Central and Eastern Europe. Critics highlighted the low U.S. participation in NATO exercises in Estonia and Latvia. The largest NATO exercise in the region in over 10 years took place in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in November 2013 with 6,000 troops participating. The exercise aimed to certify command and control elements of the NATO Response Force in response to a possible attack on a NATO member state. The US dropped Phase 4 of the EPAA in 2013, which would have deployed advanced naval BMD interceptors in Europe. The US provided nonlethal military aid to Ukraine but declined to provide lethal military aid. Some analysts suggest providing additional military assistance to allies, including intelligence, surveillance, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank weapons. Congress could shape U.S. and NATO responses to Russia's actions in Ukraine, reexamine U.S. force posture in Europe, and assess U.S. capacity for collective defense commitments. Congress may also play a role in determining U.S. policy towards NATO and guiding discussions about NATO's future ahead of the next summit in Wales. Drafting legislation on issues such as development of allied military capabilities, military burdensharing, NATO enlargement, relations with partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia, NATO relations with Russia, cybersecurity, and energy security."
