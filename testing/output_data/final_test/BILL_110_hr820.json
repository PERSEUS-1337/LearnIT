    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2007\". Congress finds that 37 percent of seniors in the United States display symptoms of depression, with a higher suicide rate compared to other age groups. Many Medicare beneficiaries lack access to mental health services in underserved communities. Marriage and family therapists are not recognized by the Medicare program for coverage and reimbursement, unlike other core mental health professionals. Nearly 75 percent of US counties lack psychiatrists, 58 percent lack clinical social workers, and 50 percent lack psychologists. Marriage and family therapists offer vital mental health services in underserved areas. The shortage of Medicare providers is due to the program not covering licensed marriage and family therapists. Many marriage and family therapists work in medically underserved communities, with a significant percentage of patients being ethnic minorities. There are more marriage and family therapists than psychiatrists in rural counties, and Medicare coverage of marriage and family therapy services can improve access to mental health care in rural areas. The Social Security Act is amended to include coverage of marriage and family therapist services under Part B, defining these services as provided by subsection (ccc)(1). This change aims to improve access to mental health care in rural areas. The term 'marriage and family therapist services' refers to services provided by a therapist for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses, authorized by State law. A 'marriage and family therapist' is an individual with a master's or doctoral degree qualifying for licensure, who has completed required post-degree experience. The text discusses the requirements for marriage and family therapists to be eligible for payment under Part B of the Act, including obtaining a degree, completing supervised clinical experience, and being licensed or certified in the state where services are provided. Additionally, it mentions the amendment of payment amounts for marriage and family therapist services under the Act. The text discusses the payment amounts for marriage and family therapist services under the Act, including the exclusion from the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System and the inclusion of marriage and family therapists as practitioners for assignment of claims.
