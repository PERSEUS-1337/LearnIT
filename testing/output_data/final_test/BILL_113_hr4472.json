Congress recognizes the importance of developing neuroscience research and neurotechnology for national security. The strong partnership between the United States and Israel has led to significant advancements in various scientific fields through collaborative programs like the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation. The Office of Science and Technology Policy was directed by Congress to establish an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience in December 2011. Israeli scientists are leading research in neuroscience, and Israel Brain Technologies aims to make Israel a global leader in brain technology and research. Israel Brain Technologies aims to create a community around neurotechnology, attract key stakeholders, and enhance cooperation between the United States and Israel for neuroscience research and development. Israel Brain Technologies aims to create a community around neurotechnology and enhance cooperation between the United States and Israel for neuroscience research and development through grants for neuroscience-related research. The Secretary, in consultation with the BIRD or BSF, will award grants to eligible entities for neuroscience research. Eligible entities must submit an application containing required information. The Secretary, in consultation with the BIRD and BSF, will review applications and select entities meeting established criteria for grants. The Secretary, in consultation with the BIRD or BSF, will determine the grant amount for eligible entities for neuroscience research. Procedures for recoupment in connection with eligible projects must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment, with recoupment being proportional to the Federal share of project costs. The recoupment requirements for grants under this section may be waived or deferred by the Secretary based on factors such as commercial competitiveness and project profitability. Private Funds may be accepted by the Secretary for this Act. Recipients of grants must submit a report within 180 days, detailing fund usage and project success evaluation. SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE-RELATED RESEARCH ADVISORY BOARD. Established in the National Institutes of Health is an International Neuroscience-Related Research Advisory Board. The Board advises the Secretary on grant recipient criteria, total grant amounts, and membership includes appointees from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. The International Neuroscience-Related Research Advisory Board in the National Institutes of Health includes members appointed by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and 3 Israeli citizens appointed by the Director of the National Institutes of Health. Initial appointments must be made within 60 days of the Act's enactment, with each member serving a 4-year term. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment process. The Advisory Board members serve without pay and receive travel expenses. A quorum consists of three members, with the Chairperson designated by the Director of the National Institutes of Health. Meetings are held at least once annually. The Advisory Board meets annually at the Chairperson's call and is not subject to termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like Advisory Board, BIRD, BSF, and eligible entity, which refer to specific organizations and joint ventures involved in neuroscience-related research projects between Israel and the United States. The term \"eligible project\" refers to a project promoting cooperation between the US and Israel on neuroscience research, as defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The grant program and Advisory Board will end after a 7-year period from the enactment of the Act. The Secretary is authorized to spend up to $20,000,000 annually from 2014 to 2020 for this Act."
