Collective bargaining rights vary between federal and state/local workers, with state laws defining bargaining scope. Federal employees gained collective bargaining rights in 1962 under Executive Order 10988. The Federal Labor Relations Council, established by Executive Order 11491 in 1969, laid the foundation for federal labor-management relations. This order also identified prohibited unfair labor practices for management and labor organizations. In 1978, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute codified the right to engage in collective bargaining and established the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) established the FLRA to supervise union elections and resolve unfair labor practice complaints. It grants employees the right to form, join, or assist labor organizations and engage in collective bargaining for conditions of employment. This includes personnel policies and practices affecting working conditions, excluding matters specifically provided for by federal statute. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) outlines management rights that are generally non-negotiable, except for procedures to implement agency proposals. Section 7106(a) of Title 5, U.S. Code, specifies management officials' authority over agency mission, budget, organization, employees, and internal security practices, as well as hiring, assigning, disciplining employees, work assignments, and agency operations personnel. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) grants management officials authority over agency operations, including contracting out and personnel decisions. Section 7106 ensures a balance between management rights and negotiable procedures. Legislation for collective bargaining for state and local government employees was first adopted in the 1950s. In the 1950s, legislation granting collective bargaining rights to municipal employees was first adopted. By the end of 1967, 21 states had laws authorizing some form of collective bargaining for state and/or local employees. State laws on collective bargaining vary, with some prohibiting it and others providing comprehensive rights. North Carolina and Virginia prohibit the execution of collective bargaining agreements. Under Virginia law, public employers are prohibited from recognizing labor organizations as bargaining agents for public employees. In at least 31 states, public employees have the right to engage in collective bargaining, including negotiating wages and hours. However, in some states like Hawaii and Iowa, the negotiation of retirement or health benefits is limited by state law. In 11 additional states, collective bargaining rights are limited to specific employees, such as firefighters in Wyoming. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a bill in 2011 restricting negotiations under the Municipal Employment Relations Act and State Employment Relations Act. The enactment of the Budget Repair Bill in Wisconsin restricted negotiations under the Employment Relations Act and State Employment Relations Act to only public safety employees. Similar measures have been introduced in other states, like Michigan's Fiscal Accountability Act allowing the governor to appoint an emergency manager with broad powers over collective bargaining agreements. The Fiscal Accountability Act allows an emergency manager to reject, modify, or terminate terms of a collective bargaining agreement after meeting with the bargaining representative. This could raise constitutional concerns under the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution limits states' power to modify contracts but allows them to repeal or amend statutes. The Supreme Court considers three factors to determine if a state law violates the Contract Clause, including whether it substantially impairs the contractual relationship. The Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution limits states' power to modify contracts but allows them to repeal or amend statutes. The Court has indicated that a state law can constitute a substantial impairment if it affects contractual expectations, and will consider if the state has a legitimate public purpose for the law. In cases like Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power and Light Co., the Court has recognized that remedying broad social or economic problems can serve as a legitimate public purpose, even if not associated with an emergency. In Company of New York v. New Jersey, the Court found mass transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection to be important public concerns. The Court also considers whether a state law is reasonable and necessary to serve a public purpose, taking into account changed circumstances since the contract was executed. In U.S. Trust, the Court determined that a New Jersey law was not reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. The Court in U.S. Trust found that a New Jersey law repealing a bond covenant was not reasonable due to unchanged circumstances since the covenant's adoption in 1962. The Court emphasized that the state law must be necessary and consider less drastic modifications or alternative means to achieve its goal. The Fiscal Accountability Act allows for the rejection, modification, or termination of terms in a collective bargaining agreement under certain conditions determined by the emergency manager and state treasurer. The Fiscal Accountability Act allows for the rejection, modification, or termination of terms in a collective bargaining agreement under specific conditions related to addressing financial emergencies for the benefit of the public as a whole. This action must be temporary and not target specific classes of employees. In a 1993 case, a salary reduction plan was implemented, which could be seen as a substantial impairment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit emphasized the importance of the right to compensation in employment contracts. The Contract Clause may prevent measures that repudiate a state's contractual obligations as states address budget issues through legislative solutions. The outcome of a challenge to the Fiscal Accountability Act under the Contract Clause will depend on the identification of terms to be rejected and the absence of alternatives to achieve the state's purpose. The Contract Clause may prevent measures that repudiate a state's contractual obligations. The Supreme Court's willingness to find remedying a broad economic problem as a legitimate public purpose suggests that carefully considered state laws could survive constitutional challenge."
