    "content": "U.S. interests in South Korea involve security, economic, and political concerns. The Mutual Defense Treaty obligates the U.S. and South Korea to settle disputes peacefully, refrain from using force, consult in case of external armed attack, and act to meet the common danger in the Pacific area. In the Defense Treaty, South Korea allows the U.S. to station military forces there to deter North Korea. U.S. attention has focused on North Korea's nuclear weapons development and other concerning policies. North Korean actions impact U.S. relations with China and Japan. The United States and South Korea have a significant trade relationship, with total trade close to $80 billion annually. A Free Trade Agreement was signed in 2007 but has not been approved by Congress. The focus of U.S. policies towards North Korea has been on its nuclear weapons program, with other issues like human rights taking a backseat. On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test, followed by a second test on May 25, 2009. Estimates suggest they have 30 to 50 kilograms of nuclear weapons grade plutonium, enough for five to eight atomic bombs. North Korea also admitted to a uranium enrichment program in June 2009. North Korea has a uranium enrichment program that the United States has been aware of since 2002. Reports indicate North Korea has collaborated with Syria and Iran on nuclear technology, including developing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles. Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons programs have involved six parties since August 2003. Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons programs have involved six governments since August 2003. On April 14, 2009, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the six-party talks and its intention to restart the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. This decision was influenced by the failure to complete the disablement of Yongbyon, Kim Jong-il's stroke in August 2008, and other factors. The Obama Administration reacted to North Korea's missile and nuclear tests by seeking UN sanctions, which were approved in June 2009. The sanctions called for restrictions on financial transactions related to North Korean weapon sales. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korean trading companies and banks to prevent WMD transactions. US officials sought cooperation from China and other countries to enforce the sanctions, especially regarding financial transactions. China's role is crucial due to reported ties between North Korean entities and Chinese banks, air space, and airports. North Korea showed signs of moderation in its policies after Resolution 1974, including releasing American prisoners and taking conciliatory actions towards South Korea. Motives for this shift were unclear, but may have been influenced by food shortages in North Korea. North Korea's actions were influenced by its worsening food situation and efforts to restore U.S. and South Korean food aid donations. President Lee Myung-bak proposed a \"grand bargain\" for total denuclearization in exchange for aid, energy benefits, and diplomatic relations. Kim Jong-il called for U.S.-North Korean negotiations to end \"hostile policies.\" The Obama Administration sent Ambassador Stephen Bosworth to Pyongyang to seek commitments from North Korea to resume participation in six-party talks and denuclearization. North Korea made general commitments but did not specify a timeline for resuming talks. North Korean officials demanded the lifting of U.N. and U.S. sanctions and negotiations with the U.S. North Korea seeks to negotiate a U.S.-North Korean peace treaty, move the nuclear issue into bilateral negotiations, eliminate the \"U.S. nuclear threat,\" and lift U.N. and U.S. sanctions. North Korea has been accused of illegal activities by U.S. administrations since the mid-1990s. North Korea engages in illegal activities such as counterfeiting U.S. currency and trafficking drugs, with earnings going to Kim Jong-il. The Bush Administration took action in 2005 by naming Banco Delta Asia in Macau as a money laundering concern. Banco Delta Asia in Macau was accused of distributing North Korean counterfeit U.S. currency and laundering money for North Korean front companies. The Macau government closed the bank and froze over $24 million in North Korean accounts. Other countries also froze North Korean accounts following warnings from the Treasury Department. North Korea demanded the release of the $24 million in its accounts at Banco Delta Asia as part of the 2007 nuclear agreement. In April 2007, the Bush Administration allowed the release of $24 million frozen in North Korean accounts at Banco Delta Asia. The money was transferred to a private Russian bank through the New York Federal Reserve Bank. In December 2007, Japan revealed North Korea's earnings from counterfeit drugs and cigarettes, estimating up to $800 million annually. North Korea increased production of counterfeit cigarettes due to Chinese and Japanese measures. North Korea increased production of counterfeit cigarettes due to Chinese and Japanese measures against smuggling of North Korean drugs. The State Department reported a decline in North Korean drug trafficking but noted large-scale trafficking in counterfeit cigarettes and fake U.S. $100 bills. U.N. Security Resolution 1874 advised restricting North Korean trading companies and banks' access to foreign banking systems for financing weapons sales. The Obama Administration and the Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korean trading companies and banks, but China has not fully enforced them. North Korea's missile program has developed short-range Scud missiles and intermediate-range missiles, with newer solid-fuel Scuds capable of reaching all of South Korea. North Korea has made progress in its missile program, deploying 200-300 intermediate-range Nodong missiles with a range of 900 miles. They have also developed the Musudan missile with a range of 1,500-2,400 miles, capable of reaching Okinawa and Guam. However, they have not successfully developed a long-range missile to reach Alaska, Hawaii, or the U.S. west coast. On April 5, 2009, North Korea attempted to test launch a Taepodong II missile. The 2009 test of North Korea's Taepodong II missile was deemed a failure by U.S. officials and experts. The second and third stages fell short of the target by over 1,500 miles, indicating that North Korea had not mastered long-range missile technology. Despite this, some experts saw it as a significant advance towards developing a ballistic missile capable of carrying a warhead of 1,000 kilograms or more. The development of a ballistic missile by North Korea with a range of 7,000-10,500 kilometers, potentially reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. west coast. North Korea has exported missiles to countries in the Middle East and South Asia, collaborating with Iran and Pakistan on missile development. North Korea has developed sophisticated versions of the Nodong missile, known as the Shahab in Iran, along with the Musudan and Iranian Safir-2. Iranian delegations attended test launches of North Korean missiles in 2006 and 2009. Estimates suggest North Korea possesses 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons, including nerve gas and biological agents like anthrax and smallpox. Reports indicate North Korea is producing biological weapons at multiple facilities. North Korea pressured the Bush Administration to remove it from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism to gain access to financial resources from the World Bank and IMF. This move may also aim to reduce U.S. support for Japan on the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea. The objective is to reduce U.S. support for Japan regarding the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea. Japan has urged the U.S. to keep North Korea on the terrorism list until the kidnapping issue is resolved. North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens in 2002, claiming that 8 were dead. Another motive for North Korea may be to improve diplomatic relations with the U.S. before a final denuclearization agreement. North Korea's possible motives for seeking removal from the U.S. terrorism list include preventing the U.S. from using it as a negotiating lever, denying U.S. incentive to raise concerns about its activities in the Middle East, and removing obstacles to a final denuclearization agreement. Reports suggest North Korea has provided training and weapons to Hezbollah, cooperated with Iranian Revolutionary Guards on missile and nuclear development, and shipped weapons to Iran. The international community has donated over 12 million metric tons of food aid to North Korea to address chronic food shortages since the 1990s. The United States has provided over 2.2 million metric tons of food assistance worth nearly $800 million, with most aid channeled through the United Nations World Food Program. North Korea's gestures towards the United States and South Korea in 2009 may have been driven by a desire for more food aid. Reports indicate that North Korea faces severe food shortages in 2010 due to a poor harvest in 2008. North Korea rejected outside food aid in 2008 and 2009, including South Korean aid linked to the nuclear issue. South Korea had previously provided fertilizer and food to North Korea. In 2009, North Korea suspended the U.S. food aid program and ordered U.S. officials to leave. The Bush Administration had signed an agreement to provide North Korea with 500,000 metric tons of food, emphasizing monitoring and access for confirmation of receipt. North Korea expelled U.S. monitors and rejected food aid in 2009, citing objections to their presence. The Kim Jong-il regime also imposed new restrictions on the U.N. WFP and cracked down on private food markets. Food confiscations by the military increased amidst a sharp policy change in late 2009 due to reductions in food production. North Korea faces severe food shortages in 2009, with a significant decrease in corn and rice production. The WFP predicts a deficit of 1.8 million metric tons. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea conditions future aid on North Korea meeting policy requirements. In 2009, South Korea offered North Korea 10,000 tons of corn in response to a request for food aid. The Obama Administration expects North Korea to comply with monitoring mechanisms for any renewed U.S. food aid program. The North Korean government prioritizes the military and elite for food resources. The North Korean government prioritizes military and elite for food resources, refusing agricultural reforms. Estimates of North Korean refugees in China range from 20,000 to 300,000, with the exodus beginning in the mid-1990s due to food shortages. China tacitly accepted North Korean refugees, allowing foreign NGOs to provide aid while preventing official international aid presence. Periodic crackdowns and repatriation to North Korea were implemented to avoid destabilizing the Pyongyang regime. Refugees who gained asylum in foreign diplomatic missions were allowed to emigrate to South Korea. China aims to prevent a collapse of the Pyongyang regime and fears escalation of refugee outflow with too much visibility. China's crackdowns on North Korean refugees have increased since 2002, with reports of heightened security on the border and Chinese roundups for repatriation. South Korea accepts refugees at its missions and has resettled about 15,000 refugees, including 4,000 from 2007-2009. Aid groups operate an \"underground railroad\" to help refugees reach Southeast Asia. Several hundred North Korean refugees are transported through China into Southeast Asian countries, where they await repatriation to South Korea or other nations. The Bush Administration gave low priority to the refugee issue, requesting China to allow U.N. assistance but urging South Korea to lead diplomatically. The North Korean Human Rights Act allowed for the admission of refugees into the United States, with 64 refugees admitted by the end of 2008. Congressional hearings have addressed the issue, and a Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights was created. The North Korean Human Rights Act established the Special Envoy on North Korean Human Rights and emphasizes human rights in U.S. policy towards North Korea. It includes measures such as supporting human rights groups, increasing radio broadcasts into North Korea, and monitoring food aid. The Act was passed in response to reports on human rights violations in North Korea. Reports and accounts highlight severe human rights abuses by the North Korean government, with no foreseeable change in the near future. These abuses include denial of political, civil, and religious freedoms, harsh punishments for offenses, no tolerance for dissent or criticism of the leader, and restrictions on independent organizations. North Korea is noted as one of the most repressive countries for religion. Physical abuses are also reported for those who break laws. The North Korean government enforces severe human rights abuses, including concentration camps housing political prisoners in harsh conditions with low survival rates, family imprisonment policies, frequent executions, and torture. Citizens are subjected to extensive ideological indoctrination through regime-controlled media, mass campaigns, crackdowns on accessing independent information, and arrests by state security organizations. The Bush Administration's policy towards North Korean human rights practices and the role of the Special Envoy was controversial. They focused on the nuclear issue and planned to address human rights after North Korea terminated its nuclear program for normalization of relations. Jay Lefkowitz, the Special Envoy, had little involvement in negotiations with North Korea. The Bush Administration's approach to North Korean human rights drew criticism for its low priority. Special Envoy Jay Lefkowitz openly criticized the Administration's ineffective strategy and called for a new approach involving a human rights dialogue with Pyongyang. Lefkowitz proposed prioritizing human rights in negotiations with North Korea, but Hill did not address these issues in subsequent meetings. Under the Obama Administration, a human rights envoy will collaborate with relevant departments and international groups, but will not participate in six party talks or propose meetings with North Korea's leader. Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung implemented a \"sunshine policy\" of reconciliation with North Korea, meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in 2000. His successor, Roh Moo-hyun, continued these policies under a \"Peace and Prosperity Policy\" focused on reconciliation, cooperation, and peace with North Korea. South Korean officials believed these policies would encourage positive change within North Korea, including economic and humanitarian aid. The South Korean conciliation policy towards North Korea included economic and humanitarian aid, promotion of economic relations, separation of economic initiatives from political and military issues, and settlement of security issues through dialogue. This policy led to significant amounts of food and fertilizer aid, increased North-South trade, and reunion meetings for separated families. The South Korean conciliation policy towards North Korea included economic projects such as a tourist project at Mount Kumgang, connecting roads and railways across the DMZ, and an industrial complex at Kaesong. These projects led to increased economic cooperation, with South Korean companies investing in manufacturing and employing North Korean workers. Over 100 companies had set up facilities by November 2009, with plans for more investments and employment opportunities in the future. South Korea provided North Korea with $7 billion in economic aid between 1998 and 2008, including cash from Mount Kumgang and Kaesong projects. The cash payments were directed through Bureau 39 of the North Korean Workers Party, reportedly controlled by Kim Jong-il, for luxury product procurement. North Korea used South Korean cash payments for luxury products for Kim Jong-il and weapons components. South Korean officials were involved in transferring money to North Korean accounts in Macau. From 1999, U.S. military officials suspected North Korea of using South Korean cash payments for military purposes. North Korea received over $1 billion in cash payments from Hyundai in 1999-2000, accelerating foreign exchange expenditures for its secret uranium enrichment program. CIA estimates suggest North Korea started procuring uranium enrichment technology in 1999 and increased procurements in 2000 and 2001. South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak, who took office in February 2008, continued Roh Moo-hyun's policies of providing humanitarian aid to North Korea. He introduced a \"3000 Policy\" to raise North Korea's per capita income to $3,000 in 10 years. Lee reviewed infrastructure projects promised by Roh Moo-hyun, considering canceling or postponing them based on progress in the North Korean nuclear issue, economic feasibility, financial costs, and public support. He emphasized linking South Korean policy towards North Korea with economic cooperation. President Lee Myung-bak aimed to align South Korean policy towards North Korea with the status of nuclear negotiations, advocating for complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear programs and weapons. He also planned to address human rights issues, including South Korean fishermen and soldiers held captive by North Korea. However, North Korea responded by cutting off relations and rejecting aid, leading to tensions between the two countries. North Korea demanded higher wages and land rents from South Korean firms at Kaesong, threatening armed confrontation with South Korea. However, after July 2009, North Korea began to ease restrictions on Kaesong and allowed a reunion of divided Korean family members. In October 2009, North Korea requested food aid from South Korea due to a deteriorating food situation. President Lee welcomed these gestures but emphasized the need for North Korea to commit to denuclearization. President Lee emphasized the need for North Korea to commit to denuclearization in exchange for economic cooperation, including food aid and security guarantees. He supported sanctions on North Korea and stressed policy conditions in response to North Korean overtures for a summit. In 2007, the United States and South Korea signed the KORUS FTA, the largest FTA for South Korea and the second-largest for the US after NAFTA. The agreement aims to increase bilateral trade and investment flows, covering various trade and investment issues with wide economic implications. It includes provisions for tariff elimination on most manufactured goods and partial liberalization of services trade, as well as addressing sensitive issues like autos, agriculture, and trade remedies. The KORUS FTA was signed in 2007 between the US and South Korea, aiming to increase bilateral trade and investment. Negotiations included provisions on tariff elimination, services trade, autos, agriculture, and trade remedies. The FTA requires congressional approval through implementation legislation under the trade promotion authority granted by Congress in 2002. The Obama Administration has not yet sent the draft legislation to Congress, but there is support for the agreement in both countries. The KORUS FTA, signed in 2007 between the US and South Korea, aims to increase bilateral trade and investment. U.S. supporters see it as crucial for new business opportunities in South Korea, while some argue it will strengthen the alliance. However, auto and steel manufacturers oppose it due to concerns about imports, and the U.S. agricultural community is hesitant due to beef import restrictions. The KORUS FTA, signed in 2007 between the US and South Korea, aims to increase bilateral trade and investment. U.S. negotiators reached an agreement in 2008 to end South Korea's ban on imports of U.S. beef due to mad cow disease fears. Despite the agreement, massive public demonstrations erupted against the Lee government due to safety concerns and rumors about U.S. beef. In response, the agreement was revised in late June 2008 to limit sales of U.S. beef from cattle. The Lee administration revised the agreement in late June 2008 to limit sales of U.S. beef from cattle less than 30 months old. U.S. beef began to be sold at retail outlets in Seoul in July 2008, and public demonstrations began to wane. Barack Obama criticized the FTA during and after the 2008 presidential campaign. The Obama Administration demanded new provisions for U.S. automobile companies' access to the South Korean market. President Obama and President Lee indicated the possibility of new talks over automobiles during Obama's visit to Seoul in November 2009. The Obama Administration also called for a further relaxation of South Korean restrictions on imports of U.S. beef. The U.S. administration seeks side agreements on autos and beef with South Korea, facing strong opposition in Congress. President Lee may lack political support for concessions. South Korea signed a Free Trade Agreement with the EU in 2009, similar to the U.S.-R.O.K. FTA. The U.S.-South Korea alliance is addressing issues like troop relocations and force reductions. Since 2000, changes in U.S.-South Korea military relations include possible reductions of U.S. forces in South Korea, South Korean military contribution to Afghanistan, and cost-sharing for maintaining U.S. forces. These changes were influenced by factors like North Korean military deterioration, anti-U.S. protests in South Korea, global military restructuring plans, and U.S. commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2004, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld approved a program to reduce and relocate U.S. forces in South Korea, including withdrawing troops from the demilitarized zone. The U.S. is relocating troops from the demilitarized zone to \"hub bases\" in Pyongtaek, South Korea. The original cost estimate was over $10 billion, with South Korea contributing $4 billion. New estimates exceed $13 billion, and the relocations may not occur until 2015 or 2016. The main U.S. Air Force base at Osan will remain with nearly 6,000 personnel. The Pentagon announced in 2008 that U.S. military families can join personnel in South Korea, increasing the community size to over 53,000. Secretary Rumsfeld accepted a proposal to establish separate South Korean and U.S. military commands, with completion set for April 17, 2012. A new U.S. Korea Command (KORCOM) will be established under the Opcon agreement, with a Military Cooperation Center responsible for planning military operations, joint exercises, logistics support, and intelligence exchanges. There are concerns about North Korea's nuclear capabilities leading to calls for canceling or postponing the agreement. The final Opcon transfer decision in 2012 will consider \"political conditions.\" The Pentagon's Rumsfeld program withdrew a combat brigade from the Second Division for Iraq. In 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates halted the troop withdrawals in South Korea at 28,500. U.S. commanders indicated a shift towards an air force and naval role in South Korea's defense. The U.S. Air Force increased its presence through rotations of advanced strike aircraft since 2004. In 2009, there was talk of deploying U.S. forces in South Korea to other conflicts for \"strategic flexibility.\" Admiral Mike Mullen mentioned this on October 22, 2009. Admiral Mike Mullen discussed the potential move of U.S. forces in South Korea to Afghanistan in 2009. President Obama also mentioned the deployment of some troops to Afghanistan during his visit to South Korea. Changes in the status of U.S. ground forces could coincide with the Opcon agreement in 2012. There is talk of expanding the alliance beyond the Korean peninsula with the election of President Lee Myung-bak. President Roh Moo-hyun sent 3,600 R.O.K. troops to Iraq in 2004. In 2007, South Korea withdrew non-combat military personnel from Afghanistan and paid a ransom to the Taliban for kidnapped missionaries. Discussions were held regarding a potential South Korean military contribution to the allied effort in Afghanistan. The South Korean government announced plans to send troops to Afghanistan to support a Provincial Reconstruction Team, with a proposed number of 300 or more troops. They are considering a site north of Kabul and need approval and funding from the Korean National Assembly. South Korea also requested an upgrade in their arms purchaser status from the U.S. to NATO Plus Three category. The U.S. Executive Branch is considering upgrading South Korea's arms sales notification threshold to $25 million. Legislation has been introduced to grant South Korea NATO Plus Three status. South Korea's direct financial contribution for U.S. troops in 2010 will be $571 million, about 42% of the total cost. Pentagon officials are calling for South Korea to increase its share to at least 50%. South Korea was governed by authoritarian leaders Rhee Syngman, Park Chung-hee, and Chun Doo-hwan until 1988. Park and Chun seized power through coup d'etats and restricted political and civil liberties. Park's government orchestrated the Korean \"economic miracle,\" transforming the country into a modern industrial powerhouse. Pro-democracy demonstrations in 1987 led to a new constitution and free presidential elections. Since then, five presidents have been elected, with a President serving a single five-year term. Since 1987, South Korea has seen significant political reforms, including the election of five presidents to single five-year terms. The National Assembly gained expanded powers, courts became more independent, and local governments were granted more autonomy. New political forces emerged alongside traditional elements, with the military ending its political role. Political parties, historically weak and unstable, have grown in importance but still retain some authoritarian characteristics. Political parties in South Korea have historically been appendages of powerful leaders, based in different regions. Members prioritize loyalty to the leader over the party itself, using parties as a means to gain power. This has led to party instability, with examples like the disintegration of the Uri Party in 2007 under President Roh Moo-hyun. Defections from the party occurred due to low public approval ratings, reducing Uri's strength in the National Assembly. In 2007, the Uri Party disintegrated under President Roh Moo-hyun, leading to defections and a weakened presence in the National Assembly. The United Democratic Party was formed by remaining leaders but entered the 2007 presidential race in a weakened state. The opposition Grand National Party's candidate, Lee Myung-bak, won the election with a pro-business platform focused on economic growth and job creation. Lee's party also secured a majority in the National Assembly in the April 2008 election. The Grand National Party won 153 of 299 National Assembly seats in the April 9, 2008 election, giving them a parliamentary majority of 171 seats after merging with another conservative party. Former President Roh's United Democratic Party only won 81 seats. President Lee faced challenges from anti-U.S. beef protests, low approval ratings, and the impact of the 2008 global recession on South Korea's economy. Despite backing off from some policy initiatives, Lee's efforts to enhance South Korea's role in international economic organizations were successful. Lee successfully enhanced South Korea's role in international economic organizations like the G-20 and tackled North Korea's hostile policy from 2008 to 2009. South Korea's economy grew by nearly 3% annually in the latter half of 2009, boosting Lee's popularity with approval ratings close to 50%. His main economic goal for 2010 is creating 200,000 new jobs. Political parties since 1987 have shown sharper ideological divisions, especially on North Korea and U.S. relations, with generational differences in attitudes towards the U.S. and North Korea. Since the anti-U.S. protests of 2002, South Korean attitudes towards North Korea have become more critical, leading to greater public support for the U.S.-R.O.K. alliance. Non-governmental groups influence key policy issues such as labor unions, environmental policies, and government support for farmers. The press in South Korea includes newspapers and news-oriented websites. The CRS reports discuss North Korea's nuclear tests, technical issues, nuclear weapons development, diplomacy, China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the proposed U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement."
