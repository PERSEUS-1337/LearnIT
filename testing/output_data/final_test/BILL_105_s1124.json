    "content": "The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997 may be cited as the \"Workplace Religious Freedom Act.\" Amendments are also included in the Act. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997, also known as the \"Workplace Religious Freedom Act,\" includes amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 regarding definitions related to employee religious accommodations and undue hardship. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997 includes factors to consider when determining undue hardship for religious accommodations, such as identifiable costs, number of individuals needing accommodation, and geographic separateness for employers with multiple facilities. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1997 outlines factors for determining undue hardship for religious accommodations, including costs, number of individuals needing accommodation, and geographic separateness or administrative relationships of facilities. Amendments to Section 703 of the Act define terms related to employment practices, such as the inclusion of prospective employees and the definition of \"leave of general usage.\" The term 'undue hardship' is defined in Section 701(j)(3). An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if they fail to provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee's religious observance, which must remove the conflict between work requirements and religious practices. Refusing to allow the use of general leave for religious accommodations is also considered a violation. The employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee's religious observance, even if it conflicts with a seniority system. This could include adjusting work hours, shifts, or job assignments that would not normally be available, or allowing employees to voluntarily exchange shifts or job assignments. An employer is not required to pay extra wages or benefits for work done during hours where they would typically apply, if it's only to accommodate an employee's religious requirements. Premium benefits include things like seniority, insurance, and leave, while premium wages cover overtime pay. The term 'premium wages' includes overtime pay, compensatory time off, premium pay for night, weekend, or holiday work, and premium pay for standby or irregular duty. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS. This Act and the amendments made by section 2 take effect on the date of enactment, except for conduct occurring before the enactment date."
