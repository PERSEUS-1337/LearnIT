    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 8610.5 of the Government Code defines terms related to emergency services and utilities. It states that costs not covered by federal funds for emergency activities must be covered by utilities operating nuclear power plants. The Public Utilities Commission will establish a fair method for utilities to contribute to state agency costs. Each local government must submit their costs to the office. Utilities are required to pay their share of state and local agency costs to the Controller for deposit in the Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account. The Controller allocates funds for activities outlined in this section and Chapter 4 of the Health and Safety Code. The Controller may disburse up to 80 percent of a fiscal year allocation from the Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account in advance for local expenses certified by the office. The office reviews program expenditures, and the Controller pays based on approved expenditures. State costs from a utility operating a nuclear powerplant shall not exceed actual costs or maximum funding levels established in this section. The annual amount for the 2009-10 fiscal year is $2,047,000, with $1,094,000 for the office and $953,000 for the State Department of Public Health for activities related to the Health and Safety Code. The total annual disbursement for local costs from a utility shall not exceed the maximum funding levels established in this section, with a maximum amount of $1,732,000 for the Diablo Canyon site. Amounts paid by a utility under this section are allowed for ratemaking purposes by the Public Utilities Commission. The disbursement amounts for state and local costs will be adjusted annually based on the prevailing wage or the California Consumer Price Index. Funds can be carried over for one year if unexpended, and can be used when the current year's funding cap is exceeded. This section will be in effect from July 1, 2019, until August 26, 2025, and will be repealed on January 1, 2026. The commission will convene an independent peer review panel to review seismic studies of the Diablo Canyon powerplant until August 26, 2025. The panel will include experts from various agencies. The independent peer review panel will review seismic studies of the Diablo Canyon powerplant and hold public meetings. Reports by the panel will be made publicly available on the commission's website. This act is an urgency statute for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. The Public Utilities Commission convened an independent peer review panel to evaluate seismic studies for the Diablo Canyon powerplant. The panel ensures the studies are conducted appropriately and reviews enhanced seismic surveys for public safety. The Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account is crucial for public safety and emergency preparedness. Extending its expiration date will ensure maintenance of the state's nuclear emergency programs and provide certainty for response planning. This act must take effect immediately."
