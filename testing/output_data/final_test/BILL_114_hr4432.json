    "content": "The Commercial UAS Modernization Act is cited as the short title. It introduces an interim rule for the operation of small unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes under the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. An individual can operate a small unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes in the US without an airworthiness certificate, subject to requirements and restrictions until a final rule is in effect. Liability insurance is required for commercial operation during this period. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act requires registration of small unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes and the development of an aeronautical knowledge test by the FAA. Operating a small unmanned aircraft commercially is subject to testing requirements. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act mandates registration of small unmanned aircraft for commercial use and passing a proficiency test to demonstrate the ability to fly the aircraft in accordance with operating restrictions before certification for commercial operations. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act requires small unmanned aircraft for commercial use to meet specific requirements and operating restrictions, including visual line of sight rules, a maximum altitude of 500 feet above ground level, and prior authorization in certain airspace. Small unmanned aircraft operating in Class E airspace designated for an airport must adhere to daylight conditions, yield right of way, be operated by individuals without impairments, and undergo a preflight inspection. Accidents causing injury or property damage must be reported to the FAA. Accidents causing injury or property damage must be reported to the Federal Aviation Administration within 2 days. SEC. 338. MICRO UAS OPERATIONS. The Federal Aviation Administration will classify micro UAS as unmanned aircraft systems weighing up to 4.4 pounds, with operational limitations including flying below 400 feet, at a speed of 40 knots or less, within visual line of sight, during daylight, and at least 5 miles from an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration classifies micro UAS as unmanned aircraft systems weighing up to 4.4 pounds, with operational limitations. An individual may operate a micro UAS within 5 statute miles of a tower-controlled airport without passing any aeronautical knowledge test or meeting age/experience requirements. The micro UAS and its components are not required to meet airworthiness certification standards. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 amended certification standards for airworthiness of unmanned aircraft systems. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 introduced new regulations for small unmanned aircraft operations, including the appointment of a Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated the appointment of a Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. The Deputy Associate Administrator is responsible for developing a research and development plan for the safe integration of unmanned aircraft into the National Airspace System, considering work from other federal agencies and industry partners, conducting an audit of current unmanned aircraft activities to identify gaps, overlaps, and allowing for programmatic exemptions based on analysis. The Deputy Associate Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator, will develop strategies to address unmanned aircraft spectrum issues, barriers to operating beyond line of sight, payload carriage, and automated unmanned aircraft systems. Within 90 days of the Commercial UAS Modernization Act enactment, exemptions from interim operating restrictions will be expedited and expanded. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act allows for exemptions from operating restrictions for unmanned aircraft, including beyond line of sight operations, programmatic exemptions, extended visual line of sight, and heavier unmanned vehicles. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. SEC. 339 establishes the Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will establish a joint aircraft system research and development program at the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The program will prioritize data collection, analysis, and research on safety standards for autonomous aircraft systems and air traffic management. It will utilize the FAA's unmanned aircraft system test sites for research and data collection to expedite commercial development. The Federal Aviation Administration will establish a joint aircraft system research and development program at the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The program will prioritize data collection, analysis, and research on safety standards for autonomous aircraft systems and air traffic management. It will work with other agencies and stakeholders to implement commercial unmanned aircraft system operations. Additionally, an air traffic management pilot program will be implemented to research and test a new regulatory structure for small unmanned aircraft operations in controlled and uncontrolled airspace below 1,200 feet above ground level. The Center will partner with a third party to test small unmanned aircraft management in airspace below 1,200 feet. The Director will submit reports every 180 days to specific Senate and House committees summarizing actions taken under subsections (b), (c), and (d)."
