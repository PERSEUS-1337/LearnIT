    "content": "The \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that women have entered the workforce in record numbers but still earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work, leading to wage depression for working families and hindering the optimal use of labor resources. These pay disparities are attributed to intentional discrimination or the effects of past discrimination. Congress finds that labor resources have been spread among workers through commerce, burdening commerce and obstructing the free flow of goods. This leads to unfair competition, labor disputes, and interferes with the marketing of goods. In many cases, it may deprive workers of equal protection based on sex, violating constitutional amendments. Artificial barriers hinder the elimination of these issues. Artificial barriers to wage discrimination based on sex persist over 3 decades after the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would positively impact the economy by addressing unfair pay disparities, reducing the number of women earning low wages, promoting stable families, and remedying past discrimination effects. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 aims to address past discrimination based on sex and ensure equal protection for workers in the future. It provides provisions for equal pay for work of equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions. Some employers have already taken steps to eliminate unfair pay disparities in the workplace. Achievements in eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace should be acknowledged. SEC. 3.
