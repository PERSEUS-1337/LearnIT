    "content": "Broadband, also known as high-speed Internet service, has been widely deployed in the United States since the late 1990s by private sector providers such as telephone companies, cable companies, and wireless providers. However, there are still parts of the nation, particularly rural areas, where broadband access is limited. Some communities are dissatisfied with the current broadband services due to issues like slow speeds, outdated technology, poor reliability, high prices, and limited provider options. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering defining the minimum broadband speed at 25 Mbps, which may highlight the lack of adequate broadband in more communities. Some communities in rural areas are turning to public entities for better broadband service, anticipating superior speed, performance, and affordability compared to private providers. Public entities like local governments or public utilities may construct and manage broadband networks alone or in partnership with private companies. Municipal broadband models vary across the nation to address unique community challenges. Municipal broadband, also known as community broadband, involves local governments participating in providing broadband service. Models include public ownership, public-private partnerships, and cooperatives. Public ownership entails the local government building and operating the network, which can be managed by a municipal utility or city department. Public-private partnerships involve collaboration between public and private entities in various forms. Municipal broadband can take various forms, including public-private partnerships, government-funded projects, and cooperative models involving private companies, nonprofits, and residents. Some cooperatives, originally established during rural electrification, now provide broadband services with support from the Rural Utilities Service. Municipal broadband networks in the U.S., such as the East Central Vermont Community Fiber Network and the WiredWest project in Massachusetts, vary in governance models and services offered. They may provide wholesale or retail service, serve different types of customers, extend beyond municipal boundaries, and offer various types of data and communication services. Municipal broadband projects in the U.S. utilize various technologies like fiber, wireless, or cable, often in small to mid-sized rural communities. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance lists 492 municipalities with broadband networks, including 89 with publicly owned fiber networks. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance lists numerous municipalities in the U.S. with publicly owned broadband networks, including fiber, cable, and wireless technologies. Municipal broadband projects have been implemented in various small to mid-sized rural communities, with a significant number of deployments in states like Washington, Kentucky, and Minnesota. The debate over the benefits and challenges of municipal broadband continues among policymakers and stakeholders. Advocates for municipal broadband argue that communities are dissatisfied with existing private broadband services due to low speeds, high prices, and lack of competition. They believe municipalities should provide broadband to meet citizens' needs and support economic development, especially in rural areas where the digital divide persists. There is a digital divide between rural and urban areas in terms of broadband access. Municipal networks can introduce competition in areas with limited providers, potentially leading to lower prices and increased speeds. Lack of competition can result in high prices, poor customer service, and limited service options. Municipal broadband can address public interest needs and encourage private providers to improve their services. Municipal broadband entities, publicly owned, may offer affordable broadband to low-income households. Critics argue against government-owned broadband competing with private providers due to unfair advantages like preferential treatment and taxpayer subsidies. Taxpayer subsidies or government bonds with below-market interest rates can unfairly skew the competitive playing field between private and public providers. Anti-municipal broadband arguments include the high-risk nature of deploying broadband systems, governments being ill-equipped to operate efficient commercial broadband systems, and taxpayer money being better directed towards traditional infrastructure needs. According to the FCC, private industry invests billions in broadband networks, but municipal broadband may deter private investment due to market distortion. Government bureaucracy may lead to reliance on outdated technology in municipal broadband projects. Supporters and opponents debate the success and failure of existing projects among hundreds of municipal broadband initiatives. Municipal broadband projects vary in success and failure, with supporters highlighting improved services, lower prices, increased competition, and private-sector investment. Opponents point to unprofitable networks, lack of private competition, and managerial inefficiency. Both sides use examples like the Lafayette, LA, municipal fiber network, LUS Fiber, to support their arguments. LUS Fiber, a municipal fiber network in Lafayette, LA, funded by bond revenues, was established in 2008 and connected to customers in 2009. The network has led to lower prices for residents, with savings estimated at $4 million from deferred rate increases by competing firms like Cox Communications. LUS Fiber's prices have consistently been lower than Cox's, benefiting the community and local anchor institutions. LUS Fiber's fiber system is projected to save $90-100 million over 10 years. Companies like Pixel Magic and Skyscraper Holding have moved to Lafayette for fast, affordable broadband. However, opponents claim LUS Fiber is falling short of revenue projections and is in significant debt. LUS Fiber is struggling to compete with other service providers in terms of price, performance, and service options. City auditors have warned about low revenues, with the system incurring a $2.5 million operating loss for the year. Operating revenues were $23 million, falling short of the forecasted $36.7 million. The original plan aimed for a profit of $902,000, but the system is currently facing a deficit. LUS Fiber's deficit has increased to $47 million from $37.1 million the previous year. The FCC is actively promoting broadband services and infrastructure, transitioning the Universal Service Fund to support broadband deployment, modernizing the Schools and Libraries Program for high-speed connections, and expanding the Lifeline Program to include broadband support. Former FCC Chairman Wheeler expressed support for these initiatives. On July 24, 2014, the City of Wilson and Electric Power Board of Chattanooga petitioned the FCC to preempt state laws restricting their broadband network deployment. Both providers offer gigabit speed broadband services alongside electric utilities. Wilson operates in North Carolina, while EPB is in Tennessee. Wilson and EPB petitioned the FCC to preempt state laws restricting their broadband network deployment. They claim they are willing to expand services to other counties but are restricted by Tennessee state law. The FCC granted petitions from Wilson and EPB to preempt state laws in North Carolina and Tennessee that restricted the expansion of community broadband services. This decision was made in February 2015 and became effective in March 2015. The FCC preempted state laws in North Carolina and Tennessee that hindered broadband deployment and competition, citing its authority under Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This action aimed to promote infrastructure investment and competition in the telecommunications market. The FCC preempted state laws in Tennessee and North Carolina that hindered broadband deployment and competition, citing its authority under Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Order stated that preemption of these restrictions will expand broadband investment and deployment, increase competition, and serve the public interest. The FCC found that the geographic and other restrictions in these laws were barriers to broadband infrastructure investment and competition, in conflict with Section 706. Specifically, the Order concluded that the territorial restriction in Tennessee Code Section 601 was a barrier to broadband deployment and infrastructure investment. The FCC granted the Wilson petition in part, stating that certain provisions in North Carolina law act as barriers to broadband infrastructure investment and competition. While the FCC cannot preempt state laws banning municipal broadband networks, it can intervene if restrictions hinder timely deployment of advanced telecommunications services. The FCC can preempt state laws that restrict municipal broadband deployment if they create barriers to investment and competition. The decision was not unanimous, with Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly dissenting. Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly dissented, arguing that the FCC lacked the authority to grant the petitions filed by Tennessee and North Carolina challenging the FCC's preemption of broadband restrictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals ultimately reversed the FCC's Order, stating that the FCC overstepped its bounds in reallocating decision-making power between states and municipalities. The FCC's preemption of broadband restrictions was challenged by Tennessee and North Carolina, leading to a reversal of the order by the U.S. Court of Appeals. President Obama announced initiatives to expand broadband access, including the establishment of the Broadband Opportunity Council. The memorandum established the Broadband Opportunity Council chaired by the Department of Commerce and the USDA, with 25 other member agencies. The Council aimed to support communities in expanding broadband access, identify regulatory barriers, report on existing programs, and take actions to increase broadband competition, deployment, and adoption. The Administration released the Broadband Opportunity Council Report and Recommendations on September 21, 2015, with nine recommendations encompassing 36 actions. NTIA released the Broadband Opportunity Council Agencies' Progress Report in January 2017, detailing agency progress on nine recommendations and 36 actions. BroadbandUSA, established by NTIA, provides resources and assistance for communities developing broadband partnerships. BroadbandUSA provides resources and tools for communities to address broadband infrastructure issues and is developing an online tool for planning and assessment. The federal government has supported municipal broadband projects through funding programs like the $7 billion broadband stimulus program established by the ARRA. The ARRA broadband programs have concluded, with no more funding to be awarded. Currently, the RUS offers three ongoing programs for broadband infrastructure funding: Farm Bill Broadband Loans, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans, and Community Connect Grants. Funding tends to go to private providers, with the Connect America Fund also providing ongoing support for broadband infrastructure. Loans are used for upfront capital to invest in broadband infrastructure, with ongoing subsidies from the CAF to support broadband networks in high-cost areas. Several bills in the 114th Congress addressed the municipal broadband debate, with provisions ranging from restricting states and localities from prohibiting public broadband to preventing the FCC from preempting state laws. None of these measures were enacted. The Community Broadband Act of 2015 (S. 240) aims to remove state barriers for municipal broadband networks and promote public-private partnerships. It prohibits states from blocking public entities from offering telecommunications services and encourages fair treatment of private providers by public entities. The Act also emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships in expanding broadband access. S. 240 promotes public-private partnerships for municipal broadband projects and requires extensive public notice. It prohibits the use of federal funds to revive failed projects and exempts public providers from anti-discrimination requirements in certain cases. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The State's Rights Municipal Broadband Act of 2015 (S. 597 and H.R. 1106) prohibits states from enacting laws that restrict public providers from offering advanced telecommunications services. It also states that the FCC cannot preempt states with existing municipal broadband laws or any states that adopt such laws in the future. The bills were referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The bills introduced in 2015 (S. 597 and H.R. 1106) aim to prevent states from restricting public providers from offering advanced telecommunications services. Draft legislation released by Republican leaders includes a provision that prohibits the FCC from relying on Section 706 as a grant of authority, which conflicts with the FCC's final Order. Congress and the FCC have been working on policies to encourage broadband deployment since the late 1990s. The debate over municipal broadband revolves around whether locally owned networks should be encouraged or restricted. Congress and the FCC are balancing competing public policy interests as they address the issue, considering the diverse factors that can lead to success or failure in these projects. Supporters and opponents cite numerous examples to make their arguments. The FCC lifted restrictions on municipal broadband networks in Wilson, NC, and Chattanooga, TN, on March 12, 2015. There are debates over whether public entities should be allowed to compete with private sector providers in deploying broadband infrastructure. Congress has addressed the debate over municipal broadband restrictions through oversight of the FCC and appropriations process. Committees are considering measures to either prevent the FCC from overruling state restrictions or override them. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 5016 aimed to prevent the FCC from interfering with 20 states' broadband laws. Congress has debated ways to support municipal broadband, including funding infrastructure and considering policies like loans, grants, tax incentives, and regulatory measures. The issue of municipal broadband deployment is part of broader discussions on promoting broadband access, which may involve rewriting the Communications Act of 1934. In considering ways to promote broadband access, Congress is debating the balance between government support in underserved areas and minimizing negative impacts on competition and private sector investment."
