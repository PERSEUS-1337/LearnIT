    "content": "Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress view Poland as a key ally in Europe, with close cooperation on various issues including NATO capabilities, counterterrorism, human rights, and economic growth. Poland is the most populous country in Central Europe and the Baltic region, with a strong military presence. The Congressional Caucus on Poland works to strengthen the U.S.-Poland relationship and address mutual interests. Poland, with strong support from the United States and Members of Congress, joined NATO and the European Union in 2004. Analysts note Poland's reliance on the U.S. for foreign policy leadership. Many Members of Congress prioritize a close transatlantic relationship, supporting U.S. interests through EU, NATO, and a \"whole and free\" Europe. Congressional activities often involve European economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Poland's significance in U.S.-European relations, NATO, and legislative activities is highlighted due to its role in addressing challenges like the conflict in eastern Ukraine and concerns about Russia. Congress is also interested in Poland due to its governance trends, particularly since the 2015 parliamentary election led by Prime Minister Beata Szydlo. The government of Poland is led by Prime Minister Beata Szydlo of the Law and Justice Party, which won an absolute parliamentary majority in the 2015 election. Prior to that, the center-right Civic Platform party was in power from 2007 to 2015. Donald Tusk was the prime minister during most of this period. In the 2015 election, the Law and Justice Party gained momentum as Andrzej Duda unexpectedly defeated the incumbent president, Bronislaw Komorowski of Civic Platform. Duda, 43, became the new president of Poland in August 2015, attributing the Law and Justice Party's victory to voter fatigue towards Civic Platform and discontent with the political establishment. The Law and Justice Party gained momentum in the 2015 election, with Andrzej Duda defeating the incumbent president from Civic Platform. Discontent with the political establishment and a change in leadership were factors in Civic Platform's decline. The party was also affected by the \"Waitergate\" scandal, leading to the resignation of government ministers. The Law and Justice Party advocated for more statist-nationalist economic policies, contrasting with Civic Platform's \"free market\" approach. The Law and Justice Party, led by the Kaczynski brothers, co-founded in 2001, gained power in 2015. Lech Kaczynski, former president, died in a plane crash in 2010. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, party chairman, wields significant influence despite no formal government role. The party's controversial actions, including changes to the Constitutional Tribunal, have drawn criticism for undermining the rule of law. The government's changes to the Constitutional Tribunal undermine the rule of law by placing the court under political control. President Duda refused to confirm the appointment of five new judges by the outgoing government, citing democratic principles. The Law and Justice government then selected five new judges to the tribunal. The government selected five new judges for the tribunal, who were sworn in by President Duda. A reorganization of the tribunal in December 2015 changed the rules for rulings, requiring a two-thirds majority and extending the waiting period. Critics argue these changes limit the court's decision-making ability. Jaroslaw Kaczynski criticized the tribunal, calling it \"the bastion of everything in Poland that is bad.\" The Venice Commission warned that the Constitutional Tribunal's inability to function efficiently threatens democracy and human rights in Poland. The government rejected a ruling declaring changes to the tribunal illegal, claiming it was not legally binding. Additionally, a controversial law granted the government direct control over public media management, sparking criticism. Critics argue that the Law and Justice Party's move to control public media compromises its independence, with international journalist organizations calling it \"wholly unacceptable in a genuine democracy.\" The government claims it is necessary to ensure media impartiality. Critics also point out other controversial actions by the government, such as politicizing the civil service and expanding police surveillance powers. The Law and Justice Party in Poland is facing scrutiny from the European Commission for changes to the Constitutional Tribunal and public media, potentially leading to sanctions under the EU's rule-of-law framework. The party's euro-skeptic approach prioritizes national sovereignty over European integration, causing tension with the EU. Concerns over democracy and rule of law have sparked public protests in Poland. The Law and Justice government in Poland's actions regarding democracy and rule of law have led to large public protests. Social tensions have been heightened by accusations against Lech Walesa, the first democratically elected president, of being a secret police informant. Observers believe this is part of a strategy to discredit previous governments and highlight flaws in Poland's post-Communist development. Polish politics are divided between \"Western-oriented liberals\" and \"national-oriented social conservatives.\" The country's economy is one of the most successful in Central and Eastern Europe. Poland's economy is successful in Central and Eastern Europe, with a strong private sector. Despite the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, Poland's economy grew, and it was the only EU economy to grow in 2009. The government focused on fiscal consolidation, reducing the budget deficit and government debt. Unemployment rates have also been a concern. Poland's economy has shown resilience, with government debt at 52% of GDP in 2015. Unemployment decreased from 13.5% in 2013 to 10%. Despite being an EU member since 2004, Poland has not adopted the euro due to the Eurozone debt crisis. There is no fixed date for adopting the euro, but Poland supports tighter European integration and fiscal austerity. The Law and Justice Party in Poland proposed economic policies to benefit households, including new benefits for low-income families and lowering the retirement age. They also plan to introduce new taxes on large foreign-owned banks and retailers to reduce dependence on foreign capital, potentially conflicting with EU rules. The Polish government's economic policies may conflict with EU rules, including initiatives to reduce foreign currency liabilities by converting mortgages into z\u0142oty. Poland's defense strategy focuses on territorial defense, NATO membership, and building foreign and security policy around alliances with NATO, the EU, the United States, Nordic and Baltic neighbors, and Visegr\u00e1d Group partners. Analysts have noted a defense policy to prepare Poland to defend itself without immediate assistance, with the ninth-largest army in NATO. Poland has the ninth-largest army in NATO with 48,200 active personnel and a total of approximately 99,300 across all branches. The country is undergoing a 10-year military transformation to develop a smaller, more capable, and deployable military. Despite budgetary pressures, Poland is investing in a broad equipment acquisition program to upgrade its military assets. Plans include spending around $35 billion on military modernization from 2013 to 2022. In 2014, the government announced intentions to increase defense spending to NATO's target level of 2% of GDP. Poland's defense expenditures were 1.85% of GDP in 2014 and reached 2.18% in 2015. The Law and Justice Party proposed increasing defense spending to 2.5% of GDP. A Foreign Military Sales agreement for air-launched cruise missiles and F-16 upgrades was finalized with the United States in December 2014. Delivery is set to begin in the second half of 2016. Poland's defense modernization efforts include plans to purchase new attack helicopters and heavy-lift helicopters. The Polish Air Force has F-16C/Ds, Mig-29s, and Su-22s. The army has over 900 main battle tanks, including German-made Leopard 2A4/5s, Soviet-era T-72M1s, and modernized PT-91s. The government is reviewing security modernization programs. Poland is reevaluating its security modernization programs, including reconsidering a $2 billion deal with Raytheon for Patriot missile systems. The government is dissatisfied with the high price, long delivery time, and changing conditions since the announcement. The Polish Ministry of Defense announced the selection of Airbus Helicopters H225M Caracal to replace Soviet-legacy helicopters. The $3 billion agreement was initially for 70 helicopters but reduced to 50, with newer Mi-17s kept in service until 2026-2027. Some analysts were surprised by the choice over the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk. Law and Justice government officials criticized flaws in the selection process. The Polish government approved a plan to resettle migrants in 2015, leading to debates and divisions in society. The decision was controversial, with the Law and Justice Party strongly criticizing it. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, the Law and Justice Minister for European Affairs stated that the new Polish government did not support the EU's relocation initiative due to various reasons such as economic concerns, reluctance as a relatively homogenous society, security fears, and nationalism. Poland and the United States have had close relations since the end of the Cold War, with the US strongly supporting Poland's accession to NATO in 1999. The United States has supported Poland's NATO accession and both countries have close relations. Poland has been a key ally in global counterterrorism efforts and has contributed troops to missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S.-Poland relationship is based on shared values, with Poland being a leading partner in democracy promotion efforts. Cultural ties further anchor the relationship between the two countries. The United States and Poland have close relations with considerable cultural ties, supported by shared values. While largely positive, some Poles have expressed disappointment over unfulfilled expectations for increased military assistance and visa policy changes. Poland has been a key ally in NATO missions, but concerns over the rule of law have been raised by both U.S. Congress members and the Administration. Poland has been calling for a permanent NATO presence with U.S. troops on its territory as a security guarantee against Russia. President Duda urged an eastward shift of NATO bases and criticized NATO for treating Poland like a \"buffer zone.\" The upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw will be used by Polish officials to push for a meaningful forward presence in the region. Under the Obama Administration's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) and the Readiness Action Plan announced at NATO's September 2014 summit in Wales, the United States and NATO have bolstered security in Central and Eastern Europe with increased funding for military presence, exercises, and pre-positioning of equipment. Funding for the ERI has increased significantly, allowing for a constant Army brigade presence in the region. Since the conflict in Ukraine, U.S. Armed Forces have increased consultations, joint training, and military exercises with Polish counterparts under Operation Atlantic Resolve. This initiative, launched in 2014, demonstrates U.S. commitment to defending NATO's eastern member states through continuous training and security cooperation activities with Poland and other countries in the region. Units from the U.S. Army and Air Force have been deployed to Poland for joint training and exercises since 2014. In 2014, the U.S. Air Force started rotating F-16s and C-130 aircraft for joint training exercises in Poland. U.S. Secretary of Defense announced pre-positioning of equipment in Baltic and Central European countries to support rotational forces. NATO reinforced the Multinational Corps Northeast in Poland for defense cooperation. NATO activated Force Integration Units in Central Europe and the Baltics, including one in Bydgoszcz, Poland, to support rapid deployment of high-readiness forces. U.S. foreign military sales agreements with Poland totaled over $4.7 billion from FY1996 to FY2013. Polish defense exports to the United States mainly consist of military electronics and aircraft components, totaling approximately $295 million in 2013. Poland received $9 million in Foreign Military Financing and nearly $2 million in International Military Training and Education from the United States in FY2015. In 2007, Poland and the Bush Administration began talks on hosting U.S. interceptor missiles. In 2008, an agreement was signed for the deployment of interceptors and enhanced security guarantees. In 2009, the Obama Administration replaced the missile defense program with the European Phased Adaptive Approach. In 2009, Poland agreed to host SM-3 missiles as part of the Obama Administration's EPAA program. An \"Aegis-Ashore\" site with radar and 24 SM-3s is set to be deployed in Poland in 2018. U.S. companies do business in Poland due to strong economic growth potential, a large domestic market, tariff-free access to the EU, and political stability. U.S. corporate assets in Poland were valued at $65 billion in 2013, with foreign direct investment totaling $13.5 billion and about 160,000 people employed by U.S. affiliates in Poland. Trade between the United States and Poland has significantly increased over the past decade. In 2004, U.S. exports to Poland were approximately $929 million and imports were $1.8 billion. By 2015, exports had risen to over $3.7 billion and imports to almost $5.6 billion. Leading export categories include aircraft, machinery, electrical equipment, and vehicles. Imports from Poland include heavy machinery, chemicals, and agricultural products. Many Polish officials and citizens are disappointed that Poland has not been made a Visa Waiver Program country by the United States. Poland has not been made a Visa Waiver Program (VWP) country by the United States due to its visitor visa refusal rate being above the 3% limit. Members of Congress have tried to change the law to allow Poland to qualify, citing its status as a close U.S. ally. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a Poland Visa Waiver Amendment to the FY2016 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, allowing the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate Poland a VWP country despite the refusal rate criteria. Senators introduced a Visa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act to authorize Poland's inclusion in the VWP. Some argue extending the VWP to Poland could lead to more illegal stays in the US. Proponents believe it would boost tourism, enhance public diplomacy, and strengthen national security by sharing information. Poland's historical distrust of Russia persists, with recent events in Ukraine heightening security concerns. Poland's historical distrust of Russia is influenced by past invasions and domination. Recent events like the Nord Stream gas pipeline agreement and hosting U.S. missile defense facilities have strained relations. Warsaw's support for the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative has also irked Moscow. The former Tusk government advocated for a strong response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, including sanctions and increased NATO presence in Central and Eastern Europe. Public opinion in Poland supported stronger economic sanctions against Russia, with 77% approval in a 2014 survey. Despite Prime Minister Kopacz's attempt to adopt a gentler approach towards Russia and Ukraine, analysts note that Poland's historical distrust of Russia influences its policy decisions. Poland's Russia policy under the Law and Justice government is expected to maintain a hard line stance. Trade between Poland and Russia was significant, with Polish exports being affected by Russian retaliatory sanctions. Moscow targeted Poland with import bans even before the EU implemented tougher sanctions in 2014. Poland's exports of fruit and vegetables to Russia valued at $1-2 billion annually. Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave with heavy military presence, poses security concerns for Poland. Russia supplies over half of Poland's natural gas and most of its oil. Poland relies on coal for 90% of electricity generation, reducing dependence on Russian gas. Poland relies on coal for 90% of its electricity generation, but Russian gas only accounts for less than 10% of its energy supply. The country aims to diversify its energy sources to reduce dependence on Russia and increase the use of cleaner fuels. Efforts include expanding pipeline interconnectivity with neighbors and developing the ability to import natural gas from the West in case of a crisis. The construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal on the Baltic Sea coast has faced delays. The Baltic Sea coast near the German border (Swinoujscie) faced delays but became operational in October 2015, receiving its first shipment from Qatar in December 2015. The facility is set to start commercial deliveries in May 2016 and reach full capacity by 2018. Poland is also planning to introduce nuclear power with the construction of its first nuclear plant, with the first unit possibly operational in 2025 and full completion by 2035. The Polish government advocates for a stronger EU energy policy to reduce dependence on Russia, proposing an EU \"energy union\" for gas purchases. Poland has been active in initiatives to link the natural gas grid of the Baltic countries to the rest of the EU, with a pipeline expected to become operational in 2020. There are concerns in the United States over Russian energy dominance impacting European energy security and transatlantic unity. The US has encouraged EU states to reduce energy dependence on Russia through diversification of supply and increase energy efficiency to maintain a united transatlantic position."
