    "content": "The Act titled \"Congressional Reform and Compliance Act of 1992\" applies laws related to part-time career employees, labor standards, and occupational safety and health to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Instrumentalities of the Congress. The Congressional Reform and Compliance Act of 1992 extends labor laws and occupational safety regulations to the Senate, House of Representatives, and Congress entities, ensuring fair employment practices and employee rights. Individuals can appeal violations through established procedures. Individuals can seek redress in a Federal district court under rules or regulations promulgated under section 5, with the same rights and remedies as private persons under relevant laws. SEC. 4 of the Act specifies the individuals covered, including Senators, Representatives, congressional employees, and employees of congressional instrumentalities. The Congress must establish rules and regulations within 120 days of the Act's enactment, consistent with Federal law. Failure to do so will result in the application of rules from the Secretary of Labor for the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate rules and regulations for the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act if the Congress fails to do so within 120 days. Additionally, the head of each Instrumentality of the Congress must establish rules and regulations consistent with Federal law within the same timeframe. If Congress fails to create rules for certain acts, the Secretary of Labor will establish regulations for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1939, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and sections 3401 through 3408 of title 5, United States Code, for Instrumentalities of Congress. The term \"Instrumentality of the Congress\" in this Act includes various government agencies such as the Congressional Research Service, the General Accounting Office, and the Library of Congress."
