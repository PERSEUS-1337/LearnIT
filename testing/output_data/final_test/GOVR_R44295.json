    "content": "The 114th and 115th Congresses debated federal funding bans for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliated health centers. Legislation proposed funding bans ranging from one year to permanent. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Vice President Michael R. Pence mentioned a funding ban in the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), which passed the House. The American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA) includes a one-year funding prohibition for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). The bill passed the House on May 4, 2017, and is currently under consideration in the Senate. The proposed funding moratorium would primarily affect federal funds that PPFA receives from Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has published cost estimates on the impact of defunding PPFA in AHCA. The ACA repeal bill in the 114th Congress proposed redirecting PPFA funds to FQHCs. H.R. 3762 and H.R. 3134 aimed to defund PPFA and allocate funds to other eligible entities for women's health care services. The AHCA would reallocate federal funds to FQHCs, with an additional $422 million appropriated for FY2017. The bill does not explicitly link this funding to the PPFA ban, but congressional leaders have made the connection in their discussions. The CBO estimates a $156 million reduction in direct spending over a 10-year period with a one-year ban on PPFA funding. FQHCs are among the health care facilities that could provide care to Medicaid beneficiaries. FQHCs are mandated by federal law to cover services for Medicaid beneficiaries and receive grants for family planning. Recent legislation has focused on FQHCs as an alternative to PPAHCs if Medicaid reimbursements were no longer available. Medicaid beneficiaries could choose to stay at PPAHCs and pay for services themselves or seek care at FQHCs with nonfederal funds. Access to health care for Medicaid beneficiaries can vary based on location and availability of providers. Factors such as the presence of FQHCs, PPAHCs, and other healthcare facilities, as well as transportation options, can impact where individuals receive services. In some areas, multiple facilities may offer the same services, while in others, there may be limited options. Patients may choose to pay for services themselves, use nonfederal funds, or seek care at different providers. Facilities may face challenges in expanding services due to the need for additional providers, medical equipment, and exam rooms. Patient access to care can be affected by these constraints. FQHCs offer primary care, dental, and behavioral health services to all ages, while PPAHCs focus on family planning and related services for reproductive-age individuals. FQHCs may struggle with provider vacancies, impacting their ability to care for current patients and accept new ones. The sudden influx of former PPAHC patients to FQHCs could strain their ability to absorb new patients. Patient awareness of provider alternatives is crucial for maintaining access to care, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries who have the choice of where to seek family planning services. PPAHCs are chosen by Medicaid beneficiaries because they are accessible and meet their needs. PPAHCs specialize in family planning services and may be preferred by patients over more generalized providers. The report focuses on services that can be provided with federal funding, with limited discussion on abortion services due to restrictions on federal funding. The report compares national-level data for PPAHCs and FQHCs, highlighting variations in healthcare services provided. FQHCs receive federal grants and report more data elements, while PPAHCs focus on family planning services and may report specific services based on grant conditions. Local variations in healthcare are obscured by national data. The report compares data between PPAHCs and FQHCs, noting differences in reporting requirements and limitations in comparisons due to varying reporting years. It also discusses CBO cost estimates for legislation considering a one-year ban on federal Medicaid funds for PPFA and PPAHCs in the 114th Congress, providing additional analysis on the impact of a PPFA ban on Medicaid beneficiaries for evaluating AHCA. The report discusses the effects of a PPFA ban on Medicaid beneficiaries and compares PPAHCs and FQHCs, highlighting differences in size, services offered, and organizational structure. PPFA facilities are more coordinated with each other, while FQHCs are generally independent with no central governing body. PPAHCs and FQHCs are different in terms of funding and location requirements. PPAHCs focus on family planning for individuals aged 15-44, while FQHCs provide comprehensive services throughout an individual's lifespan. Both may receive federal reimbursements and grants. PPFA is the umbrella organization supporting 59 independent affiliates that operate 661 health centers across the United States. The number of affiliates and facilities has declined since 2009-2010. PPFA provides discounted services to individuals who cannot afford to pay and helps patients enroll in federal and state programs. FQHCs, which focus on primary care, receive federal grants under Section 330 of the PHSA. These grants, administered by HRSA, support operations and can be used to expand services or construct facilities. FQHCs are independently operated and some have multiple sites. As of March 6, 2017, there were 10,560 FQHC delivery sites. The number of FQHC delivery sites has increased by 32% since 2009, with some FQHCs operating multiple sites. The Affordable Care Act created a Community Health Center Fund to support FQHCs in providing care to those who gained insurance coverage. FQHCs have longer wait times for new appointments for Medicaid patients compared to other facilities. Community health centers are the most common type of FQHC, serving an underserved population, while Section 330 grants support other FQHC types like health centers for the homeless, residents of public housing, and migrant health centers. FQHCs, including community health centers, receive Section 330 grants to provide services to the entire population of their designated area, regardless of ability to pay. They establish discounted fee schedules based on income and family size, and coordinate with state Medicaid programs. FQHCs are designated as such for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement purposes. No PPAHCs currently receive Section 330 grants. FQHCs receive higher reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid services due to their designation, which includes providing additional supportive services not typically covered by insurance. This designation aims to prevent Section 330 grant funds from subsidizing Medicare and Medicaid patients at FQHCs. PPFA, a not-for-profit organization, receives federal and nonfederal funds for operations, including grants, donations, patient fees, and reimbursements for government health care program services. PPFA receives federal funds for operations, including government reimbursements from programs like Medicaid. In 2014-2015, PPFA reported total revenue of $1.29 billion, with the largest source being government reimbursements and grants. Federal funds are generally not used for abortions, except in specific cases. PPFA receives significant government revenue from Medicaid reimbursements, with GAO reporting $400.56 million in 2012 and CBO estimating $390 million in 2015. Federal grant support, particularly from the Family Planning Program under Title X, also contributes to PPFA's funding. In August 2016, 15 PPFA affiliates were Title X grantees, with over 350 PPAHCs included in the database of Title X sites. PPAHCs served 37% of Title X clients in 2010. In FY2012, PPFA affiliates used funds from various HHS programs and other federal agencies. In FY2012, PPFA affiliates received funding from various federal programs. It is unclear if these programs are still providing funds to PPFA affiliates, as some programs may have ended or PPFA affiliates may not have successfully competed for funds. Additionally, states may choose not to contract with PPFA for certain services. Data on current funding status is not available. FQHCs receive federal and nonfederal funds, with Medicaid reimbursements being the largest revenue source in FY2016 at 42.2%. They also receive grants from other government programs, such as Title X. In August 2016, one FQHC was identified among the current Title X grantees. FQHCs also receive Title X funding through state agencies. Research from 2010 showed that FQHCs run 38% of Title X clinics and serve 16% of Title X clients. Changes in the number of FQHCs receiving funds from state grantees may have occurred since then, but data is not available to confirm. Additionally, FQHCs received federal grants from various government programs in FY2012, as reported by GAO. FQHCs receive grants from various HHS agencies in addition to HRSA grants. FQHCs focus on general primary care while PPAHCs focus on family planning services. Despite there being more FQHCs, PPAHCs provide more contraceptive services. In 2014-2015, PPAHCs provided 2.9 million contraceptive services compared to FQHCs' 1.3 million in 2015. FQHCs provide fewer contraceptive services compared to PPAHCs. In 2010, the average FQHC saw 330 contraceptive clients per year, while the average PPAHC saw 2,950. Data comparison is limited due to different service definitions between the two types of facilities. FQHCs underreport services provided as they only require reporting selected services based on diagnoses in patient records. PPAHCs provide a wide range of contraceptive services, with 99% offering at least 10 reversible contraceptive methods on site. They also stock common contraceptive methods and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like IUDs, which are highly effective. Researchers recommend LARCs for women who do not want to become pregnant within two years. PPAHCs are highly effective in providing LARCs and same-day insertion, with 96%-98% stocking LARCs. In contrast, 75% of public-funded clinics offering family planning services could provide requested LARC methods on-site. PPFA data on services provided lack consistency over time and do not specify contraceptive methods, making it challenging to track changes. Comparing services from 2009-2010 to 2014-2015, PPFA reported a decrease in services provided. In 2014-2015, PPFA provided an estimated 11.0 million services, an increase from 9.4 million in the previous period. Services related to testing or treating STIs/STDs increased, while the percentage of cancer screenings declined. Contraceptive services remained relatively stable. In 2014-2015, PPFA provided 11.0 million services, with an increase from the previous period. Abortion services comprised 3% of PPFA services in both years, totaling 323,999 abortions in 2014-2015 and 329,445 abortions in 2009-2010. Federal funds for abortions are limited to cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of a mother's life. FQHCs must provide primary, preventive, and emergency health services as a condition of receiving a HRSA grant. FQHCs are required to provide primary, preventive, and emergency health services, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning, health education, preventive dental care, and diabetes self-management training. Additionally, they must have arrangements for emergent cases and after-hours care. FQHCs report selected primary and preventive care services to HRSA for evaluation. Data on total services provided is limited, but the number of reported services has increased over time, reaching 20.6 million medical services in 2015. This increase was due to ACA funding expansion. Some reported services are similar to those at PPAHCs, including reproductive health services like STD/STI treatment, contraception, and cancer screening. Family planning services, including STD/STI treatment, contraception, and cancer screening, account for one-third of medical services provided at FQHCs. Facilities receiving Title X grants must adhere to confidentiality policies. Research indicates that not all FQHCs offer comprehensive family planning services, especially smaller ones, with variation in the availability of specific contraceptive methods. For example, 36% of FQHCs offer on-site contraceptive implants. In 2015, more than two-thirds of FQHCs provided access to at least 10 reversible contraceptive methods compared to 99% of PPAHCs. FQHCs offer more limited contraception services, particularly in terms of available methods. Researchers have found that counseling patients on contraceptive options at FQHCs and PPAHCs can reduce rates of unintended pregnancy, births, and abortions. PPAHCs are more likely to provide LARC on-site and offer same-day insertions compared to FQHCs. In 2015, 98% of PPAHCs offered any LARC method compared to 69% of FQHCs. In 2015, 98% of PPAHCs offered any LARC method compared to 69% of FQHCs. The overall percentage of clinics stocking any LARC had increased from 66% in 2010 to 75% in 2015. Medicaid patients may face differences in access to LARCs between PPAHCs and FQHCs due to policy guidance from CMS. FQHCs provide more radiological services, including mammograms, than PPAHCs. FQHCs provide more radiological services, such as mammograms, compared to PPAHCs. PPAHCs may not offer mammography due to cost and feasibility issues. Some PPAHCs provide abortion services, which FQHCs generally do not offer. Abortion services at FQHCs would require approval from the governing board and cannot be supported by the health center's grant. PPAHCs provide a range of services but must be financially self-sustaining. They serve a diverse population, with a majority of patients having limited income. In 2013, PPAHCs saw 2.7 million patients, with 78% having incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. Approximately 60% were enrolled in Medicaid or accessed services through the Title X Family Planning Program. PPAHCs have increased services for men, primarily for STI/STD related services. The number of men served for STI/STD services has increased in recent years at PPFA facilities. FQHCs have seen a growth in patients from 18.9 million in 2009 to 24.3 million in 2015, with a majority being low-income and enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. Over half of FQHC patients are nonwhite. FQHCs serve a diverse population, with over half being nonwhite and approximately one-third being children. Unlike PPAHCs, FQHCs have location requirements and are required to be located in medically underserved areas. There is some overlap in the locations of PPAHCs and FQHCs. In 2016, 352 counties had both a PPAHC and an FQHC. Approximately 61.6% of U.S. counties have an FQHC, while only 8.7% have a PPAHC. Half of U.S. counties have an FQHC but not a PPAHC, and one-third have neither facility type. FQHCs must be located in shortage areas or serve a shortage population, which may explain why some counties do not have an FQHC. Figures 1 and 2 show the location of PPAHCs and FQHCs separately, while Figure 3 shows both facilities together. The maps of PPAHCs and FQHCs do not provide a comprehensive view of the local health care system as they exclude hospitals, inpatient facilities, physician offices, and other federally supported health services. PPAHCs are more common in the Northeast and West Coast, while FQHCs are widely distributed throughout the United States. Some counties have both types of facilities, while others have only one or neither. The map shows that PPAHCs are less numerous than FQHCs and are located in specific areas. Some areas have both types of facilities, while others have only one or neither. Patients in areas with only PPAHCs may be more affected by a reduction in services. The maps do not show other healthcare facilities that could absorb additional patients. The potential effects of imposing a ban on federal funding to PPFA are uncertain. A series of cost estimates by the CBO examined the effects of a short- or long-term prohibition on federal funds to PPFA. CBO focused on costs to the federal government and access to care, primarily on Medicaid. The estimates were uncertain and did not evaluate the effects on PPFA's operations. CBO estimated that a funding prohibition on PPFA would reduce federal spending by $178 million in FY2017 and $234 million over 2017-2026. This would lead to additional Medicaid spending due to several thousand additional births, resulting in a net savings of $156 million. CBO estimated that a PPFA funding prohibition would save $156 million, but 15% of Medicaid users at PPAHCs may lose access to care. Medicaid patients may seek services at other facilities, potentially increasing Medicaid costs if redirected to FQHCs. CBO estimated that between 5% and 25% of Medicaid users at PPFA may be unable to access care in the first year of a funding prohibition. Alternate providers may not be available in some areas, leading to potential access issues for patients. CBO estimated that a 1-year ban on federal funds to PPFA could result in immediate declines in Medicaid services use, leading to cost savings of $235 million over 10 years. Uncertainty exists due to potential forgone contraceptive services at PPFA, which could result in additional births and increased federal spending of $20 million in the first year and $60 million over 10 years. The CBO estimates that a one-year ban on federal funds to PPFA would save $235 million over 10 years, net of increased costs. The AHCA estimate predicts an increase in Medicaid births by several thousand, with Medicaid covering 45% of all births. A permanent ban to PPFA would increase spending by $130 million over 10 years due to declines in access to care, primarily family planning. The CBO estimates that a permanent ban on federal funds to PPFA would lead to an increase in Medicaid births by several thousand per year. However, redirecting funds to FQHCs may not fully mitigate the predicted loss of access to care, as HHS may not be able to award funds in time to prevent disruptions. Additionally, the reallocated funds may not be specific enough to prevent access disruptions, as they can be used generally for primary care or preventive services, rather than specifically for family planning or women's health services. In 2013, Texas excluded PPFA from its family planning program, leading to a decrease in LARC claims and Medicaid spending for childbirth services. The number of LARC claims decreased by 35.5% and Medicaid spending for childbirth services increased by 27.1%. Differences in follow-up shots for injectable contraception were found in counties with and without a PPAHC. The U.S. maternal mortality rate increased from 2000 to 2014, with underreporting of maternal deaths noted. California's rate decreased while Texas' rate remained stable. The authors compared maternal mortality rates in California and Texas, noting a decrease in California but a sudden increase in Texas between 2011 and 2012. The increase in Texas was not due to reporting changes and could be related to the Texas Women's Health Program. Data are insufficient to determine causality definitively. Health Services and the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force dispute the NCHS author's attribution of the mortality increase to the Texas Women's Health Program policy changes. They argue that the data used to determine pregnancy status at the time of death is unreliable, leading to varying results in the observed increase. In Wisconsin, PPAHCs were excluded from receiving funding, impacting cancer screening tests performed at these providers. Researchers found that funding loss and lab restrictions led to clinic closures in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Low-income women were less likely to receive preventive screenings like mammograms as distance to a provider increased. Declines in mammograms were more common among less educated women. Texas had stronger results due to fewer nearby providers after program changes. Some states have considered terminating PPFA and PPAHC participation in Medicaid programs, but no data exists on potential effects yet. States have considered restricting PPFA from participating in family planning programs funded by Title X. A regulation in 2016 prevented states from excluding providers for reasons unrelated to their ability to provide Title X services. In 2017, a bill was passed to nullify this regulation, signed into law on April 13, 2017. No data exists to evaluate the potential effects, but the report may be updated if changes occur."
