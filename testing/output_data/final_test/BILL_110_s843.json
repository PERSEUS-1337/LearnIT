Congress finds that mercury is a potent neurotoxin with significant ecological and public health concerns, primarily affecting those who consume contaminated fish, especially children and women of childbearing age. Approximately 630,000 children born in the US each year are exposed to elevated methyl mercury, risking impaired neurological development. Additionally, 8% of women of childbearing age have unsafe blood mercury levels, and as of 2004, 44 states have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. Mercury contamination has led to advisories in 44 states, covering 52,000 square kilometers of lakes and 1,230,000 kilometers of rivers. Fish consumption advisories highlight the health risks posed by mercury pollution, with uncertainties in its environmental interaction and bioaccumulation. Models show varying effectiveness in reducing mercury concentrations in fish, but broad-scale data sets are lacking for validation. In September 2003, a workshop of 32 mercury scientists was convened to develop a system to measure changes from reductions in mercury emissions. An article in Environmental Science and Technology proposed a long-term mercury monitoring program. Despite regulations limiting mercury emissions, scientists are not adequately measuring the environmental benefits. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized the Clean Air Mercury Rule in 2005 without peer-reviewed results. Governments should ensure regulations achieve desired results. In 2006, the EPA's Inspector General reported on the need for monitoring the impact of the Clean Air Mercury Rule. On January 9, 2007, a paper in the journal \"BioScience\" identified biological mercury hotspots in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada, emphasizing the need for an improved monitoring network to detect health risks. EPA was urged to develop a mercury monitoring plan to assess the impact of regulations on mercury deposition and refine estimation tools. On January 9, 2007, Charles Driscoll and other concerned individuals published a paper in the journal \"BioScience\" linking mercury contamination in forest and freshwater ecosystems in the northeastern United States. The journal \"BioScience\" published papers emphasizing the importance of mercury measurements and the need for a nationwide monitoring program to address mercury emissions from various sources in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like Administrator (referring to the head of the EPA), Advisory Committee (related to the Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee), Ecoregion (describing a distinct natural area), Mercury export (referring to mercury flow between water bodies), and Mercury flux (indicating the rate of mercury transfer in ecosystems). The term \"surface sediment\" refers to sediment in the uppermost 2 centimeters of a lakebed or riverbed. SEC. 4. MONITORING PROGRAM. The Administrator, in consultation with various agencies, shall establish a national-scale mercury monitoring program with multiple monitoring sites in ecoregions of the United States to monitor long-term changes in mercury levels in the air and watersheds. The national-scale mercury monitoring program includes measuring wet and dry mercury deposition, mercury flux, mercury export, and reemitted mercury levels from aquatic and terrestrial environments. It also involves monitoring mercury levels in water and soil chemistry, including sediment core analysis and measuring total mercury and methyl mercury concentrations in the water column. The national-scale mercury monitoring program includes measuring mercury levels in water and soil chemistry, sediment core analysis, and monitoring mercury levels in plants and animals, including methyl mercury levels in yearling fish and other relevant scientific data for assessing fish population health. The national-scale mercury monitoring program includes measuring mercury levels in water, soil, plants, and animals, including fish population health assessment and mercury levels in phytoplankton, algae, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates. The advisory committee is established. The Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee is established to advise the Administrator on the national mercury monitoring program. It consists of at least 13 non-government scientists appointed by various agency directors. The Mercury Monitoring Advisory Committee consists of 2 scientists appointed by the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Administrator is required to submit biennial reports to Congress on the program under the Act, including an assessment of mercury deposition rates. Data obtained must be made available to the public. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the Act. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 include funding for various agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Geological Survey, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For fiscal year 2010, funding allocations include $6,500,000 to the Environmental Protection Agency, $3,250,000 to the United States Geological Survey, $3,250,000 to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and $1,000,000 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 will be provided to these same agencies."
