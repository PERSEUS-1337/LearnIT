It also mandates investigations into plutonium contamination, studies on the health effects of depleted uranium, and environmental cleanup requirements. Congress finds that the health and safety of military personnel should be a top priority. Depleted uranium munitions are pyrophoric and create inhalable aerosol particles upon impact. These munitions were used in the Persian Gulf War and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, totaling over 300 metric tons in the Gulf War and additional amounts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro. Depleted uranium munitions have been used in conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the Persian Gulf War, with claims of health effects by the Yugoslav and Iraqi Governments. The cause of illnesses among US servicemembers known as \"Gulf War Syndrome\" remains undetermined. Depleted uranium munitions have been used in conflicts in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War. The British Royal Navy, Canadian Navy, and United States Navy are phasing out the use of depleted uranium munitions. Over 20 nations have been reported to use depleted uranium munitions. Federal Aviation Administration crash investigators are instructed to handle depleted uranium with caution due to its harmful effects if it enters the body. The 1949 Geneva Convention and 1977 Protocol prohibit causing unnecessary harm to civilians with depleted uranium munitions, which can be chemically toxic and irradiate internal tissues. The Department of Defense has confirmed contamination of depleted uranium munitions with plutonium, a highly toxic and radioactive material with a long half-life. The purposes of the 1949 Geneva Convention and 1977 Protocol are to prohibit causing unnecessary harm to civilians with depleted uranium munitions, which can be chemically toxic and irradiate internal tissues. The Department of Defense has confirmed contamination of depleted uranium munitions with plutonium, a highly toxic and radioactive material with a long half-life. The Act aims to eliminate health threats from depleted uranium munitions for military personnel, civilian employees, and populations in affected regions. It also includes provisions for studying contamination levels, health effects, and exposure to depleted uranium munitions. The Act aims to address health threats from depleted uranium munitions by regulating cleanup and mitigation of contamination at sites of use and production in the United States. The Act aims to regulate cleanup and mitigation of contamination at sites of use and production in the United States, including the suspension of depleted uranium munitions. The Act mandates the suspension of depleted uranium munitions' use by the Department of Defense until a certification is provided that ensures no long-term health threats to military personnel or civilians in conflict areas. The Act mandates the suspension of depleted uranium munitions' use by the Department of Defense until a certification is provided that ensures no long-term health threats to military personnel or civilians in conflict areas. The future use of depleted uranium munitions is limited to stocks free of transuranic matter as certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Act mandates the suspension of sale and export of depleted uranium munitions. Upon enactment of this Act, all government entities responsible for approving foreign sales of munitions must suspend approval for depleted uranium-containing munitions. This suspension will last until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that future exports will only come from stocks free of transuranic matter. The Secretary of Defense must certify that depleted uranium is free of plutonium and transuranic matter. SEC. 6. COMPTROLLER GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF PLUTONIUM CONTAMINATION. The Comptroller General of the United States will investigate the contamination of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements, including plutonium, neptunium, and americium. This investigation will determine when and where the contamination occurred, the quantity of material involved, and identify those responsible for monitoring production quality. The Comptroller General will investigate contamination of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements, including plutonium, neptunium, and americium. The investigation will focus on the quality of production, notification timing to NATO nations, and any potential violations of laws or treaties. Upon completion, a report will be submitted to the specified committee. The Comptroller General will study the health effects of depleted uranium. The Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study on the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on uranium-exposed veterans and their children. Uranium-exposed veterans are defined as members of the Armed Forces who handled depleted uranium munitions or were exposed to environments containing depleted uranium. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will conduct a public health assessment of individuals with an epidemiological link to US military installations where depleted uranium munitions have been used. This includes those who were exposed to depleted uranium dust, were near depleted uranium fires, or provided medical treatment to affected Armed Forces members. The Directors will submit a report to Congress on the results of the study regarding populations exposed to depleted uranium munitions, including a list of diseases and their occurrence rates compared to the general population. EPA will conduct studies on environmental contamination by depleted uranium. The Secretary of Defense will provide a list of locations in the United States where depleted uranium munitions have been used or produced to the EPA. The EPA will then conduct environmental studies on each site to assess contamination of soil, air, water, and vegetation by depleted uranium. A report on the findings will be submitted to the Secretary of Defense and relevant congressional committees within two years. The House of Representatives and Senate committees will receive a report on the extent of depleted uranium contamination at studied sites, along with site-specific cleanup recommendations and general suggestions for foreign land cleanup. SEC. 9. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of Defense must develop a cleanup plan for each site within a year of receiving a report, submit it to relevant committees, and start mitigation and cleanup efforts as per the plan. Annual reports must be submitted until projects are completed. The cleanup and mitigation required by the Secretary of Defense must be carried out in a manner consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as recommended by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency."
