The Third Validating Act of 2016, also known as Section 1, defines \"public body\" to include various state departments, agencies, and entities such as air pollution control districts and airport districts. Various districts and authorities in California are included in the definition of \"public body,\" such as bridge and highway districts, water districts, pest control districts, city maintenance districts, community college districts, community development commissions, community facilities districts, conservancy districts, county boards of education, county drainage districts, county flood control and water districts, county library systems, county sanitation districts, county transportation commissions, and county water agencies. Various districts and authorities in California, such as county water authorities, fire protection districts, and housing authorities, are considered part of the \"public body\" definition. Various types of districts and authorities in California are considered part of the \"public body\" definition, including integrated financing districts, irrigation districts, joint highway districts, library districts, local agency formation commissions, and more. Various types of districts and authorities in California are considered part of the \"public body\" definition, including property and business improvement areas, protection districts, public utility districts, rapid transit districts, reclamation districts, recreation and park districts, regional justice facility financing agencies, regional park and open-space districts, regional planning districts, resort improvement districts, resource conservation districts, river port districts, road maintenance districts, sanitary districts, school districts, sewer districts, small craft harbor districts, special municipal tax districts, pest control districts, storm drain maintenance districts, storm water districts, toll tunnel authorities, traffic authorities, and transit development boards. Various types of districts and authorities in California, such as storm water districts, toll tunnel authorities, traffic authorities, transit development boards, and water agencies, are considered part of the \"public body\" definition. However, certain entities like community redevelopment agencies and community development commissions are excluded from this definition. The definition of \"public body\" includes specific entities like the successor agency to the Redevelopment Agency of the City and County of San Francisco and successor agencies for issuing bonds or incurring indebtedness. The definition of \"Bonds\" includes all instruments evidencing indebtedness of a public body for public purposes, leases, installment purchase agreements, borrowing money in anticipation of taxes, and certificates of participation. \"Hereafter\" refers to any time after the effective date of the act, \"Heretofore\" refers to any time before the effective date, and \"Now\" refers to the effective date of the act. SEC. 3. All public bodies previously organized under any law are legally recognized and functioning. They have the same rights, powers, and duties as public bodies formed according to the law. SEC. 4. The boundaries of public bodies as previously established are confirmed and legally recognized. SEC. 5. SEC. 5 confirms and validates all past actions taken by public bodies regarding annexation, inclusion, detachment, consolidation, merger, or dissolution of territories. All past actions taken by public bodies for the authorization, issuance, sale, execution, delivery, or exchange of bonds for public purposes are authorized, confirmed, validated, and declared legally effective. All bonds issued by public bodies in the past are legally binding obligations, whether awarded, sold, or authorized through various actions. The authorization for issuing bonds by a public body makes them legal, valid, and binding obligations. Bonds previously approved by voters and issued in accordance with the authorization are also considered legally binding obligations. SEC. 7 of the act validates past acts and proceedings within constitutional limits, excluding those currently under legal dispute. SEC. 8 of the act does not authorize or validate any act, proceeding, or contract that has been previously determined to be illegal or void. Any challenge to the validity of actions taken under laws for the formation, organization, or changes to public bodies must be filed within six months of this act's effective date. Otherwise, such actions will be considered valid and legally binding. This act does not extend the time limit for legal action beyond what is already barred by statutes of limitations or laches. The legal action period can be extended beyond the statute of limitations. SEC. 9 states that any changes in public bodies must be filed in accordance with specific government code sections for assessment and taxation purposes."
