    "content": "Congress is currently debating climate legislation that could impact the U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors. The House passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, in June 2009. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works completed markup of S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, in November 2009. Both bills aim to establish cap-and-trade systems to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and address energy efficiency and renewable energy. Covered sectors include electricity production, natural gas distribution, petroleum refining, and specific industrial sectors. These bills are currently being debated in Congress. The economic effects of potential climate legislation currently being considered by Congress are being studied, including impacts on specific sectors like U.S. agriculture and forestry. Studies also look at market and industry effects, such as land use conversions and changes in crop production. Potential economy-wide effects, like retail food prices and supplies, are also examined. Limitations and uncertainties in these studies are discussed. The report discusses limitations and uncertainties associated with economic models and their results, focusing on concerns regarding lands converted from agriculture to forestry and potential unequal opportunities and costs of carbon markets in the agricultural community. The House and Senate climate proposals may raise farm costs for energy and fertilizers but also provide opportunities for additional farm income. Various governmental agencies have estimated these potential effects. The USDA, EPA, universities, and farm industry groups are studying the impact of higher costs on farmers, which could be offset by revenue increases from carbon offset programs and tradable allowances. The renewable energy provisions in the bills could also benefit farmers by expanding the market for biofuels and other renewable energy sources. Incentives for international forestry activities are also included in the bills. The EPA and USDA conducted studies on the economic effects of environmental legislation on U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors. The core modeling work for these analyses relied on longstanding economic and market models. The EPA and USDA conducted comprehensive analyses on the economic effects of energy and climate legislation on the U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors. The studies utilized the Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) to assess potential costs. Other groups, including universities and industry organizations, also contributed to the analysis. Many studies from universities, NGOs, industry groups, and advocacy groups have focused on the economic effects of climate legislation on agriculture and forestry sectors. The EPA and USDA studies suggest that the overall economic costs to farmers would be modest, with potential net economic gains for the U.S. agricultural sectors through participation in carbon offset programs. The USDA and EPA analyzed the economic impacts of climate legislation on agriculture, predicting potential gains for farmers through carbon offset programs. They considered the possibility of higher production costs being offset by tradable allowances for energy-intensive industries. The studies also projected resource shifts in agricultural markets, including land use conversions and crop production changes. Controversy arose over the conversion of cropland to forestland under a carbon offset program. Most studies agreed that energy costs would increase under a GHG cap-and-trade system. Several studies suggest that energy costs would rise under a GHG cap-and-trade system, with varying estimates. Despite higher energy and farm-level input costs, the U.S. farming sector is expected to see net benefits from the system, including higher commodity prices and new revenue sources like bioenergy demand and carbon offsets. New markets for carbon offsets and bioenergy crops would compete for land, raising farmland values. Producers shifting land to biofuels or carbon offset markets could raise crop prices, presenting additional production opportunities for farmers. Concerns exist about implications for crop production, food prices, and trade, prompting USDA to re-examine modeling assumptions. Some worry that benefits from a carbon offset program may not be evenly distributed among farmers. The report discusses how benefits from a carbon offset program may disproportionately favor larger farming operations or certain regions. Economic models struggle to predict the future impacts of cap-and-trade legislation allowing substantial use of offsets. The availability of domestic offsets in a cap-and-trade system is uncertain due to various factors. Estimates are raw data inputs for models estimating offset use in a cap-and-trade program, with considerable uncertainty. Design choices for the system, such as coverage, types of projects allowed, and limits on offset use, are crucial. International offsets and technological developments in low-carbon technologies will also impact domestic offset development. The use of offset projects in a cap-and-trade program is influenced by various factors. The market price of carbon emissions reductions determines the competitiveness of different offset projects. Uncertainty in future carbon prices and non-market factors like social acceptance also play a role. Information dissemination and the availability of offset opportunities, especially in smaller operations like family farms, are important considerations. Offsets are crucial in cap-and-trade programs, impacting program costs significantly. Prohibiting international offset projects could raise carbon prices by 65% to 180%, while banning all offset projects could result in a 250% price increase. Uncertainty in offsets also affects estimates of benefits for agriculture and forestry sectors. The availability and type of offsets influence landowners' ability to recover financial losses. Simulation models are essential for assessing policy effects, but differences in approaches and data lead to varied economic results. Uncertainty in economic modeling is influenced by limitations in simulation models, future carbon regulations, and non-economic factors. It is important to note that simulation models have limitations in accurately reflecting real-world interactions and predicting future conditions. Simulation models are theoretical constructs designed to represent complex systems, relying on available data and simplifying assumptions. They illustrate spatial and temporal dynamics, interrelationships, and processes, but often rely on simplistic assumptions due to factors like resource limitations and uncertainty. Simulation models often rely on simplistic assumptions, making it difficult to compare results across studies due to differences in approach, methodology, and underlying assumptions. Congress is still debating the design of a cap-and-trade program, which will significantly impact the availability and cost of offsets. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of a carbon offset program by regulatory agencies, particularly in the agricultural and forestry sectors, could impact offset availability and cost. Complex regulatory requirements would need to address various issues such as additionality, permanence, and leakage. Design and implementation elements could affect offset supply in multiple ways. The design and implementation elements of a carbon offset program could impact offset supply in various ways, including competition for resources and regulatory uncertainties. Simulation models have limitations due to simplifying assumptions about economic agents and market conditions. Some economists argue that economic decision-making is not always based solely on profit maximization, citing social, psychological, and emotional factors. Non-economic reasons like lifestyle choice and pride also influence why farmers continue operating despite financial challenges. Standard economic models may not capture these nuances in the U.S. farming sector, limiting their ability to understand behaviors and decisions. Aspects of U.S. agricultural production may hinder participation in a carbon offset program due to concerns about risks, existing government payments, inequities among producers, and market conditions. Questions arise about the accuracy of economic models in characterizing the farming sector. The USDA and EPA predict a shift to tree plantings for carbon offsets, but many in the agricultural community fear this could lead to millions of acres being taken out of production, impacting farmers and employees. Some fear that a regulatory program for carbon offsets could lead to U.S. cropland being converted to woodlands, impacting farmers and raising food prices. However, uncertainty remains about the potential outcomes of such a program, especially with the passage of climate legislation in Congress. The EPA and USDA economic analyses project that U.S. agricultural land could be converted to forest production under future carbon offset programs, especially at higher market prices for carbon. The FASOM model predicts that 60 to 65 million agricultural acres, including 35 to 50 million acres of cropland, could be converted to woodlands by 2050. This could result in a drop of more than 11% in cropland acres. The potential conversion of U.S. agricultural land to forest production under future carbon offset programs could lead to a drop of more than 11% in cropland acres by 2050. Concerns have been raised about the implications for crop production, food prices, and international trade, with speculation that such conversions could reduce crop production and raise food prices. The assumed carbon price greatly influences land conversion predictions. A $15 per MT CO2-Eq. price leads to steady conversion, while a 5% annual increase triples conversion by 2050. EPA and USDA used different price paths for their estimates. EPA's price starts at $15 and reaches $106 by 2050, while USDA assumes a $13 price. The USDA's price path assumes a gradual increase from $13 to $70 per MT CO2-Eq. by 2050. These prices do not consider discounts or potential errors, highlighting the impact of carbon price assumptions on modeling results in the agricultural and forestry offset market. Studies suggest that offsets generated at prices below $10 per MT CO2-Eq. would mainly come from changes in agricultural practices rather than afforestation, considering the opportunity costs of land used for crop production. Given the opportunity costs of land used in crop production, conversion of pasture land and cropland to forestland is mostly viable at higher price levels in the GHG cap-and-trade market. EPA's economic model projects U.S. farmers responding to favorable market conditions and participating in offset opportunities for additional profits. Participation in the carbon offset market would be a response to alternative financial ventures available to farmers, where the return on investment for afforestation and other offset activities surpasses that for conventional crop mixes. The economic model projects higher afforestation and land-use changes in response to favorable market conditions in the GHG cap-and-trade market. However, farmers may not always act purely based on economic incentives due to non-economic factors influencing their behavior, such as social and cultural considerations. In an emerging carbon offset market, landowners may be motivated by social factors like transferring the farm to their children. Forests face additional risks like wildfires compared to crop production, but are less susceptible to short-term failures. Some landowners may continue current operations due to uncertainties in future carbon markets and the time commitment involved. The establishment of a carbon offset program involves uncertainties and potential resistance from landowners due to regulatory concerns and the learning curve of transitioning from cropland to forestland. Resistance from landowners may arise due to changes in land use for forestry, requiring technical assistance and education. Studies show communal pressures against conversion from agriculture to urban areas, impacting traditional agricultural activities. However, multiple landowners converting to forestry could create a support network and expand afforestation, benefiting farmers through information sharing and business relations. The new carbon market could benefit farmers through afforestation and environmental services like clean water and wildlife habitat. However, participating in the carbon market would come with costs such as transaction costs for offset projects and potential revenue loss from agriculture programs. The current economic analyses do not fully consider these costs, which could be problematic. The new carbon market could benefit farmers through afforestation and environmental services, but there are costs involved such as transaction costs for offset projects. The FASOM model does not include transaction costs associated with the regulatory regime for offset development, leading to uncertainty and information limitations for participants. Other studies highlight transaction costs as key factors in driving results. The FASOM model does not adjust for government support programs and subsidy payments to farmers due to complexity and data limitations. Farm support payments can significantly contribute to annual farm income and impact business decision-making. U.S. farm programs are governed by laws periodically reviewed by Congress, with farm payments averaging about $15 billion per year since the 2002 farm bill. About 40% of farms receive government payments, with an average of nearly $9,800 in 2007 for those farms receiving payments. In 2007, farm payments averaged nearly $9,800 for farms receiving government payments, accounting for 5% of gross cash income and 22% of net cash income. The exclusion of farm support payments in economic decision-making may not accurately reflect farming operations. The impact of participating in a carbon offset program on farm commodity support programs is unclear. The FASOM model's limited ability to consider site-specific baseline conditions poses a challenge due to biological variability across regions. The FASOM model's approach to forestry offsets through afforestation of softwood plantations in agricultural regions is limited in capturing the full scope of biologic diversity and differences across the United States. Carbon storage in U.S. forests varies significantly by tree species and region, with some ecosystems storing double or triple the amount of carbon compared to others. Studies have shown a wide range of carbon sequestration possibilities in afforestation and reforestation projects, with carbon storage varying significantly by ecosystem type. The EPA estimated 2.2 to 9.5 MT CO2-Eq. per acre per year sequestered in afforestation and 1.1 to 7.7 MT CO2-Eq. per acre per year in reforestation. The USDA study estimated 2.7 to 7.7 MT CO2-Eq. per acre per year in afforestation. The FASOM model assumes a linear rate of carbon sequestration from tree planting in each region. The FASOM model assumes a linear rate of carbon sequestration from tree planting in each region, but the conversion of land for afforestation may not be evenly distributed geographically or temporally within each region. USDA's regional analysis projects that the majority of offset supply will come from afforestation of croplands and pasturelands. The USDA projects that most offset supply from afforestation will occur in the Corn Belt and Lake States regions. It is uncertain if there is the capacity to afforest 1-1.5 million acres annually. Federal programs like FIP and SIP have assisted in establishing forests on private lands. Historical data shows varying levels of tree planting, with a peak in 1988. The peak in tree planting was in 1988, with nearly 3.4 million acres planted, partly due to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). High prices for forest carbon offsets could be a greater incentive for planting trees. Legal and social constraints on land tenure could impact land conversion for tree planting. USDA researchers foresee challenges in future land leasing and retirement agreements under a carbon offset program. The mix of farmland ownership and leasing in the United States may hinder efforts to shift land uses for carbon emission reduction programs. Extended contract periods could be a barrier to farmer participation in carbon offset programs, especially for those who rent land. The House-passed bill (H.R. 2454) outlines contract periods for carbon offset projects, limiting them to 5-10 years for agricultural projects and 20 years for forestry projects. Some environmental groups advocate for longer crediting periods due to concerns about permanence and credibility. A USDA report suggests that land-owning farmers may have an advantage in generating offsets compared to those who rent land, as renters may be less inclined to make long-term conservation investments. Farmers who rent land may face challenges in participating in the carbon offset market due to the lack of long-term land leases and complex lease agreements. Concerns about land tenure issues are raised among farm groups, with USDA identifying three groups related to farm tenure: full owners, part owners, and tenants. USDA data from 1997 shows that renting land is common in the U.S. farming sector. The 1997 data on land ownership in the United States farming sector shows that less than 30% of farmed acres are owned by operators. Carbon offset markets could change incentives for landowners to lease their lands, potentially leading to higher land values and competition for land. This could affect farmers' income and lead to land being taken out of production for afforestation. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a voluntary land retirement program that aims to encourage landowners to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland. Landowners enroll in contracts for 10-15 years, receiving annual rental payments and cost-share assistance for approved conservation practices. The program, established in 1985, initially allowed for the removal of over 10% of the nation's cropland. Current CRP enrollment is at 31 million acres, about half of projected land conversion estimates for 2050. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) aims to reduce crop acreage while maintaining high yields. Lands retired under CRP are typically marginal or idle, not productive cropland. Afforestation programs target less productive and idled lands first. The decision to take lands out of production for afforestation depends on the opportunity cost of the land. Productive lands will likely remain in crop production unless offset prices increase significantly. EPA and USDA models reflect this trend. Higher offset prices could make the tradeoffs between returns and profits in the markets more competitive, potentially favoring afforestation over crop growth. CRP rules mandate landowners to offer their rented land to farmers for CRP contracts. Similar requirements in a carbon offset program could address land tenure issues. CRP rules also limit enrollment within a county to prevent disruptions to local input industries. Other provisions, like those in USDA's EQIP, ensure contractual obligations are met. Farmers participating in programs like CRP and EQIP must demonstrate control of the land for the contract period. Ownership of 80% or more of the land increases likelihood of enrollment in CRP. CRP allows landowners to offer tenants participation opportunities, but few farmers take advantage of this provision. The USDA study found that farmers who lease land tend to focus on crop production and are hesitant to retire land. Leaseholders are more likely to lease productive lands for growing marketable crops. The inclusion of forestry offsets in carbon reduction programs has been controversial since the 1990s, which could slow the adoption of afforestation projects. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol has faced challenges in implementing forestry offset projects. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol allows Annex I countries to earn credits for emission reduction projects in developing countries. The CDM is the largest compliance offset market globally, with growing trading volume and market value. Afforestation and reforestation projects are the only land-use change offset projects permitted in the CDM, but forestry-based projects have not played a significant role so far. The CDM has issued credits for 2,029 registered projects, with only 13 related to forestry. The IPCC report highlights the lost potential in forestry sector due to institutional barriers and lack of political will. The EU-ETS carbon prices may not be high enough to incentivize forestry projects, leading to concerns in the U.S. farming community about limited participation in the carbon offset market. Some are concerned about inequities in the carbon offset market, as larger landowners and farming operations may benefit more than smaller ones. The FASOM simulation model cannot fully differentiate results by operation type. Evidence is mixed on who will benefit more, with speculation that larger operations may have an advantage due to economies of scale. Larger landowners and farming operations may have advantages in carbon markets due to economies of scale and lower transaction costs. Smaller operations, however, might benefit from owning their land and being operationally diverse. Businesses that are more efficient and productive receive greater rewards in the marketplace. Larger-sized farming operations may benefit from economies of scale in carbon markets, potentially having access to greater benefits than smaller operations. The impact of transaction costs on small versus large farms is not well understood. Under a federal cap-and-trade program, transaction costs may disproportionately affect small-scale offset projects compared to larger farms. The magnitude of transaction costs could make only the largest farm operations economically viable for offset projects due to economies of scale. Research shows that measurement costs play a significant role in total costs for offset projects. Offset projects have shown that measurement costs are a larger percentage of total costs for smaller projects compared to large-area projects. The Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) confirmed this, with verification costs varying significantly between small and large agricultural soil sequestration projects. Despite the cost disparity, smaller projects may still be economically viable depending on transaction costs relative to offset revenue and project nature. Different offset protocols result in varying break-even prices, making project viability dependent on the protocol used. The break-even prices for afforestation projects vary depending on different protocols and can range from $10 to $50 per MT. Offset credits generated under various protocols can range from 118 million to 300 million MT CO2-Eq over a 60-year period. Transaction costs differ between offset projects, with agricultural soil sequestration projects requiring annual monitoring compared to afforestation projects needing periodic monitoring. Afforestation projects may only need periodic monitoring every 5 years to ensure carbon sequestration. Soil carbon requires soil samples for analysis, with the number of samples depending on soil heterogeneity. Smaller producers, focused on organic and sustainable practices, may be more interested in participating in carbon sequestration efforts despite higher transaction costs. The USDA's 2007 Census of Agriculture shows an increase in the number of U.S. farms, with new farms being smaller, more diversified, and run by younger operators. Smaller producers could benefit from participating in a carbon offset program due to increased diversification and non-economic incentives like the environmental aspects of sequestration. Additional outreach and education are important for encouraging participation. The role of outreach, education, and technical assistance is crucial for smaller producers in carbon offset programs. Lack of personal experience and local support may deter participation despite economic incentives. Converting cropland to forestland requires greater knowledge and skills, necessitating additional extension services. Larger farms hold the majority of sequestration potential according to a recent USDA study. Small family farms, owning 60% of US agricultural acres, are more likely to participate in carbon markets and create offset projects compared to larger farms. They have been more active in CRP contracts, indicating a potential for carbon offset projects. Offset project aggregators play a crucial role in developing participation in the carbon market, particularly in the agricultural sector. Aggregators act as middle-men, linking landowners with offset markets, and have been instrumental in the success of projects on platforms like the Chicago Climate Exchange. The inclusion of aggregators has increased entrepreneurial activity in carbon markets, with some organizations creating new departments to facilitate participation. Established membership organizations and cooperatives have created new departments to offer environmental services to members. New companies have also been formed to market these services, increasing competition in the market. Aggregators play a role in federal cap-and-trade systems by providing participation opportunities to small landowners, depending on offset protocols. The size and value of the voluntary offset market are unknown due to a lack of tracking systems. The voluntary carbon market lacks comprehensive data on participants, with estimates provided by the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and Point Carbon. CCX reported that 65% of farms in their conservation tillage program were small farms. Point Carbon data includes 86 forestry projects developed since 1999, categorized by CO2 emissions mitigated per year. The voluntary carbon market lacks comprehensive data on participants, with estimates provided by the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and Point Carbon. CCX reported that 65% of farms in their conservation tillage program were small farms. Point Carbon data includes 86 forestry projects developed since 1999, categorized by CO2 emissions mitigated per year. The data on offset projects in the voluntary market may not be indicative of projects under a federal cap-and-trade program due to differences in protocols and motivations. Studies suggest that economic incentives in a compliance market would be higher than in the voluntary market, making comparisons problematic. The USDA's regional analysis projects that the majority of offset supply under a cap-and-trade program would come from afforestation of croplands and pasturelands. Farmers in the Corn Belt region and the Lake States would be the largest suppliers of agriculture- and forestry-based carbon offsets. The USDA's regional analysis projects that regions like Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin would be significant suppliers of carbon offsets through afforestation, mainly by converting cropland. By 2050, the Corn Belt and Lake States are expected to contribute almost 65% of additional afforestation. Certain regions are better suited for tree growth, while others may require irrigation and fertilizers, which could be costly and technically challenging to sustain over time. The USDA's analysis projects that regions like California may not see substantial land shifts due to the production of high-value crops. The Great Plains show less afforestation, possibly due to limited tree growth ability. The Corn Belt and Lake States are projected to be the largest suppliers of offsets, with the highest annual gross revenue. Other regions like the Northeast, South Central, and Rocky Mountain states also show high annual gross revenue from offsets. The USDA's analysis shows regions like the Pacific Northwest, Southwest, and Pacific Southwest may receive little annual gross revenue from offsets, indicating fewer carbon offsets. However, participating regions could benefit from potentially higher commodity prices. Afforestation projects could lead to increased demand and higher prices for crops in regions remaining in crop production, benefiting all regions, not just those in the carbon market. When evaluating climate change legislation like a cap-and-trade program, economic models struggle to predict costs and impacts far into the future due to uncertainties like regulatory changes and technological advancements. Long-term projections should be viewed skeptically, especially when detailed estimates are involved. The economic impact estimates of H.R. 2454 by EPA and USDA are not unique in this aspect, with both agencies suggesting modest costs and potential economic gains from carbon offsets revenue. While uncertainties surround the economic impacts of carbon offsets revenue for the U.S. agricultural sectors, some models support potential benefits. Concerns exist about smaller operations and regions being unable to participate fully. Even with low participation rates, land conversions and carbon offsets by larger operations could still benefit all farmers through rising commodity prices and increased land values. Alternative sources of farm revenue, like carbon offset markets, can increase land values for all landowners. Economic analyses are complicated by factors such as offset prices, farmer responses, and missing costs. EPA and USDA models may overstate land conversion rates due to assumptions about prices and farmer behavior. The EPA and USDA analyses do not consider all farm-level costs, regional and biological variability, and capacity constraints, which could lead to overestimation of land conversion rates in carbon offset markets. The carbon reduction program requirements may overstate modeling results due to possible legal and contractual constraints on land tenure. Concerns exist that the cap-and-trade offset market could favor larger producers, as the FASOM simulation model does not account for differences in farm size. Mixed evidence and speculation surround the inequitable distribution of benefits, with larger operations potentially benefiting more due to economies of scale. Smaller farms may benefit from developing carbon markets due to their diversification and responsiveness to non-economic influences. Owner-operated smaller farms are more likely to shift to carbon offset projects, and have shown willingness to participate in conservation-payment programs. Aggregators are developing projects for voluntary carbon markets, which may continue to support smaller operations. The USDA expanded upon EPA's model simulations to analyze carbon offset supplies and benefits by region. Most benefits are expected in the Corn Belt and Lake States, with lesser benefits in other regions. The Southwest shows an increase in cropland, while other regions are converting cropland to forestland. Higher crop values and land values due to the carbon offset program increase farm revenues, allowing for expansion of crop production in areas where operating costs are currently not covered. Selected studies show potential economic impacts of carbon offset programs on agriculture. EPA and USDA analyses, along with Congressional Budget Office reports, provide insights into the effects of these programs. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and studies related to the costs and impacts of carbon offset programs on agriculture, including analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and Kansas State University. These studies provide insights into the economic effects of such programs. Various reports and studies have analyzed the impacts of H.R. 2454 on the agriculture sector, including research from Duke University, the Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute, and Texas A&M University. These studies examine the effects of low-carbon policies on net farm income and crop production costs, as well as the economic implications of cap and trade provisions for U.S. representative farms. Several research papers from institutions such as Iowa State University, University of Tennessee, and University of Arkansas analyze the impacts of climate change policy and energy legislation on the agricultural sector. Several institutions including University of Arkansas, Informa Economics, American Farm Bureau Federation, Fertilizer Institute, and Brookings Institution have conducted studies on the potential impacts of cap-and-trade policies on agriculture in the South and U.S. corn, soybean, and wheat producers. Several institutions have conducted studies on the potential impacts of cap-and-trade policies on agriculture in the South and U.S. corn, soybean, and wheat producers. The studies include research from the Brookings Institution, CRA International, USDA, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Several studies have been conducted on the potential consequences of climate variability and change for agriculture in the United States. The Institute for Policy Integrity highlights the economic benefits of climate legislation, while the Environmental Working Group warns that climate change will cost farmers more than a climate bill."
