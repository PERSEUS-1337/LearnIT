FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the Russian Federation has adopted constitutional protections and procedures for emigration, complies with freedom of emigration requirements, and has made progress towards democratic institutions and a free-market economy. The Russian Federation, as an OSCE member, is committed to developing governance in line with human rights principles. It also aims to address issues concerning national and religious minorities, ensuring their equality and respecting minority religious communities. Problems persist regarding the registration of religious groups. The Russian Federation has enacted legislation to protect against discrimination based on national, racial, ethnic, or religious grounds, including anti-Semitism. They have committed to ensuring freedom of religion and equal treatment of all religious groups, as well as combating intolerance and hatred. Efforts have been made to combat ethnic and religious intolerance through cooperation with various entities. The Russian Federation is continuing the restitution of religious properties confiscated from minorities during the Soviet era, facilitating their reemergence in national life. They have received normal trade relations treatment since a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 1992 and are progressing towards accession to the World Trade Organization. The Russian Federation is making progress towards accession to the World Trade Organization, with key issues remaining unresolved such as restrictions on agricultural products, tariff reductions, intellectual property rights, energy sector reform, and trade remedy provisions. Despite enacting some labor rights protections and guaranteeing freedom of the press, gaps in enforcement and infringements still exist. The Russian Federation has shown a strong desire for a friendly relationship with the United States, despite ongoing infringements on press freedom. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Russia and extend nondiscriminatory treatment to their products. This would result in the termination of Title IV's application to Russia. The United States remains committed to engaging with Russia, urging them to uphold OSCE standards including free emigration, religious liberty, and enforcement of existing laws. The United States urges Russia to enforce laws against discrimination and violence, expand property restitution, and respect freedom of the press. They will work with Russia to address human rights issues and continue monitoring the situation closely. The United States is assisting nongovernmental organizations and human rights groups in Russia, promoting discussions with the Russian Federation on human rights issues, and involving US and Russian NGOs in these discussions. The reports required by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 must assess specific issues. The bilateral trade agreement between the US and Russia from June 17, 1992, remains in force, granting the US rights to use safeguard rules against import surges from Russia. SEC. 6. EXERCISE OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OVER WTO ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS. The President must notify Congress within 5 days of a bilateral agreement with Russia on WTO accession terms. A report on the agreement must be transmitted to Congress within 15 days. If a resolution of disapproval is introduced in Congress within 30 days, it will be considered. Congress must consider a resolution of disapproval for the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation on WTO accession terms. The resolution must be a joint resolution of both Houses of Congress. Resolutions of disapproval can be introduced by any Member of the House or Senate and are referred to specific committees. They cannot be amended by the committees. Resolutions of disapproval introduced by any Member of the House or Senate cannot be amended and follow specific committee discharge and floor consideration procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. These procedures are deemed part of the rules of each House and supersede other rules to some extent. The procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974 supersede other rules to some extent, allowing for resolutions of disapproval to be introduced without amendments. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time."
