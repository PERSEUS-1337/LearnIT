    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act\". The \"Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act\" highlights Iran's high levels of corruption, involvement of security forces in the economy, and acquisition of wealth by political and military leaders. Sanctions relief from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action has removed many corrupt Iranian entities from the US sanctions list. Iran's financial sector, including Iran's Central Bank and private banks, is identified as a primary money laundering concern by the United States. Iran is listed by the FATF as a high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdiction along with North Korea. Iran is ranked 131st out of 176 countries in the Transparency International index of perceived public corruption. The Department of State has labeled Iran as a major money-laundering country and a state sponsor of terrorism, along with North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Iran continues to sponsor terrorist groups worldwide. Iran supports various terrorist groups globally, including Lebanese Hizballah, Iraqi Shia militants, Hamas, and Palestine Islamic Jihad. The Iranian government's tolerance of corruption and nepotism hinders foreign and domestic investment, with the IRGC controlling a significant portion of Iran's economy. The IRGC and bonyads control key sectors of Iran's economy, providing funds for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas. This control also worsens the economic situation for the average citizen of Iran. SEC. 3. REPORT RELATING TO ASSETS OF IRANIAN LEADERS AND SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES.
