    "content": "The authority for congressional review and approval of the District of Columbia's budget is derived from the Constitution and the District of Columbia Self-Government and Government Reorganization Act of 1973. Congress granted limited home rule authority to the city in 1973, allowing citizens to elect a mayor and city council. However, Congress retains the authority to review and approve all District laws, including the annual budget. The city council must approve a budget within 56 days, which is then transmitted to the President and Congress for review and approval. The budget review and approval process for the District of Columbia must be completed within approximately 120 calendar days before the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1. Congress appropriates federal payments to fund certain activities and reviews the District's entire budget, including the expenditure of local funds. The District's appropriations act has been included in a multi-agency appropriations bill since FY2006. The District of Columbia's appropriations act is currently included in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. It consists of special federal payments for statutory obligations, the District's operating budget for day-to-day functions, and capital outlays funded by local taxes. District operating budget expenditures are funded by local taxes, federal funds, and fees. General provisions in the District's budget cover fiscal directives, administrative controls, lobbying limitations, and congressional oversight. Congress can also authorize new initiatives or charter amendments in the District's Appropriations bill. The District of Columbia's budget includes funding from local taxes, federal funds, and fees.

The budget request included provisions for greater self-governance, such as budget and legislative autonomy, if approved by Congress. The District of Columbia Council approved the FY2016 budget, including provisions for greater self-governance. The proposed amendment to the District's home rule charter aimed to remove congressional oversight of the general fund budget and make the annual operating/local budget effective upon passage by the District Council. It would have directed the mayor to submit the budget for special federal payments to Congress for review and approval, while only requiring notification for local funds expenditure. The Council's budget request for FY2016 also included provisions to advance the principles of home rule by eliminating provisions governing congressional review. The District of Columbia Council approved the FY2016 budget, including provisions for greater self-governance.

The House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2014, H.R. 2995 on July 9, 2015, as part of the appropriations process for FY2016. The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2014, H.R. 2995, included $678.0 million in special federal payments to the District, which was less than appropriated for FY2015.

Additionally, $45 million was recommended for the District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, and private school vouchers. The House committee bill included general provisions governing budgetary and fiscal operations, prohibiting deficit spending, establishing restrictions on fund reprogramming, and allowing fund transfers. It also required the city's Chief Financial Officer to submit a revised budget for District public schools within 30 days. Additionally, the bill included provisions related to statehood and congressional representation for the District. H.R. 2995, unlike the Senate committee bill, would restrict the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the pregnant woman's life. It also prohibits the use of federal funds for laws decriminalizing or regulating marijuana and administering needle exchange programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1910, recommending $688.7 million in federal payments to the District for FY2016, which was $9.1 million more than FY2015.

The bill also included provisions not found in the House Committee version of the bill. The Senate measure in the FSGG bill granted the District budget autonomy over locally raised funds for FY2017, allowing spending if Congress failed to pass a resolution. It also amended the Opportunity Scholarship Program and college access program. Congress passed multiple continuing resolutions in FY2016 for the District of Columbia, allowing local funds to be spent at specified rates.

Congress must approve these expenditures, which are supported by locally raised revenues. The public funding of abortion services for DC residents is a recurring issue debated by Congress during annual budget deliberations, with District officials citing it as congressional intrusion into local matters. Since 1979, Congress has restricted public funds for abortion services for District residents. Initially, funds were limited to cases where the woman's life was endangered or pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. In 1989, restrictions were further tightened to only allow funds in cases where the woman's life would be endangered if the pregnancy continued. President Reagan supported these changes, threatening to veto the District's budget if they were not included. President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush endorsed restrictions on public funding for abortion services in the District of Columbia. Bush vetoed the FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue but eventually signed a bill prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases where the woman's life was endangered. The District successfully lobbied for the removal of funding limitations in the FY1994 appropriations act, which also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, the success was short-lived as subsequent appropriations acts reinstated restrictions on funding. In FY2010, Congress lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services but maintained restrictions on federal funds, except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the woman's life. However, appropriations acts for FY2011 to FY2015 reinstated restrictions on both federal and District funds for abortion services, allowing exceptions only for rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman's life. During the 112th Congress, bills were considered in the House to ban or restrict abortion services in the District of Columbia. The House passed H.R. 3, which would have prohibited federal and District funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the woman's life. The House Judiciary Committee also ordered reported H.R. 3803, which aimed to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy in the District, with exceptions for physical disorders, injuries, or illnesses endangering the woman. The proposed act in the District of Columbia would have banned abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for physical disorders, injuries, or illnesses endangering the woman's life. It would have imposed penalties on doctors, allowed civil actions against those performing late-term abortions, and required reporting of abortion details to the health agency. Eleanor Holmes Norton criticized the measures as an infringement on home rule. Congress reinstated restrictions on the use of District and federal funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia appropriations measures for FY2014 and FY2015. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget request included restrictions on federal funds for abortion services, except in specific cases, but did not restrict the use of District funds. The mayor's budget request did not address abortion services. The House Appropriations Committee bill, H.R. 2995, aimed to prohibit the use of federal and District funds for abortion services. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 1910, would restrict federal funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the pregnant woman's life. P.L. 114-113 also limits the use of federal and District funds for abortion services under similar conditions. District of Columbia leaders are concerned about delays in passing the appropriations act for the city's budget. The approval of the District's annual budget by Congress is often delayed, impacting the city's financial management and public services delivery. The District's appropriations act is typically included in omnibus or consolidated appropriations acts, causing delays. Only in FY1997 was the D.C. appropriations act enacted before the start of the fiscal year. Congress has taken steps to mitigate the impact of these delays. The mayor's FY2016 budget request aimed to grant the District more autonomy over locally raised revenues, allowing it to establish its own fiscal year start date and spend local funds without federal approval if necessary. The District Delegate introduced legislation for budget autonomy over locally raised revenues, eliminating the need for congressional approval. This bill is part of a series of budget autonomy measures dating back to 1981. Additionally, in 2014, the District Council had a legal dispute with the Mayor and Chief Financial Officer over a budget autonomy amendment. The Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012 was passed by the Council and signed by the Mayor in 2013. The Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012, signed by the mayor in 2013, eliminated the need for congressional approval of the District of Columbia budget. Despite objections, the charter amendment was approved by voters with 83% support. Mayor Gray informed the Council in a letter that he would not enforce the budget autonomy law due to the District Attorney General's opinion that the charter amendment was unlawful. The Attorney General raised legal objections to the proposed amendment, questioning its legality and the Board of Election's authority to place it on a ballot referendum. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act prohibits using the Charter-amending procedure to enact or affect laws beyond the Council's limitations specified in the statute. This includes restrictions on Congress's authority to change laws regarding the District's budget. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act prohibits using the Charter-amending procedure to enact or affect laws beyond the Council's limitations specified in the statute, including restrictions on Congress's authority to change laws regarding the District's budget. The proposed charter amendment was deemed null and void by the Office of Attorney General due to exceeding the Council's authority and violating federal law. The District of Columbia Council's proposed charter amendment violates federal law by exceeding its authority and changing the functions of the United States. Legal arguments in support of the act are deemed unpersuasive, with a GAO legal analysis raising objections. The Council filed a lawsuit to compel the mayor to execute the changes, but legal standing is questioned. On May 19, 2014, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled the Local Budget Autonomy Act unlawful, enjoining District officials from enforcing it. The Council appealed, presenting its case before a three-judge panel on October 18, 2014. A new mayor, Muriel Bowser, reversed the decision not to enforce the Act. A motion to dismiss was filed on March 23, 2015, claiming no dispute between the Council and the mayor, seeking to vacate the judgment and dismiss the appeal. The Appeals Court ruled to vacate the District Court's judgment on the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012 and remand the case to the D.C. Superior Court. Judge Holman upheld the Act's legality in 2016, but the issue of budget autonomy remains unresolved. Litigation initiated by Clarice Feldman in 2015 is ongoing despite Mayor Bowser's motion for dismissal. The legal challenge to the District's budget autonomy act initiated by Clarice Feldman in 2015 is still pending in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Mayor Bowser and the CFO filed motions to dismiss, arguing lack of standing and mootness. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on D.C. Home Rule on May 12, 2016. The Subcommittee on Government Operations held a hearing on D.C. Home Rule, focusing on the legislative history and intent of key provisions of the District's Home Rule Charter. Attorney Jacques DePuy, a former subcommittee counsel, testified about the amici brief filed in a case regarding budget autonomy provisions in the home rule act. The House approved a bill clarifying congressional intent on D.C. home rule, repealing budget autonomy provisions and requiring Congress to approve the District's budget as part of the appropriations process. The House approved a bill clarifying congressional intent on D.C. home rule, repealing budget autonomy provisions, and requiring Congress to approve the District's budget as part of the appropriations process. The bill includes provisions to prohibit the District government from amending laws related to budget preparation. The Senate has yet to take action on the bill. During House consideration of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2017, an amendment to repeal congressional efforts to prohibit the District's budget autonomy act was defeated."
