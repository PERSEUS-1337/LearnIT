    "content": "Unsupervised text style transfer involves rewriting text from one style to another without using parallel source and target sentences for training. A reinforcement learning-based system with novel rewards shaping methods outperforms existing systems in generating sentences with the target style, fluency, and content preservation. Text style transfer is crucial for natural language generation across various domains, allowing for adaptation to different writing styles, formality adjustments, sentiment alterations, and even poetry generation. Recent works focus on unsupervised style transfer, aiming to separate stylistic attributes from content in texts for modification while maintaining content integrity. Recent works in text style transfer aim to separate stylistic attributes from content in texts for modification while maintaining content integrity. Some approaches encode style and content separately, while others identify attribute and content words to generate target style sentences. However, previous works have shown challenges in disentangling content and style effectively, leading to training instability, low sample efficiency, and poor quality outputs. Approaches removing attribute words require heuristics and manual setting, making them sensitive and prone to errors. Some recent works in text style transfer struggle with effectively separating content and style attributes, leading to challenges in generating high-quality outputs. While some approaches focus on encoding style and content separately or identifying attribute words, others avoid disentanglement altogether. Transformers have been shown to be effective in this task compared to recurrent networks. Transformers have been proven to be more effective than recurrent networks for text style transfer tasks. Recent advancements leverage transformers and pre-trained language models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Some approaches use reinforcement learning to handle non-differentiable training objectives, but challenges arise from errors cascading between content and attributes models. Recent advancements in text style transfer tasks have shown that using adversarially trained discriminators and a dual RL system can improve outputs. However, previous models tend to be biased towards certain attributes, leading to unnatural sentences. To address these issues, a novel RL-based model for style transfer is introduced, aiming to improve the quality of outputs. The novel RL-based model for style transfer introduced leverages decoder-only GPT, learns mappings from source to target sentences without disentanglement, and does not require a parallel corpus. It allows for controllable generation by balancing style, content retention, and fluency, outperforming current systems based on human and automatic evaluations. All code, data, and results are published on Github for reproducibility. The Reinforcement Learning based Style Transformer (RL-ST) is a decoder-only Transformer model that aims to learn the conditional distribution P(y|x, s_tgt) for sentiment transfer tasks. It utilizes a language model like training similar to GPT, with masked attention heads for token processing. RL-ST is a decoder-only Transformer model trained using a language model similar to GPT. To address convergence issues during RL training, warm-start is done by pre-training RL-ST on a synthetic parallel corpus generated using B-GST. Fine-tuning is then done using Policy Gradient for style, content preservation, and fluency. Sampling is optimized using policy gradient to maximize long term rewards. The model parameters define a policy that maps states to actions in sequence generation problems. 'Top-p sampling' is used for exploration by sampling tokens from the top probability distribution. Multiple samplings are done for each sentence in the RL-training set to ensure exploration. The state at each output timestep is represented as st. Rewards are typically assigned to pairs in style transfer tasks. In style transfer problems, reward assignment to intermediate tokens is a challenge. One approach is to 'roll out' the partial sequence generated up to a certain timestep and sample the rest of the sequence. However, this method is computationally expensive. A novel method leveraging transformer attention weights is proposed to assign token-level style rewards, along with using a language model for token-level fluency rewards. This is the first work on style transfer that combines these techniques. Our work is the first to utilize reward shaping in style transfer, along with a warm starting mechanism to avoid roll-out. We generate the entire output sequence at once and assign token-level rewards using a Transformer Attention based Style Reward. The style classifier determines the style reward for each generated sentence by defining a distribution over style labels. We use the Delete Transformer (DT) for the classifier, which is BERT-based. The text describes the use of a Delete Transformer (DT) for style classification, extracting representative head-layer pairs and attribute words based on self-attention weights. The top tokens are considered attributes, and a style classifier determines the style of the output. The text discusses the assignment of rewards in training a language model for fluency and content generation. Fluency is determined at the token level using a probability distribution, while content is evaluated using the BLEU score between input and generated sentences. The model is biased towards retaining content due to its training process. During training, RL-ST is warm-started with GST, biased towards retaining content. The overall reward is a weighted sum of rewards, with inference done using beam search. Results are shown on YELP, CAPTIONS, and GYAFC datasets for sentiment, factual, and formality transfer respectively. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of models for unsupervised style transfer, including Cross Aligned, Style Embedding, Multi Decoder, and others. These models were state-of-the-art at different points in time. The evaluation of these models is detailed in the text. The curr_chunk evaluates the models for unsupervised style transfer using automatic and human evaluation methods. FastText classifiers are trained to measure target style strength, achieving high accuracies on test sets. Content preservation is assessed using BLEU scores, while fluency is estimated using OpenAI GPT-2 models to obtain perplexity scores. The GPT-2 models achieve perplexities of 21.42, 52.5, and 42.91 on YELP, GYAFC, and CAPTIONS test sets. Human evaluations from crowd workers on MTurk compare model outputs for style, content, fluency, and overall style transfer. Top performing models are chosen based on automatic and human evaluations for comparison. The results of human evaluation on model outputs for style, content, fluency, and overall style transfer are presented in Table 2. Previous works show a trade-off between target style match and content retention. Different models achieve high scores in either content preservation or target style match. RL-ST stands out for achieving high target style accuracy. RL-ST achieves high target style accuracy without compromising content retention. It outperforms other models on HM and GM scores across datasets, with low PL scores. However, automatic metrics may not capture all nuances, as seen in biased outputs on the Yelp dataset. Model-based metrics like AC and PL are sensitive to training data quality. Our model, RL-ST, outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by a significant margin on all metrics across various datasets. It generates more natural-sounding sentences and achieves high target style accuracy without compromising content retention. Additionally, it performs better in formal to informal and informal to formal style conversions. The young man performs bicycle tricks in different settings, including near dumpsters, a group of people, and a crowd of aliens. The RL-ST model excels in style transfer, retaining core content while making necessary stylistic changes. The RL-ST model excels in style transfer by maintaining consistency, producing meaningful attributes, and eliminating redundancy in output sentences. Examples of outputs are shown in Table 3, with more results and comparisons in Appendix Table 6. However, a failure case is observed where the model retains conjunction words instead of making stylistic changes. The RL-ST model excels in style transfer by maintaining consistency, producing meaningful attributes, and eliminating redundancy in output sentences. However, it sometimes struggles with retaining conjunction words and identifying analogies in the source sentence. Ablation studies on the YELP dataset were conducted to compare the performance of RL-ST with different training approaches. Warm-starting using MLE significantly boosts performance in RL-ST. Providing the model with the full source sentence during training and inference is more beneficial than just the content. RL-ST is highly sample efficient, requiring only a fraction of the training set to improve performance significantly. The study explores the effects of style and fluency rewards in training with a set of 450K samples. Results show successful control over style and fluency. Ablation tests on different style reward versions reveal superior style accuracy with attention scores. Decoding strategies during inference involve top-p sampling and beam search. Ablation results are presented in Table 4, including style accuracy, BLEU score, perplexity, harmonic mean, and geometric mean. During inference, two decoding strategies were tested: top-p sampling and beam search. Beam search slightly outperformed in harmonic mean and geometric mean, while top-p had better perplexity. Previous works on unsupervised machine translation and style generation were also mentioned. In style transfer research, various methods such as GAN-like training, hierarchical reinforcement operations, and revision in continuous space have been explored. Different approaches focus on style prediction, sentence alteration, and multi-attribute control. Additionally, the examination of style transfer metrics and the discussion of standard problems are highlighted in recent studies. The text discusses problems with standard assessment using automatic metrics in style transfer and emphasizes the importance of human evaluation. It introduces an RL-based style transfer model that surpasses current systems in both human and automatic evaluations, showcasing its generalizability across various tasks. The model learns to map source to target sentences without disentanglement, efficiently shapes RL rewards, and utilizes transformer-based language models. The datasets used in the study include YELP, where sentences are labeled with positive or negative sentiment for style transfer, and CAPTIONS, where image captions are labeled as factual, romantic, or humorous for style conversion. The task is to transfer sentences/captions to different styles without using alignments. The task involves transferring formal to informal sentences and vice-versa using a dataset from Yahoo Answers in the Family and Relationships domain.
