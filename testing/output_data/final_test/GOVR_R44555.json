    "content": "On July 12, 2016, an arbitral tribunal under UNCLOS will issue a final ruling in a case between the Philippines and China regarding maritime rights in the South China Sea. The U.S. follows UNCLOS despite not being a party to it. China, a UNCLOS member, has rejected the tribunal's jurisdiction. China has declined to participate in the arbitral tribunal's proceedings regarding maritime rights in the South China Sea. The tribunal found jurisdiction to rule on some of the Philippines' submissions, with the case closely watched for its implications on tensions between the two countries, overlapping maritime claims, U.S.-China relations, and international law. The tribunal's ruling on maritime rights in the South China Sea will be legally binding for the Philippines and China, but could also clarify issues for other countries with claims in the region. The ruling aims to reduce maritime incidents, protect commercial shipping routes, and facilitate joint exploitation of resources. China has stated it will not accept the award. China refuses to accept the tribunal's award on maritime rights in the South China Sea, citing concerns over sovereignty and sea boundary delimitations. This refusal could escalate regional tensions and undermine the authority of international law. The Obama Administration supports the Philippines' right to pursue arbitration and emphasizes that the award will be binding on both parties. The United States supports the Philippines' decision to pursue international arbitration for territorial disputes in the South China Sea. President Obama reiterated the need for peaceful resolution and emphasized that the tribunal's decision would be binding on both parties. China's rejection of the treaty could damage its reputation and adherence to the rule of law. China's rejection of the treaty could damage its reputation and adherence to the rule of law. The tribunal's decision would be binding on both parties, as stated by Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. The ruling is seen as a way to narrow the scope of disagreement and open the door to diplomatic progress in resolving territorial disputes in the South China Sea. China's decision on how to respond to the ruling on the South China Sea dispute will determine its reputation and relationships with other countries. It can either abide by the ruling, leading to cooperative efforts and peaceful resolution of disputes, or ignore it, risking damage to its reputation and pushing countries closer to the United States. The outcome of the arbitration is being closely monitored by Congress, which supports the Philippines' right to seek resolution through arbitration. The Philippines exercised its right to seek arbitration with China to resolve disputes peacefully. Congress supports this action and hopes all parties will abide by internationally recognized dispute settlement rulings. Bills in the Senate call for implementation of the tribunal's ruling and urge ASEAN to develop a common approach to reaffirm the decision. The Philippines submitted 15 cases to the tribunal regarding China's claims in the South China Sea under UNCLOS jurisdiction. The submissions cover legality of China's nine-dash line, maritime entitlements, harassment of Philippines vessels, and violations of marine environment protection. Philippines aims to establish boundaries of China's rights under UNCLOS without addressing sovereignty issues. China's claim to the South China Sea is under scrutiny, particularly the legal validity of its nine-dash line. The origin of the dashed line dates back to the Republic of China in the 1930s, and China has not clarified the specific rights it asserts within it. The tribunal has deferred jurisdiction on the issue, which is seen as significant by many analysts. China's nine-dash line claim in the South China Sea lacks precise coordinates and consistent mapping, raising questions about its legal basis under UNCLOS. The ambiguity of China's nine-dash line claim in the South China Sea includes questions about its extent and legal basis under UNCLOS. The original Philippine Notification and Statement of Claim in the case asked the tribunal to rule that China's claims based on the nine-dash line are inconsistent with UNCLOS. In its 2014 position paper on the arbitration case, China did not mention the nine-dash line but claimed sovereignty over the South China Sea Islands. The tribunal could rule that the nine-dash line has no legal standing under UNCLOS or that it is inconsistent with UNCLOS. The Philippines seeks a ruling from the tribunal on the physical status of China-occupied features in the South China Sea, including the Spratly Island chain and Scarborough Shoal. This would determine the extent of China's ability to regulate and exploit resources in the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone. The tribunal ruling on the physical status of Second Thomas Shoal, claimed by both the Philippines and China, includes the deteriorating condition of the BRP Sierra Madre beached there in 1999. China's harassment of Philippine navy ships resupplying military personnel stationed on the shoal raises concerns about the Philippines' control. The tribunal also expanded the case to include the physical status of other Spratly Island features, potentially affecting each other's entitlements under UNCLOS. Under UNCLOS, land reclamation or island-building does not change the legal status of any landmass. Features on which China has constructed artificial islands since 2013 would be considered in their original state. An island able to sustain human habitation or economic life generates territorial rights extending out 12 nautical miles, including sovereignty, a contiguous zone, and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) up to 200 nautical miles. In the EEZ, a state has rights to regulate economic development and claim a continental shelf. The Philippines seeks specific designations for China-occupied landmasses under UNCLOS, including rocks generating a 12-nautical mile territorial sea and low-tide elevations generating no maritime rights. This ruling could set an \"outer bound\" on the rights of claiming nations. The Philippines seeks specific designations for China-occupied landmasses under UNCLOS, including rocks generating a 12-nautical mile territorial sea and low-tide elevations. This could limit China's claim to regulate maritime activity around certain features in the Spratly chain and Scarborough Shoal, allowing the Philippines to undertake economic activities in its EEZ. The Philippines seeks specific designations for China-occupied landmasses under UNCLOS, including rocks generating a 12-nautical mile territorial sea and low-tide elevations. The Philippine case also seeks a ruling that Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal are part of its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. The tribunal is particularly interested in the status of Itu Aba, the largest naturally formed Spratly Island feature, to determine if it qualifies as an island under UNCLOS Article 121. The tribunal is examining Itu Aba's status to determine its entitlement to an EEZ and continental shelf, which could impact disputes over China's artificial islands. The case is complex due to Taiwan's contested political status, with Beijing claiming sovereignty over Itu Aba. China's objection to the arbitration case is based on this claim. China objected to the Philippines' omission of Itu Aba from the arbitration case, claiming it violated the One-China Principle and China's sovereignty. Taiwan disputes the characterization of Itu Aba as a rock, stating it qualifies as an 'island' under UNCLOS. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Itu Aba qualifies as an 'island' under UNCLOS and should not be classified as a 'rock'. President Tsai Ing-wen's administration expressed that any award undermining Taiwan's sovereignty over South China Sea islands will not be acknowledged or accepted. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has not issued a follow-up statement on Itu Aba in the context of the arbitration. The Philippines argues that China has violated its EEZ rights under UNCLOS through various actions. Depending on the tribunal's rulings, China could be found to have violated the Philippines' rights. The Philippines also claims that China has violated obligations under UNCLOS regarding the marine environment. China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands have caused severe damage to local marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and reef-associated species, leading to a long-term reduction in fish stocks. China's island-building activities in the Spratly Islands have caused severe damage to local marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and reef-associated species, leading to a long-term reduction in fish stocks. The marine environmental damage from China's island-building activities is seen as a violation of UNCLOS by some, with allegations of destruction of coral reefs, hazardous fishing practices, and harvesting of endangered species. China denies these charges, stating they have not caused harm to the marine environment in the South China Sea. China has engaged in extensive land reclamation in the Spratly Islands, surpassing other claimants by reclaiming over 2,900 acres of land. This is 17 times more than all other claimants combined over the past 40 years, accounting for 95 percent of all reclaimed land in the area. China's spokesperson reiterated that the South China Sea arbitration case initiated by the Philippines is illegal and null. China will not accept any ruling from the arbitral tribunal and rejects any proposals based on it. The Philippines chose an arbitral tribunal under Annex VII of UNCLOS for its dispute with China over maritime entitlements. The Philippines chose an arbitral tribunal under Annex VII of UNCLOS for its dispute with China over maritime entitlements in the South China Sea. China rejected the tribunal's ruling citing its exclusion from compulsory dispute resolution procedures in the convention. The tribunal's ruling, outlined in a December 2014 position paper, focuses on the issue of territorial sovereignty, which is deemed beyond its jurisdiction. China argues that determining sovereignty over a maritime feature is necessary to assess the consistency of maritime claims with the Convention. The Philippines' submission, while not explicitly seeking maritime delimitation, is seen as a disguised request for it. China's 2006 declaration excludes itself from compulsory dispute resolution procedures, including disputes over maritime delimitation. In the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, China and the Philippines agreed to settle maritime disputes through negotiation. China argues that agreements exclude third-party settlement and cites Article 300 on \"Good faith and abuse of rights.\" The arbitral tribunal rejected China's contention in a 2015 jurisdiction award. The tribunal rejected China's argument that the case was about sovereignty or maritime boundary delimitation, ruling that it was about disputes regarding the interpretation of the Convention. It also stated that prior agreements did not prevent the Philippines from seeking resolution through the Convention, and that China's non-participation did not affect the tribunal's jurisdiction. The tribunal found jurisdiction over seven of the Philippines' submissions. China's Foreign Ministry declared the award on jurisdiction \"null and void,\" stating it had \"no binding effect on China.\" Critics argue that China's challenge to the tribunal's jurisdiction is not valid under UNCLOS provisions. Article 288(4) states disputes on jurisdiction are settled by the tribunal, and Article 296(1) mandates compliance with the tribunal's final decision. In anticipation of the final award from the arbitral tribunal, China criticized the Philippines for pursuing the case and questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction. China's Foreign Minister accused the Philippines of political arrogance and distortion of the international arbitration mechanism. The tribunal's final award, to be issued on July 12, 2016, will be legally binding on both China and the Philippines. Observers are waiting to see the responses from China, the Philippines, and the United States. China's response to the tribunal's award could escalate tensions in the region. Analysts worry that if China rejects the award, it could challenge regional stability and the credibility of international legal mechanisms. China has been garnering support for its position on the arbitration case, with 8 nations publicly backing China and more expected to follow suit. Diplomatic efforts are likely to increase after the award is issued. China began military drills around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea in response to alleged efforts by the Philippines and the US to challenge China's territorial claims. China's official newspaper stated the drills were to safeguard its sovereignty. China's response to the tribunal's award will depend on the actions of the Philippines and other countries. China hopes for bilateral negotiations with the Philippines to set aside the award. Analysts see China having three options for managing operations in the South China Sea after the ruling. China's response to the tribunal's award will depend on the actions of the Philippines and other countries. China could choose tacit compliance by ceasing efforts to drive away vessels and planes from low-tide elevations, halting land reclamation work, and clarifying its claims in the South China Sea. Alternatively, China could maintain the status quo by continuing to assert control over territorial seas and installing infrastructure on artificial islands. China's response to the tribunal's award will depend on the actions of the Philippines and other countries. China could escalate the disputes by taking actions to assert its rights, such as starting land reclamation at Scarborough Shoal, seizing control of Second Thomas Shoal, declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone over parts of the South China Sea, and establishing territorial baselines around the Spratly Island chain. The Philippines' possible response to the tribunal's award has been complicated by a change in administration. On June 30, 2016, the Philippines swore in a new president, Rodrigo Duterte, to succeed President Benigno Aquino, whose administration initiated the arbitration proceedings. President Duterte's inauguration day marked a shift in the Philippines' stance on resolving disputes in the South China Sea. President Duterte's stance on the tribunal's ruling is unclear, but he has stated that the Philippines will respect the Award as an affirmation of UNCLOS. He is open to bilateral negotiations with China if other efforts fail. In leaked remarks, President Duterte acknowledged a tribunal award as a \"moral victory\" but emphasized the need to face reality, hinting at the difficulty of forcing China to accept the ruling. He expressed a preference for peaceful resolution through dialogue and highlighted efforts by the US and Japan to garner international support for the tribunal's decision. The US and Japan are discussing raising their voices in the international community, including with the Group of Seven and ASEAN. Potential US responses to the tribunal's award may involve urging ASEAN and China to finalize a Code of Conduct, conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations, and pressuring China in UNCLOS bodies. China's refusal to honor the tribunal's ruling could disqualify them from deep seabed mining applications in the Indian Ocean. The US has signed but not ratified UNCLOS, so they are not currently a party to the convention."
