Section 9(jj) of the Small Business Act is amended to establish a grant program supporting innovative technology transfer at higher education institutions, research institutions, and Federal laboratories to accelerate commercialization of federally funded research by small businesses. The Small Business Act is amended to establish a grant program for Federal agencies to award grants through a competitive process to institutions of higher education, technology transfer organizations, Federal laboratories, and other entities for initiatives that identify commercially viable federally funded research and technologies. The Small Business Act is amended to establish a grant program for Federal agencies to award grants to institutions for initiatives that identify commercially viable federally funded research and technologies, and accelerate their transfer into the marketplace through activities such as proof of concept funding and technology maturation funding. The grant program aims to support activities like prototype construction, experiment analysis, product comparison, technical validations, market research, intellectual property rights clarification, mentoring, and entrepreneurial education to facilitate technology transfer into the marketplace. The grant program supports activities to facilitate technology transfer into the marketplace through innovative approaches to technology transfer, technology development, and commercial readiness. Qualifying institutions must submit an application to a Federal agency to participate in the program. The grant program supports technology transfer and commercial readiness to increase outcomes for federally funded research. Qualifying institutions must demonstrate proven strategies for technology transfer and commercialization to achieve greater success with program funding. The grant program requires qualifying institutions to contribute to local and regional economic development, have a plan for sustainability, and assemble a Program Oversight Board with expertise in technical, scientific, or business fields. The Program Oversight Boards are responsible for establishing award programs, evaluating project applications, and determining which projects should receive awards. The Program Oversight Boards establish milestones, award amounts, monitor project progress, and reallocate funds as needed. Each Federal agency may provide grants of up to $1,000,000 per year for 3 years to qualifying institutions. Qualifying institutions can award individual project funds of up to $150,000 based on reaching established milestones. Each Federal agency is required to establish an STTR program and allocate a percentage of their extramural budget to the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program. The percentages are set at 0.05% for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and 0.1% for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Federal agency must allocate funds towards the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program for program evaluation and data collection from grantees to assess outcomes of technology transfer. The Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program evaluates technology transfer outcomes, including follow-on funding, licenses to companies, invention disclosures, patents, and projects supported by qualifying institutions. The Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program evaluates outcomes of projects awarded to qualifying institutions, including commercialized products, job creation, and other relevant data as required by Federal agencies for program evaluation. Each Federal agency participating in the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program must submit an evaluative report to relevant committees detailing program implementation, grantee selection process, funds usage, and data collected. The Administrator will provide information on the Innovative Approaches to Technology Transfer Grant Program on the public database, including the program evaluation plan, list of award recipients, and grant usage by recipient institutions."
