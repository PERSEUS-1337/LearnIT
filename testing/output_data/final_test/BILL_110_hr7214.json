Congress finds that over 1.6 million Armed Forces members have been deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. A 2008 RAND Corporation report highlighted the need for increased mental health treatment capacity for OEF/OIF veterans, with an estimated 300,000 new cases of mental health conditions. Combat stress, common among military personnel exposed to war events, is linked to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and readjustment difficulties. Approximately 18.5 percent of Afghanistan or Iraq veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, with a high suicide rate among those with PTSD. Around 19.5 percent report traumatic brain injuries during deployment. Only half of veterans needing treatment for PTSD or TBI seek help, and of those who do, slightly over half receive adequate care. The Department of Veterans Affairs must provide lifetime care for severely wounded veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. The shortage of mental health professionals trained to treat combat stress may impact the quality of care for veterans. Challenges exist in hiring and retaining mental health providers. The Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program offers various support programs that need improvement. The Department of Veterans Affairs must improve education debt reduction programs to address the shortage of licensed mental health professionals with specialized training in combat stress treatment. The Department of Veterans Affairs aims to increase the number of licensed mental health professionals trained to treat combat stress through the Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program. The Department of Veterans Affairs is amending Section 7603 of title 38 to establish a selection priority for licensed mental health professionals with specialized training in treating combat stress under various components of the Educational Assistance Program. The Department of Veterans Affairs is amending Section 7603 of title 38 to establish a selection priority for licensed mental health professionals with specialized training in treating combat stress under the education debt reduction program. Priority is given to eligible individuals enrolled in approved courses leading to a degree in this field.

The Secretary will provide materials to educate personnel and institutions on program priorities until the shortage of professionals with specialized training in combat stress treatment is resolved. The Secretary will issue guidelines for identifying qualified educational programs for combat stress treatment within 60 days of the Veterans Combat Stress Healthcare Improvement Act enactment. The term 'licensed mental health professional' includes social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other disciplines as determined by the Secretary. Combat stress refers to expected reactions in veterans exposed to war events, often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $15,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 for veterans' medical conditions. The amendment does not limit the diagnosis or treatment of veterans' medical conditions. Section 7618 of title 38, United States Code, is reauthorized by changing the expiration year to 2011."
