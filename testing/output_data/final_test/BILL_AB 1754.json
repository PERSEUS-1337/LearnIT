    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's high number of older adults, who are vulnerable to financial predators due to loneliness and isolation. Scams targeting this population include foreign lotteries, annuity sales, identity theft, reverse mortgage scams, and fraudulent home repairs. Financial abuse can also occur at the hands of family members or caregivers. Studies show that elder victims of financial abuse have a decreased lifespan compared to those who have not experienced exploitation. The State Department of Social Services reports that Adult Protective Services offices statewide investigate up to 1,600 reports of elder and dependent adult financial abuse per month. Despite federal law allowing the use of Victims of Crime Act funds, the California Victims of Crime Program does not serve this population. Several states, including Colorado, Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wyoming, already provide assistance to victims of financial crimes. Elderly and dependent adult victims of financial abuse often suffer severe consequences, including failing health, anxiety, depression, and dependence on public assistance. Mental health and financial counseling have been shown to help victims remain independent and regain confidence to take legal action against perpetrators. A pilot program is needed to gather data on the demand for victim services, track financial crimes against this population, identify needed services, and establish best practices for serving these victims. The County of San Diego is establishing a pilot program to compensate victims of elder or dependent adult financial abuse. Victims of specific crimes in San Diego may be eligible for compensation under this program. The County of San Diego is implementing a pilot program to compensate victims of elder or dependent adult financial abuse. Eligibility for compensation excludes derivative victims of elder or dependent adult abuse, with potential reimbursement for financial counseling, mental health counseling, or supportive services up to $3,000 per person for specific crimes in San Diego. The San Diego County Elder or Dependent Adult Financial Abuse Crime Victim Compensation Pilot Program provides compensation for financial counseling and mental health counseling, with a maximum limit of $1,000,000 for all persons compensated. This section will become inactive on January 1, 2020. The California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board must report to the Legislature and Governor by July 1, 2020, on the number of victims receiving payments, mental health counseling, and financial counseling under the pilot program. The program will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed after that date. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the County of San Diego due to high elder and dependent adult financial abuse crimes. A pilot program will gather data on victim services demand to develop policies and resources for this underserved population. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the California Constitution."
