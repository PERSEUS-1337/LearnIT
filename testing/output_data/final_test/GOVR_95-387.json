    "content": "The report discusses provisions for providing abortion services to military personnel and their dependents at military medical facilities. It highlights the history of these provisions, legislative actions, and proposals to modify the law. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 expanded coverage of government-funded abortions to cases of rape and incest, previously limited to cases where the mother's life was at risk. President Clinton issued a memorandum allowing abortions at military medical facilities in cases where the mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, with the condition that the procedure is privately funded. This change was a departure from previous restrictions on the use of Department of Defense funds for abortions. President Clinton issued a memorandum allowing abortions at military medical facilities in cases where the mother's life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, with the condition that the procedure is privately funded. However, the Department of Defense went beyond the requirements of the statute by banning all abortions at U.S. military facilities, even if privately funded. The ban is unwarranted, and it was directed to be reversed to permit abortion services if paid for with non-DOD funds and in accordance with relevant DOD policies. The interpretation of Title 10 of the United States Code and the President's memo regarding abortion services has been a subject of varying interpretations. President Clinton allowed abortions at military medical facilities in cases of endangerment to the mother's life, rape, or incest, privately funded. Critics argue his interpretation of the law was overly broad, countermanding the intent to prevent DOD from providing abortion services. Proponents claim Congress allowed for this interpretation, especially crucial for eligible beneficiaries deployed overseas where abortion services may be scarce. Representative Robert K. Dornan prioritized this issue in the 104th Congress. Subcommittee member Robert K. Dornan prioritized barring abortions at overseas military hospitals, leading to the enactment of laws P.L. 104-61 and P.L. 104-106 restricting abortion services at Department of Defense facilities. Exceptions were made for cases where the mother's life is endangered, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Efforts to modify laws on abortions have become routine in the legislative process. The Senate version of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act includes language expanding government-funded abortion in cases of rape or incest. Current law restricts the use of Department of Defense funds for abortions, allowing them only when the mother's life is endangered. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 restricts the use of Department of Defense funds for abortions, allowing them only when the mother's life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. No DoD medical facility can perform abortions unless in these specific circumstances. Prior to 1970, there was no formal service policy on abortions in military medical facilities. Availability varied by service, location, and physician discretion. The Air Force was more liberal, while the Army and Navy were more conservative. Facilities followed state laws, and individual physicians decided whether to provide abortion services. Commanders also influenced the circumstances under which abortions were provided. Military physicians provided abortion services based on medical indications, influenced by commanders' approach to the issue. While formal policies were not always stated, physicians followed professional guidelines to practice \"good medicine.\" Abortion services were relatively few in military medical facilities, with some locations like Vietnam not offering them, leading to medical evacuations to other countries for the procedure. In 1970, the Department of Defense issued orders for military hospitals to perform medically necessary abortions or when the mother's mental health was at risk. President Nixon later aligned military abortion policies with state laws, known as \"the good neighbor policy.\" After Roe v. Wade in 1973, the Department of Defense funded abortions. The 1973 Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade led to the Department of Defense funding abortions for women eligible for DOD health care, with certain limitations. There were concerns over inconsistencies between state statutes and the Roe decision, leading to variations in accessibility for women seeking abortions. Military medical personnel were instructed to follow the constitutional guidance provided in Roe, despite differing state laws. In 1978, an amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill prohibited the use of Defense Department funds for abortions, except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered, for victims of rape or incest, or when severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result. In 1978, an amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill allowed abortions in cases where the mother's life is endangered, for victims of rape or incest, or when severe physical health damage would result. The 1979 language in the FY1980 DOD appropriations act did not restrict abortions for physical health reasons, allowing approximately 1,300 privately paid abortions at military hospitals overseas. In FY1979, approximately 1,300 privately paid abortions were allowed at military hospitals overseas under the rationale of limited access to safe civilian facilities. The FY1981 DOD appropriations act further specified that funds could only be used for abortions in cases where the mother's life is endangered, for victims of rape or incest reported within seventy-two hours, or for medical procedures necessary for the termination of an ectopic pregnancy. In 1981, language was added to encourage states to fund abortions at their discretion, with exceptions for cases where the mother's life is endangered, rape victims reporting within 72 hours, and ectopic pregnancies. The language was further shortened in subsequent years and codified in Title 10, United States Code in 1984. In 1988, DOD modified rules for abortion claims via CHAMPUS, requiring a physician's statement for life-threatening situations like leukemia, breast cancer, kidney failure, and heart disease. Dr. William Mayer issued a memorandum barring abortions in military medical to avoid insensitivity to the law's spirit. An attempt to overturn this restriction in 1990 failed. The battle over allowing abortions at military medical facilities overseas intensified in 1991. An amendment to reinstate the pre-paid overseas policy was passed by the House of Representatives but rejected by the Senate twice due to concerns about the scope of the amendment. In 1992, the battle over language allowing abortions at overseas military facilities intensified. Proponents argued for access to safe abortions for military women or dependents in dangerous situations, while opponents claimed no woman was denied transportation for an abortion in another country. Despite some successful amendments, President George H. W. Bush was expected to veto any defense legislation reinstating the former policy, leading to the language being dropped by the conferees. The Senate and House agreed to remove language pertaining to overseas abortions from the DOD authorization act in anticipation of a presidential veto. President Bush pocket-vetoed the bill on October 31, 1992, and no attempt was made to override it. President Clinton's 1993 memorandum led to Secretary of Defense Les Aspin directing military departments on the matter. In 1994, the DOD reinstated the pre-1988 policy on overseas abortions, providing access for service women and dependents, requiring consent for minors, respecting host nation laws, and allowing alternate access if pre-paid services were not feasible. The cost of abortion services at military facilities is estimated to be around $500, but the actual cost is difficult to determine due to how DOD funds are allocated. President Clinton's 1993 policy to liberalize abortion access may not have had the intended effects, as actual access to abortions may not have increased despite policy changes. In the years leading up to the 1988 ban, military hospitals overseas performed an average of 30 abortions annually. However, a survey of military medical personnel in Europe revealed a reluctance to perform abortions, with only one doctor willing to do so. Reasons for this reluctance include a lack of training in abortion techniques and the conservative nature of the military on social issues. In the Pacific theater of operations, no military medical personnel have volunteered to perform abortions. Military physicians, known for their conservatism on social issues, may be reluctant to volunteer for training in abortion procedures due to the close-knit and hierarchical social order on military posts. Superiors hold significant influence over subordinates' actions, making it challenging for medical team members to volunteer for such contentious tasks. The military team must consist of volunteers, with no economic incentive for performing abortions. Restrictions in different countries may limit access to pre-paid abortions at military facilities. In 1993, 27 abortions were performed globally, and in 1994, 10 abortions were reported, all for \"life of the mother\" cases. Data on therapeutic abortions by year and service were provided by the military services. (Since 2010, DOD has not responded to CRS requests for abortion data.) Since 2010, DOD has not responded to CRS requests for abortion data. Over 15 years, DOD has performed an average of 3.79 therapeutic abortions per year. In 1993, the Army's 7th Medical Command (Europe) tried to hire a civilian physician to provide abortion services, aligning with the President's memo on ensuring access to abortion services. This move could have been seen as encouraging abortion and potentially sparking protests, but no reports of protests have been found to date. The Defense Advisory Committee for Women in the Services (DACOWITS) suggested expanding the use of foreign physicians for abortion services in certain situations. In countries like Spain, South Korea, and Panama where abortions are outlawed or restricted, the issue of abortion policies was highlighted in Germany after unification in 1993. The Bundestag struggled to create new laws regarding abortion services at military facilities in Germany, which could have been sensitive to certain German sentiments. German President Roman Herzog signed a law on August 21, 1995, making abortions illegal except in cases of rape or medical necessity. Women seeking abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy must attend counseling but will not face criminal prosecution. Contracting with foreign physicians for abortions raises concerns about skill levels and costs. The cost of abortion services for military personnel raises concerns about including pro-rated amounts for various expenses, potentially making the services unaffordable. Using Defense Department funds for \"pre-paid\" abortions may conflict with regulations. Reduction of military physicians could limit access to abortion services, especially in light of host nation laws and downsizing proposals. The Defense Department plans to reduce the number of physicians in uniform by up to 50%, with civilian medical personnel cuts in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This reduction may require rotating uniformed physicians back to the US, impacting abortion services overseas. Federal court rulings on military-funded abortions for anencephalic fetuses were later reversed on appeal. The DOD Pharmacy recommended adding Plan B to the Basic Core Formulary as an emergency contraceptive. Plan B prevents pregnancy by interfering with various reproductive processes but does not terminate an established pregnancy like RU-486. The DOD Pharmacy recommended adding Plan B to the Basic Core Formulary as an emergency contraceptive, which can prevent fertilization and implantation. The decision was approved in March 2002 after a recommendation by the P&T Executive Council. The DOD Pharmacy recommended adding Plan B as an emergency contraceptive to the Basic Core Formulary. The decision was approved in March 2002, but later rescinded in May 2002. Plan B has not been approved for addition to the BCF at this time, and the ASD(HA) is reviewing the recommendation. Military Treatment Facilities must re-evaluate whether to include Plan B on their formularies. A proposed amendment to make Plan B available on all military bases died in May 2005. Plan B was the subject of controversy within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005. Certain military bases have Plan B on hand for cases of sexual assault or contraceptive failure. Military physicians can prescribe the medication for beneficiaries to fill at civilian pharmacies. The FDA approved over-the-counter sales of emergency contraceptive Plan B to women 18 years old and older in August 2006, following delays and controversy surrounding the application. In 2007, Plan B was not on the Basic Core Formulary for the Department of Defense, but Military Treatment Facilities may have had it available. In June 2009, Plan B was replaced by \"Next Choice,\" which was recommended to be stocked at all military facilities in November 2009. \"Parental notification\" concerns minors seeking abortions at military facilities. According to DOD, consent must be obtained before any surgical procedure is performed in military treatment facilities. The standard of care for obtaining consent for minors seeking abortions in overseas facilities is governed by host nation laws or legal requirements. If those are absent, valid consent may be obtained through specific methods outlined in DOD Health Affairs Policies. In military treatment facilities, valid consent for minors seeking abortions can be obtained from a parent or guardian, or by a judgment made by the commanding officer and attending physician. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act aimed to restrict the use of military facilities for pre-paid abortions. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act aimed to restrict the Department of Defense from using funds for abortions at military facilities, with political differences causing the authorization act to stall in conference. Legislators also sought to prohibit abortions at overseas military facilities in the DOD appropriations act. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act aimed to restrict the Department of Defense from using funds for abortions at military facilities. The authorization language would only take effect if specifically authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. However, the authorization bill was stalled in conference, and the failure to pass it would negate any language concerning abortions in the appropriations bill. On September 29, 1995, pro-life legislators in the House and a large number of Democrats rejected the conference version of the FY1996 DOD appropriations act, sending the bill back to the House-Senate conference. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act aimed to restrict the Department of Defense from using funds for abortions at military facilities. The bill was approved by the Senate on December 19, 1995, but was vetoed by the President on December 28, 1995. The President vetoed the FY1996 Defense Authorization Act due to provisions restricting service women and female dependents from obtaining privately funded abortions in military facilities overseas. He urged Congress to repeal a similar provision in the Department of Defense appropriations act, 1996. The House failed to override the veto, and later amended another bill to include the vetoed language. The FY1996 Defense Authorization Act was vetoed by the President due to restrictions on abortions in military facilities overseas. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report, including provisions on abortion exceptions. President Clinton signed the Act into law on February 10, 1996. The authorization act modifies Title 10 United States Code, ensuring the language stays in effect unless Congress acts to amend or repeal it. An amendment to allow abortions at military facilities without federal funds was defeated in the House but passed in the Senate for the FY1997 National Defense Authorization Act. Efforts to amend provisions regarding access to health care procedures for female members of the armed forces and dependents at Department of Defense facilities have been ongoing. Various attempts to allow privately funded abortions at these facilities have been rejected by the House and Senate in different years. Efforts to amend provisions regarding access to health care procedures for female members of the armed forces and dependents at Department of Defense facilities have been ongoing. The House Armed Services Committee considered amendments on privately funded abortions at overseas military medical facilities, with one amendment allowing Defense Department funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest. The Kuykendall amendment, as amended by Representative Buyer, would allow funding in cases of forcible rape or incest if reported to law enforcement. Later attempts to reinstate the Sanchez language for overseas abortions using personal funds were rejected. Ultimately, the Kuykendall amendment was deleted during conference consideration of the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act, leaving the law unchanged. The House considered amendments on privately funded abortions at overseas military medical facilities, including allowing Defense Department funding in cases of rape or incest. H.R. 2436 proposed language modifying Title 10, United States Code, making it a criminal offense to cause death or bodily injury to a fetus during conduct violating certain provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Exceptions were included for abortions, medical treatment, or conduct of the woman with regard to her fetus. The House passed this language on September 30, 1999. The House passed language on September 30, 1999, regarding criminal sanctions for causing harm to a fetus. The Senate held hearings on a companion bill but took no further action, and the legislation did not become law. Proponents argue for recognizing fetal victimization, while critics fear defining a fetus as a separate person could complicate the abortion debate. The House Armed Services Committee voted to retain its ban on abortions at military hospitals unless the mother's life is at risk. There were failed attempts to allow abortions in cases of rape or incest. Amendments to lift the ban on abortions were defeated in both the House and Senate. The House Armed Services Committee voted to retain the ban on abortions at military hospitals, with failed attempts to lift the ban on abortions in cases of rape or incest. Amendments to allow abortions at military facilities were rejected in both the House and Senate. The House Armed Services Committee voted to retain the ban on abortions at military hospitals. The Senate passed an amendment to remove the restriction on the use of military facilities for abortion services, but it was later dropped by the conference committee. President Bush signed the \"Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004\" into law, which included a provision protecting individuals involved in abortions with legally obtained consent. Amendments to the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act were offered to modify the law regarding abortion services at DOD facilities. The House rejected an amendment to limit the restriction to the United States, while the Senate rejected an amendment to repeal the restriction on using DOD facilities. Legislation for parental involvement in abortions of dependent children of the Armed Forces was considered but not called to the floor. Representative Susan A. Davis introduced an amendment in the House to allow military personnel and their dependents to use their own funds for abortion services. In the Senate, an amendment by Senator Barbara Boxer to allow DOD funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest was passed en bloc by unanimous consent. The \"Boxer amendment\" was later dropped from the legislation. Two other Senate amendments to the Ronald W. Reagan FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act were submitted, one regarding parental involvement in abortions for dependent children of military members and the other requiring notification of authorities in cases of rape. The House of Representatives rejected an amendment to allow overseas military facilities to provide privately funded abortions for military women or dependents. Senator Lautenberg filed an amendment in the Senate to restore previous policy on restrictions at medical facilities, but no further action has been taken. The House of Representatives rejected an amendment to allow overseas military facilities to provide privately funded abortions for military women or dependents. Language in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 aimed to repeal the prohibition on using military facilities for abortions, with exceptions. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-383) was passed without the Senate provision allowing military facilities to perform abortions. Senator Jeanne Shaheen's proposed amendments for FY 2012 were not included in the final version, which would have expanded government-funded abortion at military medical facilities. The Senate version for FY 2013 included language allowing for abortions at military facilities. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013 (H.R. 4310, Sec. 704) allowed for government-funded abortions in cases of rape or incest. Abortion availability at military facilities overseas varied by location before restrictions were enacted on December 1, 1995. In Germany, abortions are illegal except in cases of rape or medical necessity, with certification required for abortions within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Military facilities do not provide abortions. In Germany, abortions are only allowed in cases of rape or medical necessity, with certification required within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Military facilities do not provide abortions. In Italy, abortions are permitted and can be performed by licensed gynecologists. U.S. military personnel in Naples and Sigonella areas are referred to local providers for abortion services. In Japan, abortion is legal but more expensive than in the United States. In Japan, abortion is legal but more expensive than in the United States. U.S. military policy in Japan refers women seeking abortion to Japanese doctors. In Korea, abortion is illegal except to save the life of the mother, but Korean women still have access to abortion services. U.S. military hospitals in Korea do not provide abortions due to local laws. Korean women have access to abortion services in Korea, but U.S. service members or family members still have to travel outside of Korea for abortions. Abortion policies of foreign militaries vary based on factors such as religion, population control policies, cultural factors, and the presence of women in the military. Some countries do not allow abortions due to these factors. Comparing foreign nations' abortion policies, including military abortions at overseas facilities, is challenging due to various factors like lack of women in uniform in Islamic countries, absence of military in some countries like Costa Rica, internal legal restrictions such as court rulings on abortion in Germany, and limited overseas deployments for direct comparisons."
