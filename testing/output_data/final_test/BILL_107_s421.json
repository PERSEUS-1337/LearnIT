    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that gifted and talented students demonstrate high performance in specific academic fields and require specialized services to fully develop their capabilities. These students come from diverse backgrounds and are often underrepresented in gifted education programs due to their advanced academic abilities. The students with special educational needs require unique opportunities not typically available in regular education programs. Parents play a crucial role in developing appropriate services for gifted students. There is no federal mandate to identify or serve the approximately 3,000,000 gifted students in the nation. Some states and local agencies are taking steps to address this issue. Some states and local agencies allocate resources to educate gifted and talented students, while others do not. Varying state laws and funding mechanisms result in disparities in services for this special-needs population. It is crucial for the United States to have more students achieving at higher levels, especially highly capable students who need education to excel in today's innovative and creative workplace. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the US on international assessments like TIMSS has been among the lowest globally. The performance of gifted and talented students in the United States, as shown in the TIMSS study, was among the lowest globally in physics and advanced mathematics. Elementary school gifted students already master a significant portion of the curriculum before the school year begins. Funding for challenging programs for gifted students is minimal. The purpose of the Act is to provide grants to support programs for gifted students. The Act aims to provide funding for programs and services for gifted students in elementary and secondary schools to meet their educational needs. The Act authorizes programs and activities for gifted students in elementary and secondary schools.
