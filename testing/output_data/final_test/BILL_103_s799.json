    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bucket Drowning Prevention Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that approximately 400 infants have drowned in 4 to 6-gallon buckets since 1985, with children aged 1 to 28 months being affected. African-American infants had the highest drowning rates, followed by Caucasians and Hispanics. Only 10% of 5-gallon buckets are labeled annually, prompting states to establish their own standards. To prevent infant drownings in buckets, establish Federal labeling and performance standards. The labeling standard requirements are outlined in Section 3. Established under the Consumer Product Safety Act, a standard requires buckets with a capacity of 4 to 6 gallons to have permanent warning labels in English and Spanish. Labels must be difficult to remove and meet specific size requirements. The label on buckets with a capacity of 4 to 6 gallons must be centered on each side just below the handle, in English and Spanish. It should have a border for contrast and include the word \"WARNING\" in bold uppercase letters on an orange background, along with a safety message in black ink on a white background. The label on buckets with a capacity of 4 to 6 gallons must include a safety alert symbol with an orange exclamation mark on a black triangle. It should also feature a picture of a child falling into liquid with a red prohibition symbol superimposed over it. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS: It is prohibited to remove or tamper with the label on buckets once it is placed. SEC. 5. EXISTING LABELS: Labels on buckets conforming to requirements before 1993 can be used until 12 months after this Act, but must include both English and Spanish labels after the new standard is in effect. SEC. 6. AMENDMENTS: Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, applies to amendments to bucket labeling standard. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to these changes. SEC. 7. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LABELING. The manufacturer or distributor is responsible for labeling buckets covered by the standard, regardless of intended use or sale. Labels must be on the bucket at the time of sale. SEC. 8. PERFORMANCE STANDARD. Within 30 days of enactment, the Commission will start a proceeding to establish a performance standard for buckets to address drowning hazards. The standard must be in effect within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
