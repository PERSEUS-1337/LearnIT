    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Art and Collectibles Capital Gains Tax Treatment Parity Act\" and it pertains to the capital gains treatment for art and collectibles. The \"Art and Collectibles Capital Gains Tax Treatment Parity Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to change the maximum capital gains rate for art and collectibles. The amendment introduces a new 28-percent rate gain definition and applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2008. SEC. 3. Charitable contributions of certain items created by the taxpayer. Special rule for certain contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions under subsection (e) of section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for fair market value of property contributed to be considered without reduction in the amount of contribution. The term 'qualified artistic charitable contribution' refers to a charitable donation of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions, or the copyright thereon, created by the taxpayer at least 18 months prior to the contribution, and with a qualified appraisal of fair market value. The taxpayer must provide a qualified appraisal for the donated property, attach it to their tax return, ensure the recipient is a qualified organization, and that the use of the property aligns with the recipient's tax-exempt purpose. The taxpayer must provide a qualified appraisal for the donated property, ensure the recipient is a qualified organization, and that the use of the property aligns with the recipient's tax-exempt purpose. The written appraisal should include evidence of the extent to which similar property has been owned, maintained, displayed, or sold by qualifying organizations. The increase in the deduction under this section for any taxable year shall not exceed the artistic adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for that year and cannot be carried over to the next year. The term 'artistic adjusted gross income' refers to the portion of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income attributed to income from personal efforts in creating or teaching about similar property. This definition excludes certain contributions like letters or memoranda. The amendment specifies that a charitable contribution of a letter, memorandum, or similar property must be entirely personal to be excluded. In the case of a qualified artistic charitable contribution, the tangible property and the copyright on such work are treated as separate properties. The effective date of this amendment is specified. The amendment made by this section applies to contributions made after the enactment of this Act in taxable years ending after that date."
