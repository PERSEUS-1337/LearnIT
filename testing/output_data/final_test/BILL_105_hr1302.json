The Fair Pay Act of 1997, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, acknowledges wage differentials based on sex, race, and national origin in Government employment and industries engaged in commerce. These differentials depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also recognized. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has maintained a segregated workforce, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown wage differentials between white and non-white workers, with a significant portion unexplained and potentially due to discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court's decision in County of Washington v. Gunther extended this prohibition to jobs that may not be considered \"equal work\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Lower court decisions have highlighted the need for further clarification of existing legislation to effectively implement the Supreme Court's ruling. Artificial barriers to eliminating discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite legislation from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would have positive effects on the economy, reduce low wages for women and people of color, and promote stable families by ensuring fair pay for working family members. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits employer discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in wage payments for equivalent jobs. Exceptions include seniority, merit, or productivity-based systems. Labor organizations are also covered by this provision. The provision prohibits labor organizations from causing employers to discriminate against employees. Any withheld amounts owed to employees are considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation. The term \"labor organization\" is defined as any organization dealing with employers on labor-related matters. The term \"equivalent jobs\" refers to jobs with similar requirements in terms of skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Section 13(a) is amended to include references to sections 6(d) and 6(g). SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended to include protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, assist, or participate in investigations. It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about or discuss wages. The amended Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) now includes protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, assist, or participate in investigations, as well as prohibiting discrimination against employees who inquire about or discuss wages. SEC. 5. REMEDIES.\n\nSection 16 (29 U.S.C. 216) is amended to allow expert fees in addition to other remedies for violations of section 6(g) and permits class actions. Subsection (b) is revised to include paragraphs (3), (6), and (7) of section 15(a) and clarifies exceptions for class actions under subsection (f).\n\nSEC. 6. RECORDS. Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 211(c)) is amended to require employers subject to section 6(g) to preserve records documenting wage calculations and report annually to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Employers subject to section 6(g) must report annually to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with a detailed report on wage or salary rates by classification, position, and employee demographics. The report must not include individual employee names and will be made public by the Commission. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can use information obtained under subparagraph (B) for statistical and research purposes. They can compile and publish studies, reports, and surveys based on the data. Regulations allow for inspection of filed reports and provide copies to individuals for a fee. Rules and regulations dictate the format and content of required reports. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can establish rules and regulations for reporting requirements to prevent evasion. They may simplify reports for small employers to reduce burden. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide information and assistance to address wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in equivalent jobs. This includes research, education, and technical support to eliminate such discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is tasked with correcting conditions leading to section 6(g) by publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing technical assistance to promote compliance. The annual report to Congress includes an evaluation on this matter. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for addressing issues related to section 6(g) through various initiatives. The annual report to Congress includes an evaluation of the implementation of this section. The amendments made by this Act will take effect one year after its enactment."
