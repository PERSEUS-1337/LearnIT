    "content": "The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the lead federal agency for increasing access to behavioral health services. SAMHSA funds community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention services, collects information on mental illness and substance abuse, and supports improving the lives of those with these disorders through formula and competitive grants. Religious organizations are eligible for funding under SAMHSA's charitable choice provisions. Under SAMHSA's charitable choice provisions, religious organizations can receive funding to provide substance abuse services without changing their religious character. SAMHSA's main programs include the $1.8 billion Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant and the $421 million Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) block grant, which make up over 60% of the agency's budget. The SAPT block grant covers about 40% of state agencies' expenses for substance abuse services, while the CMHS block grant funds around 2% of state mental health agencies' expenses. This disparity reflects the historical funding roles of federal and state governments in mental health and substance abuse services. SAMHSA also gathers national data on mental health and substance abuse. SAMHSA collects data on mental health and substance abuse at national and state levels to monitor trends and allocate resources. The report provides an overview of SAMHSA's organization, programs, and funding over the past decade. It also highlights issues for Congress to address when reauthorizing SAMHSA and its programs. The reauthorization of SAMHSA was last discussed in the 110th Congress and legislation was introduced in the 111th Congress. Possible reauthorization issues include increased performance measurement, specific authority for the Access to Recovery program, collaboration with other federal agencies, emphasis on primary prevention, expanding the behavioral health workforce, and fairness in distributing block grants. This report will be updated as needed. SAMHSA administers various grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services under Title V of the Public Health Service Act. Appropriations were reauthorized in 2000, with new authorities added. Congress has not reauthorized SAMHSA since 2000 but has expanded its programs and activities. SAMHSA administers grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services under Title V of the Public Health Service Act. New authorities were added in 2000, expanding the agency's programs. PHSA Title V authorizes SAMHSA programs under three centers: CMHS, CSAT, and CSAP. SAMHSA conducts data collection and analysis activities related to mental health and substance abuse. Funding for SAMHSA programs includes competitive and formula grants, with formula grants accounting for two-thirds of the agency's budget, providing flexibility at federal and state levels. The mix of funding for SAMHSA programs includes formula block grants and competitive grant programs. Formula block grants offer flexibility for states to allocate funding but do not easily adjust based on changing needs. Competitive grants target specific issues like suicide prevention to areas with the greatest need. Some grant programs under Title V have not received funds, in addition to those with specific statutory authority. SAMHSA centers have general authority to fund projects addressing substance abuse and mental health needs through Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS). These programs translate research findings, provide training, and increase service capacity. Examples include the Access to Recovery program and the Strategic Prevention Framework. Most SAMHSA programs focus on mental health, substance abuse prevention, or treatment. SAMHSA centers fund projects addressing substance abuse and mental health needs through PRNS. Programs focus on mental health, substance abuse prevention, or treatment. Cross-cutting programs support various initiatives, including the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. SAMHSA has created connections between centers for programs with both mental health and substance abuse components. The co-occurring state incentive grant is administered by both CMHS and CSAT to improve infrastructure for treating individuals with both conditions. CSAT is authorized to develop, evaluate, and implement substance abuse treatment programs, administer grants for services, and focus on treatment and recovery support services. CSAT focuses on treatment and recovery support services for various populations, including homeless individuals and those in the criminal justice system. Key programs include the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant, Access to Recovery (ATR), and Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). These programs provide grants to states and tribal organizations for substance abuse prevention, treatment, and evaluation services. The curr_chunk focuses on grants for substance abuse screening, treatment in drug courts, services for homeless individuals with substance use disorders, minority AIDS programs, and targeted capacity expansion. CSAP provides grants to support strategic planning for substance abuse prevention, administers competitive grant programs, and oversees a prevention set-aside from the SAPT block grant. CSAP administers authorized programs and funding, including the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant with a 20% prevention set-aside. This grant supports primary prevention strategies such as information dissemination, education, and community-based processes. Additionally, grants are provided for the Strategic Prevention Framework to implement a public health approach to substance abuse prevention. STOP grants are available for underage-drinking programs, and funding is allocated for minority AIDS organizations to support substance abuse and HIV prevention services in minority communities. The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Center of Excellence disseminates information on preventing fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. CMHS funds evaluation, treatment practices, violence prevention, and collects data. It administers block grants and competitive grant programs for mental health, youth violence prevention, homeless services, and suicide prevention. CMHS funds various programs including the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant, Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness, Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness, and Services in Supportive Housing. See Table A-1 for a full list of authorized programs and funding within CMHS. Housing grants provide mental health services for individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Children's Mental Health Services grants aim to meet the needs of children with emotional disturbances. National Child Traumatic Stress Network funds experts to develop effective practices for children exposed to trauma. Safe Schools/Healthy Students grants focus on promoting healthy childhood development and preventing violence. Youth Suicide Prevention programs include grants to states and institutions for suicide prevention. The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) collects data on mental health and substance abuse at national and state levels, including information on incidence and characteristics of those affected. Grants are provided for suicide prevention hotlines, mental health system transformation, and substance abuse prevention and treatment services. The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality collects data on mental health and substance abuse at national and state levels. Data is collected through various surveys and surveillance systems such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), and Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS). These systems provide information on drug use, emergency department visits, and treatment data. SAMHSA collects data on substance abuse treatment through TEDS, N-SSATS, and I-SATS. The agency's budget for FY2010 was $3.563 billion, with an additional $111 million requested for FY2011. 69% of the budget is allocated to substance abuse activities, 28% to mental health activities, and 3% to program management. SAMHSA's budget for FY2010 was $3.563 billion, with 69% allocated to substance abuse activities, 28% to mental health activities, and 3% to program management. The two block grants for substance abuse and mental health activities made up 62% of SAMHSA's budget. Funding increased by 34% in actual dollars from FY2000 to FY2010, but only 6% in inflation-adjusted dollars. Funding growth within SAMHSA varied significantly among programs from FY2000 to FY2010. CMHS-administered mental health programs grew at twice the rate of substance abuse programs. Program management funding increased more than funding for mental health and substance abuse programs. Funding for mental health and substance abuse block grants saw minimal growth, below the 27% inflation-adjusted increase needed to keep pace. Funding for mental health and substance abuse block grants has seen minimal growth since FY2000, below the 27% inflation-adjusted increase needed to keep pace. In contrast, programs under the PRNS budget lines, including competitive grant programs, have received significant funding increases. Mental health PRNS grew by 166% and substance abuse treatment PRNS grew by 112% from FY2000 to FY2010. PRNS funding primarily supports priorities identified by SAMHSA, unlike block grant funding which is largely directed by states. The PATH formula grant saw the most significant increase in funding, with a 110% growth from FY2000 to FY2010. SAMHSA was last reauthorized in 2000 under the Children's Health Act of 2000. The Children's Health Act of 2000 amended SAMHSA's authorities under Title V, added new authorities, and authorized appropriations through FY2003. Congress has not reauthorized legislation since 2000 but has enacted laws adding new authorities to Title V. The 2000 reauthorization increased flexibility for SAMHSA to direct mental health and substance abuse funding, eliminated categorical grant programs, and added new programs focused on expansion. The Children's Health Act of 2000 expanded SAMHSA's authorities, added new grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services for youth, including support for prevention and treatment services for at-risk youth and those in the justice system. It also allowed funding for homeless individuals, adults in the justice system with substance abuse or mental illness, and for methamphetamine abuse prevention and treatment. The Children's Health Act of 2000 expanded SAMHSA's authorities and added new grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services for youth. It included provisions on the use of restraint and seclusion in certain facilities, specifying that they can only be used for physical safety and emergencies, with reporting requirements for deaths resulting from restraint and seclusion. The 2000 reauthorization law expanded SAMHSA's authorities and added new grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services for youth. It required facilities to report deaths resulting from restraint within 24 hours and prohibited the use of mechanical restraints. SAMHSA produced a report in 2002 on coordinated prevention and treatment services for co-occurring substance abuse and mental health problems, identifying barriers to treatment and providing a five-year plan for improvement. The 2000 reauthorization law expanded SAMHSA's authorities and added new grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services for youth. It required facilities to report deaths resulting from restraint within 24 hours and prohibited the use of mechanical restraints. SAMHSA produced a report in 2002 on coordinated prevention and treatment services for co-occurring substance abuse and mental health problems, identifying barriers to treatment and providing a five-year plan for improvement. In 2005, SAMHSA discussed efforts to improve flexibility and accountability of block grants, allowing states to direct funding to priority mental health and substance abuse services. Performance data is collected to measure the impact of block grant funding on patient outcomes. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 expanded treatment options for opioid addiction. The 2000 reauthorization law expanded SAMHSA's authorities and added new grant programs for mental health and substance abuse services for youth. It permitted qualified physicians to dispense or prescribe approved opioid treatment medications in their offices. The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 established programs to combat methamphetamine abuse, including increased penalties and new research. Congress has enacted laws expanding SAMHSA's authority since then. The expanded SAMHSA's authority with new programs focusing on suicide prevention, underage drinking, and prescription drug abuse. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 added authorizations for SAMHSA related to mental health and substance abuse. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act of 2004 authorized suicide prevention programs at SAMHSA. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act of 2004 authorized suicide prevention programs at SAMHSA, including efforts to reduce student mental and behavioral health problems, support a national suicide prevention hotline, and fund a national technical assistance center for suicide prevention. Two laws passed since 2000 also focus on reducing and preventing underage drinking, with SAMHSA providing consultation for grants to schools and awarding grants for community-wide approaches to preventing underage drinking. SAMHSA leads the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Underage Drinking prevention. The NASPER program funds state prescription drug monitoring programs to combat abuse. This program is similar to the HRPDMP administered by the Department of Justice. The HRPDMP, funded by the Department of Justice, provides grants to states for PDMPs. PPACA included provisions for mental health and substance abuse services, impacting SAMHSA programs. New SAMHSA authorities were established, including national centers of excellence for depression and demonstration projects for integrated services. PPACA mandates SAMHSA to simplify grant funding access for Indian tribes and establish a program for culturally compatible, school-based suicide prevention. Other provisions focus on expanding the behavioral health workforce and improving access to services. Grant programs aim to recruit and educate providers, as well as educate primary care providers on mental health services. PPACA mandates SAMHSA to simplify grant funding access for Indian tribes and establish culturally compatible, school-based suicide prevention programs. It also focuses on expanding the behavioral health workforce and improving access to services, including mental health and substance abuse services offered at parity with medical/surgical coverage through state-based exchanges. SAMHSA has strategic planning documents guiding its work, including the SAMHSA Strategic Plan, FY2006-FY2011, the Data Strategy Plan, FY2007-FY2011, and Leading Change: A Plan for SAMHSA's Roles and Actions, 2011-2014, outlining eight strategic initiatives for the agency's future work. The SAMHSA Strategic Plan outlines priority areas such as mental health, substance abuse, homelessness, and criminal justice. Cross-cutting principles include evidence-based practices, collaboration, and stigma reduction. The Data Strategy Plan discusses SAMHSA's National Outcome Measures (NOMs), which track mental health and substance abuse outcomes on the state and program level. The NOMs help monitor progress and determine the impact of grant funding. They are organized across 10 domains including reduced morbidity, employment/education, crime and criminal justice, stability in housing, social connectedness, access/capacity, retention, perception of care, cost effectiveness, and evidence-based practices. SAMHSA's strategic initiatives align with the priorities in the Strategic Plan and Data Strategy, focusing on prevention, justice, homelessness, data collection, and public support. New priorities include military families, health care reform, and jobs/economy. Each initiative has a designated lead within SAMHSA, with the FY2011 budget reflecting these priorities with a focus on prevention, homelessness, and data collection. Issues that may be considered during congressional debate on SAMHSA reauthorization include increased performance measurement and accountability for grants, specific authority for the Access To Recovery program, improving community ability to provide behavioral health services during disasters, and requiring collaboration between SAMHSA. SAMHSA focuses on primary prevention, workforce expansion, and fair grant distribution. National Outcome Measures track progress in mental health and substance abuse. NOMs cover 10 domains and include measures like alcohol use and risk perception. SAMHSA uses National Outcome Measures (NOMs) to monitor progress in mental health and substance abuse services. States report NOMs data to receive block grant funding, but funding is currently not tied to outcomes. Linking NOMs performance to funding could improve program performance and state outcomes. The accountability system for mental health and substance abuse services involves setting national and state-specific goals for NOMs. States may need to show improvement over time instead of meeting national goals due to data variability. The Access to Recovery program provides grants for substance abuse treatment vouchers and recovery support services. The Access to Recovery program offers support services for individuals seeking substance abuse treatment, including care coordination, child care, transportation, and work preparation. The program operates under CSAT's authority and has received funding of nearly $100 million annually since FY2004. SAMHSA has requested an increase of almost $10 million for FY2011 to fund new ATR grants. A total of 69 grants have been awarded since FY2004, with grant amounts ranging from $2 million to $4 million. SAMHSA is conducting an assessment to evaluate the program's effectiveness, with results expected in late 2010. The ATR program uses vouchers to fund substance abuse treatment services, allowing patients to choose their provider. Faith-based providers can participate without restrictions on religious activities. SAMHSA is assessing the program's effectiveness, with results expected in late 2010. SAMHSA provided mental health and substance abuse services after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, as well as during the Haiti earthquake and Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Effective disaster assistance should utilize existing behavioral health resources, but many communities lack the infrastructure to support increased demand post-disaster. SAMHSA can offer emergency behavioral health assistance through the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants (SERG), and supplemental appropriations. Federal assistance is provided to state and local governments for mental health needs during presidentially declared disasters. States must apply for funds with a needs assessment within 10 days of the disaster declaration. There is no matching requirement, and funds must supplement existing resources. Funding can last up to nine months after a disaster, with possible extensions. SAMHSA can redirect funding through SERG authority for non-competitive grants to address substance abuse or mental health needs in communities without a disaster declaration. States must certify a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists due to a clear event to receive funding. SAMHSA provides federal assistance to states for mental health needs during disasters. States can receive SERG grants if no other resources are available. SAMHSA also has programs for building mental health and substance abuse infrastructure. These programs do not have specific authorizations but are administered under SAMHSA's general authorities. SAMHSA's programs for mental health and substance abuse infrastructure do not have specific authorizations but are administered under general authorities. These programs improve service availability and delivery in states and communities, creating a stronger foundation for post-disaster services. Various federal agencies, including SAMHSA, the Department of Education, and the Indian Health Service, provide mental health and substance abuse services to specific populations. Experts suggest that collaboration among these agencies is crucial due to the diverse socioeconomic risk factors for these disorders. Collaboration between SAMHSA and other federal agencies is essential to address a range of socioeconomic risk factors for mental health and substance abuse disorders. For example, SAMHSA works with the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a veteran-specific suicide prevention hotline. Additionally, SAMHSA collaborates with the Department of Education to administer the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program, offering grants to schools for violence and substance abuse prevention. The Schools/Healthy Students program provides grants for violence and substance abuse prevention activities. Collaboration with federal agencies like the Department of Justice, ED, CDC, IHS, VA, and HUD can enhance SAMHSA's ability to support at-risk populations with mental health and substance abuse conditions. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and some SAMHSA programs provide housing services for individuals with mental health and substance abuse conditions, including the homeless. Reports from the Surgeon General, President's New Freedom Commission, and Institute of Medicine recommend a public health approach emphasizing prevention and early intervention in mental health care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the lack of federal leadership in promoting mental health prevention for young people. In response, SAMHSA has initiated new prevention initiatives, such as the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF), to address substance abuse in communities. SAMHSA implements various prevention programs, including the LAUNCH Initiative for young children's wellness and early intervention efforts for mental illness and substance abuse. They aim to reduce system fragmentation and increase services for those in need. SAMHSA funds treatment programs for at-risk populations like pregnant women, youth, and homeless individuals, with a greater emphasis on substance abuse treatment over prevention in their budget. Funding for substance abuse prevention has grown 37% in the past decade, while funding for treatment has more than doubled. Funding for substance abuse treatment was more than twice that of prevention in FY2010. SAMHSA's budget does not specify treatment and prevention for mental health. The 2006 IOM report highlighted the shortage of mental health and substance abuse treatment providers and recommended building a competent workforce. SAMHSA has limited support for workforce training through the Minority Fellowship Program. PPACA included provisions to enhance the health workforce, including the behavioral health workforce. The 2006 IOM report emphasized the need to address the shortage of mental health and substance abuse providers. New programs authorized by PPACA aim to mitigate these issues, but are subject to annual appropriations. Concerns have been raised about the distribution of block grant funding to states matching their needs. The ADMHS block grant was established in 1981 to consolidate substance abuse and mental health services grant programs. The ADMHS block grant program was established in 1981 to consolidate substance abuse and mental health services grant programs. The OBRA authorized block grant funds for FY1982 through FY1984, with a funding allocation formula based on population and state fiscal capacity. The 1984 ADAMHA Amendments included an allocation formula and reauthorized funding for three years with a minor equity adjustment. The 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act revised the block grant formula to phase out hold-harmless provisions, allocate funds based on populations at risk, use total taxable resources as the measure of state fiscal capacity, and incorporate weighted age cohorts for alcohol abuse, other drug abuse, and selected mental disorders. The 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act split the ADMHS block grant into two separate block grants, one for community mental health services (CMHS block grant) and another for substance abuse prevention and treatment services (SAPT block grant). The block grant formulas were further revised in 2000 with hold-harmless provisions reintroduced for both block grants. The formula for calculating a state's SAPT and CMHS block grant allocations considers three measures: population-at-risk, costs of services, and fiscal capacity. The population-at-risk factor is based on the number of individuals in need of services in a state. The CMHS block grant allocation formula considers three factors: population-at-risk, cost of services, and fiscal capacity. The population-at-risk factor is calculated based on different age groups, the cost of services factor ranges from 0.9 to 1.1, and the fiscal capacity factor adjusts for state revenue differences. These factors are multiplied to produce a state's score, which is then used to calculate the grant amount. The current formula for CMHS block grant allocation is based on a state's score, which is calculated by dividing the state's score by the sum of all states' scores and then multiplying it by the total grant funds. Issues with the formula include not considering variations in uninsured individuals across states and not accounting for other federal funding for mental health services. Experts suggest using national surveys to determine the population in need of services. Research indicates that the current cost-of-services measure does not adequately represent interstate wage variations in occupations related to substance abuse and mental health. SAMHSA administers surveys like the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication and NSDUH to assess mental health and substance abuse needs. Appendix A summarizes the statutory authorizations for SAMHSA's programs, organized by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, and the Center for Mental Health Services. The table summarizes authorizing legislation for programs administered by SAMHSA, including the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act in 1986, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, and others in between. The table summarizes authorizing legislation for programs administered by SAMHSA, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. It shows authorization of appropriations, funding levels, and fiscal years for which funding has been appropriated since FY2000. Some programs created in FY2000 have never received funding. SAMHSA funding details from FY2000 to FY2011 are shown in Table A-2, including direct appropriations and additional funds transferred by the HHS Secretary. Useful SAMHSA resources and grant awards by state can be found on their website. Funding information and program details for SAMHSA's various centers are also available online.
