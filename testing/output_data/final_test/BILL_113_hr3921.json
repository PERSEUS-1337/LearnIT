Congress finds that comprehensive immigration reform would reduce the national deficit, strengthen Social Security, create more jobs, and boost GDP. Additionally, a significant number of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, contributing billions to the economy. Despite thousands of DACA students graduating from U.S. high schools annually, only a small percentage pursue higher education, even though many jobs now require postsecondary education. Investments in higher education are crucial for providing youth with opportunities to achieve the American dream. States are spending less per student in higher education since 2008, leading to rising tuition costs and student loan debt. The purposes of this Act include allowing immigrant students access to higher education, incentivizing States to support higher education, and promoting increased access and affordability for students. State need-based financial aid supports postsecondary education for students. SEC. 415G. AMERICAN DREAM GRANTS are introduced as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide financial aid for postsecondary education. Dreamer students are defined as individuals who were younger than 16 years old when they first entered the United States, have attended secondary school in the US, and have earned a high school diploma or equivalent. Dreamer students must meet specific criteria to qualify, including earning a high school diploma in the US, completing at least 2 years of higher education, or serving in the military for at least 4 years with an honorable discharge. The Secretary can waive requirements in cases of hardship. To qualify as a Dreamer student, individuals must demonstrate compelling circumstances for inability to meet certain requirements and satisfy other specified criteria. The Secretary may reserve a small portion of funds for administration and award grants to eligible States for program implementation. The program awards grants to eligible States to increase access and affordability to higher education for Dreamer students. States must offer in-State tuition or expand financial aid for Dreamer students and demonstrate progress in establishing a data system. The America COMPETES Act awards grants to States to provide in-State tuition and financial aid to Dreamer students. The Secretary allots funds based on the number of Dreamer students enrolled in postsecondary education. The America COMPETES Act awards grants to States to provide in-State tuition and financial aid to Dreamer students. Grant funds awarded under this section shall be used to supplement non-Federal funds. Funds are authorized and appropriated for fiscal years 2015 to 2020. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allocate specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2020 to 2024. Additionally, a new fee of $150 for F-1 visas is authorized to be collected by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security will collect a $150 fee from nonimmigrants admitted under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i). The fee will be deposited in the Treasury's general fund. The State's option to determine residency for higher education purposes is restored by repealing Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Additionally, Section 328(a) of the Naturalization Act is amended to include individuals who have not been lawfully admitted to the US for permanent residence."
