    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"IFQ Act of 2001\" and includes provisions for Individual Quota Programs. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for the establishment of individual quota systems for fisheries, with specific conditions and requirements for administration by the Secretary and each Council overseeing the fishery. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for individual quota systems in fisheries, with provisions for sustainable management, fair allocation, minimizing negative impacts on coastal communities, and ensuring enforcement. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for individual quota systems in fisheries, with provisions for sustainable management, fair allocation, and preventing excessive acquisition of quotas. Enforcement is ensured through observer use and consideration of participation and historical fishing practices. Individual quotas can be revoked or limited at any time for conservation purposes, without conferring compensation to the holder. They can be received and held according to regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Individual quotas can be revoked or limited at any time for conservation purposes without compensation. They expire within 5 years unless part of a pre-existing system, and can be renewed, reallocated, or reissued by the Councils. Eligible holders can receive individual quotas according to fishery management plans. Individual quotas under a fishery management plan may be authorized for fishing vessel owners, fishermen, and crew members. Non-citizens are not eligible to hold individual quotas. The plan can allocate quotas among vessel categories and provide a portion of the harvest for entry-level fishermen or small vessel owners. The quotas can be terminated or limited as needed for conservation purposes. Individual quotas under a fishery management plan can be terminated or limited by the Council or the Secretary if necessary for conservation purposes. This does not diminish the Secretary's authority. Individual quota systems established for a fishery after the IFQ Act of 2001 must not allow quota shares to be sold, transferred, or leased. Participants must engage in fishing to hold a quota share, and if inactive for 3 or more years in a 5-year period, the share may be reallocated. Individual quota shares in a fishery cannot be sold, transferred, or leased. If inactive for 3 or more years in a 5-year period, the share may be reallocated by the Secretary in a fair and equitable manner. Exceptions include cases of hardship or transfer to family members on a case-by-case basis. The individual quota system limits access to a fishery through the allocation of individual quotas, granting permission to harvest a stated percentage of the total allowable catch. Individual quota shares cannot be sold, transferred, or leased, but may be reallocated by the Secretary after 3 years of inactivity. Exceptions include cases of hardship or transfer to family members. The Fishery Management Plans must be approved through separate referenda conducted by eligible permit holders with a two-thirds majority vote. The Secretary will develop guidelines for conducting fair referenda on fishery management plans. Limited access systems with individual quotas must comply with section 303(e) and regulations will be issued within one year of review panel recommendations. The regulations for establishing an individual quota system must specify factors for consideration, ensure compliance with specific requirements, impose penalties for violations, and include management options. The IFQ Act of 2001 mandates the establishment of management options for individual quotas, including leases or auctions by the Federal Government, and a central lien registry system. Additionally, a review panel must evaluate fishery management plans with limited access systems to assess their success in conserving resources. The review panel, consisting of various representatives, will evaluate the success, costs, economic effects, and use of auctions in fisheries management systems by September 30, 2003. The review panel will provide comments and recommendations to the Councils and the Secretary by September 30, 2003 regarding the revision of individual quota systems established before June 1, 1995, and for the development of required regulations."
