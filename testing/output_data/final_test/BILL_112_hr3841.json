    "content": "The \"Principal Reduction Act of 2012\" is also known as the Act. It focuses on reducing the principal of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Principal Reduction Act of 2012 requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce outstanding principal balances on qualified mortgages for single-family housing upon request from the mortgagor. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will establish policies and procedures for this program. The term \"qualified mortgage\" refers to a mortgage for a one to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor as their principal residence, owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, originated before the enactment of the Act, and with a principal balance exceeding the dwelling value by more than 20 percent. The program allows for principal reduction on qualified mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the condition that the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 90 percent after the reduction. The reduction must be determined to be net present value positive for the enterprise, meaning that reducing the principal is more financially beneficial than foreclosing on the mortgage. The program allows for principal reduction on qualified mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If the mortgage is sold outside of foreclosure or short sale and appreciates in value, the mortgagor must provide a portion of the appreciation to the enterprise. In case of foreclosure after principal reduction, the mortgagor must repay the difference between the foreclosure sale price and the outstanding principal balance. Enterprises are required to streamline the paperwork process for mortgagors. The enterprise must limit paperwork for mortgagors seeking principal reduction and aim to complete the reduction within 30 days of request. Borrower fees for principal reduction are prohibited, including appraisal fees. All default-related fees on qualified mortgages are waived. The program allows for principal reduction on qualified mortgages, with the enterprise paying a fee to the servicer. Tax liability for the mortgagor is waived, and the reduction of principal does not affect lien priority or loan status. The program allows for principal reduction on qualified mortgages without treating the modified loan as new. The Director encourages modification of second liens on dwellings with mortgages receiving principal reductions, with remedial actions for non-compliance by servicers. Remedial actions may include cancelling servicing rights or reducing compensation for non-compliant servicers. The Director may impose restrictions on compensation for executives of enterprises, limiting bonus compensation to not exceed base compensation unless a certain number of qualified mortgages have received principal reductions. Any reduction of principal on qualified mortgages is considered consistent with the mission of conservators of the enterprises. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency may impose restrictions on executive compensation for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The Director shall issue regulations or guidance for programs required under this section within six months of the enactment of this Act. Definitions for terms like \"Director,\" \"enterprise,\" and \"net present value\" are provided. Termination of principal forgiveness requirement for qualified mortgages after 12-month period from enactment of Act. Request for principal reduction must be made before expiration of 6-month period from issuance of regulations or guidance."
