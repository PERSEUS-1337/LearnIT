The House narrowly passed H.R. 2490 on July 15, 1999, after reducing subcommittee discretionary funding levels by $249 million to bring total spending down to FY1999's freeze level. This led to many Members withdrawing support for the bill, affecting programs such as Treasury-wide systems, IRS processing, tax law enforcement, information systems, and repairs and alterations by the General Services Administration. Several amendments were offered during consideration of H.R. 2490. During consideration of H.R. 2490, amendments were made to prohibit the import of children's sleepwear without required labels, change language on contraceptive coverage in FEHBP, provide $3 million for money laundering investigations, and establish no prohibition on women breastfeeding in federal buildings. Amendments to limit funds availability in FEHBP and increase the President's salary failed. Several House Members offered amendments during consideration of H.R. 2490, including amendments to release frozen assets of a foreign state, require specific procedures for strip searches by U.S. Customs officers, study the safety of red-dye kerosene fuel, and allow for the use of Exchange Stabilization Fund. Some amendments were withdrawn after assurances from bill managers that the issues would be addressed later.

Licensees must conduct background checks before using a firearm as collateral for a loan.

The Administration's request was $219,371,000 less than the previous year's appropriation, largely due to supplemental appropriations for counter-drug trafficking activities. Conferees rejected the proposal for a user fee to fund modernization. The Administration proposed a user fee to fund modernizing the Automated Commercial System (ACS) and developing the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). $35,000,000 was allocated for FY2000 to upgrade ACS and continue ACE development. The total FY2000 funding for Custom's Cybersmuggling Center was $4,000,000, with $2,400,000 specifically for the center. The cost to develop the ACE system over four years is estimated at $1,800,000,000, with a request for a revised blueprint, schedule, and budget by the time of the FY2001 budget submission to Congress. The funding for Custom's Cybersmuggling Center includes $2,400,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The center tracks child pornography trafficking and exploitation online.

The Customs Service was instructed to maintain staffing levels in Arizona. The Customs Service was directed to report on reducing wait times at Southwest border ports of entry and improving contraband detection. Allegations of discriminatory practices towards African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans led to a request for a report on personal search and detention procedures. Assessment of infrastructure at international ports of entry was also required. The General Services Administration, in collaboration with the Customs Service, will assess infrastructure at international ports and report to appropriations committees within 9 months. The act allocates $725,000 for a Northern Plains agricultural economics program to analyze U.S./Canada trade issues.

The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government appropriations bill funds all offices in the Executive Office of the President (EOP), except for three offices. The Federal Drug Control Programs account within EOP is for transfer to federal and state entities for drug control programs. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) distributes the funds.

It works with executive branch agencies to uphold ethical standards and ensure impartiality and integrity in government operations. Funding for the office increased by 7.3% in FY2000 to $9,114,000.

The agency's FY 1999 appropriation was $13,478,212,000 with emergency funding of $2,428,000 for Y2K conversion.

The Office of Special Counsel investigates federal employee allegations and enforces the Hatch Act. The act also permits the use of executive branch agency funds for child care services for low-income federal employees. The Senate added a title to the bill (Amendment No. 1197) establishing new requirements for federal agency child care facilities for employees. The provision mandates compliance with state or local licensing standards within six months and accreditation entity standards within three years. Regulations would be set for health and safety standards by the Administrator of General Services. Legislative agency facilities must meet accreditation entity standards within one year of enactment. The bill mandates compliance with state or local licensing standards and accreditation entity standards for federal agency child care facilities. Legislative and judicial branch facilities must also meet accreditation standards within specific timeframes. Executive branch agencies can use funds for childcare and interagency coordination is authorized. The Senate passed H.R. 2490 with provisions for executive branch agencies to use funds for child care services for low-income federal employees. However, in conference, Title VII of the bill was deleted, removing some federal child care provisions originally proposed. The conference report on H.R. 2490 includes provisions for using agency funds for childcare services for low-income federal employees. It also includes a pay increase for the President to $400,000 per annum starting January 20, 2001. This increase does not benefit President Clinton due to constitutional restrictions on changing a President's pay during their term. The President must pay federal income tax on his salary, with an official expense allowance of $50,000 that is not subject to income tax. Under the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, federal officials are to receive an annual pay adjustment based on private sector wages. The rate of pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2000 was determined to be 3.9%. The pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2000 will be 3.4%, authorized through the FY2000 appropriations bill. Congress has historically denied annual adjustments, except in January 1998, through the Treasury appropriations bill. Federal judges' salary adjustments require specific authorization from Congress. The FY2000 appropriations bill authorizes a 4.8% pay adjustment for federal employees under the General Schedule, with 3.8% as the national base pay adjustment and 1% for locality-based payments. The President did not present an alternative plan, so the rates are expected to go into effect as stated in the bill. The conference report does not specify the distribution of the allocated amount, allowing the President to exercise discretion. The President has discretion to distribute allocated funds for locality-based payments among pay localities. Both House and Senate versions of the Treasury bill assumed a 4.4% federal civilian pay increase in January 2000. The Senate committee had to reduce budget authority and outlays to stay within allocations, denying requests for additional funding. The committee denied requests for additional funding to cover the remaining months of the 1999 statutory annual pay adjustment, except for employees with administratively determined salaries. President Clinton proposed a 4.4% pay adjustment for federal employees in his FY 2000 budget, including locality pay adjustments. Legislation passed for a 4.8% military pay adjustment, with calls for parity between military and civilian personnel pay adjustments. The House-passed Treasury bill includes a Sense of the Congress language for parity between military and civilian personnel pay adjustments. Blue-collar employees under the Federal Wage System have their pay adjustments limited by a formula based on GS adjustments. The Senior Executive Service and other pay systems will have caps raised on their salaries, with Executive Schedule rates increasing by 3.4% in January. The President administratively sets SES rates, with a maximum payment of $25,000 for voluntary separation incentives. Section 651 allows voluntary early retirement for federal employees, subject to OPM approval. The Administration requested $27,997,054,000 for this appropriation, compared to $27,972,418,000 enacted in FY2000 under P.L.106-58. The House and Senate data for FY1999 enacted differ, with the House showing $27,922,712,000 and the Senate showing $27,915,604,000 in budget authority. Both approved FY2000 levels represent an increase over FY1999. The House recommended $28,095,811,000 while the Senate reported $27,737,971,000 in funding.
