    "content": "Many problems in deep learning have been solved, but Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) remains a challenge in machine learning. A new approach using network reparameterization decouples feature extraction and classification in deep models for UCC, ensuring strong discriminability and adaptability. Experiments show that network reparameterization achieves state-of-the-art performance in Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) for zero-shot and few-shot learning. Deep learning's success in tasks like visual recognition, object detection, and machine translation is fueled by labeled data, but UCC poses a challenge due to limited annotated data. Various approaches, including zero-shot learning (ZSL) and few-shot learning (FSL), have been proposed to address UCC. Previous approaches to Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) for few-shot learning often involve training deep classification models with state-of-the-art techniques. However, these models struggle to adapt to new classes with limited supervision due to their high number of parameters. Episode-based training methods are also used, but they limit the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The training strategy for Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) in few-shot learning limits the model's feature extraction capability by not fully utilizing the diversity of all classes in the dataset. To address this, a proposal is made to reparametrize the network's learnable weights to enhance feature extraction and classification adaptability. Our method decouples the feature extraction and classification modules of a deep model for Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) in few-shot learning. It involves training a discriminative feature extractor through multi-class classification and a classification weight generator using a light deep neural network. This approach, adaptable to both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL), achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of zero-shot learning (ZSL) in Unseen Class Categorization (UCC) due to the hubness problem in high-dimensional embedding spaces. Some approaches project visual features into a lower-dimensional semantic space to mitigate this issue. Some methods project visual and semantic features into a common space to address the hubness problem in zero-shot learning. One recent approach chooses the visual space as the embedding space and learns a mapping from semantic to visual space, benefiting from data diversity. However, it focuses only on mapping semantic descriptions to visual samples, neglecting separation information. Our method bridges the semantic space and visual space by formulating a visual feature classification problem conditioned on semantic features. A deep neural network generates classification weights for visual features based on semantic features, ensuring both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This approach improves the mapping for Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to recognize unseen classes with limited labeled samples. The curr_chunk discusses deep metric learning through deep embedding models and various approaches like META-LSTM, MAML, Meta-SGD, and others that aim to optimize classifiers for new few-shot tasks. These methods use episode-based training but may compromise discriminative feature extraction. The curr_chunk discusses a new approach to few-shot learning that focuses on generating classification weights directly from feature embeddings of support images, bridging information across different domains. This method is more powerful and flexible, applicable for both zero-shot learning and few-shot learning tasks. The proposed framework addresses both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) by decoupling the feature extraction network from the classification weights. This approach allows for easier adaptation to novel classes with limited supervision information. The framework decouples the feature extraction network from the classification weights, allowing for easier adaptation to novel classes with limited supervision information. The classification weight W is generated by a separate network g \u03c6 trained in an episode-based fashion, while the main network f \u03b8 is trained as a standard multiclass classification task. This approach aims to generate more discriminative feature representations for images of unseen classes. The network reparameterization strategy allows for a powerful and flexible UCC model by generating generic classification weights using cosine similarity based cross entropy loss. This technique improves generalization and classification accuracy in deep neural networks. The technique of training the weight generator g \u03c6 for classification involves calculating the classification score of a sample using a learnable scalar s and classification weights generated by neural network g \u03c6. The loss function for a typical UCC task includes a hyper-parameter \u03bb for regularization. For ZSL, semantic class attributes are provided as assistance for UCC tasks. Existing ZSL algorithms assume a class-invariant visual-attribute relationship learned from seen classes can be applied to unseen classes. BID30 suggests using the visual space as the embedding space to mitigate the \"hubness\" problem. Their objective function involves a feature extraction model f \u03b8 that outputs a representation vector f \u03b8 (x i ) using image x i. The method utilizes a feature extraction model to establish a visual-attribute relationship for unseen classes. It focuses on mapping attributes to the visual feature embedding space and finding the best class attribute through nearest neighbor searching. However, it neglects inter-class separation, which is crucial to avoid the hubness problem. To address this, the learning of visual-attribute relationship is reformulated. The learning of visual-attribute relationship is reformulated to address the hubness problem. A network is trained to classify visual features, ensuring intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The feature extraction module is decoupled from the classification weight module for efficient learning. The feature extraction module f \u03b8 is trained for discriminative feature representation in image classification. The classification weight module g \u03c6 is trained using episode-based training with new ZSL tasks for good performance in testing. Tasks consist of classes and attribute vectors, with g \u03c6 trained on batches of images and attributes. In testing, attributes of unseen classes are used for classification. In the generalized zero-shot learning (ZSL) setting, classification weights are generated using g \u03c6 to classify images of unseen classes. The method can be extended to few-shot learning (FSL) by replacing semantic attributes with feature embedding vectors. Training g \u03c6 involves sampling FSL tasks from labeled samples and using feature embeddings for classification weight generation. One distinct aspect of our method is decoupling the feature extraction and classifier modules in the deep classification model. The feature extraction module is trained on a multi-class classification task, while the classifier module generates classification weights for the classes. This approach is motivated by the effectiveness of simple classifiers like nearest neighbor. The effectiveness of simple classifiers like nearest neighbor is highlighted in the observation that using powerful feature extractors can outperform sophisticated Few-Shot Learning models. Existing FSL methods suppress obtaining a powerful feature extractor due to their episode-based training scheme. Our proposed method aims to address the dilemma faced by existing Few-Shot Learning algorithms by decoupling the network and training different components separately for improved discriminability and adaptability. The framework is evaluated on zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks using popular datasets like AwA1, AwA2, CUB, SUN, and aPY. The evaluation includes both conventional zero-shot learning and generalized zero-shot learning settings. The study evaluates a model for Few-Shot Learning on datasets like AwA1, AwA2, CUB, SUN, and aPY. It includes conventional ZSL and GZSL settings, using ResNet101 for feature extraction and a weight generation model with two FC+ReLU layers. The model is trained with Adam optimizer and hyper-parameters are adjusted for each dataset. Our model, implemented with PyTorch, outperforms DEM BID30 for all datasets, showing the benefit of considering interclass separability. In the GZSL setting, our method significantly outperforms all competitors, with gains of up to 30% in the AWA1 dataset. The advantage lies in our method's consideration of inter-class separation during training, resulting in good classification weights for seen classes. The training stage focuses on achieving good separation properties for classification weights of seen classes. These weights are then combined with semantic descriptions of unseen classes in the testing stage across various datasets, showing performance improvements over existing methods. The training stage aims to achieve good separation properties for classification weights of seen classes. This reduces the risk of candidates being selected as nearest neighbors for many query images. Few-shot classification is evaluated on Mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing sets. Mini-ImageNet has 60,000 images from 100 classes, while CUB has 11,788 images from 200 bird categories. The CUB dataset consists of 11,788 bird images from 200 categories. Images are resized to 224x224 for feature extraction. Evaluation includes 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot classification tasks. ResNet18 is used as the feature extraction model. Training follows standard classification learning pipeline using Adam optimizer. The experimental datasets were trained using Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10^-3, decaying by half every 10 epochs. The model was trained for 100 epochs with two FC+ReLU layers for g \u03c6. The intermediate hidden layer dimension was set to 512. Training g \u03c6 used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-5 and hyper-parameters \u03bb = 10^-5. The model was trained with 60000 randomly sampled FSL tasks, each consisting of 5 classes with support and query samples. Results showed that the baseline method \"ResNet18 + NN\" outperformed most FSL algorithms. The proposed weight generation strategy for Few-Shot Learning (FSL) outperforms existing methods in both 1-shot and 5-shot evaluation settings on two datasets. The accuracy of feeding the classifier of PROTO NET with features obtained by ResNet18 is much higher than training PROTO NET end to end with ResNet18 as the base model. This highlights the advantage of the episode-based training scheme and the benefit of the weight generation strategy for FSL. The proposed weight generation strategy for Few-Shot Learning (FSL) outperforms existing methods in the GZSL setting due to good separation property of classification weights from attributes of seen classes, reducing the hubness problem. Visualizing weight vectors using t-SNE shows more even distribution compared to DEM. Our method for unseen class categorization with limited information provides a flexible framework using a powerful feature extractor and a flexible classifier. By decoupling the feature extraction module and the classification module, we address the hubness problem. The classification weight vector is generated from exemplar information of unseen classes, trained in an episode-by-episode fashion for new tasks. Our framework for zero-shot learning (ZSL) and few-shot learning (FSL) improves results by incorporating inter-class separation information for ZSL and a flexible scheme for FSL, enabling powerful feature extraction and weight generation models."
