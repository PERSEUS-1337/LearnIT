The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may conduct a mobility demonstration program for public housing agencies to administer housing choice voucher assistance in a way that encourages families to move to lower-poverty areas and increase access to opportunity areas. Public housing agencies meeting certain requirements may participate in the program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may conduct a mobility demonstration program for public housing agencies to administer housing choice voucher assistance in a way that encourages families to move to lower-poverty areas and increase access to opportunity areas. Public housing agencies meeting specific criteria, such as having a high-performing Family Self-Sufficiency program, may participate in the program. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for public housing agencies to participate in a mobility demonstration program. This includes planned consortia serving a single region, small agencies, and other agencies deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Participating agencies may be required to use randomized selection for families. The Secretary will require participating agencies to use a randomized selection process to choose families eligible for mobility assistance. Public housing agencies must submit a Regional Housing Mobility Plan identifying participating agencies, the number of vouchers available, and entities involved in the plan. The Plan must include identifying waivers, actions for successful transition to opportunity areas, criteria for identifying opportunity areas, and priorities for families with young children. The demonstration program under this section allows public housing agencies to use administrative fees and funding from private entities to provide mobility-related services, including counseling, landlord outreach, and security deposits. Public housing agencies in the demonstration program can use housing assistance funds for security deposits to help families lease units in designated opportunity areas. The Secretary may waive certain provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to allow agencies to implement Regional Housing Mobility Plans. The Secretary may provide additional authority for public housing agencies in a selected region to form a consortium with a single housing choice voucher funding contract or enter into a partial consortium to operate the Regional Housing Mobility Plan. Waivers or alternative requirements shall not take effect before a 10-day period from publication. The Secretary may implement the demonstration program by notice and evaluate its effectiveness after 5 years. Interim findings will be disseminated, and promising strategies will be reported to Congress for potential funding. The Secretary may implement a demonstration program to test strategies in public housing agencies and housing markets. Congress will be notified of the funds needed for expansion. Passed the House of Representatives on July 10, 2018. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
