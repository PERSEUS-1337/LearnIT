    "content": "Deficit reduction influenced the Agricultural Act of 2014 (2014 farm bill) throughout its legislative development, with questions about funding and sequestration impacting policies. The farm bill, updated every five years, authorizes programs in mandatory and discretionary spending categories. Mandatory programs operate as entitlements funded through multi-year budget estimates, while discretionary programs are subject to appropriations. The 2014 farm bill was enacted on February 7, 2014, following the expiration of the 2008 farm bill in 2012. The 2014 farm bill was developed over two years, with budget concerns delaying its passage. The House and Senate passed separate bills for farm programs and food stamps, with deficit reduction proposals aiming to reduce the bill by $10 billion to $179 billion. The reduction plans proposed cutting the farm bill by $10 billion to $179 billion. The enacted reduction was $16.6 billion over 10 years, unofficially referred to as $23 billion due to sequestration. The total cost of mandatory programs at enactment of the 2014 farm bill was estimated at $489 billion over the next five years. SNAP accounted for about 80% of the projected net outlays, while farm commodity support, crop insurance, and USDA conservation programs accounted for a combined 19%. Other farm bill titles were expected to account for about 1% of all mandatory program costs. The 2014 farm bill reduces projected spending and the deficit by $5.3 billion over five years compared to the 2008 farm bill baseline. Federal spending on agriculture is about $145 billion in FY2014, with farm bill programs being a subset of that amount. Understanding budget terminology and federal spending methods is crucial when analyzing farm bill spending. The FY2014 Agriculture appropriation of $145 billion includes $125 billion for mandatory programs authorized inside and outside the farm bill, with $21 billion for discretionary programs under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The farm bill authorizes discretionary appropriations for various programs, but funding is not provided until an appropriation is made. Discretionary funds are used for agency operations, including programs like WIC, CSFP, FDA, agricultural research, rural development, food aid programs, agricultural credit, and more. Mandatory spending for Agriculture programs is controlled by authorizing legislation. Mandatory spending for Agriculture programs, controlled by authorizing legislation, includes SNAP, CCC, crop insurance, and Section 32 programming. Private insurance companies, Section 32 programming funded by customs receipts, and child nutrition programs for meals and snacks in institutional settings are included in Agriculture appropriations. Differences with the farm bill mainly involve nutrition programs and the Food and Drug Administration. Child nutrition programs and WIC are not part of the farm bill due to jurisdiction, while the FDA is not under the House or Senate Agriculture Committee. The farm bill focuses on mandatory spending allocation, creating budget authority based on CBO baseline projections. Funding for new legislation is determined by current laws' cost projections and budget assumptions. The CBO baseline projections for mandatory spending and budget scores of proposed bills determine the mandatory budget for the farm bill. The baseline is an estimate of future federal spending on mandatory programs under current law, updated periodically by CBO to reflect economic changes. The CBO baseline projections for mandatory spending provide a benchmark for assessing changes from proposed legislation. Changes in projected costs do not trigger budget enforcement mechanisms, and the impact of a bill is measured as a difference from the baseline. Increases or reductions in costs do not require offsets or create savings for other programs. Projected cost changes above the baseline may be subject to budget rules like PAYGO, while reductions below the baseline can provide savings for deficit reduction or other provisions. Programs with a continuing baseline are assumed to continue under current law, with funding available for reauthorization if needed. Mandatory funding in the last year of authorization is assumed to continue into the future. This allows for periodic reauthorization of programs like farm commodity programs without assuming funding will cease. Funding for programs may cease following zero-based budgeting. Some programs may not continue in the budget baseline beyond the end of a farm bill due to various reasons. Budget enforcement rules use a 10-year period to measure the future effect of proposed legislation, regardless of the length of authorization. The May 2013 CBO baseline for mandatory farm bill programs was $973 billion for the 10-year period FY2014-FY2023. This amount included $764 billion for domestic nutrition assistance programs, $84 billion for crop insurance, $59 billion for farm commodity price and income supports, and $62 billion for conservation. Less than 1% was allocated for international trade. The baseline for mandatory farm bill programs in the 10-year period FY2014-FY2023 was expected to spend about $100 billion per year through FY2016, declining to about $95 billion per year in 2023. The nutrition portion was expected to decrease, while conservation and crop insurance outlays were expected to increase. Table 2 provides data for each year FY2014-FY2018, the 5-year total, and the 10-year total, showing amounts for individual programs within each title. The baseline for expected outlays for some programs from the 2008 farm bill was not considered to have funding available for reauthorization beyond the end of the 2008 farm bill. This resulted in a $949 million decrease in the 10-year baseline for \"continuing\" farm bill programs. The alternative 10-year total was $972 billion, with the non-nutrition agricultural programs totaling $208 billion. Figure 5 displays the baselines for individual programs within the $208 billion subtotal. In the farm commodity programs, \"direct payments\" were the primary program with a mandatory funding baseline, but became politically vulnerable in a high farm-income environment. Other programs like \"counter-cyclical payments\" had reduced baseline due to high market prices. Crop insurance was considered the most important component of the farm safety net, with premium subsidies being the largest cost. Total estimated costs of the conservation programs were significant. Total estimated costs of conservation programs were about as large as estimated farm commodity spending. The largest three conservation programs had 93% of total conservation baseline, with other farm bill titles also having significant funding. The trade title had $3.4 billion, the horticulture and organic agriculture title had $1.1 billion, the miscellaneous title had $1.4 billion, and the energy title had $0.2 billion for continuing programs. The Feedstock Flexibility program converts sugar to ethanol. Forestry, research, and rural development titles were combined under \"Other\" with no continuing programs. Sequestration enforces budget goals through spending reductions. Some farm bill programs are exempt from sequestration, including nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Some agricultural programs may be exempt from budget sequestration, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB ordered budget sequestration on March 1, 2013, with a 5.0% sequestration rate for non-defense discretionary spending and 5.1% for non-defense mandatory programs. Approximately $1.9 billion was sequestered in FY2013 from Agriculture and related agencies appropriations, with $1.2 billion from discretionary accounts and $700 million from mandatory accounts. The $23 billion discretionary agriculture budget authority was mostly subject to sequestration, along with $14 billion of the mandatory budget. Exemptions included SNAP, child nutrition, and crop insurance. User-fee funded accounts and trust funds were also affected. The sequestration effect on farm bill programs extended beyond FY2013, impacting program funding levels due to budget authority reductions. The sequestration reduction had a multiple year effect on the baseline, resulting in a $6.4 billion decrease over FY2014-FY2023. This reduction impacted the agriculture committees' ability to write the 2014 farm bill. Despite claims of greater deficit reduction in the enacted bill, the official CBO scores remain the standard. The 2014 farm bill underwent a lengthy development process over two years and was debated in the 112th and 113th Congresses. The Senate and House Agriculture Committees each reported bills in 2012, with the Senate passing S. 3240 and the House Agriculture Committee reporting H.R. 6083. In 2013, new bills were introduced in the House (H.R. 1947) and passed in the Senate (S. 954). The House separated food stamps from the farm bill for the first time in 40 years, resulting in two separate bills for farm programs (H.R. 2642) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, H.R. 3102). The two House bills were eventually recombined for final enactment. The 2014 farm bill underwent a lengthy development process over two years and was debated in the 112th and 113th Congresses. The two House bills were recombined for conference with the Senate and final enactment (H.R. 2642, H.Rept. 113-333). The budgetary impact of the 2014 farm bill is measured relative to what the 2008 farm bill would have spent, with 10-year totals for the baseline and scores being the focus during the debate. The May 2013 CBO baseline projected that the mandatory programs of the 2008 farm bill would have spent $973 billion over the next 10 years, with $764 billion for nutrition programs, primarily SNAP, and $208 billion for non-nutrition agriculture-related programs. The 2014 farm bill reduced projected spending and the deficit by $16.6 billion over 10 years. The House-passed proposal would have reduced spending by $51.9 billion over 10 years, while the Senate-passed proposal would have reduced spending by $17.9 billion over 10 years. The proposed bill (S. 954) aimed to reduce spending by $17.9 billion over 10 years, with potential additional savings if not for sequestration. The 2014 farm bill already reduced the deficit by $16.6 billion over 10 years, with some titles receiving more funding and others less to offset increased spending. Budgetary savings were seen in nutrition, farm commodity subsidies, and conservation titles, while additional funding was allocated to various agricultural sectors. The House and Senate bills proposed changes to various agricultural titles, with the House bill showing a net reduction of $51.8 billion over 10 years and the Senate bill showing a net reduction of $17.8 billion. The enacted 2014 farm bill increased outlays for eight titles by $9.8 billion and reduced budgets for three titles by $26.3 billion, resulting in a net reduction of $16.5 billion over 10 years. The House and Senate bills proposed budget reductions totaling $26.3 billion over 10 years. The enacted bill settled on an $8.0 billion reduction in the nutrition title. The most significant budget difference between the House and Senate bills was the proposed reduction for the nutrition title. The enacted bill settled on an $8.5 billion reduction (-4.1%) in the agriculture-related subset of the bill, smaller than either the House or Senate proposal. Reductions in the farm safety net were not as large as in the House or Senate proposals. Increases in other titles of the bill, primarily in the research and horticulture titles, were larger than in either the House or Senate proposals. The scope of the miscellaneous title was larger and more costly. The House or Senate proposals had a larger and more costly scope in the miscellaneous title. The combined reduction for crop insurance and farm commodity programs was $12.4 billion in the Senate bill and $9.8 billion in the House bill. Both bills recognized savings of nearly $47 billion by repealing direct payments and creating new counter cyclical-type payment programs. The House and Senate bills differed in their proposed funding for crop insurance and farm commodity programs. The House bill would have spent $2.7 billion more than the Senate bill on the safety net, with $3.9 billion more allocated for crop insurance. The enacted 2014 farm bill reduced the farm safety net baseline by $8.6 billion over 10 years, with a smaller net reduction compared to the House and Senate proposals. The enacted 2014 farm bill reduced the farm safety net baseline by $8.6 billion over 10 years, with a smaller net reduction compared to the House or Senate proposals. The combined farm safety net was projected to cost $134.3 billion over 10 years, with a $16.5 billion deficit reduction in the new law. The reduction in the conservation title approximately offsets the increases in spending for other programs. The enacted 2014 farm bill reduced the conservation baseline by $4.0 billion over 10 years. Research programs receive $1.145 billion more than their baseline, while the miscellaneous title costs an additional $0.953 billion. Energy, horticulture, rural development, trade, and forestry also receive increased funding. The House bill would have saved $1.3 billion more than the Senate bill in Title II. The farm bill score for each of the 10 years is shown in Figure 7, with net budgetary savings starting in FY2015. Savings from the commodity title begin in FY2015 due to agricultural disaster payments in FY2014 and the repeal of direct payments in FY2015. Most payments for the new farm commodity program occur after the marketing year, delaying the budgetary effect for Title I in FY2015. The budgetary effect for Title I in FY2015 is significant due to the repeal of direct payments, with changes to crop insurance and conservation gradually increasing over time. The House and Senate bills show differences in new farm program payments, with the House bill reducing outlays in FY2020 and deferring payments until FY2021. The Congressional Budget Office estimated these changes. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the farm bill would cost $489 billion over the next five years, with $391 billion for nutrition, $65 billion for the farm safety net, $28 billion for conservation, and $5 billion for other titles. Over 10 years, the bill is expected to spend $956 billion, with $756 billion for nutrition and $200 billion for agriculture. Figure 8 illustrates the 10-year amount relative to the May 2013 baseline. The House bill's $51.9 billion reduction over 10 years would have decreased expected outlays to $921 billion, while the Senate bill's reduction of $17.9 billion would have reduced outlays to $955 billion. The Agricultural Act of 2014 reduced outlays by $16.6 billion to $956 billion. CBO updates the baseline projection annually based on changes in economic conditions. The nutrition title of the farm bill has seen an increase in its share of the budget over time, from 67% in the 2008 bill to 79% in the 2014 bill. This growth does not mean that nutrition programs have grown at the expense of agricultural programs. Legislative changes in the farm bill have led to significant shifts in budgetary expectations. For example, the 2014 farm bill resulted in $16 billion in 10-year savings, but 10-year expected costs increased by $352 billion. Changes in nutrition, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs did not align with changes in outlays for those titles. Analysis of SNAP and farm safety net supports from the 2008 to 2014 farm bill shows a separate way of analyzing costs. The recession led to increased food assistance needs, impacting nutrition program outlays. Projected nutrition program outlays increased due to rising food assistance needs triggered by the automatic safety net, leading to a 10.9% annual rise in SNAP outlays from the 2008 to 2014 farm bill. The $350 billion increase in expected 10-year outlays was mainly due to changing economic expectations. Additionally, crop insurance outlays also rose by 11.3% annually, driven by higher agricultural market prices. The $43 billion increase in expected 10-year crop insurance outlays is mainly due to changing economic expectations, while farm commodity program outlays decreased as market prices rose. The 2014 farm bill eliminated direct payments, leading to a $41 billion reduction in expected 10-year outlays. The farm safety net subtotal of crop insurance and farm commodity programs remained nearly constant from the 2008 farm bill to the 2014 farm bill, with expected 10-year outlays at $133 billion in 2008 and $134 billion in 2014. Despite reductions in Title I programs and increases in crop insurance, overall farm safety net spending slightly increased by +0.2% per year. Other titles in the 2014 farm bill are expected to spend more than in the 2008 farm bill, with the research title showing the greatest growth. Some programs have assumed future funding, while newer programs have not. The 2014 farm bill did not provide assured funding for 37 programs that had mandatory funding in the 2008 farm bill, requiring $9 billion to $14 billion in offsets. The one-year extension of the 2008 farm bill did not offer additional mandatory funding for these programs, instead allowing for discretionary funding in FY2013, which was not provided. The 2014 farm bill only provides funding for 29 of these programs. The 2014 farm bill provides new mandatory funding totaling $6.2 billion over five years for 29 programs, with some receiving permanent baseline funding. This is more funding than proposed in both the House and Senate bills. Some programs may face future concerns regarding funding in the second five-year period. The 2014 farm bill provides new mandatory funding totaling $6.2 billion over five years for 29 programs, with some receiving permanent baseline funding. Scores for the second five-year period of the budget horizon reveal which programs would receive baseline funding beyond the expiration of the 2014 farm bill in FY2018. Some programs, such as research programs and rural development programs, do not have a baseline beyond FY2018. The farm commodity programs could become more expensive if outdated \"permanent law\" provisions were resurrected. The 1938 and 1949 farm bills, as amended, are still in statute but have been suspended by modern farm bills. Reverting to permanent law could result in higher subsidy outlays than the 2013 baseline. Various deficit reduction proposals from 2010 to 2013 included agricultural programs, potentially impacting farm bill savings. The $24 billion in savings in S. 954 is consistent with previous proposals and savings suggested by the House and Senate Agriculture committees. The reduction in S. 954 from the nutrition title is similar to the Super Committee proposal, with $13 billion reduction from commodity programs. The House bill had $35.1 billion of savings, consistent with reconciliation instructions in the FY2013 House budget resolution. The primary difference was that reconciliation savings were from nutrition programs, while farm bill proposals had savings from farm commodity programs and crop insurance. In 2013, H.R. 1947 proposed significant reductions in nutrition programs, with subsequent bills increasing the proposed reductions even further. The House proposals aimed to reduce spending by billions of dollars, moving away from the Senate's budget effect. The CBO cost estimates also included projections for discretionary appropriations needed for the farm bill proposals. The bill proposals for farm programs require discretionary appropriations, with estimated amounts needed over a five-year period. The estimates for S. 954 and H.R. 1947 are $37.6 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. No estimate was provided for the conference agreement. These amounts include reauthorizing existing programs and would be subject to annual decisions by budget and appropriations committees. The House Farm Bill (H.R. 2642, combined with H.R. 3102) presents detailed year-by-year scores of provisions, with a cumulative limit on new farm program payments reducing outlays in FY2020. The bill requires discretionary appropriations over a five-year period, with estimated amounts for S. 954 and H.R. 1947 at $37.6 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. No estimate was provided for the conference agreement. The House bill reduced outlays in FY2020 by deferring direct payments until FY2021, impacting the commodity title scores. The Senate Farm Bill (S. 954) detailed year-by-year scores and deficit reduction proposals were made from 2010-2013. From 2010-2013, government-wide deficit reduction proposals included cuts to agriculture or farm bill spending, ranging from $10 billion to $179 billion. These proposals recommended reductions to farm commodity programs, crop insurance, export promotion, and conservation, with some also suggesting cuts to nutrition programs. The visibility of agriculture and nutrition spending for deficit reduction was a common theme in these proposals. The visibility of agriculture and nutrition spending for deficit reduction was a common theme in government-wide proposals from 2010-2013, which included cuts to various programs."
