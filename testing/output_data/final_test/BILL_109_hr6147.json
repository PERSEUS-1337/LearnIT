    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gestational Diabetes Act of 2006\" or the \"GEDI Act\". Congress finds that gestational diabetes is increasing among pregnant women in the US, with unknown causes but risk factors including genetics, excess weight, ethnicity, and age. There is disagreement among physicians on treatment effectiveness, and it can lead to preeclampsia and increase the risk in subsequent pregnancies. Infants of women with gestational diabetes may have increased birth weight and face risks during birth. They are also at risk for low blood sugar, jaundice, obesity, birth trauma, and developing type 2 diabetes later in life. About 15% of infertility cases are linked to weight disorders, particularly being overweight or obese, which can affect fertility and increase morbidity for both mother and child. Improved nutrition and healthcare before and during pregnancy can significantly reduce these risks. Obesity in pregnant women can lead to gestational diabetes, induction, and primary caesarean section. About 10% of obese pregnant women develop gestational diabetes. Title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act addresses gestational diabetes, focusing on understanding and monitoring gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a Research Advisory Committee, with membership including representatives from various federal agencies such as the CDC, NIH, and others. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with the Research Advisory Committee, will develop a gestational diabetes research project to improve surveillance data and public health research. This project will focus on consistent standards for measuring gestational diabetes, efficient data collection systems in each State, and collaboration with national and state health departments. The curr_chunk discusses improving surveillance of gestational diabetes through standard birth certificate data, reporting procedures to the CDC, post-natal tracking, variations in diabetes distribution, and factors influencing risks for gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. The Research Advisory Committee will meet annually to assess the progress of the gestational diabetes research project and update the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will generate a report on the prevalence of gestational diabetes and share it with relevant agencies. Demonstration grants are provided to lower the rate of gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants for demonstration projects to reduce gestational diabetes and obesity among young women. Scientific findings support the prevention of type 2 diabetes for older adults and the establishment of diabetes risk during earlier ages. Women can demonstrate their diabetes risk through acquiring gestational diabetes. The text chunk discusses the risks of gestational diabetes during pregnancy, including the increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes for both the mother and her children. Eligible entities seeking grants must submit an application to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlining plans to reduce gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy or track women post-natally. The grant funds are used for demonstration projects aimed at preventing gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. This includes expanding health promotion education, collecting surveillance data, and implementing interventions based on the data. Implementing programs and interventions based on surveillance data, training healthcare providers to promote risk assessment, quality care, and self-management for gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. Reports required from CDC and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the results of studies conducted through grants awarded under this section. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the findings of the report received. An eligible entity is defined as a nonprofit organization or State health agency. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2007, with additional funding for 2008-2011. \"Research expansion of gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy is authorized with $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and additional funding for 2008-2011.\" The Directors of CDC and NIH, with collaboration from NIDDK, will conduct research on gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. This includes investigating therapies, developing new clinical trial approaches, and enrolling diverse populations for trials. The authorization of appropriations for research on gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy includes developing improved diagnostics, conducting public health research, and enrolling diverse populations for trials. $8,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2007, with additional funding for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will promote screening for gestational diabetes in state-based programs to reduce its incidence and related complications."
