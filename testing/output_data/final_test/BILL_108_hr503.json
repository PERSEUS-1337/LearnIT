The credit amount is $3 per barrel of qualified crude oil production and 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production, with reductions as oil and gas prices increase. The tax credit amount for producing oil and gas from marginal wells is determined based on the excess of the applicable reference price over $15 ($1.67 for qualified natural gas production) and $3 ($0.33 for qualified natural gas production). The reference price is for the calendar year preceding the taxable year, and dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation after 2003.
