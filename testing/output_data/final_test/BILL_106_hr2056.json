    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lebanon Independence Restoration Act of 1999\". It includes findings. The Congress finds that Lebanon has a rich history, has been a free nation, and has a strong relationship with the United States. Lebanon has faced foreign occupations, including an Israeli force controlling a security zone in the country. Lebanon has a security zone bordering Israel, with Syrian troops and various armed groups controlling the rest of the country. Israel offered to withdraw from the security zone in 1998, while Syria influences Lebanon's government without recognizing its independence. Lebanese factions signed a peace settlement in 1989 to end the civil war. The Taif Accord in 1992 called for Syrian forces to withdraw from Lebanon, but Syria has refused to redeploy as agreed. Syrian dominance in Lebanese politics has prevented the Lebanese government from pushing for a withdrawal. Syria also maintains a strong intelligence presence in Lebanon, turning it into a satellite state against the will of the Lebanese people. Syrian domination in Lebanon has hindered the country's development, prevented direct contacts with Israel, and led to human rights abuses. Syrian control has influenced election results, caused disappearances of Lebanese citizens, restricted media freedom, and failed to address issues like drug trafficking and terrorism. Syrian control in Lebanon has prevented the Lebanese Army from entering southern Lebanon, allowing terrorist groups supported by Syria and Iran to use the region as a staging area for military provocations against Israel. The United States Congress is concerned about the potential for conflict between Israel and Syria, especially in southern Lebanon, due to Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems. The United States Congress has urged Syria to withdraw its military forces from Lebanon to restore the country's independence and democracy. Lebanon's freedom and sovereignty are crucial for promoting peace in the Middle East. Elections in Lebanon are hindered by the presence of foreign military, security forces, and terrorist groups. The statement of policy in Lebanon addresses the hindrance of elections by foreign military, security forces, and terrorist groups. The Congress calls for the immediate withdrawal of all Syrian, Palestinian, and other terrorist forces from Lebanon, followed by the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces. After restoring a democratic government in Lebanon, the Lebanese Army should be deployed to southern Lebanon to maintain stability, disbanding all armed groups except the national armed forces. Additionally, the safety of all members of the South Lebanon Army and their families must be ensured by the Government of Lebanon. The Congress emphasizes the need for the full withdrawal of Syrian military forces from Lebanon in any peace agreement with Israel. Additionally, nondiscriminatory treatment for imports from Syria and Lebanon will be withdrawn. Nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) will not apply to goods from Syria or Lebanon entering the US customs territory after a certain date. The President can restore this treatment for goods from Lebanon once Syrian forces are completely withdrawn from Lebanon and the Lebanese government is democratically elected. The President can restore most-favored-nation treatment for goods from Lebanon once Syrian forces are completely withdrawn from Lebanon and the Lebanese government is democratically elected. Goods from Syria entering the US customs territory will not receive this treatment until Syria is certified to have been freely elected and wholly democratic. PROHIBITION ON ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO SYRIA AND LEBANON. Prohibition on economic assistance to Syria and Lebanon, except if specific conditions are met for Lebanon and Syria regarding military withdrawal and democratic elections. The term \"economic assistance\" refers to aid provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or other related laws. SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON. Prohibition on military assistance to the Government of Lebanon unless Syrian forces are withdrawn and Lebanon is democratic. Congress suggests redirecting prohibited assistance to humanitarian and democracy-building efforts in Lebanon. The Prohibition on military assistance to the Government of Lebanon includes any form of military cooperation with Lebanon. SEC. 8. Requirement to oppose loans and other assistance to Syria and Lebanon by international financial institutions. Beginning 15 days after the enactment of this Act, the President must direct the US representative in international financial institutions to oppose any loans or assistance for Syria or Lebanon. An exception is made for Lebanon if Syrian forces are withdrawn and Lebanon is democratically elected, and for Syria after certain conditions are met. After certain conditions are met, the President must certify to Congress that Syria is freely elected and democratic. SEC. 9. ANNUAL REPORTS. The Secretary of State is required to include in the annual human rights report a detailed assessment of Syrian influence in the Government of Lebanon, human rights abuses linked to Syrian influence, the role of Syrian intelligence services, the presence of Syrian military and intelligence forces in Lebanon, and the progress of Lebanon in disarming terrorist groups. The Department of State is tasked with detailing Syrian influence in Lebanon, human rights abuses, Syrian military presence, and progress in disarming terrorist groups. This includes steps taken to withdraw Syrian forces and proxies from Lebanon. SEC. 10. DEFINITION. The term ``Syrian military, security, and intelligence forces and their proxies'' includes Syrian Army regulars, paramilitary forces, and plain clothes intelligence and security officials."
