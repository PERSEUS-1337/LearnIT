    "content": "The procurement of C-17 airlift aircraft began in FY1988, with a total of 223 acquired by FY2010. The proposed FY2011 defense budget aimed to halt C-17 procurement, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warning of a potential presidential veto if Congress added funds for more. The Administration believes enough C-17s have been acquired to meet future needs, while supporters argue for additional procurement in FY2011. A study is ongoing to assess future airlift capability requirements. The C-17, also known as the Globemaster III, is a key airlift aircraft for the Air Force, capable of transporting equipment, supplies, and personnel over long distances. Congress is debating whether to procure additional C-17s and pass legislation related to the airlift aircraft force structure, which could impact DOD capabilities and funding requirements. The C-17 complements the Air Force's other airlift aircraft, such as the C-5 Galaxy and C-130 Hercules, in both strategic and tactical airlift roles. The C-17 is a key airlift aircraft for the Air Force, capable of carrying large cargo items like M-1 tanks. It has a shorter unrefueled range than the C-5 but can deploy cargo and personnel into more austere airfields. The C-17 program began in the early 1980s, with procurement starting in FY1988. The C-17 program began in the early 1980s, with procurement starting in FY1988. The C-17 achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in January 1995, with 12 aircraft delivered to a squadron. A full-rate production contract was awarded in February 1996. The program faced development challenges and cost growth initially, leading to congressional oversight. C-17s were procured under multiyear procurement arrangements in FY1997-FY2003 and FY2003-FY2007. Boeing Airlift and Tankers is the prime contractor for the C-17, employing about 30,000 people in 43 states. As of July 2009, 190 C-17s had been delivered to the Air Force. As of July 2009, 190 C-17s had been delivered to the Air Force, with the 213th scheduled for delivery in March 2011. The production line will start shutting down as the final aircraft moves through. Other countries like the UK, Canada, Australia, Qatar, and a NATO consortium have acquired C-17s. India was in negotiations to buy 10 C-17s. The proposed FY2011 defense budget did not request funding for further C-17 procurement. The proposed FY2011 defense budget did not request funding for additional C-17 procurement. Instead, $153.3 million was requested to shut down the C-17 production line. The budget also included $14.3 million for C-17 program procurement, focusing on support equipment, spares, data, and training. The Air Force operates 111 C-5s, with decisions on C-17 procurement influenced by the retention and modernization of C-5s. The C-5 modernization effort, led by Lockheed Martin, aims to enhance operational capability, safety, and reliability. The first phase, C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), began in 1999, with 55 C-5s modified by July 2009. The second phase, C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP), started in 2000, including new engine installations. AMP modifications for 88 C-5s are scheduled for completion in 2012. The C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) began in 2000, involving new engine installations and modifications to over 70 subsystems. RERP modifications were initially planned for all 111 C-5s but were limited to 52 due to cost growth in 2007. The first RERP-modified C-5 flew in June 2006, with test and evaluation scheduled for completion by April 2010. Initial operational capability of RERP-modified C-5s is set for June 2013. The C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) began in 2000, involving new engine installations and modifications to over 70 subsystems. The Air Force plans to fully modernize 52 C-5s by 2015, with the first C-5A completing modification in February 2009. The RERP program replaces the propulsion system and enhances the reliability of various systems and components. The Government Accountability Office reported cost increases leading to a reduction in the number of C-5s to be modernized. The costs to modernize C-5 aircraft have not been fully identified and are likely to increase. The Air Force estimates it will spend $9.1 billion, but costs may be underestimated due to lack of risk analysis. The reliability enhancement and reengining program is underfunded by almost $300 million, and costs may escalate if the program schedule is stretched to stay within funding targets. The Air Force has not fully priced or budgeted for a new C-5 upgrade program. The Air Force has not fully priced or budgeted for a new C-5 upgrade program planned for fiscal year 2010 to address avionics deficiencies and add new capabilities. Future costs may be reduced if older C-5s are retired and planned modifications are skipped. DOD's airlift capability requirements have evolved since 2005, with a recommendation for a strategic airlift force structure of 292 aircraft. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) set a goal of maintaining 292 strategic airlifters, including 180 C-17s and 112 fully modernized C-5s. Unlike past studies, the Mobility Requirements Study 2005 (MRS-05) did not recommend a specific airlift capacity in MTM/D. Some expected a new requirement close to 60 MTM/D in the Mobility Capabilities Study 2005 (MCS-05), but concerns about affordability may have kept it at 54.5 MTM/D. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the methodology used for MCS-05 in September 2005. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the methodology used for MCS-05 in September 2005. In September 2006, as MCS-05 was nearing completion, a more detailed GAO criticism followed. Other observers criticized MCS-05 for not adequately addressing DOD intra-theater airlift needs and focusing on near-term capabilities rather than taking a longer view. The Air Force's Air Mobility Command was reported to be studying DOD airlift needs in September 2006, possibly indicating acknowledgment of flaws in MCS-05. Section 1034 of the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act required DOD to submit a report to Congress on airlift requirements. The Defense Authorization Act required DOD to submit a report to Congress defining airlift requirements in terms of million-ton-miles per day. The planned mix of C-17s and C-5s evolved between December 2005 and June 2009 due to various events. Section 1046 of the FY2008 defense authorization act required the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on alternatives for the proper size and mix of fixed-wing intratheater and intertheater airlift assets. The Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) conducted a study in February 2009 to assess fixed-wing intratheater and intertheater airlift assets for fiscal years 2012, 2018, and 2024. The study evaluated airlift requirements based on Mobility Capabilities Study (MCS) benchmarks and found that the currently programmed fleet meets the benchmark requirements for moderate acceptable risk. The study evaluated different computer models for deliveries, with varying results. Programmatic alternatives and their life-cycle costs were considered, comparing 36 alternative fleet mixes and sizes with the currently programmed fleet. Results showed the relative capabilities of alternative fleets in meeting moderate risk delivery demands for cargo. Similar analyses were done for intratheater airlift fleets. The study identified cost-effective ways to enhance capability without acquiring more strategic airlifters. This includes utilizing C-5s at Emergency Wartime Planning levels, transporting oversize cargo with CRAF, maximizing host nation airlifters, and using tankers for cargo transport in theater. These strategies could lead to a smaller strategic fleet meeting delivery requirements. The analysis suggests an upper limit of 316 strategic airlifters needed, with potential for additional capability by converting C-5s to C-5Ms. This alternative has comparable costs to the current plan, with savings in operating costs over time. Retiring some C-5As could save costs without impacting capability, especially in high tempo non-MCO operations like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. The analysis suggests retiring some C-5As to save on operating costs without impacting capability, especially in high tempo non-MCO operations. A cost-effective fleet alternative includes using C-27Js instead of C-130Js for small loads. Continuing C-17 production, even at low rates, is expensive compared to restart costs, and additional C-17s may not be needed. Retiring C-5As to fund more C-17s is not cost-effective. The analysis shows that retiring some C-5As to save on operating costs is a cost-effective fleet alternative. Aircraft service lifetimes were projected based on flying conditions, with most airlifters having lifetimes beyond 2030. However, the C-130E is near its structural life limit and extending its life is not cost-effective. CRAF aircraft contribute to wartime deliveries, especially in MCOs, but their ability to remain a viable augmentation option may be impeded at specific fleet inventory levels. The current analysis indicates that restructuring airline fleets may reduce charter passenger aircraft numbers but should not significantly impact the availability of cargo CRAF. The cargo CRAF is a strong economic sector that does not heavily rely on CRAF for revenue and is unlikely to be greatly affected by potential changes in DoD force levels. The OSD and U.S. Transportation Command are assessing future airlift capability requirements in the Mobility Capability study. The U.S. Transportation Command is conducting a study called Mobility Capability and Requirements Study 2016 (MCRS-16) to determine future airlift capability needs by the end of 2009. The study will consider changes since 2005, such as transporting over 92,000 Marines and Army soldiers worldwide and the establishment of a new African Command. The U.S. Transportation Command is conducting a study called Mobility Capability and Requirements Study 2016 (MCRS-16) to determine future airlift capability needs by the end of 2009. The study will consider changes since 2005, such as the establishment of a new African Command and the introduction of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles in Iraq for enhanced protection of U.S. troops. The increase in weight of the Army's Future Combat System vehicles has made it no longer possible to transport some vehicles with C-130 aircraft. The GAO report suggests that the C-17 may be the only aircraft capable of delivering major weapon systems to the front lines and more austere bases in the theater of combat. The 2009 Mobility Capabilities Requirements Study indicated no need for additional strategic airlift beyond planned procurements of re-engined C-5s and C-17s. Previous studies had suggested a requirement of 300 strategic airlifters, but were discredited as budget-driven. Air Force officials are considering options from an independent study for future strategic airlift needs. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley is considering options from an independent study for future strategic airlift needs, including leasing additional Civil Reserve Air Fleet capacity and re-engining all C-5s. Section 132 of the FY2004 defense authorization act prohibits the retirement of C-5As below 112 until certain conditions are met. Section 132 of the FY2007 defense authorization act amended 10 USC 8062 to require the Secretary of the Air Force to maintain a total aircraft inventory of strategic airlift aircraft of not less than 299 aircraft by October 1, 2008. Strategic airlift aircraft are defined as those with a cargo capacity of at least 150,000 pounds and a capability to transport outsized cargo over an unrefueled range of at least 2,400 nautical miles, including the C-5 and C-17 aircraft types. This provision was later repealed by Section 311 of the FY2009 supplemental appropriations act. The FY2004 defense authorization act allows the Secretary of the Air Force to retire C-5As after certifying to Congress that it won't increase operational risk. The decision must not reduce the total strategic airlift force below 292 aircraft unless addressed in the FY2010 defense authorization act. The main issue in FY2011 is whether to procure more C-17s to meet future operational needs. In FY2011, additional C-17s may be needed to meet future operational needs. Congress must consider factors such as total airlift capability requirements, cost-effectiveness of C-5 modernization versus procuring more C-17s, constraints on defense spending, and potential impacts on funding for other programs. Observers are awaiting results of studies on airlift capability requirements. The Department of Defense supports the minimum of 292 strategic airlift aircraft as required by the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009. Congress has funded additional C-17s not requested by the Department, leading to excess aircraft and increased operating costs. Considerations for future C-17 procurement include total airlift capability requirements, cost-effectiveness of C-5 modernization, defense spending constraints, and potential impacts on funding for other programs. The Department of Defense is facing excess operating costs due to an overabundance of C-5A aircraft, costing over $100 million annually. The Department believes additional C-17s are unnecessary and proposes retiring a portion of the C-5A fleet to manage strategic airlift inventory efficiently. The Department of Defense is considering retiring a portion of the C-5A fleet to manage excess operating costs. The C-17 fleet currently provides both strategic and tactical airlift capabilities, but there may be a future gap in tactical airlift for medium weight Army equipment. The JFTL aircraft is planned to replace the C-130H in the future, but won't be available for 15 years or more. The studies did not fully evaluate the expanded future use of the C-17 for transporting medium weight equipment and its impact on force structure, service life, and production line shutdown. The C-17 is currently the only aircraft capable of transporting heavy equipment like armored Strykers and MRAP vehicles, but it has limitations in landing areas. The C-17 is unable to transport equipment into challenging landing areas, and the planned replacement, the JFTL, won't be available for at least 15 years. Despite the C-17's ability to handle tactical missions, studies have not fully considered its role in the tactical force structure. This raises concerns about the impact of increasing tactical heavy lift missions on future airlift requirements and the C-17's service life. The DOD officials do not see the C-17 as a suitable replacement for the JFTL mission. Preliminary results show that the C-17 can fulfill its primary role as a strategic airlifter and some tactical missions until 2016. However, there are concerns about the need for the C-17 to perform additional tactical heavy lift missions between 2016 and 2024 when the JFTL is expected to be fielded. The C-17's heavy lift mission was not fully considered in DOD's analysis through 2016 due to lack of access to preliminary study information. Production of C-17 is set to end in March 2011, and restarting production later could incur costs of up to $2 billion, including hiring and training a workforce, restoring production tooling, and identifying suppliers. GAO highlighted shortcomings in the study plan that could hinder decision-making on strategic airlift needs. The study plan lacked details on assumptions, measures of effectiveness, and metrics for evaluating strategic airlift needs. GAO recommended DOD to ensure the final study plan includes sufficient details to inform decision makers. Shortcomings in DOD's 2005 mobility capabilities study approach were also identified. The 2005 study did not specify a specific airlift requirement in million ton-miles per day, as prior studies had done. Instead, DOD expressed its airlift requirement in terms of specific aircraft numbers and types to meet national defense strategy. The study did not assess the operational impact of different C-5 and C-17 aircraft mixes on achieving warfighting objectives. The 2005 study did not specify a specific airlift requirement in million ton-miles per day, as prior studies had done. DOD expressed its airlift requirement in terms of specific aircraft numbers and types to meet national defense strategy. However, the study did not assess the operational impact of different C-5 and C-17 aircraft mixes on achieving warfighting objectives. In 2006, DOD was recommended to include mobility metrics in future studies, which was agreed upon. Currently, specific metrics for determining the number and mix of strategic airlifters in the current mobility capabilities study have not been finalized. The use of a million ton-miles metric is being considered for comparison of fleet capacity. The report highlights the importance of using the ton-mile metric to compare different fleet mixes, such as C-130s, C-130Js, C-17s, C-5As, C-5Bs, and C-5Ms. It emphasizes the need for clarity in determining the optimal mix of aircraft and avoiding premature shutdown of production lines. New mobility studies are expected to bring clarity to strategic airlift capabilities needed to support future forces. The report emphasizes the importance of using specific ton-mile mobility requirements and reliability rates to analyze cost-effective force mixes for strategic airlift capabilities. It is unclear if the Department of Defense will use these metrics in their current analysis to determine the optimal aircraft mix and guide investment decisions worth billions of dollars. Comprehensive requirements and quantifiable metrics are needed before making decisions on the future size and mix of strategic airlift. The Department of Defense faces challenges in decision-making regarding the future size and mix of strategic airlift capabilities. GAO reported in 2008 that increasing costs of C-5 modernization may lead to a reconsideration of airlift portfolio mix or additional funding requests. Investing in new C-17 aircraft, costing $276 million each, could be more attractive as they provide 100% cargo capacity towards meeting airlift requirements. C-5 modernization programs offer only a marginal 14% increase in capacity. According to DOD data, C-5 modernization programs offer a marginal 14% increase in capability over nonmodernized aircraft. It would require modernizing 7 C-5s to match the capability of acquiring 1 additional C-17, which would cost over 3 times more. The Air Force has not secured full funding for C-5 modernization, with current estimates at $9.1 billion to modernize the fleet. The current budget does not fully fund the revised C-5 RERP program, with a shortfall of about $294 million across fiscal years 2009-2013 according to the CAIG analysis. Additional funding is needed in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The Air Force may avoid some future modification costs by justifying the retirement of older C-5s. The Air Force is committed to fully funding the CAIG RERP cost estimate in the fiscal year 2010 President's budget. However, additional funding sources are needed for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Weaknesses in the cost-estimating methodology were found, particularly in not accounting for risk or uncertainty in major cost drivers like the propulsion system and labor. This impairs the credibility and reliability of the C-5 cost estimate. The CAIG identified risks in the cost estimate, particularly related to the purchase agreement between Lockheed Martin and General Electric for the propulsion system. Meeting quantity and schedule targets could result in cost savings, but failure to do so could lead to increased costs for the C-5 RERP project. The CAIG did not perform a risk/uncertainty analysis for the C-5 RERP program, leading to potential cost increases if buy quantity is cut. DOD often changes procurement quantities, posing a risk for the program. The CAIG also did not address uncertainty in the $2.1 billion labor cost estimate for the RERP installation on C-5 production. The CAIG estimated a $2.1 billion labor cost for the RERP program on C-5 production aircraft, factoring in a 29-month production break. Their estimate differed from the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, causing a $200 million difference from Lockheed Martin and a $400 million difference from the Air Force. This discrepancy impairs the Air Force's strategic airlift investment decisions and increases the risk of cost overruns in the RERP program. Additional modernization efforts may further increase future C-5 costs. The Air Force plans to start a new C-5 upgrade program in fiscal year 2010 with an initial funding requirement of $65 million. This program aims to standardize the software configuration of all C-5s based on previous upgrades. Additional funding will be needed in 2012 and beyond for more capabilities. The total costs for modernizing C-5 aircraft will depend on future strategic airlift needs determined by DOD officials. Lockheed, the maker of the C-5, criticized the November 2008 GAO report for not providing a balanced discussion on the C-5 modernization debate and C-17 alternatives. They argued that the report selectively applied facts and omitted relevant analysis, hindering public understanding of the strategic airlift debate. Lockheed Martin criticized the GAO report for lacking balanced discussion on C-5 modernization and C-17 alternatives. The report was deemed one-dimensional and biased towards C-17 advocacy, ignoring the benefits of C-5 modernization. The DoD found that C-5 modernization provided the best military capability at a lower cost compared to other options. The FY2010 defense authorization act did not authorize funding for additional C-17s. The FY2010 defense authorization act prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from retiring C-5As below 111 until certain conditions are met. It also requires reports on C-5 retirement and force structure of C-5 and C-17 aircraft. The act mandates maintaining a total inventory of at least 316 C-5s and C-17s. The FY2010 defense authorization act prohibits the retirement of C-5A aircraft below 111 until certain conditions are met, including the modification of aircraft to the RERP configuration. Additionally, reports on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review are required, with a focus on strategic and tactical airlift decisions. The FY2010 defense authorization act prohibits the retirement of C-5A aircraft below 111 until certain conditions are met, including the modification of aircraft to the Reliability Enhancement and Reengining Program (RERP) configuration. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation conducts an operational evaluation of the modified aircraft, focusing on reliability, maintainability, availability, and critical operational issues. An operational assessment of the program to modify C-5A aircraft to the RERP configuration is also provided to the Secretary of Defense and congressional defense committees. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring C-5 aircraft until certain conditions are met, including operational assessments of the program to modify the aircraft to the RERP configuration. This includes evaluations of reliability, maintainability, availability, and critical operational issues. The Secretary of the Air Force must certify to Congress that retiring C-5 aircraft will not increase operational risk or reduce the total strategic airlift force structure below 316 aircraft. A report must be submitted detailing the rationale for retirement, cost-benefit analysis of alternative force structures, and an updated assessment on the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program modification. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of various aspects related to the retirement of C-5 aircraft, including the implications for the Air Force, operating a mix of C-5A and C-5M aircraft, increasing the number of C-5 aircraft in Back-up Aircraft Inventory status, transferring C-5 aircraft to US flag carriers or coalition partners, and other relevant matters as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Before a C-5 aircraft is retired, the Secretary of the Air Force must submit a report to Congress detailing the force structure and basing of strategic airlift aircraft. The report includes lists of aircraft in inventory, proposed retirements, affected units, and military installations. The House Armed Services Committee recommends no funding for additional C-17s in FY2010 and instead approves $88.5 million for other C-17 program expenses. Section 134 of H.R. 2647 requires the Secretary of the Air Force to coordinate with the Director of the Air National Guard before retiring a C-5 aircraft. The Secretary of the Air Force, in coordination with the Director of the Air National Guard, must submit a report to the congressional defense committees at least 120 days before a C-5 aircraft is retired. The report will detail the force structure and basing of strategic airlift aircraft. Section 135 of H.R. 2647 requires a report detailing the retirement of strategic airlift aircraft, including the type, variant, and military installation where each aircraft is based. It also includes information on the units affected by the retirement, changes to mission at military installations, anticipated reductions or increases in manpower, and any related military construction. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to maintain a total strategic airlift aircraft inventory of at least 316 aircraft, effective October 1, 2009. This supports a force structure of 111 C-5s and 205 C-17s, as identified in the Mobility Capabilities Study 2005. The United States Transportation Command commander testified that a force structure of 205 C-17s, 52 C-5Ms, and 59 C-5As meets the requirement to transport 33.95 million ton-miles per day. Previous commanders also identified 316 strategic airlift aircraft as necessary to meet global mobility requirements. The potential increase in strategic airlift for Army's future combat systems was not considered in MCS-05. The committee believes that the results of MCRS\u201316 should accurately identify the inventory of strategic airlift aircraft needed for future mobility requirements. They suggest that the long-term strategic airlift force structure may need adjustments based on the study's results. The committee encourages ongoing discussions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense, military officials, and congressional defense committees. Section 1032 of the title requires a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), including details on strategic and tactical airlift force structure decisions and changes. The committee emphasizes the importance of accurately identifying the inventory of strategic airlift aircraft needed for future mobility requirements and suggests potential adjustments to the long-term force structure based on study results. Ongoing discussions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense, military officials, and congressional defense committees are encouraged. The FY2010 defense authorization bill requires a report on the force structure findings of the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, focusing on strategic and tactical airlift force structure decisions and changes. It includes details on the necessary airlift aircraft numbers for increased Army and Marine Corps personnel, transporting future combat systems, and intra-theater airlift missions. The report also addresses force sizing constructs, operational risks, and measures planned to address those risks. The FY2010 defense authorization bill includes detailed funding tables and a provision prohibiting the retirement of C-5A aircraft until certain conditions are met. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring C-5A aircraft until they have been modified to the RERP configuration and have undergone operational evaluation. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring C-5A aircraft until they have been modified to the RERP configuration and have undergone operational evaluation, including testing and evaluation of performance with respect to reliability, maintainability, and availability. Additionally, there are limitations on the retirement of C-5 aircraft from the active inventory until certain conditions are met. The Secretary of the Air Force is required to submit a report to Congress detailing the rationale for retiring existing C-5 aircraft and conducting a cost/benefit analysis of alternative strategic airlift force structures. The retirement of C-5A aircraft is prohibited until they have been modified to the RERP configuration and undergone operational evaluation. Additionally, specific conditions must be met before C-5 aircraft can be retired from the active inventory. The report to Congress will assess the costs and benefits of retiring C-5 aircraft, applying RERP modifications to the C-5A fleet, operating a mix of C-5A and C-5M aircraft, increasing the number of C-5 aircraft in BAI status, transferring C-5 aircraft to flag carriers or coalition partners, and other relevant matters related to C-5 aircraft retirement. The Secretary of the Air Force will maintain retired C-5 aircraft in storage until transfer opportunities are exhausted. A final version of H.R. 3326 was signed into law on December 19, 2009, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010. The explanatory statement in Section 8124 of the consolidated bill allocates $2,588.5 million for procurement of 10 C-17s in FY2010, an increase of $2,500.0 million over the administration request. Congress decided to continue production but did not fund the $91.4 million administration request for post-production support. Additionally, $22.4 million is rescinded from Air Force research and development funds for the C-17, and the budget for modification of in-service C-17s is reduced by $17.4 million. The text of H.R. 3326 includes a provision that funds for modification of C-17 aircraft cannot be obligated until prior year contracts are definitized, unless certified necessary for warfighting needs or cost prevention. The Air Force's actions to reduce undefinitized contract actions are praised in the explanatory statement. The bill includes provisions to limit obligations for C-17 aircraft modifications until prior contracts are definitized or certified necessary. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to review Air Force contracting procedures and provide a strategy to reduce undefinitized contracts. Additionally, a consolidated list of undefinitized contracts within the Department of Defense is to be provided twice a year. $2.5 billion is allocated for the procurement of ten C-17 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $762.6 million for the procurement of three C-17 aircraft, with reductions in funding for modifications and post-production support. The bill provides $2.5 billion for the procurement of ten C-17 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $762.6 million for the procurement of three C-17 aircraft, with reductions in funding for modifications and post-production support. The report states that no funds for C-17 aircraft procurement or modernization can be obligated until prior year contracts are definitized. Additionally, $132.3 million is allocated for modification of in-service C-17s and $11 million for post-production support. The Committee also provides an additional $674.1 million for the procurement of three C-17 aircraft, recognizing its contributions to national security. The Committee provides an additional $674.1 million for the procurement of three C-17 aircraft, intending to incorporate them into the fiscal year 2009 production run to avoid high costs. The report also addresses concerns about the excessive use of undefinitized contract actions by the Air Force. The Air Force has not properly overseen contracting activities in the C-17 aircraft program, with billions of dollars in undefinitized contracts. The program often uses undefinitized contract actions as the rule rather than the exception, leading to delays in definitizing contracts as required by DFAR regulations. Many contracts exceed the 180-day timeline for definitization, with proposal times for fiscal year 2007 funds ranging from 373 days. The excessive use of undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) in the C-17 aircraft program has led to delays in definitizing contracts, with proposal times for fiscal year 2007 funds ranging from 373 to 975 days. This practice puts taxpayers at a disadvantage as contractors have little incentive to control costs. Additionally, the use of UCAs has expanded beyond procurement and modernization programs to operation and maintenance programs, with the Air Force justifying waivers for definitization schedules and obligations for UCAs supporting overseas operations. The Air Force's excessive use of undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) for routine activities, including depot funding, has led to delays in definitizing contracts. The Committee directs the Air Force to address this situation within 30 days and provide a detailed report on all UCAs exceeding $50,000,000. The Air Force has been criticized for abusing contracting mechanisms, specifically undefinitized contract actions (UCAs), leading to delays in finalizing contracts. The Committee demands expedited finalization of existing UCAs and urges the Air Force to minimize their use in the future. Additionally, the Undersecretary of Defense is directed to review Air Force contracting procedures and provide a strategy to reduce current and future undefinitized contracts within 90 days. The Air Force is urged to reduce the use of undefinitized contracts, with a strategy required within 90 days. The bill would rescind certain FY2009 appropriations for DOD programs, including $70 million for the C-17 program. The Administration objects to additional funding for C-17 aircraft, stating that the current fleet is sufficient for future airlift needs. The Committee recommends $2,588.5 million in procurement funding for the C-17 program, including $2,500.0 million for the procurement of 10 C-17s. There are reductions in funding requested for modifications and post-production support. Additionally, the report approves funding for Overseas Contingency Operations. The committee recommends rescinding $22.4 million in FY2009 research and development funding for the C-17 program. The National Guard and Reserve Equipment program should prioritize Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) systems for C-17s. The Administration opposes adding $2.5 billion for 10 unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft, stating that the current fleet of C-17s and C-5 aircraft is sufficient for future airlift needs. The Senate rejected a motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to an amendment that would strike funding for C-17 procurement in excess of the amount requested by the administration.
