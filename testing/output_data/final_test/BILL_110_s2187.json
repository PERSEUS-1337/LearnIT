    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quality Child Care for America Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical role of young children's environment in brain development, with most neural connections forming in the first 3 years of life. Over 12 million children under 5 are in child care weekly, and about 6 million children under 3 are cared for by someone other than parents. Additionally, 61% of mothers with children under 3 are in the workforce. High-quality, developmentally appropriate child care is essential. High-quality child care improves children's school success, with a 4-State study showing that children in high-quality care had better math skills, attention, and behavior by second grade. At-risk children are particularly impacted by the quality of care they receive. However, many child care providers lack the support needed to improve quality. Better compensation is linked to improved child care quality and developmental outcomes. Child care workers' low wages are linked to inadequate reimbursement rates from the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. In 2006, only 9 States reimbursed providers at the recommended level, making it difficult for child care centers to pay above-poverty wages. Child care providers face challenges with health insurance coverage and high turnover rates. In 2005, 27% of child care providers lacked health insurance, compared to 16% of all female workers. Additionally, 35% of child care providers were no longer employed in the field after one year. These issues highlight the need for additional investments in the child care workforce. Additional investments in the child care workforce are necessary to attract and retain qualified providers. The Child Care WAGES project offers salary supplements to preschool teachers, directors, and family providers, resulting in low turnover rates. Quality child care depends on providers' training in child development, with higher education levels and specialized training linked to better interactions with children. Lack of affordable, reliable child care remains a challenge. Lack of affordable, reliable, high-quality child care is crucial for working parents, especially low-income mothers, to maintain employment. SEC. 3. Authorization of appropriations for workforce development initiatives under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to allocate $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for section 658H. SEC. 4 introduces section 658H for Child Care Workforce Development Initiatives. An eligible entity receiving funds for workforce development initiatives must reserve and use the funds for activities to assist child care providers, such as improving compensation and benefits or providing education and training. An eligible entity receiving funds for workforce development initiatives must reserve and use the funds for activities to assist child care providers, such as improving compensation and benefits, providing education and training, and offering technical and financial assistance to meet regulatory requirements. The eligible entity receiving funds for workforce development initiatives must reserve at least 30 percent of the amounts for child care providers not center-based. These funds are used for activities like mentoring programs, career plans, and business development for child care providers. Maintenance of effort is required when utilizing the reserved funds for activities described in the initiative. The entity must maintain expenditures for activities at a level not lower than the previous fiscal year. States cannot reduce the number of children served compared to the previous year. Definitions include 'covered payment' and 'development portion'. The term 'eligible entity' refers to a State, territory, or Indian tribe. The term 'State' excludes territories. The allocation of funds is based on the relationship between the amount appropriated under section 658B(b) and the total amount appropriated for that fiscal year. The term 'State' excludes territories and refers to the amount allotted to a State under section 658O(b). SEC. 5 amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to include a workforce development initiative in the State plan. SEC. 6 requires a report. SEC. 6 amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to include a workforce development initiative and requires a report on the impact of the activities funded through the initiative on the state's workforce."
