    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bison Management Improvement Act of 1995\". Congressional findings are included in the Act. The Congress finds that the natural resources of Yellowstone National Park, including free-ranging wildlife like bison and elk, are of significant value to the American people. The livestock industry is vital to the economy of the Yellowstone area, and the containment of brucellosis is crucial for State livestock-dependent economies. Better scientific information is needed on Brucella abortus in wildlife, containment and elimination of the disease, and transmission between wildlife and domestic livestock. Bison hold cultural and spiritual value for Native Americans, emphasizing the importance of preserving and restoring buffalo to tribal lands. The purposes of the legislation are outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to address the containment and elimination of brucellosis from the Yellowstone area by 2010, recognize the value of bison to Native Americans, support scientific research, provide economic stability to livestock producers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, and ensure management decisions are based on scientific information. The Act aims to address the containment and elimination of brucellosis from the Yellowstone area by 2010, recognize the value of bison to Native Americans, support scientific research, provide economic stability to livestock producers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, and ensure management decisions are based on scientific information. Yellowstone wildlife are managed to allow bison and other ungulates to range across jurisdictional boundaries on public lands in the area. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Yellowstone area\" is defined as the lands, water, and interests within a specific boundary map. \"Brucellosis\" is a disease causing abortion in cattle and other ungulates. The Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee is established by Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, USDA, and DOI. Surplus bison are those that may enter private property, mix with livestock, or exceed allowed numbers. Secretaries refer to the Agriculture and Interior Secretaries. The Yellowstone Brucellosis Free Management Area is established to manage bison herds, protect wildlife and agricultural values, and eliminate brucellosis from the Yellowstone area. The Secretaries have powers and duties related to this management area. Within the Yellowstone Brucellosis Free Management Area, the Secretaries are authorized to develop joint bison and elk management plans with Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Plans must separate bison from cattle unless vaccination programs are sufficient. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop plans for transporting surplus bison to tribal lands. The Secretary of Agriculture will work with States to eliminate Brucella abortus from Yellowstone wildlife populations. The Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee may be used to develop necessary plans and recommendations. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary of Agriculture will work with States to eliminate Brucella abortus from Yellowstone wildlife populations. The Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee may be used to develop necessary plans and recommendations. The Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, is authorized to prescribe regulations based on scientific information to achieve the objectives of the Act. Factors considered include ecological relationships of wildlife in Yellowstone and market stability for cattle producers, such as transportation protocols for bison and ensuring Brucellosis status for Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with the Secretary of the Interior, can establish regulations to achieve Act objectives. This includes addressing wildlife ecology in Yellowstone, market stability for cattle producers, and maintaining Brucellosis status for Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Special rules under the National Brucellosis Eradication Program aim to preserve Class-Free Brucellosis Status for these states outside the Yellowstone area. SEC. 8. RESEARCH AUTHORIZATION. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct research to understand Brucella abortus in wild ungulates, prevent transmission to domestic livestock, and develop vaccines to eliminate the disease in the Yellowstone area. Financial assistance can be provided for relevant research by federal or state agencies, institutions, or individuals. SEC. 9. DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS BISON. The Secretaries will collaborate with States and Indian tribes to manage surplus bison. They can build facilities on Federal lands for bison handling, subject to environmental laws. The Secretary of the Interior can donate or sell bison to various authorities and Native American tribes. The Secretary may sell or dispose of surplus bison, with transportation costs to be covered by benefiting organizations. Monies from bison sales will offset management costs. Within the Yellowstone area, the Secretaries may acquire lands for various purposes through lease, cooperative agreement, donation, or purchase. The Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited from downgrading the Class-Free Brucellosis Status of certain states as long as specific management plans are in place. SEC. 12. LIMITATION ON STATE ACTION. No State can impose requirements on livestock from Montana, Wyoming, or Idaho that are not imposed on other Brucellosis Class-Free states. SEC. 13. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Funds are authorized for the Department of the Interior and Agriculture to carry out the Act's purposes."
