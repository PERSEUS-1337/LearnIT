This has led to concerns that sensitive nuclear weapons information has been lost to espionage and left vulnerable to theft. The extent of damage to national security is difficult to calculate. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been warned about security lapses that could increase the nuclear threat to the United States due to its bureaucratic structure. Established in 1977 by combining 40 government organizations, each with its own culture and conflicting missions, some agencies prioritize security more than others. The Department of Energy (DOE) faces challenges due to varying priorities within its agencies, leading to security lapses. Conflicting views on the importance of security in relation to other missions create tensions and hinder the establishment of a proper balance between open collaboration and security measures. The Department of Energy (DOE) struggles with maintaining a balance between open collaboration and security, leading to internal conflicts and challenges. Critics point to issues such as high turnover in leadership, bloated management, and a culture that disregards counterintelligence discipline. Leadership turnover has been a persistent problem, with eleven secretaries leading the department over almost 30 years. Some secretaries have proposed aggressive security reforms at the Department of Energy (DOE), but often leave before implementation. Lack of national security experience among top leadership has led to security and counterintelligence issues being overlooked. DOE's management structure is criticized as bloated and dysfunctional, diffusing authority and hindering quick decision-making. Critics blame DOE's bloated and dysfunctional management structure for diffusing authority and hindering accountability, leading to unaddressed security and counterintelligence shortcomings. The culture at DOE is seen as contributing to an environment where legitimate concerns are met with ambivalence or hostility, partly due to the brilliance of its scientists who clash with administrators and bureaucrats. This bureaucratic culture is described as cynical, disrespectful of authority, and cavalier towards security. In 1998, the Clinton Administration discovered that the People's Republic of China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from the DOE, prompting the need for serious reforms. President Clinton issued a directive instructing DOE to implement 13 reforms, including establishing the Office of Counterintelligence (OCI) to strengthen the Department's CI program. The new office was tasked with developing a comprehensive CI policy, led by a senior FBI executive. Initiatives included giving the OCI director oversight of all DOE's CI functions and requiring DOE laboratories to meet CI goals. The OCI director's authority was expanded in a 1999 plan to address weaknesses in the CI program. The DOE's CI program historically lacked a dedicated bureaucratic home, being part of larger offices focused on security or intelligence. President Clinton's PDD-61 marked the beginning of a more aggressive CI program, addressing issues like insufficient funding and lack of control over field offices. In 1999, concerns about DOE's counterintelligence program peaked due to issues like limited access to senior DOE management, poorly trained employees, and a strained relationship with the FBI. This was highlighted by the case of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who was accused of mishandling classified material and having unauthorized contacts with the People's Republic of China. Lee was fired after failing a polygraph test and later pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling classified information. In 1999, concerns about DOE's security practices peaked after Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, pleaded guilty to unlawfully retaining national defense information. A House Select Commission found that the PRC had stolen design information on advanced US thermonuclear weapons. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board criticized DOE for its poor security record and denial of security vulnerabilities. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board criticized DOE for its security failures and dysfunction, recommending the creation of a semi-autonomous agency within the department to address the issues. The Board agreed with the assessment that the PRC had stolen classified U.S. nuclear weapons information, enabling them to accelerate their nuclear weapons development. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended creating a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy to address security failures and streamline operations, focusing on nuclear weapons and national security. This agency would be modeled after the National Security Agency and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Another option proposed was the creation of a new independent agency, similar to NASA and the National Science Foundation. Despite opposition from the executive branch, Congress approved the first option and established the semi-autonomous agency within DOE. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was created as a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) to oversee national security-related nuclear programs. Congress also established two separate counterintelligence offices, one at NNSA and the other at DOE, to implement CI policy at their respective facilities. The Office of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence (ODNCI) at NNSA focuses on protecting classified nuclear and defense technology, while DOE's CI office safeguards other assets. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and DOE established separate counterintelligence offices to oversee technology protection at their respective facilities. Critics questioned the effectiveness of this arrangement, leading to a recommendation by the Commission on Science and Security to reestablish a unified counterintelligence program under DOE's control for the entire DOE complex. The Commission on Science and Security recommended establishing a unified counterintelligence program under DOE's control for the entire DOE complex to address espionage threats from foreign adversaries targeting DOE/NNSA facilities. The bifurcated structure was deemed ineffective and complicated by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive in 2003. The NCIX report criticized the dual-office structure at DOE for causing communication problems, duplicative messages, and inconsistent program tasking, which could lead to missed CI breaches. NCIX recommended consolidating the two CI offices under one senior authority within DOE. NCIX recommended consolidating the two CI offices under one senior counterintelligence officer within DOE, reporting directly to the Energy Secretary. The Directors of Central Intelligence and the FBI endorsed this finding. DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham also supported the consolidation, arguing that the current structure was not optimal. Despite criticism, proponents of the new CI structure highlighted its effectiveness in focusing sustained attention on CI at the laboratories. The NNSA's separate CI office was deemed vital for sustained attention on CI at the weapons laboratories. Despite some criticism, the bifurcated structure had proven successful in other DOE programs. The Senate proposed a single CI office under NNSA control, but the House objected, leading to the proposal's demise in conference. In fiscal year 2007 legislation, Congress consolidated the counterintelligence offices of DOE and NNSA into a single office within DOE, despite initial objections. Congress urged the offices to improve cooperation to ensure the security of both programs and facilities. In fiscal year 2007, Congress consolidated the counterintelligence offices of DOE and NNSA into a single office within DOE. Congress adopted legislation with safeguards including a \"sunset\" provision reestablishing NNSA's CI office in 2010 and establishing an Intelligence Executive Committee within DOE. The legislation in fiscal year 2007 consolidated the counterintelligence offices of DOE and NNSA into a single office within DOE. A new position, the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Liaison, was established to facilitate communication between NNSA and DOE's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. The legislation also required DOE to detail funding for counterintelligence activities in its annual budget submission. Despite initial doubts, the Senate deemed the consolidation successful and proposed making it permanent in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate Armed Services Committee found the consolidation of counterintelligence offices within DOE effective and supported by the Energy Secretary and NNSA Administrator. Proponents argue that a unified structure increases accountability and centralizes control over CI programming across the DOE complex. The previous partially bifurcated structure of CI programming across the DOE complex led to disagreements between the Office of Counterintelligence and NNSA's CI office. This resulted in divergent management philosophies, priorities, and inconsistent CI practices. Consolidation of DOE CI guidance has led to more consistent practices and eliminated day-to-day problems caused by overlapping responsibilities. It has also given the Secretary of Energy's Senior Intelligence Officer exclusive authority to develop a strategic CI policy. Consolidation of DOE CI guidance has resulted in a more strategic CI program focused on using foreign intelligence to identify espionage risks. This approach aims to prevent espionage before it occurs by understanding the plans and intentions of foreign intelligence services. The development of the \"Common Operational Picture\" tool is an example of integrative initiatives launched as a result of consolidation. The NNSA/DOE consolidation has led to the development of the \"Common Operational Picture\" tool for CI officials to represent the CI threat geo-spatially. Critics argue that transferring CI headquarters staff may undermine program integration and accountability, despite the benefits of a unified office and chain of command. Critics argue that DOE's integration of counterintelligence within a larger office structure has led to a lack of focus compared to NNSA's dedicated CI office. They believe that DOE's emphasis on foreign intelligence has detracted from its CI capabilities. Critics suggest that DOE's focus on foreign intelligence has led to a programmatic imbalance with counterintelligence, prompting the establishment of NNSA's CI office. DOE Headquarters is increasing its emphasis on FI but claims it is part of a strategic effort to better support CI, refuting claims of neglecting counterintelligence. Critics suggest that NNSA's CI managers were more effective than DOE counterparts, with better communication, consensus building, and quicker decision-making. NNSA's CI methods were deemed more effective, with a greater emphasis on strategic issues. Critics argue that NNSA's approach to counterintelligence focused on non-confrontational briefings and debriefings, while DOE took a more investigative and aggressive stance. NNSA believed in relying on the workforce for information, while DOE was criticized for using \"dragnet tactics\" that assumed guilt. Critics and proponents agree on the importance of a unified counterintelligence program under a single chain of command. Critics argue that effective leadership is more crucial than bureaucratic structure for program success. Some suggest that NNSA's CI office was established to address DOE's weak CI management. Proponents of consolidation point out that the DOE/NNSA consolidation began in 2007 and is still ongoing. The DOE/NNSA consolidation started in 2007 after organizational turmoil. Efforts to improve communication and collaboration are still in early stages. Some question the quality of CI evaluation assessments conducted by NNSA. In 2006, DOE combined its Offices of Intelligence and Counterintelligence under a new Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence to provide timely intelligence analyses on foreign nuclear weapons and energy. The Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence within the Department of Energy provides intelligence analyses on foreign nuclear weapons, materials, and energy issues. It is comprised of four directorates: intelligence, counterintelligence, management, and energy and environmental security. The Directorate of Intelligence assesses foreign powers targeting DOE for espionage, the Counterintelligence Directorate protects classified information, the Management Directorate provides support services, and the Energy and Environmental Security Directorate examines energy and environmental impacts. The Security Directorate at the Department of Energy focuses on energy and environmental issues' impact on U.S. national security. By consolidating intelligence and counterintelligence directorates, the CI program has been strengthened. The new integrated structure improves communication and collaboration between the two disciplines, allowing for more effective use of foreign intelligence analysis in developing a strategic CI program. The consolidation of intelligence and counterintelligence directorates at the Department of Energy has strengthened the CI program by improving communication and collaboration. This integration allows for the harnessing of foreign intelligence analysis to develop more strategically focused CI plans, concentrating on protecting DOE information and computer networks from espionage. The consolidation aligns with the FY2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act's goal of promoting a more integrated corporate approach within the Intelligence Community. Additionally, it has helped correct the misperception of having two Senior Intelligence Officers at DOE, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the SIO. The consolidation of intelligence and counterintelligence directorates at the Department of Energy has strengthened the CI program by improving communication and collaboration. This has enabled DOE to establish an \"intelligence brand\" to highlight its unique contributions to policymakers and distinguish its intelligence products from other agencies within the Intelligence Community. Critics argue that the consolidation of intelligence and counterintelligence at the Department of Energy has led to cuts in CI resources at some laboratories, attributing this to increased spending on FI initiatives like the Energy Attache Program and the Collection Management Initiative. They also highlight budget constraints affecting the CI program. The Department of Energy's CI budget constraints are attributed to factors such as a flat CI spending due to a continuing resolution, higher costs from laboratories transitioning to for-profit status, and a CI contingency fund holding 10% of the budget. DOE officials deny diverting CI funding to FI, stating that increases in CI spending have been hindered by short-term continuing resolutions since 2006. Critics blame budget constraints on the non-profit to for-profit transition and the CI contingency fund. Critics argue that CI offices at major laboratories have faced 10% funding cuts despite increases in the DOE Headquarters CI budget. They also point out that the authorities of the CI Deputy Director have been diminished since the independent CI office was absorbed by the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. Critics are concerned about the control of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, access to the Energy Secretary, and suggestions to place PDD-61 on \"inactive status.\" They believe important provisions have been ignored, such as the elimination of the independent Office of Counterintelligence. Critics argue that certain provisions should be preserved despite claims that the directive is outdated. Critics argue that key provisions of PDD-61, such as CI program goals and direct access for senior CI officials, should be preserved despite changes in law. The role of the FBI director in selecting a DOE CI chief has been eliminated, with the Secretary of Energy now having that authority. Additionally, the requirement for the CI chief to be a senior FBI executive has been removed. The Secretary of Energy is expected to coordinate his selection of a DOE CI chief with the Director of National Intelligence. Critics question the need for a wholesale reorganization, expressing concerns about weakened CI capabilities and authorities. Budget cuts to CI programs at DOE's largest laboratories have raised further doubts. Budget cuts to CI programs at DOE's six largest laboratories in FY2008 have led to a degradation of CI analytic capability. Some CI officials are concerned that CI program managers are being tasked with FI assignments, reducing resources devoted to CI. One laboratory CI official noted a shift in focus towards Headquarters tasks, leading to disruptions and unraveling of the CI/FI consolidation. Some DOE officials express concerns about the CI/FI consolidation, stating that communication between Headquarters and the laboratories has worsened. They also note that strategic goals, such as addressing personnel security clearances and interactions with foreign scientists, are not being met. Consolidation proponents acknowledge these criticisms but attribute them to ongoing communication issues. The DOE acknowledges criticisms regarding communication problems between Headquarters and field offices, but defends that it does not diminish CI operational capabilities. They argue that there are misperceptions about CI spending management and emphasize budget increases for the six largest laboratories in FY2008. Critics claim CI funding supports FI efforts, but DOE insists it serves CI interests. They describe the consolidated business model as sound, despite organizational growing pains. The 111th Congress may support the current approach. The 111th Congress may consider retaining the current approach, which would involve reestablishing NNSA's CI office in 2010 and keeping DOE's FI/CI program consolidation. Policymakers may need to decide whether to maintain the 2010 sunset provision and reestablish NNSA's CI office independently of DOE, or to retain the FI/CI consolidated program within DOE. Various options include eliminating the sunset provision and not reestablishing NNSA's CI office, or maintaining the provision and reestablishing NNSA's CI office independently while retaining the FI/CI program. The 111th Congress may consider different options for the future of DOE's CI structure, including maintaining the current FI/CI consolidated program, reestablishing NNSA's CI office independently, or placing the FBI in charge of DOE CI. These options involve decisions on the 2010 sunset provision and the organization of FI and CI offices within DOE. Opponents argue that retaining the sunset provision and reestablishing NNSA's CI program would bring needed attention to CI in DOE's weapons laboratories. Another alternative is to maintain the sunset provision and reestablish NNSA's CI program as an independent entity in 2010, while keeping DOE's FI/CI consolidated program. Under the previously existing structure, NNSA's CI office was restricted to implementing DOE CI policy and shared resources with its DOE counterpart. Proponents argue that an independent NNSA CI office could be more effective by developing and implementing CI policy at all NNSA facilities, eliminating tensions and inefficiencies. Opponents fear re-establishing NNSA's CI office could disrupt progress made under the current consolidated FI/CI program. Establishing an independent CI office at NNSA could require additional funding, as it would no longer share resources with its DOE counterpart. Retaining the current structure of DOE's consolidated FI/CI program could preserve and expand gains made from consolidation. An alternative option is to eliminate the sunset provision in P.L. 109-364 and not reestablish NNSA's CI office in 2010, instead opting for an independent CI office with budget control. Proponents argue that this would eliminate redundancies and reduce costs associated with a dual management structure. Maintaining the current structure of DOE's consolidated FI/CI program could preserve gains from consolidation, while establishing an independent CI office at NNSA may improve program effectiveness. Opponents argue that disrupting DOE's strategic CI program could jeopardize achievements. Proponents argue for retaining the current structure of DOE's consolidated FI/CI program and restoring NNSA's CI office to strengthen CI authorities and capabilities. Opponents fear that reversing consolidations could undermine the benefits of a more integrated program. Congress could potentially eliminate DOE's CI program altogether. Under an alternative approach, Congress could transfer DOE's CI program to the FBI, leveraging their expertise in counterintelligence. This change may lead to increased FBI involvement, potentially impacting cooperation from DOE employees. The NNSA/DOE CI consolidation could be reversed in 2010, with NNSA's CI office reinstated, while retaining the FI/CI consolidated program. Proponents and opponents debate the effectiveness of NNSA/DOE consolidation on accountability and CI program effectiveness. Congress could consider oversight alternatives like classified briefings, formal assessments, ensuring compliance with laws, and codifying PDD-61. Congress could require DOE to brief appropriate committees on CI methods used, providing insight into DOE's efforts, strategic interests of foreign powers, and cooperation with the Intelligence Community. However, this may be time-consuming due to the numerous, detailed, and sensitive nature of the cases. DOE may restrict briefings to committee leadership. Congress could commission an assessment to evaluate the benefits of the DOE FI/CI consolidation, enabling better oversight. The Department's Senior Intelligence Officer could demonstrate program synergies resulting from the consolidation. Conducting such an assessment has no apparent disadvantages. One approach Congress could take is to ensure DOE compliance with the law regarding the consolidation of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. Questions have been raised about the legality of the consolidation, suggesting it may have been a \"transfer of function\" within the new office. Congress could codify certain provisions from PDD-61, such as requiring specific CI goals in laboratory contracts and granting senior CI personnel direct access to laboratory directors. This would make these provisions legally binding and not subject to termination. The 1998 PDD-61 formalized the FBI's role in supporting DOE's CI Program by establishing an independent Office of Counterintelligence. The FBI's joint AIL Program with DOE aims to prevent foreign acquisition of WMD technology, penetration of the Intelligence Community, and compromise of U.S. critical national assets. The FBI's role in supporting DOE's CI Program was formalized in 1998 with the establishment of an independent Office of Counterintelligence. The FBI works with DOE to prevent foreign acquisition of WMD technology, penetration of the Intelligence Community, and compromise of U.S. critical national assets. Despite recent changes, the FBI's authority over the program has been reduced, with the Secretary of Energy now having selection authority for the program director. The impact of this change on the FBI's role in DOE's CI program is still being debated. The FBI's role in supporting DOE's CI Program has been reduced, with the Secretary of Energy now having selection authority for the program director. The potential diminishing role of the FBI depends on whether DOE can develop its own CI professionals and reduce reliance on the FBI."
