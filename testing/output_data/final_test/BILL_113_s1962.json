The Pullman Historic District was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1970 due to its significance in labor history, social history, architecture, and urban planning. George M. Pullman built the Pullman community between 1880 and 1884 as an industrial town with a model community and suitable living conditions for employees. The town developed by George M. Pullman was awarded \"The World's Most Perfect Town\" in 1896. The Pullman factory site symbolizes the historic struggle for fair labor practices, leading to the first industry-wide strike in the US in 1894. The strike, initiated by factory workers protesting unsafe conditions and pay cuts, was supported by the American Railway Union and crippled the rail industry. Following the deadly 1894 strike, Congress unanimously approved rush legislation to create a national Labor Day holiday, signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. The Pullman Palace Car Company also played a significant role in African-American and early civil rights history. The Pullman porters, many of whom were ex-slaves, played a crucial role in African-American history by serving diligently between the 1870s and 1960s. They were commended for their service, attention to detail, and contributions to the development of the African-American middle class. Additionally, they carried information, ideas, and commerce across the country, helping to bring education and wealth to African-American communities throughout the United States. The Pullman porters played a significant role in African-American history by providing first-class service on Pullman cars. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded by A. Philip Randolph in 1925, was the first African-American labor union with a collective bargaining agreement. They fought against discrimination and supported just labor practices, laying the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement. The Pullman community is a notable example of architect Solon Spencer Beman's work. The Pullman site, designed by architect Solon Spencer Beman, is a well-preserved example of 19th-century community planning, architecture, and landscape design. It includes historic structures like the Administration Clock Tower Building, Hotel Florence, Greenstone Church, Market Square, and rowhouses for Pullman workers. Threatened by demolition in 1960 and a fire in 1998, preservation efforts involve community organizations, foundations, nonprofits, residents, the State, and local government units. The preservation and restoration of the Pullman District after the 1998 fire were crucial for its protection. The District is designated as a National Historic Landmark, an Illinois State Landmark, and a City of Chicago Landmark District. Cooperation and partnerships among various entities are necessary for the preservation, enhancement, and economic potential of the historic resources in the Park. Several organizations have shown support for community preservation by endorsing the establishment of the Pullman National Historical Park. The Pullman National Historical Park is defined as a park established in Illinois by the Secretary of the Interior. The Pullman National Historical Park in Illinois is established to preserve labor, industrial, civil rights, and social history, architectural structures, and the role of the Pullman community in creating the first national Labor Day holiday. It aims to coordinate preservation efforts by various government and private organizations. The Pullman National Historical Park in Illinois aims to preserve the significant aspects of the Park, including the Pullman Factory Complex and surrounding structures within the approximately 300-acre Pullman Historic District in Chicago. The Park boundary will be established by the Secretary and will not exceed the defined area. The administration of the Pullman National Historical Park in Illinois will be overseen by the Secretary, with a defined boundary not exceeding the 300-acre Pullman Historic District in Chicago. The Secretary administers the Park according to specific laws and may enter into agreements for the preservation of non-Federal land within or near the Park. The Secretary may acquire land, buildings, or structures for the Park from willing sellers. A management plan must be completed within 3 fiscal years. Federal laws on Federal land in the Park remain unaffected. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act."
