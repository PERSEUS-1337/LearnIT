The Congress acknowledges the projected depletion of the Social Security trust funds by 2037 due to demographic factors such as the retirement of baby boomers and increased life expectancy. Policymakers would need to consider raising taxes, cutting spending, or borrowing money to address this issue. Social Security reform is deemed necessary due to concerns about its long-term sustainability and value. Despite the urgency, there is no consensus on how to achieve this, as evidenced by various proposals and bills introduced in Congress. The administration and Congress have proposed various approaches to Social Security reform, but there has been no progress due to differences. To address this, a Bipartisan Commission on Social Security Reform will be established to develop a unified proposal for long-term retirement security. Established in the legislative branch, the Bipartisan Commission on Social Security Reform is tasked with designing recommendations for long-term solvency and retirement income security in the United States. The Bipartisan Commission on Social Security Reform consists of 17 members selected by various leaders in the government, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, the House minority leader, the Senate minority leader, and the President.
