    "content": "The \"Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and purposes related to computer security. The Congress finds that the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for developing standards to ensure security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems. The Federal Government plays a crucial role in protecting sensitive, unclassified information. Encryption technology can provide confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of information, and its development should be market-driven, not government-imposed. The Act aims to reinforce the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in securing unclassified information in Federal computer systems, promote private sector technology solutions for security, and assess information security products with cryptography capabilities. The export control policy for encryption technologies should consider international competitiveness of US computer companies. The Act promotes private sector technology solutions for security and assesses information security products with cryptography capabilities available outside the United States. SEC. 3 amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to assist in establishing voluntary standards for public key management infrastructure. SEC. 4 focuses on the security of federal computers and networks. SEC. 4 amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to provide guidance and assistance to Federal agencies in protecting computer systems, evaluating security vulnerabilities, and testing security products for use in protecting sensitive information. SEC. 5 addresses the implementation of computer security measures. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to emphasize technology-neutral policy guidelines for computer security practices by Federal agencies, promote the use of commercially available products for security and privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems, and participate in encryption technology implementations to develop standards and guidelines for Federal computer systems. The guidelines for Federal computer systems include assessing the desirability and costs of establishing key recovery infrastructures for Government information. SEC. 6. COMPUTER SECURITY REVIEW, PUBLIC MEETINGS, AND INFORMATION. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new subsection requiring recommendations from the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board before submitting standards or guidelines to the Secretary of Commerce. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998 and $1,030,000 for fiscal year 1999 for this purpose. The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board was established in 1999 to identify emerging issues related to computer security, privacy, and cryptography, convene public meetings, receive presentations, and publish reports for public distribution. SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON PARTICIPATION IN REQUIRING ENCRYPTION STANDARDS. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to restrict the Institute from establishing encryption standards for non-Federal Government computer systems. SEC. 8. MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS. Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is further amended to improve computer security for Federal computer systems by coordinating with the Office of Management and Budget. This includes the ability to draw upon resources and expertise for enhancing security, specifically in relation to computers and computer networks. SEC. 9 of the Computer Security Act of 1987 is amended to emphasize protecting sensitive information in Federal databases and computer sites accessible through public networks. SEC. 10 establishes a Computer Security Fellowship Program. SEC. 10 authorizes funding for a Computer Security Fellowship Program to support students in computer security at higher learning institutions. $250,000 for fiscal year 1998 and $500,000 for fiscal year 1999 are allocated for this purpose. The funds are not subject to percentage limitations. The Secretary of Commerce will contract the National Research Council to study public key infrastructures for individuals, businesses, and government. The study will assess technology, current plans, interoperability, scalability, and make recommendations for Federal actions to ensure national feasibility and utility. The National Research Council will study public key infrastructures for individuals, businesses, and government. All Federal agencies must cooperate with the study, including access to classified information if necessary. A report with findings, conclusions, and recommendations for public policy related to public key infrastructures will be transmitted to relevant committees within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The National Research Council will study public key infrastructures for individuals, businesses, and government. $450,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Commerce for fiscal year 1998 for this purpose. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will promote the use of cryptography to enhance national information security, establish a central clearinghouse for information on security threats, and support the development of encryption technologies. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will establish a National Policy Panel for Digital Signatures, composed of technical and legal experts, industry representatives, state officials, and public individuals. The Panel will focus on developing a national digital signature infrastructure with uniform standards to enable widespread use, including creating model practices for certification. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will establish a National Policy Panel for Digital Signatures, composed of experts and industry representatives. The Panel will develop model practices and procedures for certification authorities, ensure consistency among licensing jurisdictions, and establish audit standards. Administrative support will be provided as necessary. Amounts authorized by this Act will be derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 1997."
