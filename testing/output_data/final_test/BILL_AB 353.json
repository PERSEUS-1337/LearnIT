    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the environmental damage to Bouquet Creek in Bouquet Canyon, impacting the habitat of the unarmored threespine stickleback. To restore the environment for this protected species, authorization is needed for restoration efforts by various departments. The department may authorize the take of the unarmored threespine stickleback for habitat restoration projects in Bouquet Canyon on public lands, subject to specific conditions. The department has executed agreements to address environmental impacts at Bouquet Canyon, including Bouquet Creek. The requirements for the take of the unarmored threespine stickleback are satisfied. Further measures to meet the conservation standard are incorporated into projects, with a biologist present during activities that may affect the stickleback. The take authorization includes a monitoring program and adaptive management process to minimize impacts on the unarmored threespine stickleback. It does not exempt projects from other laws or affect contractual obligations for water provision from Bouquet Reservoir. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code prohibits the taking or possession of fully protected fish, except for authorized scientific research purposes. The department must notify affected parties and solicit comments before authorizing any take of these species. Affected and interested parties must notify the department of their interest in fully protected species and provide relevant information within 30 days of notification being published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Legally imported fully protected fish or parts thereof may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. The following are fully protected fish: Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens River pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to include these species. Fully protected fish may not be taken or possessed, except for scientific research purposes authorized by the department after notifying affected parties. No permits or licenses are issued for taking fully protected fish, except for legally imported ones under a department permit. Affected and interested parties must notify the department in writing of their interest in fully protected species and provide contact information. They have 30 days to submit relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization after it is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Fully protected fish, including Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens River pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin, may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. Scientific research excludes actions for project mitigation. The bill incorporates amendments to the Fish and Game Code related to Rough sculpin. It includes provisions for the bill to become operative under certain conditions. The act is deemed urgent for public safety reasons and will take immediate effect. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works proposed a habitat restoration project for unarmored threespine stickleback on Bouquet Creek in Bouquet Canyon. To begin the project promptly, a take permit from the Department of Fish and Wildlife is needed, requiring immediate effect of the act."
