    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Rapid Deployment Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that the United Nations Security Council failed to deploy peacekeepers to Rwanda in 1994, leading to a genocide that cost 800,000 lives and $2 billion in humanitarian aid. The United Nations Secretary General's report in 2000 emphasizes that member nations must address the structural weaknesses of UN peace operations. The United Nations system for launching peacekeeping operations is compared to a volunteer fire department that struggles to find resources for deployment. The Brahimi Report in 2000 highlighted the lack of readiness and resources for rapid deployment of personnel in UN peace operations. The United Nations aims to quickly acquire resources for future peace operations, including a standing police corps, reserve mission leadership, equipment stockpile, and civilian recruitment. Member nations are encouraged to form partnerships under UNSAS for Rapid Deployment Brigades capable of deploying peacekeeping operations within 30-90 days. Former US Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke emphasized the need for meaningful peacekeeping reform to show the UN's commitment. Both Europe and the US recognize the importance of rapidly deployable combat units for various operations, including peacekeeping and full-scale warfare. The European Union and the United States are both working on establishing rapid deployment combat units for various operations, including peacekeeping and full-scale warfare. The US has veto power in the UN Security Council to halt deployments not in its national interests. Establishment of a United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force. The President directs the US representative to urge the UN to establish a UN Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force that can deploy within 15 days for peace operations, limited to six months per mission. The President urges the UN to establish a UN Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force with at least 6,000 volunteers trained for international peace operations, given authority to protect itself, execute peace accords, disarm combatants, protect civilians, detain war criminals, and restore the rule of law as detailed in UN Security Council resolutions. The Force's purpose is to prevent hostilities, recruit personnel, and provide funding. The term \"international peace operations\" refers to operations carried out under a United Nations Security Council resolution to provide funding for the Force. Establishment of Rapid Deployment Brigades. To promote the development of resources for UN peacekeeping operations, the President shall direct officials to encourage member nations to form partnerships under the UNSAS for Rapid Deployment Brigades. These brigades aim to deploy traditional peacekeeping operations within 30 days and complex operations within 90 days of a Security Council resolution. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a study within six months to assess the use of interim combat brigade teams in Rapid Deployment Brigades as described in a Security Council resolution. The President must submit a report to Congress within one year of this Act's enactment on the progress of negotiations for a United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force, US efforts to promote Rapid Deployment Brigades among UN member nations, and the findings of a study conducted under section 4(2)."
