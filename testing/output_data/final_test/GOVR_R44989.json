    "content": "Table 1 compares provisions in the KIDS Act and Division B of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. CHIP has been funded through subsequent legislation since its establishment in 1997. The Children's Health Insurance Program has been funded through various legislation, including CHIPRA, ACA, and MACRA. Annual appropriations for FY2016 and FY2017 were $19.3 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively. The KIDS Act proposes to extend federal CHIP funding for five years, covering FY2018 through FY2022. The KIDS Act proposes to extend federal CHIP funding for five years, with funding amounts increasing annually from $21.5 billion in FY2018 to $25.9 billion in FY2022. The funding for FY2022 includes semiannual appropriations and a one-time appropriation of $20.2 billion. States are reimbursed by the federal government for a portion of their CHIP expenditures up to state-specific annual allotments. State CHIP allotment funds are provided annually, available for two years, and determined by two formulas - even-year and odd-year. In even years, allotments are based on prior year's federal allotment plus adjustments for growth. In odd years, allotments are based on prior year's spending, including federal CHIP payments and adjustments for growth. The odd-year formula for State CHIP allotments is based on actual CHIP expenditures, called the rebasing year. Allotments can increase or decrease depending on state spending. States can increase allotments for eligibility or benefit expansions by submitting required information to HHS by August 31st. The KIDS Act authorizes CHIP allotments for FY2018-FY2022 under SSA Section 2104(m), maintaining formulas for odd years. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act authorizes CHIP allotments for FY2018-FY2022 under SSA Section 2104(m, allowing states to submit program expansion information within 60 days of enactment for FY2018. Prior to MACRA, federal CHIP funding was available until FY2015, with semiannual appropriations provided. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act authorizes CHIP allotments for FY2018-FY2022 under SSA Section 2104(m, allowing states to submit program expansion information within 60 days of enactment for FY2018. In FY2015 and FY2017, state allotments were determined based on federal spending from the prior year multiplied by the allotment growth factor. The KIDS Act would structure federal CHIP funding for FY2022 similar to FY2015 and FY2017, with funding available from SSA Section 2104(a)(25)(A) and a one-time appropriation for the first half of the year, and semiannual appropriations for the second half of the year. The draft bill proposes funding for state allotments in the second half of the year under SSA Section 2104(a)(25)(B), following the even-year formula for CHIP allotments. It mirrors the provision in S. 1827, with one-time appropriations of $15.4 billion for FY2015 and $14.7 billion for FY2017. These funds were to remain available until expended. The KIDS Act proposes a one-time appropriation of $20.2 billion for FY2022, which would remain available until expended. This funding mirrors the provision in the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act and establishes the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund to provide shortfall funding to certain states. The KIDS Act proposes a one-time appropriation of $20.2 billion for FY2022 to establish the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund for states with funding shortfalls in CHIP enrollment. This fund would extend payments from FY2018 through FY2022, similar to the provision in the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Some federal CHIP funding is used to finance Medicaid expenditures in certain situations. Prior to the enactment of CHIP in 1997, Medicaid eligibility for children was in place. Eleven states have the option to use CHIP funds to cover the difference between Medicaid and CHIP matching rates for children in families with income above 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. The provision known as the qualifying state's option was last authorized in FY2017, but the KIDS Act aims to extend it through FY2022. This provision is also included in the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. The CHIPRA provision allowed states to use Express Lane eligibility through September 30, 2013, relying on findings from specified agencies for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations. The authority for Express Lane eligibility determinations was extended through subsequent legislation but expired on September 30, 2017. The KIDS Act aims to extend this authority from FY2018 through FY2022. Eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP is determined by federal and state law, with states setting criteria within federal standards. CHIP enrollment is concentrated among lower-income families, with most enrollees at or below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level. Statewide income thresholds for CHIP coverage vary widely, from 170% to 400% of FPL. States must maintain Medicaid programs with the same eligibility standards under the ACA MOE provisions. The ACA requires states to maintain Medicaid and CHIP programs with the same eligibility standards until specific dates. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the loss of federal funds. Federal CHIP funding ended in FY2017, even though the ACA child MOE requirement is in place through FY2019. The MOE requirement affects CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and separate CHIP programs differently. When CHIP funding is exhausted, eligible children will be enrolled in Medicaid instead. States have exceptions to the MOE requirement for separate CHIP programs, such as imposing waiting lists or enrollment caps. States can also enroll CHIP-eligible children in qualified health plans in the health insurance exchanges. If a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient, procedures must be established to screen children for Medicaid eligibility. For children not eligible for Medicaid, procedures must be in place to enroll them in qualified health plans certified to be comparable to CHIP. The KIDS Act extends Medicaid and CHIP MOE requirements for children with annual income less than 300% of FPL from FY2020 through FY2022. States can roll back eligibility for children above 300% FPL without losing federal funds. States can establish CHIP buy-in programs for children above income thresholds to purchase coverage at full cost. Under the ACA, individuals must maintain minimum essential coverage or face a penalty. Buy-in programs for health coverage through CHIP operate outside of federal funds and program rules, allowing states flexibility in design. Minimum essential coverage includes public programs like Medicaid and CHIP, as well as private insurance. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes a new state option to allow all enrollees in CHIP and qualified CHIP look-alike programs to be considered part of a single risk pool for rate development. Qualified CHIP look-alike programs are state-only programs for children up to age 18 not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, offering benefits equivalent to CHIP state plan benefits. Section 301(g) of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act amends IRC Section 5000A(f)(1) to include a qualified CHIP look-alike program as minimum essential coverage. Effective for taxable years after December 31, 2017, a demonstration project is required by SSA Section 1139A(e) to reduce childhood obesity through grants to eligible entities like community-based organizations and health centers. The project focuses on community-based activities related to reducing childhood obesity. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) required a demonstration project to promote individual and community health in underserved areas. The project had an initial appropriation of $25 million for FY2009-FY2013, later extended to FY2010-FY2014. In 2011, the CDC awarded funding for a Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) to four grantees. The CDC awarded funding for a Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) Project to four grantees. Funding was appropriated for FY2016 and FY2017, with an expansion project titled CORD 2.0 providing funding to two grantees for 2016 through 2018. The KIDS Act would amend SSA Section 1139A(e)(8) to appropriate $25 million for FY2018 through FY2022 for the childhood obesity demonstration project. The SSA Section 1139A requires the establishment of a Pediatric Quality Measures Program by January 1, 2011. This program aims to identify measure gaps, award grants for measure development, and revise the core measure set. States must submit annual reports on state-specific child health quality measures. The Secretary was also required to award grants for demonstration projects to improve children's healthcare quality. The Secretary established a program to develop a model electronic health record for children by January 1, 2010. The Institute of Medicine was tasked with reporting on child health status and quality by July 1, 2010. Funding of $45 million was allocated annually from FY2009 to FY2013. PAMA extended funding for the Pediatric Quality Measures Program in FY2014. Funding for other activities under Section 1139A expired in FY2013. The funding for the childhood obesity demonstration project and other activities under Section 1139A expired in FY2013. MACRA Section 304(b) allocated $20 million for FY2016 through FY2017 for SSA Section 1139A, excluding certain activities. The KIDS Act would amend SSA Section 1139A(i) to appropriate $75 million for FY2018 through FY2022 for activities excluding subsections (e), (f), and (g). Section 302(b) of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act mirrors a provision in S. 1827. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act provision mirrors S. 1827, allocating $100 million for outreach and enrollment grants for FY2009 through FY2013. Funds target Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children, with 10% for underserved populations and Native American children. The remaining 80% goes to eligible entities for outreach campaigns, focusing on rural areas and cultural barriers. ACA also allocated $140 million for FY2009. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act provision, similar to S. 1827, would allocate $100 million for CHIP outreach and enrollment grants for FY2018 through FY2022. It includes funding for organizations using parent mentors to address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act provision allocates $100 million for CHIP outreach and enrollment grants for FY2018 through FY2022, including funding for organizations using parent mentors to assist families with uninsured children in improving social determinants of health. Parent mentors would educate families on obtaining health insurance, assist with applications, serve as liaisons with Medicaid and CHIP, help identify medical and dental homes and community pharmacies, and provide referrals for addressing social determinants of children's health. Compensation for parent mentors for allowable activities would be specified under SSA Section 1902(e)(14). The federal government determines its share of CHIP expenditures through the E-FMAP rate, which can range from 65% to 85%. The ACA provision increased the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 through FY2019, raising the range to 88% through 100%. This higher federal share means states are using up their federal CHIP funding faster. The KIDS Act would extend the increase to the E-FMAP rate under SSA Section 2105(b) for one year through FY2020, with an 11.5 percentage point increase instead of 23 percentage points. Section 304 of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act mirrors the provision in S. 1827 regarding Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income patients. The ACA reduced uninsured individuals in the US, leading to less need for Medicaid DSH payments. Each state has a capped annual DSH allotment for federal matching funds. Medicaid DSH allotments increase annually based on CPI-U. Multiple laws have amended ACA's reductions in DSH payments. Under current law, the Medicaid DSH allotments face $43 billion in aggregate reductions impacting FY2018 through FY2025. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes to eliminate reductions for FY2018 and FY2019, increasing annual reduction amounts for FY2021 through FY2023. The total reduction amount would rise to $44 billion, with annual reductions of $4 billion in FY2020 and $8 billion from FY2021 to FY2025. States' DSH allotments in FY2026 would be calculated as if the reductions never occurred. In FY2026, states' DSH allotments would be calculated as though the reductions never occurred, with annual inflation adjustments for FY2020 through FY2025. Medicaid financing for the territories differs from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, with all territories having a 55% FMAP rate. Territories are eligible for some FMAP exceptions available to states and the District of Columbia. Prior to the ACA, all five territories typically exhausted their federal Medicaid funding prior to the end of the fiscal year. The territories received an additional $7.3 billion in funding through the ACA from two provisions. The territories received $7.3 billion in additional funding through the ACA, with $6.3 billion allocated for Medicaid between 2011 and 2019. An extra $1.0 billion was provided due to the territories not establishing exchanges. Puerto Rico also received $296 million in Medicaid funding in May 2017 through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Financial Management and Oversight Board established by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act has broad fiscal powers. Section 306(a) of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes to increase annual Medicaid allotments for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with additional funding of $880 million for Puerto Rico. An extra $120 million could be available if certain conditions are met regarding Medicaid fraud reduction and waste prevention. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act aims to reduce Medicaid fraud, improve data availability, and enhance patient care for Medicaid enrollees. It includes increasing Medicaid funding for the U.S. Virgin Islands based on population ratios with Puerto Rico and adding new Medicaid matching rates for both territories. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act aims to increase Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands' Medicaid matching rates for specific expenditures from 75% to 90% during 2018-2019. Medicaid serves as the payer of last resort, paying for services only when third parties are not liable, known as third-party liability (TPL). States must meet TPL requirements for both general third parties and health insurers. States must meet TPL requirements for both general third parties and health insurers, including collecting TPL-related information at Medicaid eligibility determinations, requiring health insurers to disclose coverage information, and processing third-party claims. Providers must bill liable third parties before Medicaid, with exceptions allowed under SSA Section 1902(a)(25)(E) and (F). SSA Section 1902(a)(25)(E) and (F) provides exceptions to cost avoidance rules for certain services. States must pay providers for preventive pediatric and prenatal services upfront and seek reimbursement from third parties later. Enrollees who receive payment from a third party for a service already covered by Medicaid are considered to have assigned their claim to the state. States must treat their service expenditure as an overpayment if later reimbursed by a third party. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended Medicaid TPL rules to limit exceptions for cost avoidance and allow states to recover judgments received by Medicaid enrollees. States must return the federal share of overpayments to CMS. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 amended Medicaid TPL rules to allow states to impose liens on Medicaid enrollees' assets from liability settlements. The effective date of the TPL amendments was postponed to October 1, 2019 by the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This Act also introduced the term \"responsible third party\" to replace \"third party\" and \"health insurer\" in the statute. Section 401(a)(3) of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would amend SSA Section 1902(a)(25)(E) to eliminate cost avoidance exceptions for certain services, leaving an exception only for pediatric vaccines under the Vaccines for Children program. Section 401(a)(4) would clarify the roles of Medicaid managed care entities and health insurers as responsible third parties in furnishing Medicaid benefits under state contracts. Section 401(a)(5) of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act clarifies the obligations states must impose on health insurers regarding recovery of payments from responsible third parties for Medicaid services. It ensures that insurers have the same authority as the state in dealing with third parties and treats reimbursements as overpayments. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act clarifies state obligations on health insurers for Medicaid services. It specifies a 60-day response time for insurers regarding TPL claims and prohibits denial based on claim submission date or lack of prior authorization. Additionally, it amends SSA Section 1903(d)(2)(B) for Medicaid services provided to ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees. The HHS Secretary would apply the state's standard FMAP rate, rather than the newly eligible matching rate, for TPL recovery related to ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees. States would retain a larger percentage of third-party overpayment recoveries for these services. FMAP rates for Medicaid expenditures have exceptions, which currently increase a state's standard FMAP. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would allow the HHS Secretary to reduce the FMAP by 0.1 percentage point for states that fail to comply with TPL requirements in SSA Section 1902(a)(25) starting in 2020. This penalty would apply for each calendar quarter of a year where non-compliance occurs. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes amendments to require health insurers to provide information on Medicaid enrollees, make TPL requirements mandatory for CHIP, and establish a Medicaid Integrity Program under SSA Section 1936. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes amendments to establish a Medicaid Integrity Program under SSA Section 1936, including training on the liability of responsible third parties. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes amendments to establish a Medicaid Integrity Program under SSA Section 1936, including training on the liability of responsible third parties. CMS monitors states' efforts to assess TPL, distributes information, and provides guidance to state Medicaid agencies on oversight of TPL efforts by Medicaid managed care plans. Quarterly Medicaid grant awards are based on state submissions of expenditure reports. Section 401(e) of the Act would require the HHS Secretary to develop and make available guidance in consultation with states. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes amendments to establish a Medicaid Integrity Program under SSA Section 1936, including training on the liability of responsible third parties. The Act would require the HHS Secretary, in consultation with states, to develop a model set of reporting fields for states to report to CMS through T-MSIS and collect information on responsible third parties for Medicaid and CHIP services. MAGI rules are used to determine eligibility for federal health programs, including Medicaid, as of January 1, 2014. The Medicaid MAGI income-counting rule, based on the IRC's adjusted gross income, deducts 5% for individuals at the highest income limit. Certain types of income are added, such as tax-exempt interest and nontaxable Social Security benefits. Medicaid regulations allow for the subtraction of certain types of income, like scholarships. Under Medicaid regulations, certain types of income are subtracted to arrive at MAGI. Irregular income received as a lump sum is counted as income only in the month received. The regulations also define \"household\" and require counting the income of all household members for eligibility determinations. Medicaid program regulations distinguish between income eligibility for applicants/new enrollees and redeterminations for current enrollees. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would amend Medicaid regulations to include qualified lottery winnings and lump sum income received after January 1, 2018, in determining eligibility based on MAGI. This income would not be considered for other household members' eligibility. The provision in the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would prorate winnings and income over specific periods based on the amount received, with a state option for hardship exemptions for individuals facing denial of Medicaid eligibility. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act includes a provision for prorating winnings and income over specific periods with a state option for hardship exemptions for individuals facing denial of Medicaid eligibility. This provision also requires states to inform individuals of their loss of Medicaid eligibility, offer enrollment in a qualified health plan through the health insurance exchange, and provide technical assistance for enrollment. Additionally, individuals must be informed of the date they can reapply for Medicaid. Qualified lottery winnings are defined as winnings from state or multistate lotteries. The bill defines \"qualified lump sum\" income as income received as a lump sum from gambling winnings, damages received in lump sums, or liquid assets from a deceased individual's estate. States may recover lottery winnings to pay for Medicaid medical assistance. The Medicare program underwent changes in 2007 and 2011, requiring higher-income enrollees to pay higher premiums for Part B and Part D. Less than 5% of beneficiaries pay these increased premiums, with the federal government subsidizing the majority of costs. Premiums for Medicare Part B and Part D are set at 25.5% of average annual per capita costs, with the federal government subsidizing the remaining 74.5%. Higher-income beneficiaries pay a higher percentage of their per capita expenditures, ranging from 35% to 80%. Income thresholds for joint tax filers are 200% of individual thresholds. Income thresholds for high-income premiums have been frozen at 2010 levels since 2011, with adjustments made annually prior to that. Beginning in 2018, MACRA Section 402 lowers income thresholds for top two groups, adjusting annually for inflation based on CPI-U. No provision for adjustments prior to 2018. Section 403 of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act proposes new income thresholds for Medicare enrollees with annual earnings of $500,000 or more for individuals and $875,000 or more for couples filing jointly. Premiums for those exceeding these thresholds would cover 100% of Parts B and D benefits costs. The top threshold for couples would be 175% of the individual income level, frozen until 2026 and adjusted annually for inflation from 2027 based on the CPI-U."
