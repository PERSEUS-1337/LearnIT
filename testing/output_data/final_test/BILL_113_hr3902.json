Congress acknowledges the extensive database of fingerprints and criminal records maintained by the FBI. Various Acts and statutes have been enacted to facilitate background checks for individuals working with vulnerable populations. Some individuals providing care to children may not undergo comprehensive criminal background checks as required by Federal and State laws. The National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended to include a program for national criminal history background checks. The National Child Protection Act of 1993 is amended to include definitions for terms like 'background check designee', 'covered entity', and 'covered individual' related to individuals with unsupervised access to vulnerable populations served by organizations providing care to children. The term 'criminal history review designee' refers to the entity designated by the Attorney General to carry out the criminal history review program. The program, known as the criminal history review program, is established under subsection (d). A 'qualified State program' is a program of a State authorized agency that provides access to national criminal history background checks as allowed by Federal or State law. The Child Protection Improvements Act of 2013 aims to provide widespread access to criminal history background checks for vulnerable populations, including elderly, disabled, and children. The Attorney General is required to establish policies and procedures for this program within one year of the Act's enactment. The Attorney General is mandated to establish policies and procedures for criminal history background checks for vulnerable populations, with the option to designate Federal Government agencies to carry out these duties. Access to State and National Background Checks is a key component of the program. The Attorney General mandates policies for criminal history background checks for vulnerable populations. The process includes providing information on alternative methods for obtaining background checks, completing a national criminal history check, and submitting fingerprints for the check. The Attorney General mandates policies for criminal history background checks for vulnerable populations, including fingerprints, required documents, and fees. Additionally, a fee is collected to cover the costs of conducting the criminal history review and is remitted to the FBI. The subsection aims to provide covered entities with accurate information on the fitness of individuals responsible for vulnerable populations. The Attorney General establishes procedures to receive criminal history records and determine the individual's fitness based on the records. The subsection aims to convey the fitness and suitability of individuals for caring for vulnerable populations based on specific criteria. Covered entities are directed to consult the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Enforcement Guidance for considerations regarding arrest and conviction records in employment decisions. The Attorney General will use specific criteria from federal laws to evaluate criminal history records of individuals providing care to vulnerable populations. Application processing procedures will be overseen by the Attorney General. The Attorney General establishes the process for obtaining criminal history background checks. Covered individuals can challenge the completeness of their records. The Attorney General determines covered entities. Privacy of information is ensured. Privacy of information is paramount in the handling of fingerprints and criminal history records. Entities authorized to access this information must use it only for specified purposes and maintain strict security measures to ensure confidentiality. Additionally, the FBI follows procedures for the retention of fingerprints. The FBI may retain fingerprints submitted for verification, investigation, or criminal history purposes. This does not replace existing background check programs authorized by law."
