    "content": "The Act titled \"Responsible Arctic Energy Development Act of 2010\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Alaska, as the only Arctic State in the United States, plays a significant role in oil production and holds reserves crucial for future energy security. The Arctic's marine mammals and wildlife are essential for indigenous subsistence, provide nonconsumptive value, and are at risk from oil and gas activities. The region is particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Alaska's vulnerability to oil spills is due to its remote location, cold temperatures, and Arctic wildlife dependence on insulation. The state lacks essential geospatial framework for safe navigation and oil spill response capabilities. The need for a more cohesive approach to address the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of oil and gas development in the Arctic, including better coordination with State, local, and private-sector research programs. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico emphasized the necessity for stronger prevention and response research for future development on the outer Continental Shelf of the United States. Research and action are needed to conduct oil spill prevention. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with other agencies, shall direct research to improve oil spill prevention, response, and recovery in Arctic waters. Research priorities include ecological baselines, critical habitats, and oil spill trajectory models. The research priorities for improving oil spill prevention, response, and recovery in Arctic waters include collecting observational data for response strategies, developing operational monitoring programs, enhancing technologies for cold water oil recovery, and integrating local knowledge into research studies. The research priorities for improving oil spill prevention, response, and recovery in Arctic waters include establishing a geospatial framework for safe navigation and oil spill response through surveying, mapping, charting, geodetic positioning, and monitoring of tides, sea levels, and currents. SEC. 4. ARCTIC OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. Amends Title VI of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 by adding a new section 6003 for Arctic oil and gas development. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, with consultation from the Secretary of the Department of Interior, will use funds from the Responsible Arctic Energy Development Act of 2010 for research on oil spill prevention and response in the Arctic, including establishing response capabilities and studying the effectiveness of strategies like dispersants. Research on the impacts of oil spills in Arctic conditions, including toxicity of dispersants, effects on water column and benthic habitats, black carbon impacts of burning, mechanical oil removal effects, spill response strategies on the food web, options for restoration post-spill, and effects on biota dependent on ice habitats. Tracking and locating oil is also a focus. The curr_chunk discusses the need for research on oil locating and tracking in Arctic conditions, weathering of spilled oil, scientific gap analysis for Arctic energy development, assessment of Arctic species, and monitoring authorized by Alaska Native organizations. The curr_chunk discusses Alaska Native organization marine mammal comanagement agreements, environmental sensitivity mapping, research on Arctic ocean conditions, marine debris projects, and adherence to data management standards. SEC. 5. ARCTIC MARITIME READINESS AND OIL SPILL PREVENTION. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will assess and reduce the risk of maritime disasters in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. This includes prioritizing resources for oil spill prevention, coordination of contingency plans, search and rescue capabilities, and designation of places of refuge. The Coast Guard will evaluate and enhance navigational infrastructure, vessel monitoring systems, and communication infrastructure in the Arctic. They will also conduct shipping traffic risk assessments and integrate local knowledge into prevention and response strategies. SEC. 6. FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is amended to include 2 Vice Chairmen for the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research, with specific duties assigned to each. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is amended to include 2 Vice Chairmen for the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research, with specific duties assigned to each, including coordinating Federal oil pollution research and technology development among Federal agencies, completing a research assessment on prevention and response capabilities, developing a research and technology plan, and prioritizing resources for Arctic waters. The Environmental Sensitivity Indexes focus on identifying ecologically important areas, critical habitats, and migratory behaviors. They also aim to improve oil technologies for collecting observational data essential for safe navigation and response strategies in the event of an oil spill, including data on currents, winds, weather, and waves. The curr_chunk focuses on the development of operational monitoring programs for waves, oil spill monitoring, and ice forecasting. It also includes improvements in cold water oil recovery technologies, integration of local knowledge into research studies, and conducting hydrographic and bathymetric surveys. The curr_chunk involves conducting hydrographic and bathymetric surveys in Arctic waters, with amendments to timelines and department responsibilities. SEC. 7. RISK ASSESSMENT. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research requested the National Research Council to conduct a risk assessment to enhance safety and reduce environmental impacts of industrial activities in Arctic waters by identifying spill prevention and response standards and developing recommendations for measures to prevent and respond to oil spills in the Arctic. The National Research Council will submit a risk assessment on oil spill prevention and response technology in the Arctic to the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. SEC. 8. Exemption of oil pollution research and development projects from environmental impact statement requirement. Testing of oil spill prevention, response, or mitigation technology in Arctic waters is not considered a major Federal action under certain conditions. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Secretary of Commerce must agree that the testing is necessary to advance the technology, no reasonable alternative exists, and the testing does not pose a serious threat to the environment. Actions taken under this provision are not subject to judicial review. SEC. 9. PROCUREMENT OF RESPONSE MATERIALS. The procurement of items for oil pollution prevention, mitigation, response, or cleanup is in the public interest. Any law restricting such procurement is waived. SEC. 10. WAIVER OF RESTRICTIONS ON WATER TESTING OF OIL SPILL RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with other authorities, may waive restrictions to test oil spill response capabilities in US waters. Funding for marine species rescue and recovery is also addressed. Funding of up to $20,000,000 annually is allocated from the Fund for the rescue, rehabilitation, and recovery of marine mammals, birds, and sea turtles affected by oil pollution. Additionally, there is authorization for necessary appropriations to implement this Act and its amendments."
