    "content": "The \"Mortgage Fairness Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes provisions related to the community support obligations of mortgage banks. The \"Mortgage Fairness Act\" mandates that mortgage banks must meet the credit needs of all communities where they operate, especially in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Definitions for terms like \"mortgage bank\" and \"Secretary\" are provided in the Act. The Mortgage Fairness Act mandates the establishment of the Office of Mortgage Bank and Insurance Supervision within the Department of Housing and Urban Development to evaluate the community support performance of mortgage banks and insurance companies. Mortgage banks are required to provide community support statements. The Office mandates mortgage banks to submit biennial community support statements detailing efforts to meet housing credit needs in communities where they operate. Statements must include data required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, underwriting criteria for housing loan products, and descriptions of bank activities. The bank must report on efforts to meet credit needs in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, any violations of credit laws, and any other required information. SEC. 5. MORTGAGE BANK COMMUNITY SUPPORT EVALUATION. The Office evaluates a mortgage bank's community support performance by analyzing data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for the past 2 years, focusing on market share in different neighborhoods, applications from minorities and low-income individuals, and application rejection rates. The Office evaluates a mortgage bank's community support performance by analyzing data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for the past 2 years, focusing on market share in different neighborhoods, applications from minority and white applicants, evidence of illegal discriminatory credit practices, and public comment period of at least 90 days. Penalties may be imposed on mortgage banks for inadequate community support performance. If a mortgage bank lacks community support, the Secretary can require a community support action plan with specific goals and timelines. The bank may be prohibited from using certain programs until deficiencies are addressed. Cease and desist orders can be issued if a bank violates the Secretary's orders regarding community support. The Secretary may issue an order requiring a mortgage bank to cease and desist from violations and take affirmative action to prevent further violations. The order must include notice of charges and facts constituting the alleged violation, and it remains effective for a specified period. The Secretary may issue an order to a mortgage bank to cease violations and take preventive action. The order becomes effective upon service to the mortgagee and remains enforceable unless modified or rescinded. The mortgage bank has the right to a hearing within 20 days of receiving the order. Additionally, a judicial hearing must be held within 10 days after the order is issued. Within 10 days of receiving a cease-and-desist order, a mortgage bank can seek an injunction from the United States district court to suspend the order. The Secretary can also seek judicial enforcement in the appropriate court jurisdiction. The Secretary can impose a civil money penalty on a mortgage bank, its directors, officers, or employees for violating any order issued under subsection (a) or (b), with the penalty amount determined by the Secretary. The Secretary can impose civil money penalties for violations of orders issued under subsections (a) and (b), with penalties of $10,000 per month for violations under subsection (a) and $10,000 per day for violations under subsection (b). Before imposing a penalty, the Secretary must inform the Attorney General. Penalties can be assessed and collected by written notice. If no hearing is requested within the allowed time, an assessment becomes a final order. The Secretary can adjust or waive penalties imposed. Factors considered include the seriousness of the offense and past violations. Factors considered when assessing civil money penalties include the person's history of violations, ability to pay, public injury, benefits received from the violation, deterrent effect on future violations, and other factors determined by the Secretary. The person has the right to a hearing within 20 days of the assessment, and unpaid penalties may be referred for collection. The Secretary can refer unpaid assessments to the Attorney General for collection in court. Penalties collected will go to the Treasury. The Secretary will establish procedures for implementing this subsection. SEC. 7. Community support requirements for mortgage insurance companies. Mortgage insurance companies must report policy details by census tract, applicant demographics, and application outcomes. They must also show support for community credit needs and disclose underwriting criteria. Additionally, every 2 years, they must submit a report on the availability of mortgage insurance. The Office conducts biennial community support reviews of mortgage insurance companies, analyzing policy distribution by census tract and disparate treatment of applicants based on race, gender, and income. The Secretary reviews mortgage insurance companies based on underwriting criteria, community support statements, and public comments. Public comments are solicited for at least 90 days before issuing findings. The Secretary reviews mortgage insurance companies for community support performance. If a company is found lacking, they may be required to submit a plan for improvement."
