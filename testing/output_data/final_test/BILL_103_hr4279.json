    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Studies Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that the tobacco industry spends billions on advertising cigarettes and has a voluntary code to prevent youth smoking. The code prohibits health claims and certain suggestive advertising practices. Despite the voluntary advertising code in the tobacco industry, studies have shown that cigarette advertising plays a role in encouraging youth, women, and minorities to start smoking and continue the habit. The Congress acknowledges the increasing number of young female smokers and the impact of cigarette advertising on this demographic. Between 2005 and 2010, more women are expected to die from smoking-related diseases than men. Tobacco kills over 147,000 women annually in the US, mainly from heart disease and lung cancer. Lung cancer in women has risen due to increased smoking, surpassing breast cancer as the top cancer killer. Even smoking 1 to 4 cigarettes a day can triple the risk of heart attack for women. Smoking prevalence among women increased in 1991, and smoking during pregnancy raises the risk of low birth weight and premature infants. Pregnant women who smoke are at risk for low birth weight and premature infants, miscarriage, stillbirths, sudden infant death syndrome, and infant mortality. Smoking during pregnancy leads to babies being shorter and lighter, with a higher rate of fetal and infant death. Approximately 44 percent of women who smoke have tried to quit in the past year. Cigarette smoking also increases the risk of cervical cancer in women. Tobacco companies target African-Americans and Hispanics in urban areas. In 1991, 29.2% of African-American adults smoked, with higher rates among men. Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native adults also had significant smoking rates in 1991. In 1991, smoking rates were high among American Indian/Alaskan Native adults, with 27.9% of men and 35.2% of women smoking. Among Hispanic adults, 20.2% smoked, with higher rates among men. African Americans have higher rates of tobacco-related diseases compared to whites, including higher incidences of certain cancers. Lung cancer is on the rise among Hispanic men. SEC. 3. TOBACCO ADVERTISING STUDIES. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct studies on tobacco advertising targeting women, minorities, and weight loss themes. The focus is on determining the appeal of advertising to these groups and its impact on tobacco use. Additionally, the extent of alcohol advertising targeting women and minorities will be reviewed. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on cigarette advertising targeting girls and women, specifically focusing on messages related to weight loss and maintenance. The study will examine the impact of advertising imagery on perceptions of tobacco use and weight control among girls and women. The Federal Trade Commission will examine if terms like \"slim\", \"light\", \"thin\", and imagery in cigarette advertising imply weight loss or maintenance for women. They will also assess if women understand the actual effects of smoking on weight, including the temporary nature of any weight loss.

They will also assess the perception of risk reduction by consumers and differences in perception between male and female smokers. Additionally, they will investigate how men and women interpret the wording and imagery in advertising and promotion of low yield cigarettes. The Federal Trade Commission will evaluate the health hazards of cigarettes, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and pulmonary diseases. They will also analyze if smokers are influenced to switch to low yield cigarettes instead of quitting due to advertising. The Commission will examine differences between male and female smokers in their concerns about smoking's negative impact on health. The Federal Trade Commission will assess the impact of low yield cigarettes on men's and women's health compared to quitting smoking. They will also determine if the Commission has the authority to regulate advertising of low yield cigarettes and what legislation may be necessary for them to take action. Demographics of targeted audiences for cigarette advertising will also be studied. The Federal Trade Commission will study the demographics targeted by cigarette advertising and promotions, focusing on girls, women, and minorities. This includes age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic groups, as well as the media used to target these groups, including publications with readers under 18.
