    "content": "The \"Border Security Enhancement Act of 2006\" is also known as the Alien Smuggler Prosecution Act, which aims to effectively prosecute alien smugglers. Alien smuggling is a lucrative and dangerous business, generating billions in revenue annually. Smuggled migrants face abuse and exploitation, putting them at risk of physical harm and even death. This poses a significant threat as criminal and terrorist organizations exploit these operations to smuggle their members into the United States. The text highlights the risks of alien smuggling, including injury, abuse, and death. It emphasizes the need for uniform guidelines for prosecuting smuggling offenses to address the overwhelming workload faced by border-area United States attorneys and to deter additional smuggling activities. The Congress urges the Attorney General to adopt these guidelines within three months of the enactment of the Act. In each fiscal year from 2008 to 2013, the Attorney General must increase the number of attorneys in the offices of United States attorneys by at least 20 to prosecute cases under section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. TITLE II--CRIMINAL ALIEN REMOVAL ACT\n\nSEC. 201. EXPEDITED REMOVAL FOR ALIENS INADMISSIBLE ON CRIMINAL GROUNDS. Section 238(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to give the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in removal proceedings for criminal aliens. The time limit for detention is reduced to 7 calendar days. The Secretary of Homeland Security replaces the Attorney General in various paragraphs. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to grant the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in removal proceedings for criminal aliens. The Secretary may determine inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2) and issue removal orders. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow for removal of certain aliens without formal removal proceedings, effective upon enactment but not applicable to aliens already in removal proceedings under section 240. TITLE III--BORDER TUNNEL PREVENTION ACT OF 2006\n\nSEC. 301. CONSTRUCTION OF BORDER TUNNEL OR PASSAGE. The Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2006 amends Chapter 27 of title 18, United States Code, to address the construction and use of unauthorized tunnels or passages crossing the international border. It imposes penalties for knowingly constructing or financing such tunnels, permitting their use on owned or controlled land, and using them for unlawful activities like smuggling aliens, goods, controlled substances, or weapons of mass destruction. The Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2006 amends Chapter 27 of title 18, United States Code to address penalties for using unauthorized tunnels or passages for unlawful activities like smuggling controlled substances, weapons of mass destruction, or being a member of a terrorist organization. Penalties are doubled if such tunnels are used for illegal activities. The Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2006 amends Section 554 regarding border tunnels and passages. Criminal forfeiture under Section 982(a)(6) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding \"554,\" before \"1425.\" Additionally, there is a directive to the United States Sentencing Commission in Section 302. The United States Sentencing Commission will amend sentencing guidelines to increase penalties for offenses under Section 554 of title 18, United States Code. This includes ensuring guidelines reflect the seriousness of these offenses and providing appropriate base offense levels while considering aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The United States Sentencing Commission will amend sentencing guidelines to increase penalties for offenses under Section 554 of title 18, United States Code. This includes considering aggravating or mitigating circumstances, ensuring consistency with other directives, and meeting the purposes of sentencing set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code."
