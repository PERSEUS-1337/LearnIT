Over 3,500 Medals of Honor have been awarded to nearly 3,500 recipients, with 19 double recipients. There has been a reluctance to award the medal more than once to the same person since World War I. The standards for awarding this honor have evolved over time. The Medal of Honor is the highest award for bravery in the United States, with strict regulations for judging eligibility. The deed must be proven by at least two eyewitnesses, be outstanding beyond the call of duty, involve risking one's life, and be free from justified criticism. Recommendations for the Army or Air Force must be made within 2 years and awarded within 3 years, while for the Navy, recommendations must be made within 3 years and awarded within 5 years. The Medal of Honor is awarded for acts of bravery or self-sacrifice in combat, presented by a high official in the name of Congress. It can also be awarded for individual exploits in peacetime, such as Charles Lindbergh's navigation skills. The Medal of Honor is awarded for acts of bravery in combat or individual exploits in peacetime, like Charles Lindbergh's nonstop flight from New York to Paris in 1927. It is the highest decoration in the Armed Forces and has been awarded under various circumstances, including to civilians like Buffalo Bill Cody and Mary Edwards Walker, the only woman to receive the medal. Mary Edwards Walker, the only woman to receive the Medal of Honor, was allegedly awarded it during the Civil War to placate her after the termination of her contract with the Army. In 1916, a board was created to review the cases of those who had already received the award, resulting in nearly one-third of the 2,625 awarded medals being canceled. In 1918, Congress amended existing laws to authorize the President to present the Medal of Honor to individuals who display gallantry and intrepidity in action involving conflict with an enemy. Policies and guidance were provided to commanders regarding the award for the Army and other services. Under current law, the President may award the Medal of Honor to individuals who display gallantry and intrepidity in action against an enemy, with examples of citations included in the Appendix. The medal is presented in the name of Congress for distinguished acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty. The DOD Manual of Military Decorations & Awards provides procedures for recommending and presenting the Medal of Honor to individuals who display gallantry in action against an enemy. The manual outlines the process from nomination through the chain of command and congressional consideration. The DOD Manual of Military Decorations & Awards outlines procedures for recommending the Medal of Honor. The Secretary of the Military Department establishes processing procedures for MoH recommendations, including endorsements from Combatant Commanders and Service Chiefs. Recommendations endorsed by the Military Department Secretary are forwarded to the Secretary of Defense through the USD(P&R) and CJCS for approval within statutory time limits. The process for recommending the Medal of Honor involves specific time limits for each branch of the military, as outlined in Title 10 of the United States Code. Members of Congress can also request consideration for a MOH proposal that was not previously submitted in a timely manner. The process for restoration of a rescinded Medal of Honor is different and involves an appeal to the appropriate Board for Correction of Military Records. If recommended for reinstatement, the decision goes to the service Secretary and then the President for final approval. The presentation of the MoH is made by the President in a formal ceremony in Washington, D.C. To prevent premature disclosure, public comments should not be made on any MoH case under consideration. MoH recommendations are handled on a \"FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\" basis until officially announced. Recipients are entitled to a monthly pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Enlisted recipients who retire with 20 or more years of Military Service receive a 10-percent increase in retired pay, not to exceed the 75 percent maximum. Recipients are issued a special MoH Travel and Identification Card signed by the Secretary of the Military Department, allowing the use of military air transportation. MoH recipients may wear their uniforms at any time or place they choose and are issued a DOD Identification Card for commissary and exchange privileges. Use of morale, welfare, and recreation activities, honorary club membership without dues, and special benefits for children of MoH recipients are authorized. MoH recipients receive invitations to Presidential inaugurations and a special engraved headstone from the VA. They should receive on-base billeting and permissive health care benefits. Requests for military awards, including the MoH, are generally initiated by the recipient. Requests for military awards, like the Medal of Honor (MoH), are typically initiated by the military commander or those familiar with combat situations. Recommendations for awards should come from those who can observe individual actions under stress. Members of Congress may also advocate for individuals to receive the MoH through legislation detailing their background and exploits. The Medal of Honor (MoH) is often requested through legislation by Congress, bypassing time restrictions in Title 10 U.S. Code. Congressional hearings may be held to discuss the award, with requests varying based on military commander recommendations. Tables list bills introduced in Congress for the MoH, and the handling of requests depends on the origin of the recommendation. The Medal of Honor (MoH) is typically requested through legislation by Congress, bypassing time restrictions in Title 10 U.S. Code. Requests for consideration of the MoH are usually not favored unless the individual was originally recommended but did not receive the award due to extenuating circumstances. Specific findings of fact are required in such cases, and a review may be conducted by the Board of Correction for Military Records (BCMR). If no original recommendation was made, extensive and reliable findings of valid facts must be provided for further consideration. In cases where no original recommendation was made for the Medal of Honor (MoH), the Board of Correction for Military Records (BCMR) may not be involved in the consideration process. Without factual data supporting the award and compelling reasons for it to be awarded at a later date, it is unlikely that the MoH will be awarded, especially if a significant amount of time has passed and eyewitnesses are unavailable. Legislation seeking to award the MoH is often introduced but may not progress if executive comments are unfavorable. In recent times, there have been instances where the Medal of Honor (MoH) was awarded or reinstated outside of statutory time limits. Examples include Master Sergeant Roy Benavidez receiving the MoH in 1981 after a delay, and Marine Colonel Donald G. Cook's family receiving his MoH in 1980 for his services as a POW in North Vietnam. Colonel Cook's Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously for his heroics as a POW in North Vietnam. President Carter awarded the medal to former Army Lieutenant Colonel Matt Urban in 1980 for his WWII service. Former Army chaplain Charles Liteky renounced his Medal of Honor in protest in 1986. On April 24, 1991, President George H. W. Bush awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously to Corporal Freddie Stowers, the only African American to receive the MoH for World War I. The Army reviewed citation records to ensure fair treatment of African Americans. Another controversial case involved Civil War surgeon Mary Edwards Walker, awarded the MoH in 1865, with debates over the reasons for her recognition. The Medal of Honor awarded to Civil War surgeon Mary Edwards Walker in 1865 was initially rescinded by the Army due to her not being a member of the Armed Forces and her services not meeting the criteria of gallantry or heroism. After intervention from Congress and then-President Carter, her medal was restored in 1977, although the decision remains contentious. President Carter awarded Marine Corps veteran Anthony Casamento the Medal of Honor despite military officials arguing he should only receive the Navy Cross. Critics claim the timing of the award was politically motivated. Relatives of Buffalo Bill Cody sought reinstatement of his medal following the example of Dr. Walker's reinstatement. Buffalo Bill Cody's Medal of Honor was reinstated by the U.S. Army Board of Correction of Military Records in June 1989, following the recommendation of a U.S. Senator. This decision also led to the reinstatement of medals for four other individuals. Efforts to award or reinstate the Medal of Honor have been challenging, as seen in the case of Navy Seaman Doris Miller. Advocates have long sought to upgrade Navy Seaman Doris Miller's award to the Medal of Honor for his heroics during the Pearl Harbor attack. Despite initial recognition with a Navy Cross and a destroyer escort named in his honor, efforts to upgrade his award have been unsuccessful, with critics attributing the refusal to racism during WWII. Critics attribute the refusal to upgrade Navy Seaman Doris Miller's award to the Medal of Honor to racism during WWII. The reluctance to upgrade awards is based on maintaining the integrity of the award and avoiding retroactive requests. Two Medals of Honor have gone unclaimed, including one awarded to Navy Chief Peter Tomich in 1942. In 1996, Congress enacted language that waived time limitations on awards for acts of valor during the Vietnam era and for those serving in intelligence activities from 1940-1990. The Secretary of each military department was instructed to review requests for consideration of awards and decorations. In 1996, Congress waived time limitations on awards for acts of valor during the Vietnam era and for intelligence activities from 1940-1990. The Secretary of each military department reviewed requests for awards, filing reports with congressional committees and making recommendations to improve award procedures for military intelligence personnel. Intelligence activities records are sealed for many years, making those involved often ineligible for the Medal of Honor. Individuals involved in intelligence activities may not be eligible to receive the Medal of Honor due to the classified nature of their work. Congress waived time limitations for awards related to valor during the Vietnam era and intelligence activities from 1940-1990. There have been efforts to review and potentially upgrade awards such as the Distinguished Service Cross and Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor for Asian American or Native American Pacific Islanders who served during World War II. The Army conducted a review to upgrade 22 Asian-Pacific American recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor, including Senator Daniel K. Inouye. The Navy, however, decided not to upgrade its sole Asian-Pacific American DSC recipient. The review process for upgrading American DSC recipients was seen as overdue recognition by some and criticized as race-based political correctness by others. Congress included a section for consideration of military decorations not previously submitted in a timely fashion, allowing for review and determination of award approvals. The Secretary determines the approval of awards or decorations, submitting findings to Congress. Options include approval, waiver recommendations, exceptions to policy, or disapproval. Members of Congress can request the Secretary to consider military decorations, allowing them to fulfill their oversight duties. Critics argue this could politicize the process. In 1996, the White House announced plans to award the Medal of Honor to seven African American soldiers from WWII, despite restrictions on premature discussions. The White House announced plans to award the Medal of Honor to seven African American soldiers from WWII, including Vernon J. Baker, Edward A. Carter, John R. Fox, Willy F. James Jr., Ruben Rivers, Charles L. Thomas, and George Watson. President Clinton awarded the Medal of Honor to retired U.S. Marine Corps Major General James Day for his heroism during the battle for Okinawa in 1945. The original paperwork for his award was lost, but carbon copies of the recommendation were found. Former U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Robert Ingram was also awarded the Medal of Honor after it was discovered that he had never been decorated for his heroism. In 1984, President Reagan awarded the Medal of Honor to a Vietnam veteran at the Tomb of the Unknowns. In 1998, the remains were identified as Air Force 1st Lieutenant Michael Blassie. His family requested to keep the medal, but the Pentagon denied, stating it was a symbolic award for all fallen servicemembers. The controversy surrounding the Medal of Honor (MoH) involved efforts to award it to African American servicemembers in the World Wars. In 1996, Congress waived time restraints to consider awarding the MoH to Theodore Roosevelt for his actions in the Spanish-American War. Despite reported Army opposition, President Clinton signed the bill. In 1996, President Clinton signed bill H.R. 2263 into law as P.L. 105-371, despite Army opposition, to award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt. Representatives of \"Buffalo Soldiers\" claimed it would credit Roosevelt for their success in battle, while others saw it as an opportunity to correct a 100-year slight. Congress had previously passed P.L. 103-322 in 1994 regarding military medals and decorations. The Stolen Valor Act of 2005, signed into law by President George W. Bush, makes it a federal misdemeanor to falsely claim to have received a U.S. military decoration or medal, punishable by fines or imprisonment. The law specifically addresses the misrepresentation of receiving a Congressional Medal of Honor, with defined consequences for such actions. In 2007, Xavier Alvarez, a water district board member in Southern California, falsely claimed to have received the Medal of Honor, leading to legal charges. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 in 2012, citing it as unconstitutional due to its infringement on free speech rights. The Supreme Court overturned the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 in 2012, leading to the introduction of the Stolen Valor Act of 2013 in the 113th Congress. President Obama signed the new law, making it a federal crime to fraudulently claim military decorations for personal gain. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 called for a review of veteran war records to ensure deserving individuals were not denied the Medal of Honor due to prejudice. The 2002 act was amended to allow deserving soldiers, including those of Hispanic, Jewish, or African American descent, to be honored with the Medal of Honor. In 2014, 24 recipients were honored, the largest group since WWII, due to initial bias. President Obama presented Medals of Honor to these recipients on March 18, 2014. For more details on the recipients, visit the Valor 24 website at http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/. President Obama awarded Medals of Honor to soldiers for their valor in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The Distinguished Service Cross recipients had their awards upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Medals of Honor were also given to living servicemembers from Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2014, Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Army Sergeant Kyle J. White for his bravery in Afghanistan. Retired Marine Corporal William \"Kyle\" Carpenter also received the Medal of Honor. President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to retired Marine Corporal William \"Kyle\" Carpenter for shielding fellow Marines from a grenade blast, resulting in severe injuries. Army Staff Sergeant Ryan M. Pitts also received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during combat in Afghanistan. Pitts is the most recent living recipient of the Medal of Honor for valor in Afghanistan or Iraq, awarded by President Obama. Adkins and Sloat received Medals of Honor for actions in Vietnam, with Sloat's awarded posthumously. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2014 authorized the award of the Medal of Honor to Union Army First. Section 569 of the law authorized the Medal of Honor for Union Army First Lieutenant Alonzo H. Cushing for valor during the Civil War, specifically at the Battle of Gettysburg. President Obama presented the medal to Cushing's cousin twice-removed, Helen Loring Ensign, in 2014. Section 572 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 authorized the Medal of Honor for two members of the Armed Forces for valor during World War I. During World War I, Army Sergeant William Shemin and Army Private Henry Lincoln Johnson were awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously by President Obama in 2015. Shemin had previously received the Distinguished Service Cross, while Johnson had been awarded the French Croix de Guerre and later the Army Distinguished Service Cross in 2003. President Obama presented Private Johnson's medal to Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson at a White House ceremony. President Obama presented Sergeant Shemin's Medal of Honor to his daughters, acknowledging his overlooked contributions and heroism as a Jewish American in uniform. Sergeant Shemin and Private Johnson were both inducted into the Pentagon's Hall of Heroes in 2015. Several bills were introduced in Congress to award the Medal of Honor, including H.R. 136. Several bills were introduced in Congress to honor Medal of Honor recipients, including renaming government facilities and designating a segment of Interstate Route 10 in Texas. This bill became P.L. 114-49 on August 7, 2015.
