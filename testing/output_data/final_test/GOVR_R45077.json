    "content": "The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs through the FFDCA. User fees collected from the industry fund FDA's review of brand-name and generic animal drug applications. The collection of user fees for brand-name animal drugs was authorized in 2003 to address delays in product review. Fees for brand-name and generic animal drugs are authorized to sunset at five-year intervals, reauthorized in laws known as ADUFA II and ADUFA III in 2008 and 2013. FDA has published negotiation results with animal drug sponsors, referred to as ADUFA IV. User fees for generic animal drugs were first authorized in 2009 under AGDUFA I, coinciding with ADUFA II. AGDUFA was reauthorized in 2013 as AGDUFA II, due to sunset in FY2018. FDA has also published negotiation results with generic animal drug sponsors, known as AGDUFA III. Appendix A provides legislative histories and key statistics for both user fee programs. FDA uses fee revenue for the review process of brand-name and generic animal drugs, covering application review, facility inspections, research oversight, regulation issuance, and labeling review. Sunset provisions in FDA user fee authorities set reauthorization timelines, different from appropriations. Despite lapsed authorization, HHS agencies can continue work using general authorities. The FDA relies on fee revenue for reviewing brand-name and generic animal drugs, including application review, inspections, research oversight, regulation issuance, and labeling review. Sunset provisions in FDA user fee authorities set reauthorization timelines, different from appropriations. A lapse in user fee authority prohibits payment to FDA review personnel, potentially leading to layoffs of specialized animal drug review staff. User fee reauthorizations are crucial, as Congress consistently reauthorizes them before sunset dates. FDA's authority for reviewing animal drugs is in FFDCA Section 512, with regulations in 21 C.F.R. Chapter I, Subchapter E. FDA does not oversee veterinary biologics. The FDA's Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE) determines the approval of new animal drug applications. To be approved for commercial use, a new animal drug must meet five standards: safety for animals, humans consuming treated food, and drug administrators; effectiveness for intended uses; quality manufacturing following Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. The FDA must ensure that animal drugs are properly labeled to inform users about usage, safety considerations, and storage. Additionally, environmental impact must be considered during the review process, as mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act. The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act was enacted in 2004 to address concerns about the availability of certain animal drugs. The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2004 addresses concerns about availability of certain animal drugs, allowing conditional approval and marketing exclusivity for minor species. FDA monitors safety and effectiveness post-market. The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1988 created an expedited pathway for the review of generic animal drugs, allowing sponsors to submit an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) to FDA for premarket review. This pathway avoids the need for full NADA required for brand-name animal drugs by establishing that the generic animal drug is the same as the reference-listed new animal drug product. The ANADA pathway allows for the expedited review of generic animal drugs by demonstrating similarity to the reference-listed brand drug in terms of active ingredients, dosage form, bioequivalence, and labeling. Additional requirements include an environmental assessment and submission of necessary information. FDA regulates drugs used in food-producing animals to ensure public health and environmental impacts are considered. This includes setting tolerances and withdrawal periods for drug residues in animal tissues and limiting extra-label prescribing by veterinarians. Veterinarians can prescribe medications off-label for animals, but there are limitations for food-producing animals to prevent harmful drug residues in the food supply. FDA emphasizes judicious use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals to prevent antimicrobial resistance that can affect human health. In 2010, FDA published guidance limiting antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals to necessary uses for animal health, with veterinary oversight. This restricted new approvals to drugs effective against specific diseases and eliminated over-the-counter uses. In 2013, FDA required sponsors to demonstrate effectiveness for disease treatment or prevention, or withdraw approvals. In January 2017, FDA completed a process resulting in 84 voluntary product withdrawals and enhanced controls over remaining products in food-producing animals. Feed mills, under increased scrutiny since the Animal Drug Availability Act of 1996, produce blended feed mixtures with vitamins, minerals, and sometimes drugs. FDA expanded the role of veterinarians in antimicrobial drug use in blended feeds through the Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015 to ensure safe use in food-producing animals. Animal Drug Sales and Distribution. FDA requires drug sponsors to report annually on the amount of antimicrobial drugs sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals. Sponsors are now required to provide estimates of sales broken out by major food-producing species. This information is valuable for monitoring antimicrobial resistance. Regulatory authorities for FDA's oversight of animal drugs in food-producing animals are permanent and not subject to sunset provisions. The FDA's budget has two funding streams: annual appropriations and industry user fees. User fees accounted for 43% of the total budget in FY2016. The Center for Veterinary Medicine oversees the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs. Reauthorization of ADUFA/AGDUFA focuses on animal drug issues, with Congress considering amendments during the process. Financial reports detail spending on ADUFA and AGDUFA. FDA financial reports detail the total spending on ADUFA and AGDUFA programs, showing the percentage from user fees and nonuser fee appropriations. Revenue from these programs supports CVM, ORA, and FDA headquarters. Animal drug user fees have been increasing since FY2004, with 20% of ADUFA costs covered by user fees in FY2005. In FY2016, user fees provided 34% of ADUFA total costs, while appropriations covered 66%. Generic animal drug user fees have been increasing since FY2009, comprising 59% of AGDUFA total costs in FY2016. Congress authorized user fees for brand-name animal drug review in 2003 in response to concerns from animal drug sponsors. The user fee program for human drugs was established a decade earlier, and sponsors argued for similar fees for animal drugs to counter review backlogs. Current law authorizes four types of user fees for brand-name animal drugs, with fee amounts adjusted annually for inflation and workload. ADUFA III allowed for fee increases to provide for operating reserves. The four types of brand-name animal drug user fees include application and supplement fees. The animal drug user fees include application and supplement fees, product fees, establishment fees, and sponsor fees. These fees are based on a percentage of estimated revenue and are set annually by the Secretary. The statutory fee revenue amounts for FY2014-FY2018 are established by ADUFA III. The Secretary may waive or reduce annual fees for animal drug applications under certain conditions, such as significant barriers to innovation, expected review costs exceeding fees, medicated feed use, MUMS indication, or if the sponsor is a small business. FDA's annual ADUFA financial reports detail waivers and reductions granted. FDA can only collect user fees for animal drug review if specific funding conditions are met each year. ADUFA requires FDA to collect user fees for animal drug review only if certain funding conditions are met each year. The Secretary must submit performance and financial reports to Congress annually. In FY2011, FDA introduced eSubmitter to enhance review efficiency. In FY2015 and FY2016, around 70% of animal drug review submissions were made electronically through eSubmitter to improve efficiency. FDA exceeded its ADUFA III performance goals for FY2015 and the first three quarters of FY2016. FDA is required to develop recommendations for FY2019-FY2023 in consultation with various stakeholders before reauthorization negotiations with industry. Public input, meetings, and comment periods are part of the process. FDA must hold discussions with representatives of veterinary, patient, and consumer advocacy groups during negotiations with industry for reauthorization. Recommendations are presented to congressional committees, published in the Federal Register, and open to public comment. Meeting minutes are posted on the FDA website. Proposed ADUFA IV changes are summarized on the FDA website, with draft recommendations available for review. The proposed ADUFA IV agreement with industry includes requirements for electronic submissions, retention of performance goals from ADUFA III, and addition of new performance goals for certain applications. Changes to ADUFA III authority include continuing inflation and workload adjustments, with base years reset to FY2014 through FY2018. The proposed FY2019 baseline for ADUFA IV is $30,331,240, including a $400,000 one-time cost for IT enhancement. FY2020-FY2023 would adjust revenue for inflation and workload, allocate $900,000/year for research, eliminate final year offset provision, and authorize fee adjustments by the Secretary. Total five-year revenue for ADUFA IV estimated at $150 million, with fee distribution remaining the same as ADUFA III. The proposed ADUFA IV would codify draft agreement proposals, amend definitions related to animal drug applications, and add an exemption from fees for certain labeling supplements. FDA is required to review and act on ANADAs within 180 days, but in FY2007, the average review time was 570 days with a backlog of 446 submissions. In 2008, Congress passed legislation allowing FDA to collect user fees from generic animal drug sponsors to support the review of ANADAs, supplemental applications, and investigational submissions. AGDUFA requires FDA to meet certain performance goals negotiated with the industry in exchange for collecting user fees. The law authorizes the collection of three types of user fees, with set amounts adjusted annually for workload. The AGDUFA legislation allows FDA to collect user fees from generic animal drug sponsors to support the review of ANADAs, supplemental applications, and investigational submissions. The fee amounts include a fixed 4% inflation adjustment and a final year adjustment for operating reserves. Three types of generic animal drug user fees are: Abbreviated application fee, Product fee, and Sponsor fee. The AGDUFA legislation allows FDA to collect user fees from generic animal drug sponsors for the review of ANADAs, supplemental applications, and investigational submissions. The law requires annual fees to be set and published in the Federal Register at least 60 days before each fiscal year. Waivers and reductions may be granted for drugs intended solely for a MUMS indication. Funding triggers are in place to ensure user fees supplement appropriated funds. The AGDUFA legislation allows FDA to collect user fees for generic animal drug review under certain conditions. FDA can only collect fees if nonuser fee appropriations for FDA activities remain at a certain level, and if appropriations for activities related to generic animal drug review also meet a specified level. The legislation also includes triggers to limit the amount of user fees collected. Additionally, the Secretary must submit performance and financial reports to Congress annually. The AGDUFA legislation allows FDA to collect user fees for generic animal drug review under certain conditions. AGDUFA I eliminated a backlog of 680 submissions, reduced submission review times, and met performance goals. AGDUFA II continued review performance goals, added flexibility, electronic submission capability, and exceeded performance goals for FY2015 and FY2016. AGDUFA II sets process for reauthorization, involves consultations with various groups, public input, negotiations with industry, and presentation of recommendations to congressional committees. The FDA is required to present recommendations to congressional committees, publish them in the Federal Register, allow a 30-day public comment period, hold a public meeting for stakeholder views, and revise recommendations as needed. Minutes of negotiation meetings with industry must be posted on the FDA website. The draft AGDUFA III agreement proposes to continue commitments from AGDUFA II, such as allowing two-phased technical section submissions and improving review processes. The draft AGDUFA III agreement proposes changes to AGDUFA II, including requiring electronic submissions starting in FY2019, adjusting inflation based on payroll costs and the Consumer Price Index, and setting a baseline of $18,336,340 for FY2019. Annual revenue amounts for FY2020-FY2023 will be adjusted for inflation and workload, with the elimination of the final year offset provision. The draft AGDUFA III agreement proposes changes to AGDUFA II, including adjusting inflation based on payroll costs and the Consumer Price Index, setting a baseline for FY2019, and making excess collections available to enhance the review process in real time. The planned total five-year revenue for AGDUFA III is $95 million, compared to $38.1 million for AGDUFA II and $27.1 million for AGDUFA I. AGDUFA III would also amend the definition of the review process for generic new animal drugs and add an exemption from fees for certain labeling supplements. The curr_chunk discusses an exemption from fees for certain labeling supplements in relation to FDA Animal Drug User Fee Programs."
