    "content": "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), also known as the Lightning II, is a strike fighter aircraft being procured for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement effort with an estimated total cost of $325.1 billion. The proposed FY2019 defense budget includes $10.7 billion for the procurement of 48 F-35As, 20 F-35Bs, and 9 F-35Cs, as well as continued development. The proposed budget includes $1.3 billion for F-35 research and development. The F-35 program aims to provide affordable fifth-generation aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. All three versions of the F-35 will have advanced stealth characteristics and the ability to go supersonic. The F-35 program aims to provide affordable fifth-generation aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is being procured in three versions tailored to the military services' needs, with differences in takeoff, landing, fuel capacity, and carrier suitability. The Air Force plans to procure 1,763 F-35As to replace F-16 and A-10 aircraft, serving as a complement to the F-22 Raptor. The F-35A is designed to be more capable in air-to-ground combat and stealthier than the F-22. The F-35 program aims to provide affordable fifth-generation aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is being procured in three versions tailored to the military services' needs. The Air Force plans to procure 1,763 F-35As to replace F-16 and A-10 aircraft, serving as a complement to the F-22 Raptor. The F-35A is designed to be more capable in air-to-ground combat and stealthier than the F-22. The F-22/F-35A combination is seen as the Air Force's future high-low mix, with unique and essential capabilities for maintaining superiority in conflict. The Marine Corps plans to procure 353 F-35Bs to replace AV-8B Harrier and F/A-18A/B/C/D aircraft. The Marine Corps decided to wait for the F-35B instead of procuring the F/A-18E/F because they prefer aircraft capable of vertical operations. The F-35B will provide sophisticated sensor capabilities and fifth-generation strike fighter capabilities for the Marine Air Ground Task Force. The Navy plans to procure 273 F-35Cs for carrier operations, and the Marines will also procure 67 F-35Cs. The F-35C is known as the \"CV\" version for aircraft carriers. The Navy plans to operate carrier air wings with a mix of F/A-18E/Fs and F-35Cs. The F/A-18E/F is a fourth-generation strike fighter, while the F-35C is the Navy's first stealth aircraft. The F-35C is more expensive but stealthier than the F/A-18E/F. The F-35 program aims to reduce acquisition costs and enhance interoperability with other services and partner nations. The F-35 is powered by the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, derived from the F-22's F119 engine. Rolls-Royce builds the vertical lift system for the F-35B. An alternate engine program, the F136, was developed by GE Transportation\u2014Aircraft Engines and Rolls-Royce PLC. Congress funded the F-35 alternate engine program through FY2006. The George W. Bush and Obama Administrations proposed terminating the F-35 alternate engine program, but Congress rejected the proposals and continued funding. The General Electric/Rolls Royce Fighter Engine Team ended their effort to provide an alternate engine in 2011. The F-35 is currently in low-rate initial production, with 280 aircraft delivered as of April 2018, and production is scheduled to increase to 120 per year by 2019. The F-35 program is in low-rate initial production, with 280 aircraft delivered as of April 2018, set to increase to 120 per year by 2019. The acquisition plan includes system development and demonstration (SDD) until April 11, 2018, with testing ongoing. The latest developments include multiyear contracting intentions and a production profile assumption for the USAF. The Department of Navy (DoN) plans for multi-year procurements from FY 2021-2023, followed by 5-year multi-year procurements starting in FY 2024, with necessary investments and savings. The F-35 Joint Program Office completed the 17-year System Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort, conducting over 9,200 sorties and accumulating 17,000 flight hours. The F-35 Joint Program Office completed the 17-year System Development and Demonstration (SDD) effort, conducting over 9,200 sorties and accumulating 17,000 flight hours. The end of the flight test effort does not mark the actual end of SDD, though; that will occur at Milestone C, following the completion of initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E). Preparations for IOT&E are progressing, with the Navy expecting entry in September 2018. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation notes that IOT&E likely will not be completed until the end of 2019, with over 600 aircraft already built. The F-35 is an international program with commitments from program partners and other countries to share in development costs and acquire aircraft. The latest Selected Acquisition Report projects 741 international sales\u2014609 to partners. The latest Selected Acquisition Report projects 741 international sales\u2014609 to partners in the program and 132 through foreign military sales. Australia, Belgium, and Canada have made recent decisions regarding their F-35 orders. Denmark has confirmed an order for 27 F-35As. Denmark has confirmed an order for 27 F-35As, with a possibility of increasing to 30. Japan's initial reported buy of 42 F-35s may increase to 68. Norway has received 10 out of 52 planned jets. The Netherlands has received 2 out of 37 planned aircraft. Singapore is still considering the F-35. South Korea is looking to order more F-35s. The F-35 program's overhead structure is debated, with proponents arguing it is not needed once production is established. General Christopher Bogdan stated the variants are only 20-25% common. Supporters cite the need to support international customers and oversee upgrades. The Joint Program Office employs 2,590 people at an annual cost of about $70 million. Under Secretary of Defense Ellen Lord intends to begin a deliberate, conditions-based approach. Ellen Lord plans to transition the F-35 management structure to separate Service-run F-35A and F-35B/C program offices. The specific timing and responsibilities for the transition have not been announced. The Air Force has selected Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, TX, as the preferred location for the first F-35A reserve component base. Other candidate bases include Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ; Homestead ARB, FL; and Whiteman AFB, MO. Truax Field, WI, and Dannelly Field, AL, are the next Air National Guard F-35A bases, with aircraft expected in 2023. Gowen Field ANGB, ID; Selfridge ANGB, MI; and Jacksonville Air Guard Station, FL, were also considered. In March 2018, DOD stopped accepting new F-35s due to a dispute with Lockheed Martin over repair costs for corrosion issues. Five aircraft were deferred, similar to a previous stoppage in deliveries in 2017. Lockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017, but a dispute with the government arose over inspection failures regarding fastenings. Both parties are blaming each other for the fix costs. DOD officials mentioned a corrosion issue in testimony, stating that the F-35 fleet's operational suitability is below expectations and relies on work-arounds not suitable for combat. The F-35 fleet's operational suitability is below expectations and relies on work-arounds not suitable for combat. Most suitability metrics have remained the same or moved within narrow bands over the past year, with fleet-wide monthly availability rates around 50 percent. The cost of F-35 Block 4 software has increased to $10.8 billion through FY2024, with $3.7 billion to be covered by international partners. The F-35 fleet's operational costs are a concern, with international partners covering $3.7 billion and the US paying $7.1 billion. The total estimated cost for operations and sustainment since 2015 is over $1 trillion. The latest report highlights the need to reduce costs, especially in sustainment. The Air Force is considering reducing its purchase of F-35As due to high support costs. The Air Force is considering reducing its purchase of F-35As due to high support costs, which would force the service to subtract 590 fighter jets from its planned order. The annual bill of $3.8 billion must be cut back over the coming decade. Vice Adm. Mat Winter emphasizes the importance of being able to afford to operate the aircraft. The F-35 program began in the 1990s with Boeing and Lockheed Martin chosen to compete in the concept demonstration phase. In October 2001, DOD selected Lockheed's design for the JSF program, entering the system development and demonstration phase with contracts awarded to Lockheed Martin and Pratt and Whitney. General Electric continued work on an alternate engine. General Electric continued developing an alternate engine for the F-35 program. The first flights of different F-35 versions occurred between FY2007 and FY2010. In response to delays and challenges, Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum in February 2010. In February 2010, Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter issued an Acquisition Decision Memorandum restructuring the F-35 program. This included extending the SDD phase by 13 months, delaying Milestone C to November 2015, adding an extra LRIP lot of aircraft, and funding the program to the \"Revised JET II\" level. $614 million in award fees were withheld from the contractor for poor performance, with incentives added to produce more aircraft within the new budget. The Pentagon restructured the F-35 program in February 2010, extending the SDD phase and delaying Milestone C. $614 million in award fees were withheld for poor performance, with incentives added to produce more aircraft within the new budget. Over $2.8 billion originally budgeted for the next-generation fighter would be used for development instead, resulting in 122 fewer aircraft delivered over the FYDP. The JSF program exceeded cost increase limits, requiring the Secretary of Defense to notify Congress and present a plan to correct the program. The F-35 program underwent restructuring in February 2010, with the SDD phase extended and Milestone C delayed. $614 million in award fees were withheld for poor performance, and over $2.8 billion originally budgeted for the fighter was redirected to development. This led to 122 fewer aircraft delivered over the FYDP. The program exceeded cost increase limits, resulting in a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach. Acquisition was slowed in the FY2013 budget. The F-35 program underwent restructuring in February 2010, leading to delays in Milestone C and the withholding of $614 million in award fees. The FY2013 budget slowed acquisition, resulting in savings of $15.1 billion. The Marine Corps achieved F-35B Initial Operational Capability in 2015, followed by the Air Force in 2016. The Navy's IOC may be delayed to 2019. Congressional requirement for formal declaration of IOCs was set in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The F-35A IOC will be declared when the first operational squadron is equipped with 12-24 aircraft and Airmen are trained for basic operations. The F-35B IOC will be declared when the first operational squadron is equipped with 10-16 aircraft and US Marines are trained for various missions. The F-35 program restructuring in 2010 led to delays in Milestone C and cost savings in the FY2013 budget. The F-35 program includes Air Interdiction, Assault Support Escort, and Armed Reconnaissance missions. The F-35B and F-35C will reach Initial Operating Capability (IOC) milestones between July 2015 and February 2019. Each US service will achieve IOC with different software packages, with the F-35B using Block 2B software for the Marines in December 2015, the Air Force planning on achieving IOC with Block 3I in December 2016, and the Navy using a different software package. The Navy plans to achieve operational capability with the F-35C in February 2019 using Block 3F software. A complication is the inability to airlift F-35 engines to carriers until 2021. The F-35 program includes a total of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, with procurement starting in FY2007. The Air Force plans to increase the procurement rate of F-35As to 54 per year starting in 2021, with a fleet target of 1,763 aircraft by FY2034. The Marine Corps and Navy aim for a combined production rate of 44 F-35Bs and Cs per year in 2021, towards a fleet goal of 693 aircraft. The combined F-35B and -C production rate is 44 per year in 2021, aiming for a fleet goal of 693 aircraft. F-35s are produced under Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) with decreasing unit prices for each production lot. Cost overruns in LRIPs 5, 6, and 7 are split between the contractor and the government, while in LRIP 8, the contractor is liable for 100% of any cost overrun. The government and Lockheed Martin are in negotiations for LRIP contracts for the F-35 program. Block buy contracts are being considered to reduce costs by purchasing supplies in economic quantities. Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney estimate potential cost savings of 8% and 2.3% respectively. The F-35 program office is also exploring block buy contracts for international customers. The F-35 program office is considering a block buy contract for international customers and possibly for U.S. F-35s in subsequent lots. This would require commitments to procure up to 270 U.S. aircraft and substantial numbers from foreign partners. Lockheed Martin is expected to reveal a block buy proposal in March 2018, starting in LRIP lot 11. The goal is to reduce the per-unit price of the F-35A to $80-85 million in 2019, with potential savings of $2-2.8 billion for a full block buy including US jets. Congressional approval would be needed for a U.S. block buy. The Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act authorized DOD to enter into contracts for advance parts for F-35s to be procured in FY2019 and FY2020. Navy Vice Admiral Mathias Winter became the F-35 program manager in 2017, succeeding Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan. DOD plans to reorganize F-35 procurement, shifting responsibilities from a central joint office to the military services. Congress required DOD to examine alternative F-35 management structures due to the decentralization of acquisition authority. Proponents argue that the joint office overseeing the F-35 program is no longer necessary once production is established, citing the limited commonality between the aircraft variants. However, supporters argue for the office to remain in place to support international customers and oversee future upgrades. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord emphasized the importance of the office in a letter to Congress. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord, announced plans for a transition to separate Service-run F-35A and F-35B/C program offices integrated with Military Departments. The F-35 is a stealth aircraft with advanced software integration for sensors and weapons. The F-35 program faces challenges with complex software integration, particularly in writing, validating, and debugging the operating software released in blocks. Concerns were raised by Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall and F-35 program manager Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan regarding the complexity of the software, including the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) providing logistics support. Software development is noted as a tricky aspect of the program. The F-35 program faces challenges with complex software integration, particularly in writing, validating, and debugging operating software. Development of the F-35 follow-on Block 4 software, known as Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2), is expected to cost $10.8 billion through FY2024. Some in Congress argue for separate budgeting and reporting requirements for this program. The F-35 program faces challenges with software development for its mission systems, including the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS). ALIS version 3.0, crucial for full combat capability, is delayed until early 2018 due to issues with previous versions. ALIS may not be deployable as it requires server connectivity. ALIS 3.0 may not be deployable due to infrastructure requirements. The Marine Corps declared ability to operate F-35 without deployability tests. ALIS lacks redundant infrastructure, risking fleet downtime if it fails. Operators rely on manual workarounds for ALIS shortcomings. The F-35 program faces challenges with ALIS, requiring manual workarounds due to its outdated architecture. The software manages non-critical tasks and has an estimated acquisition cost of $325.1 billion in FY2012 dollars. The F-35 program has received approximately $122.6 billion in funding through FY2017, with costs broken down into research and development, procurement, and military construction. As of December 2017, the program had a program acquisition unit cost of about $110.0 million and an average procurement unit cost of $89.8 million. The F-35 program had a program acquisition unit cost of $110.0 million and an average procurement unit cost of $89.8 million as of December 2017. The engine program cost was separate from the aircraft cost, with the engine program having a unit cost of $21.6 million and a procurement unit cost of $16.4 million in constant FY2012 dollars. The costs reported do not differentiate between the engines used in different F-35 variants. The Government Accountability Office questioned DOD's ability to afford the F-35 program due to significant affordability challenges. The program will require $12 billion per year to complete aircraft procurement through 2038, with peak production rates expected in 2022 costing over $14 billion annually for a decade. The F-35 program faces affordability challenges, with costs exceeding $14 billion annually for a decade. Efforts are being made to make the F-35 cost-competitive with previous-generation aircraft, with plans to sell F-35 fighter jets for as little as $80 million in five years. Lockheed Martin will invest up to $170 million to reduce the unit cost of an F-35A to $85 million by 2019. Pratt & Whitney is working to lower the cost of F-35 engines, despite a 6.7% increase in engine costs. Pratt & Whitney has signed contracts for F-35 engines showing a steady decrease in cost. Unit prices for different variants have been reduced compared to previous contracts. Engine cost transparency is a concern addressed in \"Issues for Congress.\" The F-35 program's concurrency leads to inevitable upgrades for early-production aircraft, with costs estimated at $6 million per jet to reach a capable warfighting level. These costs are not included in the negotiated price of each production lot. The Air Force plans to upgrade F-35As to Block 3F at a cost of $100 million. The long-term operating costs for the F-35 fleet are estimated at over $1 trillion, raising concerns about affordability. The program's sustainment estimates include fuel, spare parts, logistics support, and repairs. The F-35 program's long-term operating costs are estimated at over $1 trillion, covering fuel, spare parts, logistics support, and repairs. The operation and sustainment costs are a significant concern, with ongoing efforts to address them through various approaches. The F-35 program office established a \"cost war room\" in 2013 to reduce expenses and study future repair options. The U.S. Air Force plans to decrease the number of bases for F-35 squadrons to lower sustainment costs. Lockheed, Northrop, and BAE are collaborating on a cost reduction initiative to cut operations and maintenance expenses by 10 percent. Lockheed, Northrop, and BAE are collaborating on a cost reduction initiative to cut operations and maintenance expenses by 10 percent over five years. The F-35 is manufactured in various locations, with final assembly taking place in Fort Worth. The program is DOD's largest international cooperative effort, with allied participation helping to offset development costs. Allied countries participate in the F-35 program to acquire a fifth-generation strike fighter, technical knowledge, and industrial opportunities. Eight countries are involved in the program, contributing to research and development funding in exchange for participation. International partners also assist with Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. The partner countries are expected to purchase hundreds of F-35s. The F-35 program involves eight partner countries purchasing hundreds of aircraft, with the UK having the largest anticipated fleet. Israel, Japan, and South Korea are among the countries committed to buying F-35s. Foreign sales could potentially exceed 2,000 or 3,000 aircraft. Sales to certain countries go through the standard Foreign Military Sales process, while sales to consortium nations are not reviewed by Congress. The UK is the main international partner with the highest financial commitment. The UK is a significant international partner in the F-35 program, with a high financial commitment. They signed MOUs with the US for participation in different phases, contributing $200 million in the Concept Demonstration Phase and $2 billion in the SDD phase. UK firms like BAE and Rolls-Royce are involved in the program. The cost of F-35s for US customers depends on the total quantity produced, with new customers like South Korea and Japan emerging. Other countries have considered increasing their buys of F-35s, while some have deferred previous plans. The latest Selected Acquisition Reports reduced assumed international sales from 673 to 612 for cost purposes. Recent updates on other countries' purchase plans are detailed in \"Changes in International Orders.\" Canada's status as an F-35 partner is uncertain, with the Trudeau government canceling a previously announced purchase and putting plans to acquire F-18s on hold. Lockheed Martin has expressed concerns about Canadian work share if they withdraw as a customer. Disagreements have arisen between DOD and foreign partners in the JSF program regarding work shares and proprietary technology. The JSF program has faced disagreements over work shares and proprietary technology. The United States rejected a South Korean request for transfer of four F-35 technologies, while Italy and the UK lobbied for F-35 assembly facilities in their countries. Lockheed and Alenia Aeronautica established an assembly facility in Italy, with a similar one in Japan. Turkey, Norway, and the Netherlands will host engine overhaul and logistics facilities. The F-35 program has faced debates over its high costs and alternative options like upgrading existing aircraft. Congress has held hearings and made funding adjustments in response to changing arguments for and against the program. The F-35 program faces debates over costs and procurement quantities. Congress may need to consider alternatives due to budget constraints and evolving air environment. Concerns arise over maintaining expected procurement quantities amidst cost growth. Undersecretary of Defense Robert Hale suggests reducing the buy in case of unanticipated cost growth. The F-35 program may face reduced procurement quantities due to potential budget constraints and changes in adversary capabilities. A report suggests that non-stealthy strike aircraft may lose operational value in the future, leading to a proposed reduction in the planned total procurement quantities for the F-35. The Air Force is considering reducing the procurement of F-35As to 858 by 2034, increasing the annual procurement rate to end by 2020. This would allow for 540 combat-coded F-35As by 2021, helping absorb other program ramp ups like the next-generation bomber. The development of F-35 Block 4 software, part of Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2), is expected to cost $10.8 billion over the next six years. The Joint Program Office plans to transition to C2D2 in 2018 to address deficiencies and provide planned Block 4 capabilities. The JPO's plan for F-35 follow-on modernization, known as C2D2, involves agile software development for incremental updates to software and hardware. Some in Congress argue that the Block 4 upgrade should be managed as a separate program due to its estimated cost. Officer Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan opposed breaking off the F-35 follow-on modernization program, citing administrative burdens and cost implications. The Senate's FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act required the program to be treated separately, while a similar amendment in the House version failed. Restrictions on funds for the F-35 modernization were included in the FY2018 NDAA pending a required report on cost control. Lieutenant General Bogdan highlighted the challenge of cost control in a sole-source environment for defense programs due to industry consolidation. Congress should consider maintaining competition in system procurements, as seen in the F-35 alternate engine program. Concerns arise over the lack of transparency in revealing engine costs in F-35 contracts, prompting the need for better oversight. The affordability of the F-35 program is a concern for Congress, especially in light of projected shortfalls in Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps fighter capabilities. Some observers worry that the annual production rate of the F-35 may not be sustainable with constrained DOD resources, potentially impacting funding for other programs. The F-35 program's affordability is a concern due to the increasing production rate requiring over $10 billion annually in funding. Suggestions have been made to procure upgraded F-16s and F/A-18E/Fs as alternatives, but supporters argue that the F-35 is more capable with reduced life-cycle costs. This issue arises amidst projected fighter shortfalls in the Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps. The U.S. Air Force is considering upgrades for newer F-16s due to delays with the F-35 program. Concerns have been raised about the impact of the F-35 program on the tactical aircraft industrial base, particularly regarding the exclusion of Boeing from the program. Similar concerns have been raised about engine-making firms since 2006. The FY2007 budget proposed terminating the F136 alternate engine program, raising concerns about General Electric's future in fighter jet engine manufacturing. The F-35's potential dominance in the combat aircraft export market is compared to the F-16, with its low cost and high performance being attractive features. The F-35 faces competition from other high-performance fighters like the Rafale, Gripen, and Eurofighter in the export market. Concerns exist about foreign participation in the program impacting the U.S. industrial base. The F-35 program, aimed at jointness and acquisition reform, may have a flawed concept of serving multiple services' requirements with one airframe. Congress should consider how joint programs have evolved with changes in warfighting technology and tactics. The F-35 program is influenced by changes in warfighting technology, doctrine, and tactics. Table A-1 outlines key performance parameters for the three versions of the F-35."
