    "content": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is the largest support agency for Congress, with over 3,100 staff positions and a budget exceeding $507 million in FY2008. It operates under the Comptroller General of the United States and was previously known as the General Accounting Office. The Comptroller General is appointed by the President for a 15-year nonrenewable term. David M. Walker was the seventh Comptroller General, but the position became vacant in 2008 after his resignation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was established as an independent auditor of government agencies and activities by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. It operates under the Comptroller General of the United States and provides oversight, investigation, and evaluation of executive operations for Congress. The General Accounting Office was renamed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) due to expanded authority and new powers for the Comptroller General. GAO's activities include auditing federal programs, conducting investigations of criminal law violations, providing legal services to Congress, resolving bid protests, and setting accounting standards for the executive branch. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) provides oversight on fiscal policies, auditing government programs, and assisting the audit/evaluation community. Since 1994, GAO has faced congressional hearings and budget cuts, leading to reductions in its powers and resources. The General Accounting Office (GAO) faced a 25% budget cut over FY1996 and FY1997, part of a larger downsizing from 1992-1999. Despite budget increases since then, full-time employees have decreased from 4,324 in FY1995 to 3,100 currently. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 gave the President significant authority over the federal budget process. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 gave the President authority over the federal budget process by creating the Bureau of the Budget. Congress established the General Accounting Office to balance executive power, transferring comptroller and auditor duties from the Treasury Department. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed an initial legislative proposal to create an independent entity in the legislative branch for these duties. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 transferred comptroller and auditor duties from the Treasury Department to the new General Accounting Office, giving the President authority over the federal budget process. The act abolished the post of Comptroller and Assistant Comptroller of the Treasury, along with six auditors, and vested the GAO with their powers and responsibilities. The Comptroller General could investigate matters related to receipt, disbursement, and application of funds. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 transferred comptroller and auditor duties to the General Accounting Office, giving the President authority over the federal budget process. The Comptroller General was granted extensive access to information in all departments and establishments regarding financial transactions and methods of business. The law also authorized the Comptroller General to recommend legislation to facilitate the settlement of accounts and make special investigations and reports when ordered by Congress. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has expanded its powers and jurisdiction since 1921 through public laws, with responsibilities over finances, expenditures, and audit authority over government corporations. Additional responsibilities and authority have been added over time, such as prescribing accounting principles and standards for executive agencies. The Federal Manager's Financial Integrity Act of 1982 and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 gave the Comptroller General authority over internal accounting controls and audit reviews in executive agencies. The General Accounting Office (GAO) plays a significant role in monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). The Government Accountability Office has broad powers to access information from government entities, authorized by various laws. This includes the ability to compel agencies to release information and sue noncomplying agencies for records. The Government Accountability Office can request agency heads to release records under its authority, with a 20-day deadline for explanation. If denied access, the Comptroller General can file a report and ultimately sue in court, as seen in a 2001 conflict with the executive over access to records of the National Energy Policy Development Group. The District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Walker v. Cheney that GAO lacked standing to sue the Vice President for information on NEPDG. Legislation (H.R. 6388) introduced in the 110th Congress by Rep. Henry Waxman aims to override this decision by expanding GAO's authority to access records and conduct investigations. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and the 1970 LRA have increased GAO's powers and independence, allowing for expenditure analysis of government agencies. The Comptroller General has specific responsibilities outlined in public law, including the ability to bring suit for the release of information. The Comptroller General has various responsibilities outlined in public law, including the power to bring suit for the release of impounded funds, impose civil penalties, serve on boards, and consider bid protests. Additionally, the Comptroller General serves on the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board to recommend accounting standards and principles. The Review Panel, including public officials and defense industry representatives, examined the operations of the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) in OMB. In response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005, the Comptroller General led a Hurricane Katrina Contract Audit Task Force to coordinate federal audit efforts for the Gulf Coast Recovery Program. The Comptroller General also chaired the now-defunct Commercial Activities Panel (CAP), an interagency group with representatives from executive departments. The Commercial Activities Panel (CAP) was a group that studied and made recommendations for improving the transfer of commercial activities from the government to contractor personnel. In the mid-1980s, there were changes in the authority of the Comptroller General, including a constitutional conflict over budget-reduction authority delegated by Congress. The Supreme Court found the delegation of authority to the Comptroller General unconstitutional due to Congress playing a direct role in executing laws. In the mid-1990s, the General Accounting Office Act reduced the authority and resources of the GAO, transferring certain executive powers to other government officials. In the 110th Congress, proposals were made to change the organization, structure, and authority of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Comptroller General called for changes in various areas, which were included in legislative proposals. The Government Accountability Office Act, H.R. 5683, has passed both the House and Senate and is awaiting approval from the White House. These changes would impact GAO's pay and personnel system, retirement pay, voluntary separation incentive payments, the Comptroller General's annuity level, reimbursement of audit costs, administering oaths, and appointment processes. H.R. 5683 would modify the Comptroller General's authority over pay rates for GAO officers and employees, allowing for higher pay levels and more discretion in determining pay for high-ranking positions. The legislation also addresses past pay discrepancies by providing pay adjustments and lump-sum payments for certain employees and officers. The appointment process for the Deputy Comptroller General would be changed under H.R. 3268, allowing the Comptroller General to appoint the deputy without Senate confirmation. H.R. 5683 would establish a statutory inspector general office to replace the current administrative structure. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established statutory inspector general offices in various government entities, including the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO's inspector general would be appointed by the Comptroller General, responsible for combating waste, fraud, and abuse within the GAO, and required to provide semi-annual reports to Congress. Other legislative branch entities also have statutory inspector general offices. H.R. 5683 allows agency heads to appoint and remove inspector generals. It also calls for executive agencies to reimburse GAO for audit costs starting in FY2009. A conflict with the executive branch arose in 2001 over GAO's access to certain records, leading to a court ruling in 2002 that GAO lacked access. In response to a court ruling that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) lacked access to certain records, Representative Henry Waxman introduced the Government Accountability Act of 2008 (H.R. 6388) to enhance GAO's powers. The legislation, approved by the House, expands GAO's authority to access records from specified agencies and gives it the ability to administer oaths and interview federal employees. It also includes a reporting mechanism to inform Congress when federal agencies do not cooperate with GAO. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has jurisdiction to audit and investigate the federal government, but its access may be restricted by the President or in cases where records are classified or exempted from disclosure. Conflicts have arisen between GAO and the Intelligence Community, particularly the CIA, over access to records for audits and investigations. Legislation has been introduced to clarify GAO's authority to audit the IC, with the CIA asserting its statutory authority as a reason for not participating in GAO reviews. The CIA has refused to participate in GAO audits, citing statutory authority, while other IC components cooperate fully with GAO. GAO lacks enforcement power but has authority to audit independently. Proposed legislation like the Intelligence Community Audit Act aims to address this issue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has faced challenges in auditing the intelligence community due to lack of enforcement power. Proposed legislation aims to reaffirm GAO's authority to audit and evaluate intelligence programs. GAO's budget and staffing levels have fluctuated since the mid-1990s, with a proposal in 1994 suggesting an eight-year authorization period for congressional support agencies. GAO's budget authority and personnel levels have fluctuated since the mid-1990s, with a significant reduction in funding and staff in the mid-1990s due to budget cuts. However, since then, GAO's budget has increased nearly 30% over the past decade. Employee compensation makes up about 80% of GAO's budget, leading to cost-saving actions and staff downsizing. The GAO's budget cuts in the mid-1990s led to significant staff downsizing, resulting in a 39% reduction in its workforce from 1992 to 1998. This included measures such as a reduction-in-force, closing regional offices, and imposing a hiring freeze. These cost-saving actions have led to challenges in human capital, information technology, and work processes for the GAO. The GAO has faced human capital, information technology, and work process challenges. Staff size has fluctuated over the years, with a low of 3,100 FTEs in FY2008. Legislation in 2004 granted the Comptroller General personnel flexibilities. Requested positions for FY2009 would reverse the downsizing trend. The General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 established an independent personnel system at GAO, removing reliance on executive branch entities like OPM. This change was necessary to avoid conflicts of interest as GAO increased oversight of federal agencies and the personnel system. The General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 granted the Comptroller General the authority to appoint, pay, assign, and direct personnel necessary for GAO's functions. Amendments in 1988 addressed personnel appeals board membership, retirement qualifications, and survivor benefits. In 2000, the Comptroller General's powers over personnel were further enhanced through a pilot program. In 2000, the Comptroller General's powers over personnel were enhanced through legislation granting authority to offer voluntary separation incentives, early retirements, and implement a reduction in force. The GAO Human Capital Reform Act of 2004 granted additional authority over pay and personnel, allowing for early retirement and buy-out incentives, private sector exchange programs, flexible employee relocation benefits, and setting annual pay raises based on performance appraisal ratings. The Comptroller General has the authority to determine pay rates using various factors, not limited to CPI or ECI. The changes aim to protect equal pay principles, maintain pay for demoted employees, and regulate private sector exchanges. These transformations are intended to enhance performance, accountability, and workforce quality at GAO. The changes have garnered significant attention and consideration. The GAO's new personnel system attracted attention and considerations, with a follow-up report in mid-2005 highlighting the successful use of human capital management for organizational transformation. Recommendations were made for other agencies to learn from GAO's lessons, including the importance of cautious change, strong workforce planning, and targeted emphasis. The IBM study endorsed the need for strong workforce planning, targeted recruitment, hiring, and retention policies, investments in manager selection and training systems, and a fair system for employee appeals. However, executive agencies may be hesitant to adopt the GAO model due to differences in size, autonomy, organizational structure, and mission diversity compared to GAO. The GAO pay-for-performance implementation has raised concerns over fairness, criteria clarity, measurement validity, desired results, employee morale, and potential impact on other government entities. Legislative proposals have been made to modify the Comptroller General's powers in this regard. The GAO pay-for-performance implementation has sparked concerns and led to the establishment of a local affiliate of IFPTE to represent bargaining unit employees. This marks the first employee organization in GAO history. The Government Accountability Office has had seven Comptrollers General since its inception in 1921. Since its inception in 1921, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has had seven Comptrollers General. The post is currently vacant, and the longest absence of a confirmed Comptroller General was three years from 1936-1939. The process for nominating and confirming the Comptroller General and Deputy Comptroller General involves recommendations from a special congressional commission and confirmation by the Senate. When a vacancy occurs, a recommending commission is established to suggest individuals for appointment. The recommending commission, consisting of various congressional leaders, determines criteria and standards for nominees for the Comptroller General position. The process includes examining backgrounds, future plans, credentials, accomplishments, and relevant work experience through interviews, meetings, and reviews of materials. The recommending commission, made up of congressional leaders, sets criteria for Comptroller General nominees. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reviews the nomination and reports to the full Senate. The commission must recommend at least three individuals, but the President can request more names or nominate someone else. The original bill called for five names, but this was reduced to three for practicality. The President can still nominate someone not recommended by the commission. The President is expected to give weight to the Commission's recommendations when selecting a nominee for the office of Comptroller General. Presidents Reagan and Clinton both chose nominees from the initial congressional list in the past. The bicameral commission allows both chambers of Congress to have a role in selecting the head of this legislative branch agency, reflecting their special interests in choosing someone who assists Congress. The nomination process for the post of Deputy Comptroller General has not been used since 1980. Instead, the Comptroller General has appointed his own deputies, with the current roles being carried out by the chief operating officer and chief mission support officer. The new nomination process began in 1981 with the appointment of Charles A. Bowsher, whose term ended in 1996. A second commission recommended three candidates to President Clinton in 1998. President Clinton nominated David M. Walker for the position of Comptroller General, who was confirmed by the Senate on October 21, 1998. This nomination followed a two-year interregnum, the second longest period without a confirmed Comptroller General. There was interest in making the position exclusively a legislative branch officer, but this was not acted upon. The Comptroller General is limited to a single 15-year term to protect independence and integrity. Of the seven Comptrollers General, three served the full term, including David Walker who served for nine years and four months. The remaining four had shorter tenures. The Comptroller General and Deputies can be removed by impeachment or joint resolution of Congress for specified reasons. No official has been impeached or removed by joint resolution. The retirement system for the Comptroller General is generous, providing a lifetime annuity after at least 10 years in office. The retirement system for the Comptroller General is generous, providing a lifetime annuity equal to the pay received at the end of the term or retirement. The annuity may be increased based on percentage increases in annuities under Title 5. The annuity cannot exceed the basic pay of the Comptroller General. This special retirement system was added in 1953 to align with the unique nature of the office, similar to that of a Federal judge. The retirement system for the Comptroller General is designed to align with Federal judges' benefits, providing a lifetime annuity equal to the pay received at the end of the term. The unique nature of the office, independent of Executive control and with a 15-year term limit, justifies the retirement provision according to the Civil Service Commission. The Comptroller General's retirement system aligns with Federal judges' benefits, providing a lifetime annuity equal to the pay received at the end of the 15-year term. The fixed term is considered too long for other pursuits and too short for lifetime security. The position requires a mature individual due to its important and complex duties. The House Appropriations Committee in the 110th Congress attempted to change the retirement system for the Comptroller General. The panel included a proviso that repeals the unique Comptroller General Retirement system for any individual appointed Comptroller General after the enactment of this Act. Future appointments to this position will be covered under the standard Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Of the seven Comptrollers General, two\u2014Lindsay Warren and Joseph Campbell\u2014retired after going beyond the 10-year threshold. Throughout GAO's history, only two of the seven Comptrollers General have resigned from office. Fred Herbert Brown served a little over one year, leaving office after suffering a stroke. David M. Walker resigned in order to head a newly established public interest foundation. The General Accounting Office, now the Government Accountability Office, was created in 1921 and is Congress's largest support agency with a budget of over $507 million. It has broad jurisdiction over the executive, independence, and authority to investigate operations. GAO provides services for legislative oversight and can initiate activities on its own or at the request of Congress. Questions have arisen over GAO's structure, organization, and powers in recent years. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the structure, organization, and powers of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Issues include delays in selecting the Comptroller General, lack of a confirmed Deputy for over twenty-five years, difficulties accessing information from certain agencies, and limitations on auditing the intelligence community. Proposed bills in Congress aim to improve GAO's access to executive branch information, clarify jurisdiction over the intelligence community, provide audit cost reimbursement, and establish a statutory inspector general within GAO. Additionally, GAO underwent significant downsizing in the mid-1990s due to criticism of its perceived bias towards previous administrations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has faced criticism for its perceived bias towards previous administrations and concerns about its missions and roles. Despite an increase in its annual budget over the past 10 years, its staff has been downsized. The Comptroller General gained new authority over pay and personnel in 2004, leading to organizational transformation through human capital management. Executive agencies are advised to learn from GAO's accountability practices during their reinvention efforts. The Government Accountability Office is undergoing a transition period with changes in personnel systems and pay, leading to the establishment of an employee union with collective bargaining rights and legislative proposals to modify the Comptroller General's powers. This transition was prompted by a vacancy in the office of the Comptroller General and conflicts over the new personnel system. The Government Accountability Office is experiencing a transition period due to conflicts over a new personnel system, the absence of a Deputy CG, and limitations on its access to executive branch information and auditing of the intelligence community."
