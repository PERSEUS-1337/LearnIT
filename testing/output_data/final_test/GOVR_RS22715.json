Since independence in 1821, Peru has had 13 constitutions and only nine elected governments completing their terms. The most recent transition to democracy occurred in 1980 after military rule. Alan Garc\u00eda of the APRA was elected president in 1985, facing economic crisis and a Maoist insurgency. President Fujimori's relationship with the international financial community and excessive spending on social programs led to hyperinflation. Despite his security policies being unable to defeat the Shining Path, he was re-elected in 1995. However, his popularity waned as the economy slowed and opposition to his policies grew, leading to him being seen as an authoritarian leader. President Fujimori's third term in 2000 was marred by irregularities and a bribery scandal, leading to new elections. An interim government served until Alejandro Toledo took office in 2001. Toledo's presidency (2001-2006) saw low approval ratings but high economic growth rates, with reforms such as tax reform and a free trade agreement with the US. Despite economic improvements, Toledo faced corruption allegations and popular protests. Former President Alan Garc\u00eda defeated populist Ollanta Humala in a close election in 2006. Humala, a retired army officer, was charged with murder in connection to his military actions in the 1990s. His alliance won 45 seats in the Congress, while Garc\u00eda's party APRA won 36 seats. Fujimori supporters also secured 13 seats. President Garc\u00eda took steps to address corruption and economic issues during his term. President Alan Garc\u00eda has shifted towards moderate policies, distancing himself from his leftist past. Despite facing social unrest and protests over poverty and inequality, his government has implemented sound economic policies leading to a strong Peruvian economy. Garc\u00eda's approval ratings have fluctuated, reaching a high of 76% after his response to a natural disaster, but dropping to 29% due to corruption scandals. President Alan Garc\u00eda has prioritized solidifying relations with the United States and supporting free trade in Latin America. Key challenges include reducing poverty and inequality, with the wealthiest 10% controlling 41% of income while the poorest 10% control just 1%. Poverty is more prevalent among indigenous households. Garc\u00eda has pledged to increase public investment and social spending to address these issues but has struggled to meet popular expectations. The main trial against former President Fujimori for corruption began in December 2007. In 2007, the main trial began against former President Fujimori for corruption and human rights abuses. Many Peruvians believe he should be prosecuted, but some feel the possible punishment is too harsh. President Garc\u00c3\u00ada may lose support from the Fujimorista bloc in Congress. Additionally, there have been violent clashes between coca farmers and police due to forced eradication policies. In 2007, Peru eradicated 12,688 hectares of coca, exceeding its goal for the second consecutive year. Former Shining Path guerillas are involved in coca production and supporting drug-traffickers. President Garc\u00c3\u00ada continues pro-market economic policies, including the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, fiscal conservatism, and government pay cuts. Peru's economy thrives on exports of minerals, textiles, and agricultural products like sugarcane, potatoes, and asparagus. It is a major producer of silver, gold, copper, zinc, and lead, with strong economic growth driven by these exports. Peru's economy is boosted by investments in the Camisea natural gas project, aiming to export liquefied natural gas to the US and Mexico by 2009. President Garc\u00eda pledges austerity measures to address the needs of poor Peruvians, including redirecting funds to rural projects and using trade to reduce poverty. The government focuses on rural development through investments in road construction, sanitation, and water connections. Peru has strong economic ties with the US, emphasizing counternarcotics and security cooperation. Since 2001, Peru has focused on strengthening ties with the US, with economic cooperation and trade being key aspects. President Garc\u00c3\u00ada met with President Bush multiple times to discuss counternarcotics efforts and the approval of the PTPA. Issues in the bilateral agenda include democratic development, human rights, and trade. The US provided significant foreign aid to Peru in recent years. The FY2008 request for Peru is for $93.2 million, with cuts in counternarcotics funds previously provided through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Alternative development programs will now be supported by the Economic Support Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 ensures funding for Peru at no less than FY2007 levels, including environmental programs at FY2006 levels. The joint explanatory statement recommends $30 million in Economic Support Funds and $36.8 million for Peru. The Appropriations Act recommends providing $30 million in Economic Support Funds and $36.8 million in ACI funds to Peru in FY2008. The U.S. Agency for International Development has four main goals for Peru: strengthening democracy, increasing governance in isolated areas where drug traffickers operate, reducing poverty, and decreasing maternal mortality and other health threats. Peru was selected to participate in the Millennium Challenge Account Threshold Program, focusing on combating corruption, strengthening the rule of law, and improving resource management. The government of Peru has taken steps to expand and enforce labor laws and prosecute those accused of human rights violations. Many accused of past abuses still avoid prosecution according to Human Rights Watch. The State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2006 highlights ongoing issues in Peru, including abuse of detainees, poor prison conditions, trafficking in persons, child labor, and failure to enforce labor laws. Concerns have been raised about restrictions on freedom of expression and association due to a law regulating non-governmental organizations. Peru is a major producer of illicit drugs, with coca cultivation increasing despite eradication efforts. Peru has increased its coca eradication efforts by 4% from 2005 levels. The United States and Peru signed a five-year cooperative agreement for 2002-2007 linking alternative development to coca eradication more directly. Counternarcotics assistance to Peru in FY2008 is estimated at $66.8 million, down from previous years, but aid reductions are due to budget cutbacks, not dissatisfaction with Peru's efforts. The United States is Peru's largest trading partner, with exports receiving preferential treatment through the Andean Trade Preference Act. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) and Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) provide duty-free market access to selected Peruvian goods. The ATPDEA was extended twice and is now set to expire on February 29, 2008. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was signed in April 2006, ratified by Peru in June 2006, and offers a comprehensive trade agreement. The PTPA is a trade agreement between the US and Peru that eliminates tariffs and barriers on bilateral trade. Amendments were made to strengthen the agreement, which was approved by Peru's Congress and signed into law by President Bush in December 2007. The 110th Congress is expected to focus on implementing the PTPA."
