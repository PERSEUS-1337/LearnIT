    "content": "Benefits and services for low-income families have gained attention from policymakers due to increased federal spending post-recession. The government offers economic assistance to eligible individuals through various programs, but understanding how these programs interact and provide cumulative benefits is challenging. Case studies can help analyze the interaction of need-tested benefits by creating hypothetical families and showcasing the suite of services available. Case studies use hypothetical families to demonstrate the benefits and services available under different programs. For instance, a single mother of two working full-time at minimum wage could receive nearly $9,000 in combined benefits from EITC, ACTC, and SNAP in 2014. However, these analyses have limitations as they do not account for the diverse characteristics and circumstances of real families. They often assume families receive all eligible benefits for a full year, which may not reflect reality where many families are financially needy for only part of the year and receive benefits intermittently. This report explores individuals' and families' eligibility and benefit receipt using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and microsimulation modeling. It complements a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on federal programs for people with low incomes. This report analyzes benefit receipt from specific need-tested programs in 2012, including SNAP, EITC, SSI, housing assistance, ACTC, WIC, and TANF. The report analyzes benefit receipt from need-tested programs in 2012, including SNAP, EITC, SSI, housing assistance, ACTC, WIC, and TANF. It addresses six key questions related to these programs and combines data from household surveys with estimates from a microsimulation model. The TRIM3 model, funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, estimates benefit receipt from nine need-tested programs using survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It corrects for under-reporting of benefits and estimates eligibility and benefit amounts for selected programs. TRIM3 estimates actual benefit receipt based on federal agencies' reported recipients and eligible person probabilities. For refundable tax credits, TRIM3 sets estimates equal to eligible individuals identified on the ASEC. There is a shortfall in aggregate credits for EITC and ACTC compared to federal tax returns. TRIM3 has limitations outlined in Appendix A. The estimates in this report for calendar year 2012 were derived using ASEC and TRIM3 data. They may not match administrative data due to differences in measurement methods, such as using the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) instead of official poverty measures. The SPM considers net income available for non-medical needs by subtracting taxes, work expenses, and child support payments from gross income. The SPM subtracts taxes, work expenses, child support payments, and medical expenses to estimate benefit amounts for a common family unit. Benefits are assigned based on the filing unit used in each program. The report reflects the estimated dollar value of aid received, including non-cash forms like medical, food, housing, and child care. The report discusses how need-tested benefits can be paid in non-cash forms like medical, food, and housing assistance, which may have different values to recipients compared to cash benefits. Policy analysts have developed methods to determine the value of non-cash benefits, but the report does not analyze their impact on family well-being. Medicaid is highlighted as the largest need-tested program. Medicaid is the largest need-tested program in terms of federal spending, totaling $270.9 billion in FY2012. It finances primary and acute care health services, as well as long-term services and supports. The report focuses on receipt of need-tested benefits in 2012, excluding Medicaid due to changes in eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. The picture of Medicaid today and in future years may differ significantly from 2012. The report examines benefit receipt from nine major need-tested benefit programs, addressing issues in estimating the value of noncash benefits. Topics such as eligible population, enrollees, and program enrollment are discussed separately for Medicaid in Appendix B. Some programs are considered in part, like the refundable portion of the child tax credit, while others are aggregated, such as housing assistance. The report analyzes nine major need-tested benefit programs, including housing assistance and the refundable portion of the child tax credit. These programs do not encompass all available assistance for low-income individuals and families, but they provide benefits based on financial need and vary in terms of eligibility criteria. The report analyzes nine major need-tested benefit programs, including housing assistance and the refundable portion of the child tax credit. These programs differ in eligibility criteria, type of assistance, conditions for benefits, and funding sources. Income eligibility is a key factor, with varying criteria and measures used across programs. Some need-tested benefit programs have eligibility criteria based on income, with thresholds set by states. Programs like WIC and housing assistance have income eligibility thresholds above the poverty line. Additional requirements beyond income eligibility may apply for many programs. Some programs have additional requirements beyond income eligibility, such as being a member of the program's target population. For example, the ACTC, TANF, CCDF, and WIC are only available for families with children. SSI is restricted to aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Certain benefits like the EITC and ACTC are only for workers with earnings. CCDF subsidies require parents to be working or in training. Behavioral requirements may also be imposed for eligibility. Some programs impose behavioral requirements for eligibility, such as work and training requirements for TANF cash assistance and SNAP benefits. Assistance can be in the form of cash or in-kind benefits like housing and food. Child care assistance is often provided as a work support. Programs vary in funding sources, with some receiving mandatory or discretionary funding, and some receiving both. In open-ended programs, federal expenditures have no pre-determined ceiling, while capped programs have limits on federal spending. Discretionary programs are funded by Congress annually. Capped programs may not have enough funding for all eligible individuals. Refundable tax credits are financed like open-ended programs. Programs vary in size due to eligibility rules or funding category. In terms of federal obligations, SNAP is the largest program, accounting for 30% of total obligations, while LIHEAP is the smallest at just over 1%. The EITC is the largest program by number of individual recipients, with CCDF being the smallest. These need-tested programs target different populations and have varying eligibility criteria. In 2012, 135 million individuals were eligible for need-tested programs, with 83.3 million eligible for SNAP benefits, the largest program. In 2012, 83.3 million individuals were eligible for SNAP benefits, representing 27% of the total non-institutionalized population. Various programs like LIHEAP and housing assistance were available to people in eligible households of all family types. TANF and child care are limited to low-income families with children, while WIC is for low-income families with a pregnant woman or young child. SSI is for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. EITC and ACTC primarily benefit families with children and earnings. Not all eligible individuals receive need-tested benefits. In 2012, 106 million people received need-tested benefits out of 135 million estimated to be eligible. These recipients were in 42 million families. The number of people receiving benefits for different programs varied, with estimates based on eligibility for each program. In 2012, the EITC was the most widely received benefit, with 62.9 million people benefiting from it. SNAP was the second largest benefit, with 58 million recipients. The ACTC was the third most received benefit. Some programs serve a large portion of eligible populations, while others serve a smaller portion. In 2012, the EITC, SNAP, and ACTC were the most widely received benefits. Three programs had high rates of receipt among eligible populations: SNAP, WIC, and SSI. Estimating the eligible population for SSI is challenging due to subjective self-reported information on disabilities. In 2012, SNAP, WIC, and SSI were estimated to provide benefits to about two-thirds of eligible persons. TANF served about 3 in 10 eligible persons, with lower rates of receipt for housing, LIHEAP, and child care subsidies. In 2012, TANF served about 3 in 10 eligible persons, with lower rates of receipt for housing, LIHEAP, and child care subsidies. Funding for these programs is capped, leading to aid rationing through mechanisms like waiting lists. TANF has work requirements and time limits, and is not considered an entitlement. Despite lack of entitlement status, programs like WIC received enough funding to serve all those seeking benefits. A substantial minority of individuals and families benefited from at least one need-tested program in 2012. In 2012, various need-tested programs had different income eligibility rules targeting benefits towards specific populations. Families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits than those with higher incomes. However, not all people in poor families received benefits, and not all benefits went to those who were poor. Benefit receipt was examined based on the ratio of pre-welfare incomes to poverty thresholds. The figure shows that families with pre-welfare incomes below their poverty thresholds were highly likely to receive need-tested benefits, with about 8 out of 10 such families estimated as receiving aid. However, even families with pre-welfare incomes above the poverty thresholds also received benefits. Table 4 displays the estimated percentage of families, by their pre-welfare income-to-poverty ratio, who received benefits from various programs in 2012. In 2012, nine programs were examined, with the most widely received benefits being the ACTC, EITC, and SNAP. SNAP was the most common benefit for families below the poverty thresholds, while EITC and ACTC were more common for families above the thresholds. Some programs base eligibility on low income alone, while others restrict benefits based on family type. Government benefits not tied to work may reduce incentives to work, as supported by empirical studies. Government benefits not tied to work, such as Social Security retirement and disability benefits, have been shown to reduce incentives to work, especially for the aged and individuals with disabilities. Concerns about providing basic needs for these groups often outweigh worries about the work disincentive. Aid to families with able-bodied, non-aged adults is a topic of debate, as most assistance to these families does not require work. Most aid to families with able-bodied, non-aged adults goes to those with children. Policies have evolved to require and support work for single mothers, leading to expansions of tax credits and subsidized child care. Families are classified based on the presence of aged or disabled individuals, children, and earners. CRS classified families into six groups based on the presence of aged or disabled individuals, children, and earners. The classification is sequential, with families assigned to one category only, even if they meet criteria for multiple categories. In 2012, there were 128.8 million families identified under the Census Bureau's SPM definition. Families were classified into six groups based on the presence of aged or disabled individuals, children, and earners. 32.5 million families had an aged member, while 18.6 million families included an individual with disabilities. Families without aged or disabled members were further divided based on the presence of children and adult workers. In 2012, a small percentage of families had no adult worker, with the poorest category being families with a child and no adult worker. The pre-welfare poverty rates varied among different family categories, with the highest rate seen in families without an aged member but with an individual with disabilities. In 2012, families with children and no workers had the highest rate of benefit receipt at 91.6%, followed by families with a disabled member at 60.4%. Families with workers had a 44.6% receipt rate. About 1 in 4 aged persons received need-tested benefits. Families with workers and no aged, disabled, or children had the lowest receipt rate at 16.1%. Among families with no workers and no aged, disabled, or children, 37.5% received need-tested benefits, reflecting different economic circumstances and eligibility for programs. There are variations in benefit uptake rates among eligible family categories, with the aged group showing lower uptake rates. Ineligible categories also impact benefit receipt rates across different programs. Table 7 displays the percentage of families receiving benefits in various programs by family category in 2012. SNAP was the most common benefit, except for families with working children. More families in this category received EITC and ACTC. Policies restricting benefits to families with children affected ACTC, TANF, WIC, and child care subsidies. Some families with aged or disabled members also received benefits from child-focused programs. Figure 6 shows total estimated spending. In 2012, estimated total spending for need-tested benefits was highest for families with children and families with disabilities. Families with children accounted for 38% of all spending, with workers in the family receiving $91.6 billion. Families with children but no workers received $9.4 billion. Families with disabilities accounted for 37% of spending, while families with aged members accounted for 15.7%. In 2012, need-tested spending was highest for families with children and disabilities. Families with children accounted for 38% of spending, with workers receiving $91.6 billion. Families with disabilities accounted for 37% of spending, while families with aged members accounted for 15.7%. Families without an aged, disabled, or child member had smaller shares of need-tested spending. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) benefits primarily go to families with children, with only 10% of childless workers receiving it. Factors such as job attachment, educational attainment, and family structure influence the receipt of need-tested benefits. These factors are further explored in a later section of the report. The selected programs examined in the report provide benefits to over 1 in 3 persons in the population residing in 42 million families. In 2012, the annual median benefit to families who received need-tested benefits was $3,300. Many families received less than $1,000 in benefits, with about 1 in 4 families receiving need-tested benefits falling into this category. In 2012, half of all families received less than $3,300 in need-tested benefits, with a skewed distribution showing fewer families receiving larger benefits. The distribution is asymmetrical, with most families clustered at lower benefit amounts, while a few receive high amounts. The top 25% of families received $9,027 or more in benefits, accounting for a significant portion of total spending. In 2012, the benefit amount was concentrated among relatively few families. 11% of all spending on need-tested benefits was for families with annual benefits less than $3,300, while families with benefits of $9,027 or more accounted for 64% of all spending. The report also discusses the extent to which individuals received benefits from multiple need-tested programs. In 2012, families received need-tested benefits from one or more programs. 40% received benefits from only one program, while the majority received benefits from multiple programs. The most common combinations were SNAP and EITC for those receiving one benefit, and EITC and ACTC for those receiving two benefits. Families receiving benefits from more programs tended to receive higher benefits. In 2012, families received need-tested benefits from multiple programs, with higher benefits for those receiving aid from more programs. Median annual benefits ranged from $800 for one program to $17,180 for five or more programs. Benefits were higher for families with lower pre-welfare income relative to poverty thresholds, with the poorest families receiving a median benefit of $9,262. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits from multiple programs, while higher income groups mostly received benefits from only one program. About one-third of all persons received benefits from selected need-tested programs, with some groups having higher rates of benefit receipt. The median annual benefit for recipients in 2012 was $3,300, with some families receiving larger amounts, and 25% of families receiving aid got $9,027 or more. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits from multiple programs, while higher income groups mostly received benefits from only one program. Families that received aid got $9,027 or more, accounting for two-thirds of benefit spending. The rate of receipt of aid was related to pre-welfare income and family type. Lower income groups were more likely to receive benefits, including amounts at or above $9,027. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits, with two-thirds of benefit spending going to those who received $9,027 or more. Families with pre-welfare incomes just above the poverty line were more likely to receive some benefit, but only a small percentage received $9,027 or more. Total spending on benefits was concentrated among the lowest income groups. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits, with two-thirds of benefit spending going to those who received $9,027 or more. Total spending on benefits was concentrated among the lowest income groups, with 55% of families below the poverty line receiving 76% of all benefit spending. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits, with two-thirds of benefit spending going to those who received $9,027 or more. Families with children without workers were the most likely to receive benefits at or above the 75th percentile, with 44.4% receiving annual benefits equal to or in excess of $9,027. Families with children with workers and families with an individual with disabilities also had high percentages of receiving benefits at or above this level. In 2012, families with lower incomes were more likely to receive benefits, with two-thirds of benefit spending going to those who received $9,027 or more. Families with children and families containing an individual with disabilities accounted for the majority of families receiving benefits at or above $9,027. Families without an aged person, an individual with disabilities, or a child accounted for a small percentage of families receiving benefits above the 75th percentile. Benefit receipt rates can be examined relative to characteristics like job attachment, educational attainment, and family structure. Individuals with disabilities and families with children are the focus of the detailed examination of characteristics associated with economic well-being. Need-tested benefits provide income supplements for working-age individuals with disabilities who are unable to meet their basic needs. For families with severely disabled children, these benefits help defray the costs associated with caring for them. Disability-related costs can include out-of-pocket medical expenses. In 2012, families with individuals with disabilities received need-tested benefits, representing a significant portion of all families receiving aid. The median benefit amount for these families was $6,236, higher than the average for all aid recipients. These families incur high costs even without considering medical expenses. In 2012, families with individuals with disabilities received need-tested benefits, with 60% receiving some form of aid and 23.3% receiving benefits of $9,027 or more. These rates were relatively high, even for families without typical economic disadvantages. The receipt of need-tested benefits among families with individuals with disabilities is higher among younger individuals who lack a sufficient work history to qualify for social insurance benefits. This may be due to Social Security income disqualifying them from need-tested benefits, or later onset of disability allowing for asset accumulation that could disqualify them as well. In 2012, younger individuals with disabilities disproportionately received need-tested benefits, with 14.2% being children and 6 out of 10 being under age 50. SSDI provides cash benefits to workers disabled after a sufficient work period. In 2012, younger individuals with disabilities disproportionately received need-tested benefits, with 14.2% being children and 6 out of 10 being under age 50. SSDI recipients tended to be older, with 63% aged 50 and older. Disabilities can be present at birth or result from accidents, injuries, or chronic conditions like diabetes or severe mental illness. SSI recipients under 50 often had intellectual, developmental, or mental impairments, while those 50 and older had different primary impairments. In 2012, 42% of individuals aged 50 and older had disabilities as their primary impairments, with 22% related to muscular-skeletal and connective tissue systems. Younger individuals with disabilities are more likely to receive need-tested aid, often for intellectual or developmental disabilities. The Social Security Act of 1935 provided aid to families with children who had lost a parent, allowing the remaining parent to care for the children without needing to work. The low-income assistance policy for families with children underwent significant changes over time, expanding aid to working parents through programs like EITC and ACTC. The focus shifted towards supporting parental work, leading to a broader reach of need-based aid to a wider population. This transformation was reflected in the 2012 data on families with children. The 2012 data reflects the characteristics of families with children receiving need-tested benefits, showing high receipt rates even for families not typically associated with economic disadvantage. For example, 38% of families with a full-time, full-year worker received benefits, and almost half of families with adults holding a college associate's degree received need-tested benefits. Families with characteristics usually linked to economic disadvantage had high rates of receiving large total benefit amounts. In 2012, families with children lacking an adult worker or with weak job attachment received need-tested benefits, often above $9,027. Those with lower educational attainment or headed by a single woman also received large benefit amounts. In 2012, families with children headed by married couples or men received need-tested benefits, but were less likely to receive benefits at or above the 75th percentile compared to families headed by women. Racial and ethnic minority families, except Asian-Americans, were more likely to receive need-tested benefits. Large families with children were more likely to receive higher total benefit amounts. In 2012, families headed by married couples or men were less likely to receive benefits at or above the 75th percentile compared to families headed by women. Racial and ethnic minority families, except Asian-Americans, were more likely to receive need-tested benefits. Large families with children were more likely to receive higher total benefit amounts. Total need-tested benefit amounts are typically higher for families that combine benefits from multiple programs than for families that receive benefits from only one program. The percentage of families in the top 25% of need-tested benefit receipt varies by program. Table 15 provides estimates of median benefit totals received from all programs and specific programs, as well as the percentage of families in the top 25% of need-tested benefit receipt in 2012 for each program. The top-ranked programs for families with children are subsidized child care and TANF, with median total need-tested benefits of $14,810 and $13,937 respectively. Families in these programs often combine benefits from multiple programs, including refundable tax credits, SNAP, and subsidized housing. TANF families also commonly receive SNAP benefits. The third-ranked program for families with children is subsidized housing, with a median total need-tested benefit of $11,349. Over 80% of families in assisted housing receive benefits from more than one program, but only 14% receive benefits from five or more programs. Families receiving refundable tax credits, LIHEAP, and SNAP had the lowest percentage of families with total need-tested benefits in the top 25%. In 2012, four in ten people in the United States were estimated to be eligible for benefits from at least one of the nine need-tested programs. In 2012, many eligible families did not receive need-tested benefits, with varying rates of benefit receipt among different programs. One in three people were estimated to have received benefits from at least one program, including families with incomes above the poverty line. However, many families received relatively small benefits. Families with aged members and non-aged, non-disabled childless adults received disproportionately small need-tested benefits. The aged have low take-up rates for eligible benefits, partially due to Social Security and Medicare coverage. Non-aged, non-disabled childless adults also received relatively small benefit amounts. In 2012, families with non-aged disabled members totaled 18.6 million, with 60% receiving benefits from at least one need-tested program. Individuals with disabilities may prevent work, limiting the ability of other family members to work. In 2012, families with non-aged disabled members accounted for $89.5 billion, or 37% of total spending on need-tested benefit programs. Families with children received the greatest amount and share of need-tested spending (41%). Policy debates often focus on balancing financial assistance for families with children and encouraging non-disabled parents to work. Many families with children who received aid had a working adult member, totaling 29.8 million families (23.2% of all families). Families with children without an aged or disabled member and lacking an adult worker were a small group in 2012 but received the highest benefit amounts, with 44% receiving $9,027 or more. Despite representing only 25% of families receiving need-tested benefits, they accounted for 64% of total spending on these programs. These families typically have characteristics associated with economic disadvantage, such as being in poverty or \"deep poverty.\" The report examines eligibility, participation, and benefit receipt in 2012 using data from the ASEC survey conducted by the Census Bureau. Key factors for economic disadvantage discussed include poverty, disabilities, weak job attachment, low education levels, and single mothers heading households. The ASEC survey excludes those in institutional group quarters and includes non-institutionalized population like Armed Forces members in civilian housing. It collects data on demographic characteristics, work experience, earnings, and receipt of government benefits. The Census Bureau estimates the ACTC and EITC based on household economic data. The ASEC survey collects data on demographic characteristics, work experience, earnings, and government benefits like the ACTC and EITC. However, data on CCDF benefits are not included. ASEC data may have sampling errors and under-reporting of need-tested benefits, with estimates showing that only a portion of recipients are captured in the survey. The TRIM3 microsimulation model funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simulates government benefit receipt for families. It applies program rules to determine eligibility and benefit amounts, with estimates derived from individual and family-level simulations. This report utilized the TRIM3 microsimulation model to adjust ASEC survey data for under-reporting of need-tested benefits and estimate federal tax benefits. The report used the TRIM3 model to estimate CCDF subsidies for families based on income, work, and age of children reported in the CPS. TRIM3 aligns recipient counts and benefits with administrative totals for need-tested programs, but has limitations due to simplifying assumptions in estimating monthly income. The TRIM3 model estimates income and benefits for various programs, but there are limitations in accuracy due to factors like under-reporting and lack of local area data. Key estimation issues are summarized in Table A-1. The estimates in this report are based on program rules and reflect receipt of benefits at any point during 2012. The number of recipients tends to be greater than reported by administrative data, which often show monthly participation. The report provides estimated annual benefits received by families, including refundable tax credits from the EITC and the ACTC. These credits are earned during the year but paid out once a year when families receive their tax refunds. The report defines \"family\" as an economic unit that pools financial resources and makes decisions together. The report defines the family unit as including all household members related by blood, marriage, or adoption, as well as cohabiting couples, relatives of cohabiters, and unrelated children. This family construct is used for the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and allows for a comparable examination of benefit receipt across programs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is an alternative poverty measure developed by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It considers a broader range of income sources and costs than the official poverty measure, including in-kind benefits, tax credits, and necessary expenses. The SPM also sets separate income thresholds for homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, and renters. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers a broader range of income sources and costs than the official poverty measure. It sets separate income thresholds for homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, and renters. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) uses the SPM for contextual purposes when considering the economic circumstances of families eligible for need-tested benefits. TRIM3 uses program rules to determine eligibility and benefit receipt. In-kind benefits were monetized for analysis, including housing assistance programs like Section 8. The project-based Section 8 rental assistance programs and public housing program are calculated similarly to the Section 8 HCV program, based on the market cost of housing. However, they provide affordable rental units instead of vouchers. The dollar value of a voucher is clear, but the value of an affordable rental unit is less clear, leading to potential over- or under-estimation of benefits. The Census Bureau does not inquire about Refundable Tax Credits in the ASEC survey. Tax Credits: The Census Bureau does not collect data on federal tax liabilities or tax credits in the ASEC survey. TRIM3 estimates tax liabilities and credits by applying federal tax rules to the population, creating tax filing units and determining income, deductions, exemptions, and eligibility for credits. Estimates based on ASEC data are known to be below the actual amount of refundable tax credits received. The TRIM3 estimate of the total dollars of the EITC for 2012 is $46.4 billion, compared to $64.1 billion based on SOI data. Reasons for the discrepancy between ASEC and SOI estimates include EITC compliance issues and misclassification of tax units. The report uses data from the TRIM3 model for 2012 to analyze eligibility and benefits of need-tested programs like EITC and ACTC. Medicaid, the largest program, was not included due to data limitations and issues with valuing it. The appendix provides an overview of Medicaid, TRIM3 analysis, participation rates, and the value of Medicaid coverage. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program that finances primary and acute medical services, as well as long-term services and supports. In FY2014, Medicaid provided healthcare services to 63 million individuals at a cost of $494 billion, with the federal government covering 61% of the total cost. Medicaid coverage includes preventive, primary, and acute care services, as well as LTSS, with eligibility based on categorical and financial criteria. Medicaid eligibility is based on financial criteria and historically included low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the aged, and individuals with disabilities. Since 2014, states can extend coverage to non-aged, low-income individuals through the ACA. Per-enrollee spending varies by population group, with higher costs for the aged and disabled due to long-term services and supports. In FY2011, spending per enrollee was $7,236, with children at $2,854, adults at $4,368, aged at $16,236, and disabled at $19,031. Per-enrollee spending for Medicaid enrollees varied in FY2011, with those without LTSS at $4,332 and those with LTSS at $44,719. Among LTSS enrollees, spending ranged from $25,837 to $66,006. TRIM3 estimated 65 million persons eligible for Medicaid in 2012, ranking third in eligibility after SNAP and LIHEAP. TRIM3 has limitations as it only includes data for non-institutionalized individuals. TRIM3 simulates Medicaid eligibility for full coverage, but some states offer limited benefits. The data is from 2012 and does not consider the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in significant changes in eligibility by 2015. TRIM3 does not include information on Medicaid enrollment or coverage value, making it challenging to analyze compared to other need-tested programs. Research indicates that Medicaid participation rates for adults are lower than for children, ranging from 52% to 81% from 1999 to 2010. Participation rates vary by state, with estimates ranging from 51% in Nevada to 94% in Massachusetts in 2009. Research suggests that Medicaid and CHIP participation rates for children are higher than for adults, with rates increasing from 82% in 2008 to 88% in 2012. Participation rates vary by state, with some states reaching 90% or higher. Rates are higher among non-whites, lower-income families, and those with health-related limitations. Older children and childless adults without limitations have lower participation rates. The value of Medicaid is difficult to estimate due to challenges in measuring the dollar value of health benefits. Analysts have struggled with how to account for medical care needs and resources in the poverty measure since the growth of Medicare and Medicaid in the mid-1970s. Despite two decades of experimentation, there is still no consensus on how to value medical insurance benefits for poverty analysis. The value of Medicaid is challenging to estimate as it is determined by the amount and type of medical services consumed by a family, which is related to the health of family members. Unlike other benefits, Medicaid spending does not simply add to family income to determine well-being. More dollars are spent on an individual when they are less healthy, but this does not necessarily mean the family is better off financially. Medicaid has economic value for families receiving benefits, with two major valuation methods: average cost to the government and fungible value. The average cost method estimates Medicaid's cost based on state, age, and disability status, but it may not accurately represent coverage costs. The 2008 Oregon Health Insurance Experiment found that enrollees value Medicaid coverage at $0.2 to $0.4 per dollar of government spending. The value of Medicaid coverage may be understated if the bundle of health care services covered cannot be purchased without coverage at the average cost. Additionally, Medicaid coverage has spillover effects to society, increasing its overall value. The 2008 Oregon Health Insurance Experiment showed that Medicaid coverage for low-income adults increased healthcare use, improved health outcomes, and reduced depression. It also benefits healthcare providers by reducing uncompensated services. Medicaid's \"fungible value\" measures the resources freed up for other uses by coverage, enhancing individuals' ability to consume goods. Medicaid coverage provides fungible value by freeing up resources for other goods and services, enhancing individuals' ability to consume. However, the impact on a family's budget varies depending on the cost of the medical services covered. The National Academy of Sciences recommended revising poverty measurement by deducting out-of-pocket medical expenses from family resources. The U.S. Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) does not include the value of medical insurance as a family financial resource. Starting in 2014, the Census Bureau stopped providing the average cost and value of benefits from Medicaid and Medicare. The Department of Health and Human Services asked the National Academy to develop measures of medical care economic burden and risk separate from poverty. The panel recommended comparing out-of-pocket medical expenses with available resources to assess the economic burden on families without adequate health insurance coverage. The panel recommended measuring how medical out-of-pocket expenses impact a person's or family's poverty status by assessing the economic burden and risk. They suggested federal agencies conduct research to develop a measure for medical care economic risk. Family categories in the report include those with aged members, individuals with disabilities, families with children and no earners, families with children and earners, and others. The report categorizes families into groups based on their composition, such as families with aged members, individuals with disabilities, families with children and no earners, families with children and earners, and other families. Each family is placed into only one category, even if they meet the criteria for multiple categories. This method creates exclusive categories that represent the total number of families in the population, but it does not fully capture the complexity of family structures. Table C-1 and C-2 display family structures with aged members, individuals with disabilities, and children. Among 32.5 million families with aged members, 14.1% had individuals with disabilities or children, showing higher poverty rates and benefit receipt. Of 18.6 million families with non-aged disabled members, 32.3% also had children, with a higher rate of benefit receipt."
