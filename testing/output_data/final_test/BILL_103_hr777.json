Additionally, a new section is added for indexing certain assets for determining gain or loss. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the minimum tax rate on capital gains for taxpayers other than corporations. A new section is added for indexing certain assets for determining gain or loss, where the indexed basis of an asset held for more than 1 year is substituted for its adjusted basis, with exceptions for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Indexed assets include stock in a corporation and tangible property used in a trade or business. The term 'indexed asset' excludes certain types of property, such as creditor's interests, options, net lease property, certain preferred stock, and stock in specific corporations. The text discusses exceptions for certain types of corporations, including S corporations, personal holding companies, and foreign corporations. Additionally, there is an exception for stock in a foreign corporation that is regularly traded on specific exchanges. The indexed basis for assets is calculated by multiplying the adjusted basis by the applicable inflation ratio, which is determined by dividing the gross national product deflator for the quarter of disposition by the deflator for the quarter of acquisition. The applicable inflation ratio is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent and the Secretary publishes tables specifying these ratios for each calendar quarter. Special rules treat each asset as a separate asset for calculation purposes. The applicable inflation ratio is adjusted for assets that are not indexed assets throughout the holding period, including certain short sale periods. Each asset is treated separately for calculation purposes. The tax treatment of short sale periods for assets not indexed for inflation is outlined, with specific rules for distributions and limitations on creating net ordinary losses. The taxpayer may be treated as having a long-term capital loss equal to an ordinary loss amount. The acquisition date for an asset previously subjected to subsection (a)(1) by the taxpayer is determined. The application of collapsible corporations under section 341(a) is not affected by this section. Certain conduit entities like regulated investment companies and real estate are covered under subsection (e). Stock in a qualified investment entity is considered an indexed asset based on the fair market value of the entity's assets. If the ratio is 90 percent or more, it is treated as 100 percent. If the ratio is 10 percent or less, it is determined differently. \"For calendar months where the ratio under subparagraph (A) would be 10 percent or less, the ratio shall be zero. Real estate investment trusts are not required to value assets more frequently than once every 36 months, except in certain circumstances. The trustee's good faith judgment can be used for valuation in the absence of a formal valuation. A qualified investment entity is defined as a regulated investment company.\" \"In the case of partnerships and Subchapter S corporations, adjustments made under subsection (a) are passed through to partners and shareholders. Dispositions between related persons are exempt from this section.\" \"For related persons, this section does not apply to property sales unless the transferee's basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with specific relationships or treated as a single employer. Transfers to increase indexing adjustment or depreciation allowance must have a principal purpose of securing an adjustment or increasing it.\" The Secretary may disallow adjustments for depreciation, depletion, or amortization under certain circumstances. The term 'net lease property' is defined as leased real property where the lease term is at least 50% of the property's useful life, and the allowable deductions for the lessor are 15% or less of the rental.

The term 'net lease property' is defined as leased real property where the lease term is at least 50% of the property's useful life, and the allowable deductions for the lessor are 15% or less of the rental income.

The amendments in HR 777 IH apply to sales and exchanges occurring after December 31, 1992, in taxable years ending after that date. The changes include indexing certain assets for gain or loss determination and adjustments for earnings and profits."
