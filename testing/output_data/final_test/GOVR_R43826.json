    "content": "Accreditation in higher education developed in the late 19th century to address the lack of educational standards and distinctions between high school and college programs. Regional associations formed accrediting bodies to set guidelines and standards for peer review. Accreditation in higher education ensures acceptable quality across a wide array of programs and institutions. The U.S. does not have centralized national control over postsecondary institutions, allowing for varying degrees of state control and institutional autonomy. Accreditation is a means of conducting nongovernmental oversight to maintain quality standards. Accreditation in higher education is a practice of conducting nongovernmental peer evaluation to assess academic program quality, promote continuous improvement, involve faculty and staff in evaluation and planning, and establish criteria for certification and licensure. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) oversees the quality of accrediting agencies. Accreditation in higher education is a process of external quality review used to scrutinize colleges, universities, and programs for quality assurance and improvement. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) identifies the roles and purposes of accreditation, including assuring quality, providing access to federal and state funds, and signaling to students and the public that institutions meet minimum standards. Accreditation is crucial for institutions to access federal and state funds, build private sector confidence, and facilitate smooth credit transfers for students. It also plays a key role in employer evaluations of job applicants and decisions on providing aid support for employees seeking further education. Accreditation is essential for institutions to access funds and facilitate credit transfers for students. There are three types of accrediting organizations, including regional agencies that focus on specific regions in the United States. ED and CHEA oversee accrediting agencies to ensure quality education. ED recognition is crucial for institutions to participate in federal financial assistance programs. Regional accrediting agencies grant status to institutions and their programs for Title IV FSA participation, but do not ensure program quality. As of February 2017, these agencies accredited 3,509 institutions. National accrediting agencies, including faith-based and private career organizations, accredit institutions with common themes. Faith-based accreditors review religiously affiliated institutions, representing a small percentage of nationally accredited institutions. Institutions accredited by national accrediting organizations (241 institutions and locations as of March 2017) and private career accreditors accredit a larger number of institutions (2,801 as of March 2017), many of which are single-purpose institutions focused on business and technology. National accrediting agencies recognized by ED, CHEA, or both operate nationwide and review programs and single-purpose institutions like engineering and technology. Programmatic accreditation can demonstrate that a specific department meets established standards for a certain field of study. Many employers require graduation from an accredited program and licensure in certain states necessitates recognized programmatic accreditation. Specialized accrediting agencies review units within accredited institutions, with approximately 66 agencies recognized by CHEA or ED. Accreditation is voluntary and institutions undergo the process every few years to up to 10 years. Accreditation is an ongoing process that takes place every few years to up to 10 years. Accrediting organizations are funded by annual dues from institutions and fees for accreditation reviews. They may also receive financial assistance from sponsoring organizations or government/private foundations. In 2012-2013, accrediting organizations spent over $137 million, employed 832 staff, and worked with 19,600 volunteers to evaluate institutions for accreditation. The evaluation process for accreditation involves multiple steps outlined by accrediting organizations, guided by federal requirements. Accreditation agencies have varying procedures for evaluation reviews. The process starts with institutional self-study to assess if operations meet accrediting standards and plan for improvement. The evaluation process for accreditation involves a peer review and site visit at the institution by an outside team of higher education faculty and administrators. The visiting team analyzes the self-study to determine if the accrediting standards are being met, conducting interviews with faculty, students, staff, and administrators during the visit. The accreditation process includes a peer review and site visit by a team of volunteers who prepare a comprehensive report with judgments on strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement. Accreditation decisions are based on self-assessment, peer review, and site visit results. Accreditation agencies have an appeals process and may require annual reporting, interim reviews, or substantive change reports from institutions. Critics argue the process focuses too much on inputs rather than outputs. Accreditation agencies take various formal actions after evaluations, but accreditation does not guarantee success. Accrediting agencies do not have standardized definitions for actions, and federal recognition of accrediting agencies began in 1952 to assess higher education quality. The federal government relied on existing accrediting agencies to assess higher education quality for institutions qualifying for federal aid under the GI Bill. A recognition process was established to produce a list of federally recognized accrediting agencies. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 also addressed the federal role in accreditation of higher education by maintaining the criterion that institutions be accredited by a recognized agency or association. The Higher Education Act of 1965 emphasized the importance of accrediting agencies for institutions to qualify for federal student aid programs. Accreditation became crucial for financial survival as only accredited institutions were eligible for these funds. The U.S. Department of Education does not accredit institutions but recognizes accrediting agencies through specific criteria outlined in the HEA and C.F.R. Part 602. The Accreditation Group within the U.S. Department of Education ensures accrediting agencies meet criteria for quality education, Title IV funding, and federal programs. Recognition can be revoked if agencies are deemed ineffective. The group reviews standards and procedures related to accreditation responsibilities. Section 496 of the Higher Education Act (HEA) sets standards for accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to ensure quality education at institutions. The 1992 reauthorization of the HEA strengthened criteria for ED recognition of accrediting agencies in response to concerns about fraud and abuse in the accreditation process. This was done to require accrediting agencies to provide genuine oversight of schools of all types. The 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (P.L. 105-244) expanded criteria for ED recognition of accrediting agencies to include assessment standards for schools, such as recruitment practices and student achievement. This aimed to ensure quality education and oversight of institutions. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 added criteria for accrediting agencies to assess distance education programs, ensuring quality and transparency in the oversight of institutions. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 added criteria for accrediting agencies to assess distance education programs, ensuring quality and transparency in oversight. Accrediting agencies must meet specific criteria outlined in Section 496 of the HEA to be recognized by the Department of Education. Accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary must meet specific criteria, including conducting accreditation through a voluntary membership organization or accrediting programs within institutions already accredited by another recognized agency. Agencies must be administratively and financially separate from any associated trade or membership organization. The accrediting agency must be separate and independent, ensuring quality education programs that meet stated objectives. Standards must assess student achievement, including course completion, licensing exam passage, and job placement rates. Considerations include curricula, faculty, facilities, and student support services. Accrediting organizations must evaluate institutions based on various factors such as curricula, faculty, facilities, student support services, recruitment practices, program length, and student complaints. They must also review compliance with Title IV requirements, including student loan default rates, financial audits, and transfer of credit policies. Accrediting agencies recognized by ED must meet requirements for due process, including resolving disputes with institutions. They must provide written specifications of requirements and deficiencies, allow written responses, hearings, appeals, and legal representation. Operating procedures must also be reviewed. Accrediting agencies must meet additional requirements for operating procedures, including reviewing new branch campuses and publicly disclosing accreditation status. Onsite inspections focus on educational quality and program effectiveness, monitoring program expansion and requiring teach-out plans. Adverse accrediting decisions must be reported to relevant parties simultaneously with the institution being evaluated. The Department of Education published amended regulations in 2010 regarding the eligibility of institutions to participate in Title IV programs. Accrediting agencies were required to review institutions' policies on credit hours to ensure Title IV aid eligibility. The process for ED recognition of accrediting agencies was established in 1992. The 1992 reauthorization established the recognition process for accrediting agencies, including requirements for independent evaluations and site visits. The Department of Education must make decision-making records available and publish reasons for denial of recognition. Accrediting agencies can have additional criteria beyond statutory requirements. The Department of Education recognizes accrediting agencies for up to five years, with agencies needing reapproval for inclusion on the list. They accredit various types of institutions and educational programs, including universities and specialized institutions. ED publishes lists of recognized accrediting agencies for institutions seeking accreditation and students ensuring program quality and acceptance of diplomas. As of March 2017, 36 accrediting agencies are recognized for Title IV. As of March 2017, the Department of Education recognizes 36 accrediting agencies for Title IV purposes, including national, regional, and programmatic organizations. Institutions can apply to these agencies to participate in Title IV programs. Distance education programs must be evaluated by an accrediting agency recognized by ED. Accrediting agencies for distance education are not required to have separate standards but must track student identities and notify them of any additional costs. NACIQI advises the Secretary on accreditation matters, including recognizing accrediting organizations. Established under the HEA in 1992, NACIQI was expanded in 2008 to an 18-member committee with appointments from the House, Senate, and President. NACIQI advises the Secretary on accreditation matters and appointees serve staggered six-year terms. It provides recommendations on accrediting agencies, eligibility, and certification processes for higher education institutions under Title IV of the HEA. NACIQI meets twice a year to review accrediting agencies' applications for recognition. Accrediting agencies submit application packages in advance of the meetings. NACIQI members receive applications, ED staff analyses, and other information before the meetings. During the meetings, accrediting agencies, ED staff, and third parties can present their cases. NACIQI conducts its business in public, with transcripts of proceedings available for public dissemination. Recommendations on recognition are forwarded to the Secretary for final determination. An appeals process is available for agencies disagreeing with NACIQI's recommendation or the Secretary's decision. Current NACIQI members include Simon J. Boehme, Roberta L. Derlin, John Etchemendy, and Susan D. Phillips. The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) members include individuals from various universities and colleges, with appointments made by the House and Senate. The committee conducts its business in public, with recommendations on recognition forwarded to the Secretary for final determination. An appeals process is available for agencies disagreeing with NACIQI's recommendation or the Secretary's decision. During a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), issues related to accreditation's role in determining institutional eligibility for Title IV federal student aid programs may be considered. This includes the use of accreditation as a measure of quality, restructuring the accreditation process, accreditation's role in the changing postsecondary education landscape, and transparency in the accreditation process. Both institutional and programmatic accreditation are key areas of focus. Institutional and programmatic accreditation are important measures of educational quality for higher education institutions (IHEs). Institutional accreditation signifies that an IHE meets institution-level performance standards, while programmatic accreditation indicates that a specific program meets standards for a certain field of study. The federal government may consider these accreditations during HEA reauthorization, as IHEs need accreditation to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs. Accreditation is crucial for IHEs to access vital revenue sources. Accreditation is seen as a measure of institutional quality, ensuring an IHE meets performance standards and financial stability. There are debates on its effectiveness and the role of the federal government in measuring quality. Some suggest focusing accreditation on student outcomes like graduation rates and job placement, rather than just assessing inputs like faculty qualifications and facilities. There is disagreement on how metrics for student outcomes should be determined, with some advocating for individual IHEs to set their own and others for standard metrics. Accrediting agencies could evaluate if metrics are met, considering factors like student characteristics. The federal government and consumers rely on data to assess the quality of IHEs for Title IV FSA programs. However, there are concerns about duplicating data collection efforts and adding time/costs to accreditation. A federal unit record system could streamline data collection for student outcomes. A federal unit record system could aid in collecting data on student performance and evaluating institutional performance, but current regulations prohibit its establishment. Privacy concerns regarding tracking individual student outcomes need to be addressed. The suggestion is to separate accreditation from access to Title IV funds to resolve conflicts and return it to a private quality assurance system. Consumers often misunderstand programmatic accreditation compared to regional or national accreditation. Regional and national accreditation focus on overall institution quality and allow Title IV aid, while programmatic accreditation assesses individual program quality. Programmatic accreditation demonstrates that a specific educational program meets established standards for a certain field of study, signaling program quality. While not required for Title IV eligibility, it may be necessary for access to certain employers, advanced educational programs, and professional licensure in some states. This accreditation is separate from regional or national accreditation, which focuses on overall institution quality. Congress may need to consider supporting attendance at programs lacking professional recognition, as it could impact program completion benefits. The American postsecondary education landscape is diverse, with approximately 7,300 Title IV participating institutions offering various educational offerings to a wide range of students. Most institutions must meet certain requirements to participate in Title IV programs. Most Title IV participating institutions must be accredited by regional or national agencies. The current accreditation structure may need reevaluation to better meet the needs of diverse institutions and students. Regional accrediting agencies accredit over 3,500 institutions with varying missions and student populations, leading to proposals for restructuring. Restructuring the accreditation system to focus on types of institutions accredited rather than geographic regions is being proposed to improve peer review and accountability. Congress may need to consider this restructuring to establish better measures of outcomes and accountability. The accreditation system may be restructured to focus on institutional type or mission, rather than geographic regions, to improve peer review and accountability. The process of accreditation is seen as resource-intensive, with federal standards indirectly influencing accrediting agencies. Congress may need to evaluate the federal recognition process to determine if it is necessary for accrediting agencies to be reliable authorities on educational quality. Efforts to provide access to postsecondary education to a broad variety of students and potentially reduce educational costs have led to the emergence of nontraditional educational delivery models. Some suggestions include modifying criteria for accrediting agencies and redistributing responsibilities between agencies and the Department of Education. Competency-based education (CBE) has gained interest for its potential to reduce time and costs for students. Online education models offer flexibility for students to work around time constraints. Accreditation agencies and Congress are considering how to address these new educational offerings. Minimum instructional time standards are required for Title IV federal student aid eligibility. Competency-based education (CBE) allows institutions to set their own academic standards without a \"seat time\" requirement for credit hours. Accrediting agencies review credit hour policies but do not evaluate course content. Competency-based education (CBE) focuses on assessing student mastery of learning objectives without the need for credit hours. Institutions offering CBE programs must demonstrate how competencies align with credit hours for Title IV FSA programs. Some argue for a shift in accreditation to evaluate student learning and skills acquired rather than time spent. Accreditation agencies are considering establishing two paths to accreditation for competency-based education programs to focus on learning outcomes rather than time spent working. They argue that the current regulatory definition of credit hour hinders the use of CBE and recommend giving agencies discretion to define elements of assessing student learning. This shift may take time to implement as assessments of learning outcomes need to be developed. Decoupling credit hours from competency-based education programs could provide accrediting agencies with greater focus on learning outcomes. This shift may take time to implement and develop well-designed assessments. The Secretary may include the ability to assess distance education programs, including online education, within an accrediting agency's scope of recognition. The use of online education has increased significantly in recent years, with new forms like massive open online courses (MOOCs) emerging. While the initial hype around MOOCs as game changers in higher education has faded, they still offer viable options for postsecondary education delivery. Some institutions are integrating MOOCs into their course offerings through methods like flipped classrooms and blended learning. Some MOOC providers offer certificates or badges for completing courses, which can demonstrate mastery of a skill. Institutions are considering awarding transfer credits for these badges, and employers may also value them. While many offerings are free, some may have fees for certification or assessment. Some institutions may charge fees for assessing courses for credit transfer, which are not covered by Title IV aid. Innovative approaches in postsecondary education aim to provide more convenient and cost-effective access to educational offerings. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs in utilizing federal student aid funds, including addressing accreditation's role in assessing the quality of new educational options. Different levels of accreditation may be necessary to evaluate these offerings, focusing on individual credentials rather than entire degrees. Creating a bifurcated system for evaluating specific skills desired by employers may require assessing the role of accrediting agencies and considering reforms for transparency and conflict-of-interest issues. Congress may need to implement changes to the accreditation framework to address these concerns. Individuals argue for more detailed information to be provided to potential consumers regarding accreditation decisions, such as reasons for denials or suspensions. This could increase public accountability and help stakeholders make informed decisions about investing in specific institutions. However, concerns exist that requiring this additional information may hinder private discussions between accrediting agencies and institutions. Some argue that decisionmakers should be cautious about adding more information to accreditation processes to preserve candor. The peer-review process is foundational, with faculty and administrators making judgments. There are concerns about conflicts of interest in colleagues reviewing colleagues, but others believe it distinguishes genuine quality review from bureaucratic scrutiny. The peer review process is crucial in various organizations for research and science. Congress may consider alternative methods for institutional review and the extent of peer involvement in evaluations."
