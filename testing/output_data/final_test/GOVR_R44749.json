    "content": "The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) is the main funding source for federal aviation programs, financing FAA capital investments and operations. Congress must periodically reauthorize the authority to collect aviation excise taxes and spend from the trust fund. The most recent reauthorization expires on September 30, 2017. If not renewed, there would be lapses in tax collection and FAA spending. The AATF was established in 1970 to provide dedicated federal funding for aviation. The Airway Revenue Act of 1970 established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) to provide federal funding for the aviation system in the United States. Trust fund revenue comes from taxes on airline ticket sales, segment fees, air cargo fees, and aviation fuel taxes. In FY2016, the AATF received over $14.4 billion in revenues, with nearly 70% from taxes on passenger transportation. Trust fund revenue can be volatile due to external factors affecting air travel demand. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) has faced challenges due to reduced air travel demand, caused by events like the SARS epidemic and economic recessions. Trust fund revenue, dependent on airline ticket sales, has been impacted by low-cost carriers and additional fees imposed by airlines. This has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the AATF. The recent trend among airlines to impose fees for add-on services like checked bags and Wi-Fi has led to concerns about the Airport and Airway Trust Fund's sustainability. Air carriers generated over $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015, which could have contributed $285 million to the trust fund if subject to the 7.5% excise tax. If airlines continue to rely on ancillary fees instead of increasing base ticket prices, federal aviation programs may become more reliant on the general fund. Any lapse in aviation tax authority would halt tax revenues into the trust fund, as seen in 1996, 1997, and 2011. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund experienced lapses in tax collection authority in 1996, 1997, and 2011. The trust fund did not receive billions in forgone tax collections during these lapses, prompting Congress to seek a stable funding source. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 extended aviation tax authorization to address the issue. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 extended aviation trust fund taxes for 10 years, with changes to the aviation tax structure. A lapse in FAA's authority to collect trust fund revenues occurred in 2011, resulting in approximately $400 million of forgone revenues. The Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2011 retroactively reinstated the taxes. The IRS granted relief to airlines and taxpayers for forgone revenues in 2011. Airlines argue for more revenue from general aviation, but general aviation interests disagree, stating they already pay a fair share. The Obama Administration proposed a $100 per-flight user charge for commercial and general aviation jets, opposed by general aviation interests. The idea of user-fee funding for air traffic services has been proposed by various administrations but has faced opposition from business and general aviation interests. This concept has resurfaced in current debates over transferring the FAA's air traffic system to a private entity or government-owned corporation. The air traffic control organization would fund its costs from user fees, not from the aviation trust fund. Federal aviation taxes would still fund other FAA operations. The general fund has historically contributed to FAA appropriations, particularly for air traffic services and safety oversight. The general fund historically provided between 7.2% and 28.9% of FAA's total annual funding. The debate revolves around whether aviation safety should be funded by taxpayers or users of the system. The general fund contribution is meant to cover costs that military, government, and untaxed beneficiaries of the aviation system would have contributed to the trust fund. The debate over funding for aviation safety revolves around whether taxpayers or users of the system should contribute. The general fund historically provided a portion of FAA's funding, allowing flexibility in response to changing needs. Annual FAA expenditures range from $15 billion to $17 billion, divided into four major accounts. The FAA's funding is divided into four major accounts: Airport Improvement Program (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), Research and Development (RE&D), and Operations and Maintenance (O&M). AIP and F&E focus on infrastructure development, while RE&D funds research on aviation safety and technology improvements like the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The RE&D account funds research on aviation safety, mobility, and NextGen technologies. Only the O&M account receives funds from the general fund for FAA operations. Most FAA spending requires annual appropriations by Congress, with 20% disbursed as contract authority for AIP. This differs from the Highway Trust Fund where most money can be expended without an appropriation. The FAA's O&M account, which funds air traffic operations and aviation safety programs, receives over 60% of total FAA appropriations. Recent authorizations and appropriations for FAA accounts are detailed in Table 3. In FY2016, the AATF and general fund split to finance FAA operations was approximately 80-20. FAA imposes air traffic service fees on flights transiting U.S.-controlled airspace, partially funding the Essential Air Service program. The Essential Air Service program subsidizes airline flights to small communities without commercial service, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Disagreements over trust fund revenues led to legislative mechanisms to ensure full funding for airport and airway projects. The trust fund balance grew as revenues exceeded spending commitments. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century of 2000 (AIR21; P.L. 106-181) and Vision 100: Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003 (Vision 100; P.L. 108-176) established spending guarantee mechanisms to ensure that trust fund revenues are used for aviation purposes and FAA's capital accounts are fully funded. This budgetary regimen for aviation programs requires total budget resources to be equal to receipts plus interest paid to the trust fund each fiscal year. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 amended the trust fund guarantee to ensure that total amounts made available from the trust fund equal 90% of estimated receipts plus interest for the year. This allows for a modest accumulation of an unexpended balance in the trust fund as a buffer. By the end of FY2016, the aviation trust fund was projected to have a cash balance of over $14.3 billion, with an uncommitted balance of approximately $5.7 billion. The uncommitted balance of the aviation trust fund was estimated to be around $5.7 billion at the end of FY2016, indicating a reversal of previous declines. This balance is crucial for evaluating the FAA's ability to enter into future commitments and fund planned projects and programs. A low uncommitted balance limits the agency's capacity to incur new obligations while covering existing expenditures. The cash balance in the aviation trust fund is essential for funding planned projects and programs. If the balance falls below outstanding obligations, FAA may need to delay payments until sufficient revenue is received. The Congressional Budget Office projects an increase in FAA spending from $16 billion in FY2016 to $19.7 billion in FY2026, with trust fund receipts growing from $14 billion to over $20.5 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects an increase in FAA spending from $16 billion in FY2016 to $19.7 billion in FY2026, with trust fund receipts growing to nearly $17 billion by the end of FY2026. The size of future trust fund balances depends on revenues generated by aviation taxes and fees, as well as future outflows and general fund appropriations from Congress. Budgetary issues impacting the Aviation Trust Fund include FAA's investment in NextGen and possible reforms in air traffic services. NextGen, a project to modernize the national air traffic system, has been in progress for about 10 years with approximately $1 billion in annual FAA spending. The impact on the Aviation Trust Fund (AATF) has been limited so far, as NextGen is funded within the existing FAA structure. However, pressure to accelerate NextGen development could lead to increased annual spending and require most aircraft to equip with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology for more precise tracking. The FAA is working on modernizing the national air traffic system through the NextGen project, which involves the use of ADS-B technology for more precise aircraft tracking. The deployment of complementary technologies is necessary for efficiency gains, and operators of ADS-B equipped aircraft are looking to accelerate the deployment of NextGen technologies in the next three to five years. The total cost of NextGen through FY2030 is estimated to be over $14 billion, in addition to the $6 billion already spent. This could be a topic of debate in pending FAA reauthorization legislation. The FAA anticipates annual federal spending on NextGen to peak at about $1.6 billion in FY2022 before decreasing to a steady level of about $400 million annually in 2028 and beyond. Accelerating NextGen spending could reduce total costs through 2030 by completing projects at lower prices and reaping benefits earlier. The impacts on the AATF would depend on the availability of uncommitted balances. Accelerating funding may not be feasible if funds cannot be obligated earlier due to administrative constraints. The FAA faces constraints in expediting specific NextGen projects due to administrative or technical limitations, potentially increasing demand for AATF funds. Proposals for dedicated NextGen funding have faced opposition, particularly from business and general aviation groups reluctant to support per-flight user fees. User fees have been considered as an alternative revenue source for air traffic control operations, alongside discussions on reforming air traffic control services. The 114th Congress proposed creating a not-for-profit air traffic control corporation funded by user fees, separate from the FAA. The concept may resurface in the 115th Congress. User-fee funding could shift $10 billion in annual expenditures from AATF and general fund revenues. Congress may consider restructuring AATF revenues by implementing user fees to cover current funding, potentially lowering fuel, ticket, and cargo taxes. The debate may also include whether to continue relying on general fund revenue for FAA expenses or solely use AATF revenue."
