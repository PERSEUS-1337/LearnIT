    "content": "TransCanada applied for a Presidential Permit in 2012 to build the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would transport Canadian oil sands and Bakken region crude to Gulf Coast refineries. Congressional members are divided on the project's national interest, with some supporting its energy and economic benefits while others are concerned about environmental impacts and potential exports of refined products. The report discusses the Keystone XL Pipeline Project, State Department's decision process, and key issues such as energy security, economics, and environmental concerns. Congress may influence the approval process through legislation. Stakeholders have varying perspectives on the pipeline construction. The Keystone XL Pipeline Project involves the construction of a pipeline system to transport crude oil from Alberta to U.S. markets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Alberta has significant oil reserves, making it a key player in the global oil industry. TransCanada announced the plan in 2005 to address the expected increase in oil production. The Keystone XL Pipeline Project consists of 875 miles of 36-inch pipeline linking Alberta to Nebraska, with a capacity of 830,000 bpd. The U.S. portion's estimated cost has increased to $8 billion during permit review. The Bakken Formation in North Dakota, Montana, and parts of Canada has seen increased oil production since 2006 due to technological advancements. Production exceeded 1,100,000 bpd in August 2014, but infrastructure for oil transport has not kept up. Bakken crude is currently transported by rail, truck, and pipeline, with the proposed Keystone XL Project aiming to address transportation challenges. The Keystone XL Project aims to address transportation challenges for Bakken crude oil by adding a lateral pipeline, the Bakken Marketlink, to connect to the Gulf Coast Pipeline. This will increase the flow of oil through the pipeline, supported by lower transportation costs and access to new markets. While TransCanada is expanding pipeline capacity, rail transport capacity in the region is also increasing. Federal agencies typically do not have authority over oil pipeline siting, which is usually governed by state law, except for pipelines connecting the US with foreign countries. The issuance of a Presidential Permit for a pipeline connecting the US with a foreign country requires State Department determination of serving the \"national interest.\" The State Department has discretion in deciding factors for the determination and must consider environmental impacts under NEPA during the permit application review. The State Department must consider environmental impacts under NEPA for the Presidential Permit application submitted by TransCanada for Keystone XL, requiring the preparation of an EIS involving input from cooperating agencies like the EPA. The State Department, along with various agencies, including the EPA, PHMSA, and others, released the final EIS for the Keystone XL project on January 31, 2014. The EIS is a technical assessment of potential environmental impacts, not a decisional document. It aims to inform the National Interest Determination (NID) process and addresses public and agency feedback. The final EIS for the Keystone XL project was released by the State Department and various agencies on January 31, 2014. It aims to inform the National Interest Determination (NID) process and incorporates feedback from 1.9 million public and agency comments. The final EIS represents the final stages of the NID process, with a final decision typically issued in a combined \"Record of Decision and National Interest Determination\" document. The State Department has significant discretion in deciding the factors it will examine when making its National Interest Determination (NID) for projects requiring a Presidential Permit. Executive Order 13337 requires the State Department to consult with various agencies before issuing the permit. The State Department, in making its National Interest Determination for projects needing a Presidential Permit, will consider factors like energy security, environmental impact, economy, and foreign policy. It will consult with relevant federal agencies and may also seek input from state, tribal, local government officials, and foreign governments. The State Department consulted with various stakeholders and extended the public comment period for the Keystone XL Pipeline project due to ongoing litigation. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in favor of the pipeline route approval, prompting federal agencies to submit their input by February 2, 2015. The State Department has not publicly released details of federal agencies' input on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Department must consider all public and agency input, along with relevant project information, to determine if the project serves the national interest. No specific timeline has been committed to for issuing a final decision. The Executive Order does not specify a timeline for making a determination. The federal government does not have siting authority over oil pipelines in the US, so the Keystone XL Project must comply with state laws. South Dakota required TransCanada to apply for a permit from the state public utility commission, which was issued in April 2010. Nebraska did not have specific permitting requirements for oil pipelines at the time of TransCanada's initial application. Pipeline companies faced challenges in obtaining property rights from landowners. Nebraska passed legislation in 2012 to allow the governor to approve oil pipeline siting, leading to approval of Keystone XL's route in 2013. Various local, state, tribal, and federal requirements apply to oil pipeline construction, including permits from agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA. Some in Congress sought to expedite the permit process for the Keystone XL pipeline by transferring permitting authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Some proposals in Congress aimed to expedite the permit process for the Keystone XL pipeline by transferring permitting authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or directly approving the permit applications filed by TransCanada. Legislation in previous Congresses also sought to eliminate the Presidential Permit requirement for the project and approve the pipeline under Congress's constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce. The Northern Route Approval Act (H.R. 3) aimed to eliminate the Presidential Permit requirement for the Keystone XL pipeline, requiring permits for water crossings by the Army Corps of Engineers within 90 days. The Senate passed an amendment to the Fiscal 2014 Senate Budget Resolution (S.Con.Res. 8) for the approval and construction of the pipeline. The North American Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3301) would transfer permit authority for oil pipelines to the Department of Commerce and require agencies to approve applications within 120 days unless deemed not in U.S. national security interest. Presidential Permits for pipeline modifications would be eliminated. The Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act and other bills sought to grant federal approval for the pipeline. President Obama intended to let the State Department permit review process proceed, but Republican leaders planned to seek congressional authorization for the pipeline in the 114th Congress. Multiple bills were introduced to support the pipeline's approval. The Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (S. 147) and other legislative proposals aimed to approve the pipeline without further environmental review. S. 1 was passed by the Senate and House but vetoed by President Obama on February 24th, 2015. President Obama vetoed S. 1 on February 24th, stating it circumvented processes for cross-border pipelines. The Senate failed to override the veto on March 4. Congressional leaders may propose new legislation for the Keystone XL Pipeline, potentially challenging the President's executive authority. The Keystone XL Pipeline may pose administrative and legal challenges for FERC or other federal agencies. Key issues in ongoing congressional debate include energy security, environmental and economic impacts, the Canada-U.S. relationship, and its role in U.S. energy policy. Canada is a major supplier of crude oil to the U.S., with Keystone XL potentially increasing this supply. Keystone XL would significantly increase Canada's petroleum export capacity to the United States, potentially supplying over 45% of U.S. crude petroleum imports. This could enhance energy security by allowing U.S. refiners to rely on stable Canadian supply and access growing Canadian crude output. The pipeline's proponents argue that it would benefit both countries economically and strategically. The Keystone XL pipeline would boost Canada's petroleum export capacity to the United States, providing stable Canadian supply and access to growing crude output. Energy security arguments have gained importance due to geopolitical tensions in Venezuela and other oil-producing regions. Expanded pipeline capacity could lead to competition with heavy crudes from Mexico and Venezuela, potentially displacing waterborne shipments from other countries. If Keystone XL is not approved, Alberta producers may increase rail shipments or seek alternative pipeline export routes. President Obama expressed skepticism about the Keystone XL pipeline's benefits for domestic crude supplies, suggesting that Canadian oil would primarily be sold overseas. However, the pipeline's developer and industry analysts argue that American refineries would be the main buyers of the transported crude oil. The Keystone XL pipeline's primary buyers of crude oil would be refineries, with ongoing debate about the amount that would be exported. Predicting domestic versus export volumes is complex due to changing economic factors. The Keystone XL pipeline's impact on domestic versus export volumes is uncertain, with a debate ongoing about its role in serving national interests. Refineries in the Gulf Coast region are increasingly optimized for heavy crude oils, particularly from Alberta. Concentrating on Canadian supply may expose the refining sector to greater supply risks. Prices for oil carried by Keystone XL and domestically produced oil will still be influenced by international events. The economic impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline are debated, with a focus on job creation and increased crude oil supplies. The energy security implications of Canadian crude supplies in the global market are unpredictable. The Keystone XL pipeline's economic impact includes job creation and property tax revenue to local jurisdictions. The State Department's Final EIS estimates that the project would support 42,100 jobs during construction and contribute $3.4 billion to the U.S. GDP. Additionally, the project would generate approximately 50 jobs during operations and increase property tax revenue for many counties. The State Department's job estimates for Keystone XL have been a source of disagreement due to different interpretations and definitions leading to confusion. Stakeholders and analysts have presented varying job estimates, with President Obama stating considerably lower numbers in a 2013 interview. It is challenging to determine the overall economic and employment impacts of the pipeline or alternative transport scenarios if the pipeline is not built. President Obama's remarks on job estimates for the Keystone XL Pipeline differed from the State Department's Final EIS. He suggested that the pipeline might create around 2,000 jobs during construction, with 50 to 100 jobs afterward. The President's comments were seen as downplaying the project's job potential, despite acknowledging a range of estimates on its economic impact. President Obama's remarks on job estimates for the Keystone XL Pipeline differed from the State Department's Final EIS. He suggested that the pipeline might create around 2,000 jobs during construction, with 50 to 100 jobs afterward. Other groups and studies have disputed the pipeline's potential job benefits, arguing that the limited number of \"permanent\" jobs do not justify the costs and risks associated with its development. Keystone XL pipeline proponents support the project based on its economic benefits, particularly job creation. The Keystone XL Pipeline could provide net economic benefits of $100 million-$600 million annually, with an immediate boost in construction employment. A 2009 report estimated 343 thousand new U.S. jobs between 2011 and 2015, adding $34 billion to US GDP in 2015. These estimates apply to the entire oil sands industry. The Keystone XL Pipeline could provide economic benefits of $100 million-$600 million annually, with a boost in construction employment. Studies emphasize the employment benefits of the project, with proponents arguing that temporary jobs will be significant during high national unemployment. Environmental concerns include potential oil spills and impacts on environmentally sensitive areas along the route. President Obama announced a national \"Climate Action Plan\" in 2013 to reduce emissions and encourage adaptation to climate change. The Keystone XL Pipeline's impact on climate was a key consideration in the State Department's national interest determination. The Final EIS identified GHG emissions as a significant impact of the project. The Final EIS for the Keystone XL Pipeline project analyzed project alternatives, including the \"no action alternative\" and found that GHG emissions during construction would be 0.24 MMTCO2e, while emissions during normal operations would be 1.44 MMTCO2e/year. Total life-cycle GHG emissions from oil sands crude were also assessed. The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would contribute approximately 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year to U.S. annual GHG emissions, with incremental emissions estimated at 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e per year. Approval or denial of the project is unlikely to significantly impact oil sands extraction or demand for heavy crude oil in the U.S. based on market analysis. The Final EIS presents crude oil market analysis separately from GHG emissions assessment. It suggests that incremental life-cycle GHG emissions from oil sands transported through the proposed pipeline are negligible. Operational emissions for alternative transportation modes are the main difference between scenarios. Stakeholders have questioned these findings. Some stakeholders question the conclusions in the Final EIS regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline project's climate change impacts and oil sands expansion. They argue that market uncertainties and higher production costs for oil sands crudes could significantly affect the project's outcome. Supporters of the pipeline emphasize the market analysis in the EIS. Supporters of the pipeline argue that global demand for petroleum products will ensure production and shipment of Canadian oil sands. They believe GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands are comparable to other heavy crude oils and will decrease in the future. Despite risks, pipelines and oil tankers transport most oil in the US, but rail transport of crude oil has increased in recent years. In recent years, the volume of crude oil carried by rail has significantly increased, with a 20-fold rise from 2010 to 2013. This increase is partly due to the growth in Canadian oil sands production and the pending status of the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department's Final EIS for Keystone XL compared oil spill frequency and volume by transportation mode, finding that pipeline transport has the highest barrels released per ton-mile, while rail transport has the highest reported releases per ton-mile. Despite individual rail car capacities being relatively small at around 700 barrels, a major derailment could result in releases from multiple cars. The potential for substantial oil spills from train derailments is a concern, with examples of spills exceeding 10,000 barrels in the past. However, the impact and cleanup costs of a spill are more influenced by the location rather than the volume of the spill. Even a small spill in a populated area or sensitive ecosystem can cause significant harm. The risk of oil spills from different modes of transportation, such as pipelines and trains, is a topic of debate among stakeholders. The Keystone XL Pipeline permit rejection is seen as a tradeoff between the risk of spills from this pipeline compared to other transportation modes. Congress enacted P.L. 112-90 to examine the risk factors, resulting in a 2013 report from the National Research. The 2013 report from the National Research Council (NRC) found no unique causes of pipeline failure for diluted bitumen (oil sands crude) transportation. The report did not compare spills of oil sands crude to conventional crude oil spills, but recent incidents have shown cleanup challenges, such as the 2010 spill in Michigan's Kalamazoo River. EPA noted specific difficulties in cleaning up this spill. The Kalamazoo River in Michigan poses unique cleanup challenges due to oil mixing with sediment on the river bottom. Enbridge estimated cleanup costs at $1.2 billion, higher than average. Changes to Nebraska law required avoiding the sensitive Sand Hills region for pipeline routes. The region's porous soil serves as a significant recharge zone for the northern Ogallala Aquifer. The Sand Hills region in Nebraska allows a significant amount of surface water to recharge the aquifer system, accounting for 78% of public water use and 83% of irrigation water in the region. The close proximity of groundwater to the surface along the proposed pipeline route increases the risk of oil contamination. TransCanada planned to work with Nebraska DEQ to find a route avoiding the Sand Hills after the 2008 permit denial. The governor of Nebraska approved a reroute of the Keystone XL pipeline through the state, but a court ruled the 2012 law authorizing the route violated the Nebraska Constitution. The Nebraska Supreme Court later cleared the way for the pipeline's construction on the approved route. Oil production and exports are crucial for economic development in the state. Oil production and exports are vital for Canada's economic development, with the United States being its largest crude oil customer. The relationship between the two countries has been straightforward under NAFTA, but tensions have arisen due to complications in the U.S. permitting process for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The U.S. permitting process for the Keystone XL Pipeline has complicated the energy relationship between the U.S. and Canada, leading to tensions. The Canadian government is advocating for the construction of the Northern Gateway and Energy East pipelines for oil export. Environmentalists and First Nations tribes oppose these pipelines. Trans-Canada submitted an application for the Energy East Pipeline on October 29, 2014, which could potentially ship 1.1 million bpd eastward. The Canadian Federal Government approved the Northern Gateway Pipeline on June 14, 2014, conditioned on provincial permits and consultation with First Nations tribes. The pipeline could potentially ship 1.1 million bpd eastward to supply eastern Canadian refineries and allow for seaborne exports from the port of Saint John, New Brunswick. There have been disagreements between the governments of British Columbia and Alberta over the pipeline, with B.C. Premier Christy Clark laying out five conditions for B.C.'s approval, including environmental review, spill response, addressing aboriginal legal requirements, and economic benefits. Many in British Columbia believe the province would bear most risks of the pipeline, with economic benefits flowing to Alberta. In November 2013, a framework agreement on inter-provincial energy movement was announced after negotiations between the two provinces. Approval of Northern Gateway by the B.C. provincial government is not represented in this agreement. Canadian federal government officials will continue to advocate for cross-Canada pipelines regardless of Keystone XL approval. Stakeholders are concerned about the project setting a precedent for U.S. energy policy. Some stakeholders believe the approval of the proposed pipeline could set a precedent for U.S. energy policy, signaling a commitment to a carbon-based economy and GHG emissions. With climate policy progress stalled in Congress and regulatory agencies, infrastructure permits may be the only outlet for promoting a low-carbon energy policy. Some stakeholders oppose a low-carbon energy policy due to concerns about setting a precedent for future infrastructure projects. Others support the project as a way to revitalize the energy production sector in North America and prioritize investment in domestic energy suppliers over overseas ones. The executive branch's permitting authority for energy infrastructure projects in North America has been in place since 1968, with Executive Orders 11423 and 13337 outlining the procedures. The source of this authority is not clearly defined in the orders, but typically stems from legislation or inherent presidential powers. The permitting authority for energy infrastructure projects in North America is outlined in Executive Orders 11423 and 13337, which delegate authority to the President to issue permits. Federal courts have addressed the legitimacy of this authority, as seen in a case where tribes challenged a Presidential Permit issued for the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline under E.O. 13337. The court found that the tribes lacked standing to challenge the permit, as their injury could not be redressed by a favorable decision. The court found that the President's authority to issue a Presidential Permit for the construction of oil pipelines is based on his inherent Constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy, not on statutory authority granted by Congress. The court stated that Congress has not created a federal regulatory scheme for oil pipelines, delegating this authority to the states, thus giving the President sole authority over cross-border pipeline permits. The President could delegate this authority to the U.S. Department of State, but delegation did not make the permit subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. In Sierra Club v. Clinton, the plaintiff challenged the Secretary's decision to issue a Presidential Permit for the Alberta Clipper pipeline, arguing it was unconstitutional. The defendant argued that the President's authority to issue such permits comes from his constitutional authority over foreign affairs. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed with this interpretation. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota found the Presidential Permit requirement for border facilities constitutional, citing historical recognition of the President's authority and Congress's implied approval through inaction."
