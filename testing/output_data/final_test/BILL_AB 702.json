    "title": "AB 702",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11450 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Aid shall be paid for each needy family, including eligible siblings and parents of the children, but not unborn children or recipients under Chapter 3. The family's income, excluding exempt amounts, shall be deducted from the specified sum for aid calculation, with a maximum monthly limit. The amount of aid paid for each month shall not exceed the specified sum in the table, adjusted for cost-of-living increases and any special needs. The maximum aid for eligible needy persons in the same home ranges from $326 for one person to $1,403 for 10 or more people. The amounts may be adjusted based on changes in government contributions. The maximum aid for eligible needy persons varies based on household size, ranging from $326 for one person to $1,403 for 10 or more people. These amounts are not adjusted for cost of living for specific fiscal years and no further reductions will be made. Aid will be paid to a pregnant child under 18 if no needy child is present in the family, in the amount that would be paid to one person. Verification of pregnancy is required for eligibility. When the family does not have a needy child, aid will be paid to a pregnant woman for the month of anticipated birth and the six months prior, equivalent to aid for one person. Verification of pregnancy is necessary for eligibility, and this applies only when the Cal-Learn Program is active. Pregnant women qualified for aid under the Cal-Learn Program may receive $47 per month to meet special needs resulting from pregnancy. County welfare departments must refer these women to the Women, Infants, and Children program. If the payment is considered income under federal law in the first five months of pregnancy, it does not apply except for the month of anticipated birth and the three months prior. Children receiving AFDC-FC are paid an amount each month to reach a specified rate, excluding exempt income. They are also eligible for special needs as per departmental regulations. The AFDC-FC program provides a monthly allowance for recurring special needs not common to most recipients, such as special diets recommended by a physician and unusual costs like transportation and utilities. The allowance is calculated by multiplying ten dollars by the number of eligible recipients in the family. After exhausting all liquid resources over $100, families can receive an allowance for nonrecurring special needs for clothing, household items, and emergency housing caused by unforeseen circumstances. The total allowance for these needs cannot exceed $600 per event. Homeless assistance is available to eligible families seeking shelter, including temporary shelter for those apparently eligible. Apparent eligibility is determined by evidence provided by the applicant or available to the welfare department. A family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed nighttime residence. A family is considered homeless if they lack a fixed nighttime residence, such as a shelter or temporary living accommodations, or if they are facing eviction due to verified financial hardship beyond their control. A nonrecurring special needs benefit of $65 a day is available to homeless families for temporary shelter costs. Additional family members receive $15 per day, up to a maximum of $125 per day. County welfare departments can increase the amount for shelter as needed. The special needs benefit for homeless families is granted or denied immediately upon application, available for up to three working days. The county welfare department verifies homelessness within the first three days and may refer families to the fraud prevention unit for assistance in verification. After verifying homelessness, the three-day limit for special needs benefits is extended up to a total of 16 days in weekly increments. Documentation of a housing search is required for each extension, with good cause defined by the department for unsuccessful efforts in securing permanent housing. A nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing assistance can pay for last month's rent, security deposits, or up to two months of rent arrearages. The payment cannot exceed 80% of the family's total monthly income and is only for families who have found housing costing no more than 80% of their income. The county welfare department may waive housing cost sharing conditions if a family intends to reside with others. The nonrecurring special needs benefit for permanent housing can cover utility deposits for family health and safety. Payments or denials for permanent housing assistance must be issued within one working day of evidence of housing availability. The eligibility for temporary shelter and permanent housing assistance is limited to 16 consecutive days and one payment, respectively. Families with a member who has already received maximum homeless assistance are not eligible for further aid. Applicants for homeless assistance benefits must be informed of the process. The temporary shelter benefit for homeless assistance is limited to 16 consecutive days in a lifetime, with exceptions. Families affected by natural disasters or domestic violence are eligible for temporary and permanent homeless assistance. The homeless assistance payments are provided for uninhabitability of the former residence due to natural disasters, fire, condemnation, or domestic violence. Verification is required by a third-party agency, with a limit of once in a 12-month period. Domestic violence can be verified by a sworn statement from the victim, with a maximum of 32 days of assistance. The county may require homeless assistance recipients to participate in a homelessness avoidance case plan if they qualify for assistance a second time in a 24-month period. Recipients who verify domestic violence by a sworn statement must be informed of counseling services and may be referred to services upon request. If required to participate in a case plan, domestic violence services may be included. If a recipient seeks homeless assistance due to domestic violence and has received services before, the county will review past services and offer additional assistance. The county welfare department must report data on aid recipients through a homeless assistance payment system. The county welfare departments and other entities involved in the CalWORKs program have the right to refunds from payments for permanent housing. Families can use refunds for moving costs in emergencies. Payments for temporary shelter and housing are made on behalf of requesting families. The daily amount for temporary shelter special needs benefit can be increased if authorized by the Budget Act. The department will establish rules for statewide application of housing benefits. Applicants and recipients will be informed of available benefits and given a quick application process. Payments under Section 11453.1 will not affect payment schedules or count as income for aid recipients. Children receiving Kin-GAP will be paid a monthly amount to equal the specified rate, excluding exempt income. Counties must implement semiannual reporting by October 1, 2013, and provide certification to the director. This section will be effective on July 1, 2015. The State Department of Social Services will implement the act by April 1, 2016, and adopt necessary regulations by July 1, 2017. No appropriation will be made for this act, and reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be provided to local agencies."
