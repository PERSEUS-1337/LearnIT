    "content": "The \"Safe Food Act of 1997\" establishes the Food Safety Administration to regulate food safety, labeling, and inspections to prevent food-borne illnesses from microbial, natural, or chemical hazards in food. It aims to consolidate these functions under one agency. The \"Safe Food Act of 1997\" establishes the Food Safety Administration to regulate food safety laws, including various acts such as the Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, and others related to food safety, labeling, and inspection. The \"Safe Food Act of 1997\" consolidates food safety, labeling, and inspection laws under the administration of the Food Safety Administration, including other relevant laws deemed appropriate by the President. The \"Safe Food Act of 1997\" establishes the independent Food Safety Administration responsible for enforcing food safety laws and consolidating separate food safety and inspection services and agencies. The \"Safe Food Act of 1997\" establishes the independent Food Safety Administration to terminate specified Federal agencies related to food safety laws, including agencies under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency. The Safe Food Act of 1997 establishes the independent Food Safety Administration to terminate specified Federal agencies related to food safety laws. The personnel, assets, liabilities, contracts, property, and funds of terminated agencies will be transferred to the Administration for the same purposes. After the termination of a Federal agency under the Safe Food Act of 1997, references to that agency in other laws will be deemed references to the Food Safety Administration. The termination will not affect any existing administrative actions related to the transferred functions. Any ongoing administrative actions related to functions transferred to the Food Safety Administration under the Safe Food Act of 1997 will continue despite the termination of the original agency. SEC. 6 of the Act limits the amount of appropriations for the first fiscal year to the level of funding in 1998 for agencies being terminated. SEC. 7 states the Act will take effect 180 days after enactment or as directed by the President."
