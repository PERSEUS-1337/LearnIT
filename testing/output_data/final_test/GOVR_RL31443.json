    "content": "A \"deeming resolution\" is legislation used when the House and Senate are late in reaching final agreement on a budget resolution. It establishes enforceable budget levels for a budget cycle. The resolution can be initiated by either chamber through a simple resolution. This report explains the concept of a deeming resolution, describes enforcement procedures associated with the budget resolution, and discusses House and Senate actions on deeming resolutions. It also provides information on waiving a bar against considering budgetary legislation before a budget resolution is adopted. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget by April 15 each year. The resolution sets aggregate levels of revenues, spending, debt limit, and surplus/deficit, along with allocations of spending by major budget categories. The budget process was first implemented in 1975, with enforcement relying on points of order and reconciliation procedures. The time frame of the budget resolution has extended from one fiscal year to at least five years, with enforcement primarily through point-of-order provisions. The 1974 Congressional Budget Act allows Members to prevent legislation violating budget resolution policies, with points of order requiring a three-fifths vote in the Senate. Sections 311 and 302 enforce budget aggregates and committee spending allocations. Section 311(a) and Section 302(a) of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act enforce budget aggregates and committee spending allocations. House and Senate rules differ on these points of order, with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees receiving allocations for different fiscal years. Section 302(b) requires the subdivision of allocations by subcommittee. Reconciliation is a two-step process where instructions are included in the budget resolution for committees to develop legislation changing spending or revenues. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees receive allocations for different fiscal years, with spending levels enforceable for one year for Appropriations Committees and for a multi-year period for other committees. The reconciliation process involves committees submitting legislation to their Budget Committees, which is then combined into an omnibus budget reconciliation measure. This measure is expedited through the House and Senate with limited debate time and germane amendments. If a final budget resolution is not reached, prior year's budget levels remain in effect for upcoming fiscal years. The House and Senate must adopt a new budget resolution each year for continuous enforcement of spending levels. If a resolution is not adopted, deeming resolutions are used to update enforcement. Deeming resolutions are used by the House and Senate to update enforcement of spending levels on an ad hoc basis. These resolutions are not officially defined and can take various forms, such as simple resolutions or provisions in bills like annual appropriations acts. They provide new spending allocations to Appropriations Committees and may also set new budget levels or allocate funds to other committees. Deeming resolutions are used by the House and Senate to update spending levels on an ad hoc basis. They can provide revised spending allocations to committees or declare a budget resolution as adopted by both chambers. The House and Senate have used deeming resolutions in the past, with instances of tardy adoption or no adoption at all. In 31 of the 38 fiscal years from FY1976-FY2013, both chambers adopted at least one budget resolution. Final agreement on the measure was typically reached in April, May, or later. The final budget resolution was typically reached in April, May, or early June, allowing the House and Senate to bring appropriations bills to the floor with little delay. In some cases, the resolution was not in place until late June, August, or October. The Senate usually considered legislation based on the Senate-passed budget resolution without adopting a deeming resolution. Spending levels in appropriations bills aligned with Senate Appropriations Committee allocations. In 1990, the House implemented a procedural change to start considering regular appropriations bills if the budget resolution was delayed. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 allowed the chairman of the House Budget Committee to issue provisional spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee if the budget resolution was not agreed upon by the April 15 deadline. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 repealed Section 603 of the Congressional Budget Act and incorporated a modified version into Section 302, requiring allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to be consistent with the most recent budget resolution. The House has adopted deeming resolutions to update spending allocations for regular appropriations bills. In 1990, a deeming resolution was adopted by the Senate to allow consideration of regular appropriations acts for FY1991 to proceed, setting forth spending allocations of $680.512 billion in new budget authority and $690.606 billion in outlays to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate adopted a deeming resolution in 1990 for FY1991 appropriations. S.Res. 308 allowed spending allocations pending final budget resolution agreement. House and Senate did not agree on budget resolutions in seven years. House and Senate took different actions on deeming resolutions each year. In six of the seven fiscal years, a deeming resolution was used to set a prescribed date for reaching a final agreement with the Senate on a budget resolution. The legislative vehicle for the deeming resolution was usually a special rule reported by the House Rules Committee, with one exception being a freestanding resolution. The House adopted H.Res. 1493 (111th Congress) as part of H.Res. 1500, which allowed for consideration of a Senate amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill. The House has adopted deeming resolutions as part of the opening-day rules package, usually numbered H.Res. 5. These resolutions provide spending allocations to the House Appropriations Committee and have a broader application in some instances, putting into effect the entire budget resolution at its latest stage of action. The Senate has employed varied practices with deeming resolutions for budget years, including adopting simple resolutions for spending allocations and not adopting a deeming resolution in some instances. In FY2005 and FY2007, the Senate included deeming resolution provisions in statute. In FY1999, the Senate passed deeming resolutions to establish new discretionary spending allocations and repeal outdated appropriations caps. Budget policy for that year was outlined in a five-year agreement reached in 1997. Despite passing budget resolutions in 1998, the House and Senate could not agree on a final version. To impose constraints on budget legislation, the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 86. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 86 for the FY1999 budget resolution and also agreed to S.Res. 209 to set spending allocations until a final budget resolution was reached. Later, S.Res. 312, known as the \"deeming budget resolution,\" was passed to incorporate budget aggregates for FY1999-FY2003 and authorize spending allocations. The House adopted resolutions setting spending allocations for FY1999 and establishing rules for budget enforcement. House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich submitted budget aggregates and committee spending allocations for FY1999-FY2003 in lieu of a budget resolution. House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich submitted budget aggregates and allocations for FY1999-FY2003. Concerns about budget discipline arose due to the expiration of statutory budget enforcement mechanisms. The House adopted a budget resolution for FY2003 on March 20, 2002. The House adopted a budget resolution for FY2003, H.Con.Res. 353, on March 20, 2002. Two months later, on May 22, the House included a deeming provision in a special rule, H.Res. 428, for a supplemental appropriations act for FY2002 (H.R. 4775). The provision stated that the budget resolution passed in March would have force and effect in the House. House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle submitted the required budgetary information the same day. A hearing on the extension of expiring budget enforcement mechanisms was held on April 25, 2002. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5502, the Restoring Budget Disciplines Act of 2002, to extend spending limits and pay-as-you-go requirement until FY2007. The House did not act on the legislation, and Speaker Dennis Hastert suggested delaying action until 2003. The Senate Budget Committee proposed S.Con.Res. 100 for FY2003 but it was not considered on the Senate floor. Efforts in June 2002 to extend budget enforcement procedures were made in the Senate during consideration of H.R. 4775. During the Senate's consideration of an emergency supplemental appropriations act (H.R. 4775), various amendments were rejected, including those proposed by Gregg-Feingold and Santorum. The Gregg-Feingold amendment failed on a point of order, while the Santorum amendment was tabled. Additionally, the Daschle amendment, aimed at extending budget enforcement procedures through FY2007, also failed. Later, during deliberations on the National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2514), the Senate rejected the Feingold amendment. The Feingold amendment, extended discretionary spending limits through FY2004 and budget enforcement procedures through FY2007, fell on a point of order when a motion to waive it was rejected by a 59-40 vote. Senators Conrad and Domenici urged action on a resolution extending the Senate's pay-as-you-go point of order and three-fifths vote requirement. Majority Leader Daschle confirmed consideration of such legislation before adjournment. The Senate passed S.Res. 304, urging the Senate Appropriations Committee to report FY2003 appropriations bills by July 31, 2002. The resolution extended the pay-as-you-go point of order and three-fifths vote requirement until April 15, 2003. In 2003, the House adopted H.Res. 5, setting standing rules for the budget process. The House adopted H.Res. 5, directing the chairman of the House Budget Committee to print spending allocations in the Congressional Record. Representative Jim Nussle submitted the required information. The House and Senate agreed on a budget resolution for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) on April 11, 2003. The House and Senate agreed on a budget resolution for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) which also included budgetary levels for FY2003. Section 421 directed revisions in spending allocations for any supplemental appropriations for FY2003. The discretionary spending limits and PAYGO requirement expired at the end of 2002. The Senate Budget Committee initiated action on the budget resolution for FY2005 by reporting S.Con.Res. 95 on March 5, 2004. The House and Senate agreed on a budget resolution for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) which also included budgetary levels for FY2003. Two weeks later, the House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2005 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 393 (H.Rept. 108-441, March 19, 2004). The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 95 on March 12, and the House passed H.Con.Res. 393 on March 25. Both chambers agreed to go to conference on S.Con.Res. 95 at the end of March. A conference report on the measure was filed in the House on May 19 (H.Rept. 108-498). The House considered the conference report on the FY2005 budget resolution under the terms of a special rule, H.Res. 649 (H.Rept. 108-500, May 19, 2004); the special rule was adopted on May 19 by a vote of 220\u2013204. By adopting H.Res. 649, the House implemented budget policies from the conference report on S.Con.Res. 95 for FY2005. Section 2(b) of H.Res. 649 prevented automatic engrossment of a debt limit increase, requiring Senate approval. The Senate did not consider the conference report on the FY2005 budget resolution or act on a deeming resolution for two months after the House adopted H.Res. 649. The Senate faced a $814 billion ceiling on total appropriations for FY2005, while the conference agreement raised the recommended level of appropriations to $821 billion. The Senate faced a $814 billion ceiling on total appropriations for FY2005, while the conference agreement raised the recommended level of appropriations to $821 billion. To address the $7 billion difference, the Senate adopted the conference report on H.R. 4613, the Defense Appropriations Act for FY2005, which was signed into law by President Bush on August 5, 2004. The House took actions in 2005 related to budget enforcement for FY2005, including adopting a measure setting its standing rules and making the conference report on the FY2005 budget resolution effective for budget enforcement in 2005. In 2005, the House adopted a deeming resolution for the FY2005 budget. The House and Senate actions for FY2007 were similar to those from two years earlier. The Senate Budget Committee reported S.Con.Res. 83 in March 2006, while the House Budget Committee reported H.Con.Res. 376 in March 2006. The Senate passed S.Con.Res. 83 in March, and the House passed H.Con.Res. 376 in May. Unlike FY2005, there was no conference action on the FY2007 budget resolution. The House did not take any conference action on the FY2007 budget resolution. On May 18, 2006, the House agreed to a special rule for the consideration of the Interior Appropriations Act for FY2007. Section 2 of the special rule implemented the budget policies from the FY2007 budget resolution and enforced procedures under the Congressional Budget Act. It also prevented the automatic engrossment of a measure raising the debt limit by the amount recommended in the budget resolution. In 2006, Congress and the President increased the debt limit under regular legislative procedures. The Senate faced challenges with the cap on appropriations for FY2007, which was deemed too tight. The Senate resolved the issue by adopting the conference report on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense. In 2006, President Bush signed H.R. 4939 into law as P.L. 109-234, allocating $873 billion in new budget authority to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The following year, the House took actions on budget enforcement for FY2007 by adopting H.Res. 6. The House adopted H.Res. 6, setting forth its standing rules with separate votes on each title. Title V, dealing with special orders and miscellaneous matters, was agreed to by a vote of 232\u2013200. Section 511 of the resolution made provisions of the FY2007 budget resolution effective for budget enforcement in 2007. The House and Senate finalized the FY2008 budget resolution on May 17, 2007, which included spending levels for FY2008-FY2012 and revised levels for FY2007. The revised spending levels in the House automatically superseded the deeming resolution, while the Senate had to take action to terminate it to avoid conflicts. Section 208 of the FY2008 budget resolution addressed this issue. In early 2010, events such as the extended consideration of health care reform legislation and the passage of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 may have impacted the FY2011 budget process. The new legislation's effect on long-term direct spending could have hindered support for adopting a budget for FY2011. The Statutory PAYGO Act established enforceable parameters for new direct spending and revenue legislation to prevent increasing the deficit over a congressional session. In February 2010, President Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to balance the federal budget by FY2015. The commission consists of 12 Members of Congress and 6 additional members. Recommendations must be submitted by December 1, 2010, with 14 out of 18 votes needed. Despite this, the Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 on April 26, 2010. The Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for FY2011 (S.Con.Res. 60) on April 26, 2010, but the Senate did not take further action. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer stated that a long-term budget debate should wait for the deficit-reduction plan in December. The House was working on a budget enforcement resolution to set limits on discretionary spending and endorse PAYGO. The House agreed to a special rule for consideration of Senate budget resolutions, aiming to eliminate waste and inefficiencies. The Senate, led by Kent Conrad, expressed reluctance to move forward without House action but supported implementing budget enforcement mechanisms. On July 1, 2010, the House approved H.Res. 1500, a special rule for considering Senate amendments to H.R. 4899 for emergency supplemental appropriations. H.Res. 1500 also included modifications to the House PAYGO rule and adopted H.Res. 1493 for budget enforcement in FY2011. H.Res. 1493 set spending allocations for the House Appropriations Committee and extended discretionary spending enforcement provisions from the previous year. H.Res. 1493 replaced a provision in the prior year's budget resolution, included non-binding deficit reduction language, and stated that deficit reduction achieved by the President's Fiscal Commission should be excluded from budgetary effects determination. The House adopted H.Res. 5 on January 5, 2011, setting rules for the 112th Congress. It directed the chairman of the House Budget Committee to insert budget aggregates and allocations in the Congressional Record for FY2011. The Senate did not agree to a formal spending allocation resolution for the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee proceeded with FY2011 appropriations bills despite the Senate Budget Committee passing a resolution $4 billion below the President's request. The House did not act, so the Committee needed to approve subcommittee funding levels for marking up twelve appropriations bills. The House Budget Committee reported H.Con.Res. 34 on April 11, 2011, establishing the budget for FY2012 and setting budgetary levels for FY2013 through FY2021, which was agreed upon by the House on April 15, 2011. In FY2021, the House approved the budget resolution on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235-193. The Senate did not mark up a budget resolution but rejected a motion to consider the House-passed budget resolution on May 25. The House then agreed to a special rule on June 1, 2011, deeming H.Con.Res. 34 enforceable for the FY2012 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted in August to address the federal government's borrowing capacity issue. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending limits enforced through sequestration. It also set enforceable budget levels for FY2013. The House passed the FY2013 budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 112, on March 29, 2012. Additionally, H.Res. 614 and H.Res. 643 were agreed upon to make the budget resolution enforceable with committee spending levels. The Senate Budget Committee did not report a budget resolution for FY2013, citing provisions in the Budget Control Act. Senate Budget Chair Kent Conrad filed spending and revenue levels in the Congressional Record, known as a \"deeming resolution.\" The Senate Budget Committee did not report a budget resolution for FY2013 due to provisions in the Budget Control Act. Senate Budget Chair Kent Conrad filed spending and revenue levels in the Congressional Record, known as a \"deeming resolution.\" The Senate voted on motions to proceed to different budget resolutions, but none achieved a simple majority vote. The Senate failed to adopt budget resolutions S.Con.Res. 42 and S.Con.Res. 44 introduced by Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, respectively. The delay in adopting a budget resolution creates timing issues under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, particularly affecting the Senate more than the House. The House has exceptions and waivers for considering spending or revenue legislation before the budget resolution is adopted, unlike the Senate. Section 303(c) of the Congressional Budget Act bars appropriations measures in the Senate until spending allocations are made. Waivers of this section only require a simple majority vote. The Senate has waived this rule multiple times for budgetary legislation, but has chosen not to for regular appropriations bills in some instances. Data from the 94th-100th Congresses show waivers were granted in only 13 cases for regular appropriations bills. In 13 cases from FY1984 to FY1986, Section 303(a) waivers were granted for appropriations bills. The waivers were obtained through motions or unanimous consent requests, indicating consensus on the need to consider the bills. In August 1984, an extended debate and objection to a unanimous consent request occurred in connection with the Agriculture appropriations bill for FY1985. The Senate voted to invoke cloture and approve the waiver motion. Budget resolutions have been adopted fairly timely in recent years, with most adopted in April or May. The Senate sometimes defers consideration of regular appropriations bills until late in the session due to political difficulties. During the 15 years when budget resolutions were adopted, the Senate Appropriations Committee avoided the need for waivers of Section 303(a). When the House and Senate couldn't agree on a budget resolution, regular appropriations bills were taken up by unanimous consent. FY1999 allocations were set at $531,961,000,000 for new discretionary budget authority. The Committee on Appropriations reported new budget authority and outlays for both discretionary and mandatory spending. H.Res. 5 outlined budget enforcement measures for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. The publication of budget totals for fiscal year 1999 marks the completion of Congressional action on a concurrent resolution. S.Res. 209 (105th Congress) allocates budget totals for the Senate Committee on Appropriations, including non-defense, defense, violent crime reduction, and mandatory spending categories. The Senate and the House of Representatives agree on the budget resolution for fiscal year 1999. The resolution includes recommended levels of Federal revenues for fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. The budget resolution for fiscal years 1999-2003 includes new budget authority, total budget outlays, and Social Security revenues for each fiscal year. The amounts increase gradually each year. The budget for fiscal years 1999-2003 shows increasing funds each year. Social Security outlays also rise annually. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget can make revisions reflecting legislation enacted in the 105th Congress. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget can make revisions to reduce balances of direct spending and receipts to zero. The resolution will take effect upon Congress adjourning or the 105th Congress expiring, and will expire upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1999. Committee allocations will be filed consistent with the resolution. Section 2 of the 107th Congress states that House Concurrent Resolution 353 will have force in the House until a budget resolution is adopted. The Chairman of the Budget Committee will submit allocations, identified accounts for advance appropriations, and an estimated surplus for printing in the Congressional Record. The report of the Committee on the Budget accompanying House Concurrent Resolution 353 in section 211 shall be considered as the corresponding allocation among those submitted by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. During the 108th Congress, the provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 353 of the 107th Congress will have force and effect until a budget resolution is adopted. The Chairman of the Budget Committee will submit allocations for printing in the Congressional Record. The Chairman of the Budget Committee shall submit allocations for printing in the Congressional Record, including allocations under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, accounts for Advance Appropriations, and an estimated unified surplus. The House Concurrent Resolution 353 of the One Hundred Seventh Congress, as adopted by the House, allocates funds among those submitted by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The conference report to accompany Senate Concurrent Resolution 95 for fiscal year 2005 has force and effect in the House until a concurrent resolution on the budget is adopted by Congress. Rule XXVII is not engaged in this section. During the One Hundred Ninth Congress, the provisions of the conference report to accompany Senate Concurrent Resolution 95 of the One Hundred Eighth Congress shall have force and effect in the House until a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2005 is adopted. The allocations of spending authority included in the conference report shall be considered the allocations contemplated by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Senate Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2005 sets total discretionary spending at $821,419,000,000 in new budget authority and $905,328,000,000 in budget outlays. Mandatory spending is set at $460,008,000,000 in new budget authority and $445,525,000,000 in budget outlays until a budget resolution is agreed upon. Adjustments and limits from S.Con.Res. 95 (108th Congress) apply. Total discretionary spending includes discretionary, mass transit, and highway categories. Section 504 is repealed. The text discusses the repeal of Section 504 of H.Con.Res. 95 (108th Congress) and the effective date of the repeal. It also mentions the provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 376 for fiscal year 2007 and its impact in the House until a budget resolution is adopted. Additionally, it refers to budget matters during the One Hundred Tenth Congress related to fiscal year 2008. The provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 376 for fiscal year 2008 shall have force and effect in the House as if adopted by the One Hundred Tenth Congress. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget will submit allocations and accounts for printing in the Congressional Record. P.L. 109-234, Section 7035, discusses 2007 discretionary limits. Section 7035 (120 Stat. 489-490) discusses the 2007 discretionary limits for budget allocations, including new budget authority for general purposes discretionary and mandatory. The limits and adjustments provided in S.Con.Res. 83 (109th Congress) for fiscal year 2007 apply to these allocations until a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007 is agreed upon by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The text discusses budget allocations for fiscal year 2007 as outlined in the joint explanatory statement of managers accompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget. It also mentions exceptions to certain provisions of H.Con.Res. 95 (109th Congress) in the Senate and specifies the effective date of the section. The text outlines budget allocations for fiscal year 2010 and 2011, including increases in discretionary budget authority for program integrity initiatives. It also discusses discretionary spending enforcement provisions and adjustments to outlay allocations for the specified fiscal years. The text outlines budget allocations for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, including discretionary budget authority increases for program integrity initiatives. It also discusses enforcement provisions and adjustments to outlay allocations for those fiscal years. The House finds that passage of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, legislation to reform the defense acquisition system, and health care reform legislation reducing the deficit were valuable contributions to fiscal responsibility. Strengthening the economy, creating jobs, and making fiscally responsible investments in education are critical for reducing the long-term deficit. The House aims to strengthen the economy and reduce the deficit by implementing fiscal discipline, making necessary investments in defense, and achieving efficiencies in military spending. It is also suggested that by 2015, the Federal budget should be in primary balance and the debt-to-GDP ratio should be stabilized at an acceptable level. The House aims to strengthen the economy and reduce the deficit by implementing fiscal discipline, making necessary investments in defense, and achieving efficiencies in military spending. Recommendations include identifying changes in law for deficit reduction, bringing National Commission recommendations to a vote, and using deficit reduction for deficit reduction only. The House aims to reduce the deficit by implementing fiscal discipline and making necessary investments in defense. Recommendations include enacting legislation based on National Commission recommendations for deficit reduction, ensuring that deficit reduction achieved is used only for that purpose. The House aims to reduce the deficit by implementing fiscal discipline and making necessary investments in defense. Pending the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012, the provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 34, as adopted by the House, shall have force and effect. The allocations printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be considered for all purposes in the House to be the allocations under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2012. The chair of the Committee on the Budget shall adjust the allocations to accommodate the enactment of appropriation Acts for fiscal year 2011. The House resolutions aim to implement fiscal discipline and make necessary investments in defense. Pending the adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2013, the provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 112 shall have force and effect in the House. Specific amounts are allocated for the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Financial Services for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. House Resolution 614 is amended to include the allocations of spending authority from Tables 11 and 12 of H.Rept. 112-421 as the allocations under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for all purposes in the House."
