    "content": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts a decline in U.S. coal production until 2050, with the most significant drop expected by the mid-2020s. This decline has led to economic distress in coal-dependent communities, causing higher unemployment and poverty rates. In response, the Obama Administration introduced the POWER Plus Plan, which aimed to address the coal industry's decline through funding for economic stabilization, social welfare, and environmental efforts. The POWER Initiative, part of the plan, provides economic development funding and technical assistance to help coal communities affected by the energy transition. The POWER Initiative, part of the POWER Plus Plan, is a funded program administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in its 420-county service area. It includes elements in the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and funded efforts for abandoned mine land reclamation. The program is supported by consistent annual appropriations from Congress and is the largest initiative retaining the POWER branding. The POWER Initiative, part of the POWER Plus Plan, is a federal program that provides grant funding and technical assistance to address economic and labor dislocations in coal communities. Congress is likely to show interest in programs like the POWER Initiative to address economic dislocations due to energy transition. The POWER+ Plan, also known as POWER Plus Plan, utilized existing funds to create grant programs for energy transition and support coal communities. It focused on economic diversification, social welfare for coal workers, clean-up of abandoned mines, and tax incentives for carbon capture technologies. Proposed in the FY2016 President's Budget, elements of the plan are still active under the ARC and EDA. The POWER+ Plan, proposed in the FY2016 President's Budget, involved multiple agencies and requested $56 million in grant funds for energy transition. This included funds for the Department of Labor, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, USDA rural development funds were aligned with POWER+ Plan priorities. The POWER+ Plan requested $56 million in grant funds for energy transition from multiple agencies. The plan also sought $1 billion for abandoned mine land reclamation and $2 billion for carbon capture and sequestration technology investments. The Obama Administration described the POWER Initiative as a \"down payment\" on the POWER+ Plan, focusing on economic development elements using existing funding sources. The EDA was designated as the lead agency for the POWER Initiative, with funding elements from the ARC, SBA, and DOL. The POWER Initiative grants were determined by individual agencies, divided into planning and implementation grants. The initiative was announced in March 2015, with grants awarded in October 2016. The POWER+ Plan was not fully enacted by Congress, with only the ARC continuing the program. As of November 2019, the POWER Initiative is solely funded by the ARC and no longer a multi-agency initiative. Certain elements of the POWER+ Plan continue to receive appropriations but are not designated as such by the Trump Administration. The EDA's ACC program continues to receive funding, with $30 million designated in FY2019, representing a 300% growth from previous years. The Trump Administration has sought to eliminate the ACC program and the EDA entirely in its budget requests. The ACC program, originally part of the POWER Initiative, is now a separate program. The ACC program, separate from the POWER Initiative, draws on EAA funds for projects in distressed communities. EDA defines economic distress based on unemployment and income criteria. The POWER+ Plan included funding for miners' welfare and cleanup of coal-related sites, though some proposals were not enacted. Congress has approved annual funding for these purposes. Congress has approved annual funding since FY2016 for economic development grants to states for Abandoned Mine Land reclamation, with appropriations ranging from $90 million to $115 million. The funds are divided among Appalachian states with the greatest unmet needs. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) received $115 million in funding, allocated to three Appalachian states with the most unfunded needs, the next three states with subsequent needs, and federally recognized Indian Tribes. The ARC is the only federal agency with regular funding for energy transition activities under the POWER Initiative. Established in 1965, the ARC addresses economic distress in 420 counties across 13 states. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a federal-state partnership overseeing the POWER Initiative program, which prioritizes federal resources for economic development in coal communities. The ARC funds grants for projects that promote regional economic growth, job creation, and employment opportunities for displaced workers. The ARC funds three classes of grants as part of the POWER Initiative: implementation grants up to $1.5 million, technical assistance grants up to $50,000, and broadband deployment projects up to $2.5 million. For FY2019, $45 million in grant funding was available, with $15 million reserved for broadband projects. Grants are subject to the ARC's grant match requirements based on economic distress levels. Special allowances may reduce or discharge matches, and match requirements can be met with other federal funds. County-level distress designations in the ARC's service area are shown in Figure 1. The ARC's POWER investments are aligned with its strategic plan, focusing on entrepreneurial and business development, workforce development, infrastructure development, natural and cultural assets, and leadership and community capacity. POWER investment determinations are based on annual objectives and broader priorities such as building a competitive workforce, fostering entrepreneurial activities, developing industry clusters, and addressing substance abuse. The ARC designates $50 million annually for POWER activities. The ARC's POWER Initiative, aligned with the POWER+ Plan, has seen over $148 million in investments since FY2016 through 185 projects in 312 counties, leveraging $772 million of private investment. Congressional intent for the POWER Initiative is signaled in House Appropriations Committee reports, with appropriations set aside from FY2016 to FY2019. Approximately $610 million in requests for POWER Initiative grant funding were received from FY2016 to FY2018, indicating unmet demand. The POWER Initiative in the Appalachian region has seen significant investments since FY2016, with unmet demand for funding. Coal production is projected to decline due to market forces, with coal's share of U.S. electricity generation expected to decrease to 17% by 2050. This decline is attributed to coal's higher cost compared to natural gas and renewable energy options, and could be further accelerated by policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Even with federal incentives for carbon capture, coal may not be competitive due to falling demand. Noncompetitive coal producers and communities face economic dislocation. Congress has bipartisan interest in assisting affected populations through programs like the POWER Initiative and AML investments. There is unmet demand for federal assistance in energy transition. Congress may consider reviewing the effectiveness of the POWER Initiative in assisting coal communities, potentially expanding it nationwide or targeting specific regions. Funding could be made available through other federal commissions and authorities to address the ongoing transition in U.S. energy systems. The ongoing transition in U.S. energy systems may lead to localized economic distress without new regional opportunities. Congress should consider funding levels for the POWER Initiative programs based on economic needs, program effectiveness, and macroeconomic factors. They could expand the program beyond coal to other energy industries or regions facing decline, like aging nuclear power plants. The aging nuclear power plants may lead to economic distress and displacement. EIA forecasts predict a decline in nuclear power generation by 2050. Congress may consider promoting renewable energy and carbon capture technologies to address these issues. The ARC's POWER Initiative program could be a model for assistance. Legacy programs from the POWER+ Plan continue to receive funding, indicating support for federal efforts in transitioning energy communities. The POWER Initiative program could be developed to facilitate energy transition from fossil fuel-based sources to renewables. Despite the discontinuation of the POWER+ Plan, constituent programs continue to receive congressional backing, indicating demand for federal resources in addressing energy transition issues. These mechanisms could also support ecological and environmental resilience efforts. The POWER Initiative program, part of the ARC, lacks formal evaluation on its effectiveness in alleviating economic distress from the declining coal industry. Anecdotal reports praise its success, but official assessments are lacking. The POWER Initiative, part of the ARC, has invested over $190 million in 239 projects across Appalachia, creating or retaining more than 23,000 jobs and leveraging $811 million in private investment. The ARC's 2018 report shows that outcome targets were exceeded, with a new monitoring and evaluation effort launched in September 2018. A new monitoring and evaluation effort was launched in September 2018 for the POWER Initiative, covering approximately 135 grants from FY2015-FY2017. The results of this assessment have not been released yet."
