The process for appointing the FBI Director involves presidential selection, nomination submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senate confirmation. J. Edgar Hoover held the position for nearly 48 years before the current nomination process was established in 1968. The Senate debated Hoover's tenure end, FBI's expansion, and Congress oversight. In 1976, a 10-year limit for FBI Director was added. Eight nominations were confirmed from 1973 to 2017, with two withdrawn. Two nominations were of Robert S. Mueller III. L. Patrick Gray III was appointed acting FBI Director after J. Edgar Hoover's death, but his nomination was withdrawn due to concerns about partisanship and lack of independence. Clarence M. Kelley became the first FBI Director nominated and confirmed through the process. President Nixon nominated Clarence Kelley as FBI Director on June 8, 1973. He was confirmed by the Senate Judiciary Committee the following day and sworn in on July 9, 1973. Kelley served as FBI Director until his retirement on February 23, 1978. President Carter nominated U.S. District Court Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr. as Kelley's successor on September 30, 1977, but withdrew the nomination on December 15, 1977 due to Johnson's health issues. William H. Webster was eventually nominated as FBI Director after the Johnson nomination was withdrawn. President Carter nominated William H. Webster as FBI Director on January 20, 1978, following the withdrawn Johnson nomination. Webster, a U.S. Court of Appeals Judge, was confirmed by the Senate on February 9, 1978. He served until May 1987 when he was appointed as Director of the CIA. William S. Sessions replaced Webster as FBI Director in September 1987, nominated by President Reagan. Sessions, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Western Texas, took over the role after serving on the bench. William S. Sessions replaced Webster as FBI Director in September 1987 after serving as Chief of the Government Operations Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas. He was confirmed by the Senate without opposition on September 25 and sworn in on November 2, 1987. Sessions was removed from office by President Clinton on July 19, 1993, citing concerns about his conduct and leadership. This led to the immediate confirmation of his successor, Louis J. Freeh. President Clinton nominated Louis J. Freeh as FBI Director on July 20, 1993, following the removal of William S. Sessions. Freeh was confirmed on August 6, 1993, and served until his resignation on June 25, 2001. President George W. Bush nominated Robert S. Mueller III on July 18, 2001, and he was confirmed on August 2, 2001, succeeding Freeh. Robert S. Mueller III served as the FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, being the only Director appointed to more than one term. He was also Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. Mueller oversaw high-profile cases such as the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing investigation and the prosecution of Manuel Noriega. He was nominated for a second term by President Obama and confirmed with a unanimous vote. James B. Comey Jr. succeeded Robert S. Mueller III as FBI Director in 2013, nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate. Comey's term began on September 4, 2013, but he was removed from office by President Trump on May 9, 2017. Christopher A. Wray was nominated to replace Comey seven weeks later. Christopher A. Wray succeeded James B. Comey Jr. as FBI Director in 2017, following his nomination by President Trump and confirmation by the Senate. Wray began his term on August 2, 2017, after a unanimous vote by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Nomination hearings for various Directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation took place in different sessions of Congress, including Clarence M. Kelley, William H. Webster, William S. Sessions, Louis J. Freeh, and Robert S. Mueller III. Confirmation hearings for FBI Directors including Robert S. Mueller III, James B. Comey Jr., and William H. Webster were held in different sessions of Congress. William Sessions nominated to be Director of the FBI in 1978, 1987, and 2011."
