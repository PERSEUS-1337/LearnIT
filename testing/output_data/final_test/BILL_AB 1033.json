    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11346.3 of the Government Code is amended to require state agencies to assess potential adverse economic impacts when proposing regulations, ensuring they are necessary and reasonable. Agencies must base their actions on adequate information about the need and consequences of the regulation. State agencies must consider the impact of proposed regulations on businesses, including the ability of California businesses to compete with those in other states. Interested parties can provide information for evaluation. State agencies must prepare an economic impact assessment for proposed regulations, evaluating effects on job creation or elimination within the state. This assessment is required for major regulations proposed after November 1, 2013, and must be included in the initial statement of reasons. State agencies must prepare an economic impact assessment for proposed regulations, evaluating effects on job creation, new businesses, business expansion, and benefits to health and welfare. This assessment is required for major regulations proposed after November 1, 2013, and excludes certain entities like the University of California and the Fair Political Practices Commission. Information for the assessment may be sourced from existing state publications. State agencies conducting economic impact assessments can use a consolidated definition of small businesses to determine their number in specific sectors or regions. A small business, for assessment purposes, is independently owned, not dominant in its field, and has fewer than 100 employees. This definition does not apply to regulations for insurance companies. State agencies must prepare a standardized regulatory impact analysis for major regulations, addressing job creation, business impact, competitiveness, investment changes, innovation incentives, and overall benefits to residents, worker safety, and the environment. State agencies must prepare a standardized regulatory impact analysis for major regulations, addressing job creation, business impact, competitiveness, investment changes, innovation incentives, and overall benefits to residents, worker safety, and the environment. This requirement does not apply to the University of California, the Hastings College of the Law, or the Fair Political Practices Commission. Information needed for the analysis can be obtained from existing state, federal, or academic sources. Regulations adopted after January 1, 1993, that require reports do not apply to businesses unless the regulating agency deems it necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the state's residents. Regulatory impact analyses aim to help agencies and the public assess the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory proposals in implementing policy decisions. The analyses focus on the economic consequences of regulatory choices, without reevaluating statutory policy. The baseline for analysis is the most cost-effective set of regulatory measures that achieve the regulation's purpose while ensuring compliance with relevant laws. Each state agency must submit a standardized regulatory impact analysis to the Department of Finance for major regulations adopted after November 1, 2013. The department will provide comments within 30 days on the analysis's adherence to regulations. The agency can update the analysis based on the department's comments and must include a summary of the comments and responses in the required statement."
