    "content": "Since 1966, civilian healthcare for service members' dependents and retirees has been provided through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), now known as TRICARE. TRICARE offers various benefit plan options, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE for Life. Other plans like TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve are also available, along with pharmacy and dental programs. Options vary based on duty status and location. The Military Health System (MHS) underwent restructuring in 2013, now primarily administered by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). New leadership organizations were established, and regional managed care support contracts were implemented. The Military Health System Executive Review (MHSER) provides a forum for strategic discussions and advises the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Military Health System Executive Review (MHSER) advises the Office of the Secretary of Defense on performance challenges and direction. Chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), it includes key members such as the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) and service vice chiefs. The Senior Military Medical Action Council (SMMAC) is the highest governing body in the MHS, chaired by the ASD(HA) and including other senior officials. The Senior Military Medical Action Council (SMMAC) is chaired by the ASD(HA) and includes key officials like the PDASD(HA), military Surgeons General, DHA Director, and Joint Staff Surgeon. It provides guidance for decision-making and oversees the Medical Deputies Action Group (MDAG) to ensure coordinated actions across the MHS. The MDAG, chaired by the PDASD(HA), includes Deputy Surgeons General, DHA Deputy Director, and a Joint Staff Surgeon Representative. Supporting governing bodies include the Medical Operations Group (MOG) consisting of senior healthcare operations directors. The Medical Business Operations Group (MBOG) and Human Resources and Manpower Workgroup (HR&MANPOWER WG) are part of the governance structure overseeing direct and purchased care systems in the Military Health System (MHS). They provide resource management input and support centralized policy coordination. The HR&MANPOWER WG supports centralized policy execution and guidance for development of human resources and manpower policies in the MHS. The eMSM Leadership Group consists of six Market Managers overseeing geographic MHS markets, providing a forum to discuss clinical and business issues. The ASD(HA) is supported by the Policy Advisory Council composed of Deputy Assistant Secretaries. The Policy Advisory Council (PAC), advised by key officials, supports MHS-wide policy development and oversight. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is designated as a Combat Support Agency to focus on medical readiness and be responsive to Combatant Commanders. The ASD(HA) will present a plan for implementing a shared services model within the military health system. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) will take over shared services in the military health system, including TRICARE, pharmacy programs, medical education, research, and more. The current JTF CAPMED will become part of the National Capital Region under DHA. The military health system serves 9.7 million beneficiaries through private providers and DOD facilities worldwide, employing 68,000 civilians and 86,000 military personnel. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) will take over shared services in the military health system, including TRICARE, pharmacy programs, medical education, research, and more. TRICARE is administered through managed care support contracts in three regions: TRICARE North Region covering multiple states and TRICARE South Region covering several southern states. Civilian providers under contract to DOD have played a significant role in defense health reconstruction. The TRICARE program is administered through managed care support contracts in three regions: North, South, and West. The regional contractors are Health Net Federal Services for the North region, Humana Military Health Services for the South region, and UnitedHealthcare for the West region. These contracts were re-competed in 2009 and became operational between 2011 and 2012. UnitedHealthcare began providing services to the TRICARE West region on April 1, 2013. The unified medical budget prepared by ASD(HA) includes funding for fixed medical treatment facilities/activities, personnel, and payments to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. Funding for combat support medical units/activities is the responsibility of military service combatant or support commands. Unified medical budget funding for military health care is appropriated through various sources, including the defense appropriations bill for Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funding. Military medical personnel and TRICARE for Life payments are funded under the Military Personnel title, while medical military construction is funded under the Department of Defense title. Transfers from the MERHCF to reimburse TRICARE for services provided to Medicare eligible retirees are authorized by Section 1113 of title 10, United States Code. War-related military health care costs are generally funded separately. The President's budget typically includes a unified medical budget request for the military health system, with separate funding for the Defense Health Program and the Medical Military Construction. The Obama Administration's FY2014 unified medical budget request totaled $49.4 billion, with $33.1 billion allocated for the Defense Health Program. The FY2014 unified medical budget request for the military health system included $49.4 billion, with allocations for the Defense Health Program, military personnel, medical military construction, and accrual payments to the MERHCF. The establishment of the Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund was directed by the FY2001 NDAA to provide care for Medicare-eligible retirees starting in 2002 through TRICARE for Life. The DOD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Board of Actuaries oversees accrual deposits into the Fund, which are made by agencies employing future beneficiaries. Transfers out are based on estimates of actual care costs. The Fund had assets of $163.6 billion as of September 30, 2011. The Board reviews the fund's actuarial status annually and reports to the Secretary of Defense, President, and Congress every four years. The DOD Office of the Actuary provides support to the Board. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness oversees the defense health program, including the management of the MERHCF. The Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 provided a statutory basis for dependents of active duty members and retirees to seek care at MTFs. Congress adopted the Military Medical Benefits Amendments in 1966 to allow DOD to contract with civilian health providers for non-hospital-based care due to resource constraints. TRICARE, established in 1966, provides civilian health care to eligible dependents and retirees through various benefit plans such as TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Extra, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE for Life. Additional plans include TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve, along with pharmacy and optional dental programs. Beneficiaries' options vary based on their relationship to a sponsor and the sponsor's duty status. Eligibility for TRICARE is determined by the uniformed services and reported to DEERS. Beneficiaries are divided into sponsors (active duty, National Guard/Reserve, or retired servicemembers) and dependents (spouses, children, former spouses). TRICARE Prime is a managed healthcare option similar to an HMO. TRICARE Prime is a managed healthcare option similar to an HMO, with a primary healthcare provider managing care and providing referrals to specialists. Beneficiaries must enroll and pay an annual fee, receiving priority appointments at military facilities and paying less out of pocket. Active duty servicemembers are required to use TRICARE Prime, with no annual deductible. Retired servicemembers and their family members are exempt from the enrollment fee. TRICARE Prime annual enrollment fees for military retirees were increased in FY2012 for new enrollees for the first time since the program began. Moving forward, under 10 U.S.C. 1097(e) TRICARE Prime enrollment fees will be subject to increases each fiscal year based on the annual retirement pay cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. For FY2013 (October 1, 2012\u2013September 30, 2013) this enrollment fee is $269.28 for an individual and $538.56 for individual plus family coverage. TRICARE Standard is a traditional fee-for-service (FFS) option that does not require beneficiaries to enroll in order to participate. TRICARE Standard plan allows the use of out-of-network providers with higher out-of-pocket costs, annual deductibles based on pay grades, and requires payment of the difference between provider charges and plan reimbursement. TRICARE Extra, available to Standard beneficiaries, offers reduced copayments by using network providers who agree to accept lower payments and file claims. TRICARE Reserve Select is a premium-based health plan for qualified Selected Reserve members and their families. Members pay 28% of the program cost, and it provides benefits similar to TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Reserve Select is a premium-based health plan for qualified Selected Reserve members and their families, with members paying 28% of the program cost in the form of premiums. Premiums for calendar year 2013 were $51.62 per month for member only coverage and $195.81 per month for member and family coverage, while for calendar year 2014, premiums increased to $51.68 per month for member only coverage and $204.29 per month for member and family coverage. Additionally, TRICARE Retired Reserve was established for \"gray area\" reservists who have retired but are too young to draw retirement pay, offering a premium-based health plan for retired National Guard and Reserve members under the age of 60 and their eligible family members. TRICARE Retired Reserve is a premium-based health plan for retired Reserve Component members under 60 and their eligible family members. Unlike TRICARE Reserve Select, there is no government subsidy, so members must pay the full premium cost plus an administrative fee. Premiums for 2013 were $402.11 per month for member only and $969.10 per month for member-and-family plans, while 2014 premiums were $390.99 and $956.65 respectively. Members become eligible for TRICARE Standard, Extra, or Prime options at age 60. The TRICARE Young Adult Program, established under 10 U.S.C. 1110b, allows unmarried children up to age 26 to purchase individual TRICARE coverage. Unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act, this program requires a separate premium based on actuarial costs. In 2013, monthly premiums were $176 for TYA Prime and $152 for TYA Standard enrollment. TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program offers Prime and Standard enrollment options with monthly premiums of $180 and $156 in 2013. TRICARE for Life serves as supplemental coverage for Medicare-eligible military retirees, functioning as a secondary payer to Medicare. It covers out-of-pocket costs for medical services under Medicare and provides additional medical benefits not covered by Medicare. Prior to TRICARE for Life, coverage for Medicare-eligible individuals was limited to military treatment facilities. To enroll in TRICARE for Life, TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries must enroll in and pay monthly premiums for Medicare Part B. Declining Part B results in loss of TRICARE benefits. Each TRICARE plan has different cost-sharing arrangements based on military status and care location. Active duty service members receive free medical care. The TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program allows beneficiaries to obtain prescription drugs through various sources. Active duty family members pay nothing out-of-pocket for care, except for a $300-$600 deductible with the point-of-service option. After meeting the deductible, beneficiaries pay 50% of the TRICARE-allowable charge as a cost-share. The Pharmacy Benefits Program maintains a formulary of pharmaceutical agents based on clinical and cost effectiveness. The formulary is updated by a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee composed of facility pharmacies and health care providers. The committee's recommendations are reviewed by a Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory before approval by the Executive Director of TRICARE. The Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory (UFBBA) consists of representatives from various organizations and contractors involved in the TRICARE pharmacy program. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at military treatment facilities without a copayment, with facilities stocking a subset of the Uniform Formulary. Non-formulary drugs are generally not available at military treatment facilities. TRICARE beneficiaries can fill prescriptions at military treatment facilities without a copayment, with facilities stocking a subset of the Uniform Formulary. Non-formulary drugs are generally not available at military treatment facilities. Certain Uniform Formulary covered pharmaceuticals may not be available due to national contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers. DOD collaborates with various organizations to develop contracting strategies for national pharmaceutical initiatives. TRICARE beneficiaries can also fill prescriptions through retail pharmacy drug stores using the TPharm services provided by a TRICARE pharmacy benefit manager. The current contract with Express Scripts, Inc. provides TPharm services for TRICARE beneficiaries. Beneficiaries can use a national network of retail pharmacies without filing a claim for reimbursement. Generic drugs are required when available, with brand-name drugs dispensed only with approval. Copayments are currently in place for medications. Currently, copayments for non-active duty TRICARE beneficiaries for a 30-day supply of medication filled through a network pharmacy are $5 for generic formulary drugs, $17 for brand-name formulary drugs, and $44 for non-formulary drugs. Copayments at non-network pharmacies vary based on the TRICARE plan, with active duty members receiving full reimbursement. Other TRICARE Prime option enrollees pay a 50% cost share after meeting a deductible of $50-$150 per person or $100-$300 per family. Under recent legislation, pharmaceuticals paid for by DOD provided by network retail pharmacies to TRICARE beneficiaries are subject to federal pricing standards, established under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. This act set federal ceiling prices for covered pharmaceuticals, requiring a minimum 24% discount off non-federal average manufacturing prices, resulting in a slowdown in the overall growth of retail prescription drug costs for DOD. TRICARE beneficiaries can get prescription drugs delivered through Express Scripts with copayments of $13 for brand-name and $43 for non-formulary medications. Generic drug copayments for home delivery were eliminated in 2011. DOD negotiates lower prices with manufacturers for mail-order drugs. A campaign in 2009 promoted home delivery benefits, leading to a 17% increase in usage by FY2011. The Secretary of Defense can adjust copayment requirements for the pharmacy program. The Extended Care Health Option (ECHO) supplements TRICARE by providing benefits not covered by TRICARE, such as assistive services, equipment, in-home respite care services, and special education for qualifying mental or physical conditions. Qualifying conditions include neuromuscular developmental conditions, homebound beneficiaries, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities. Copayment increases for the pharmacy program are limited from FY2014 to FY2022 to the percentage by which retirement pay is increased that year. Access to ECHO benefits requires registration through the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) and a monthly cost share based on the sponsor's pay grade. Monthly costs range from $25 to $250 depending on pay grade. The total TRICARE cost share for all ECHO benefits is $36,000 per covered beneficiary per fiscal year. The EHHC benefit provides skilled services to homebound ECHO beneficiaries requiring more than 28 to 35 hours per week of care. The EHHC benefit under ECHO provides up to 35 hours per week of home health services or respite care for qualified beneficiaries in certain locations. Coverage is capped annually based on TRICARE's maximum payment for skilled nursing facility care. ECHO qualified beneficiaries include active duty family members, National Guard/Reserve members' family, Transitional Assistance Management Program participants, victims of abuse under the Transitional Compensation Program, and transitional survivors of deceased active duty sponsors. Active duty personnel, military retirees, and their dependents have unequal access to care in military medical facilities. Active duty personnel have top priority access and are entitled to health care, while dependents have access on a space-available basis. Retirees and their dependents do not have the same entitlement and may receive care based on availability. Retirees and their dependents may receive medical and dental care in military facilities based on availability, with active-duty personnel and their dependents having priority access. The policy of prioritizing active-duty dependents over retirees has been in place since 1958. TRICARE established priorities for care, with active-duty servicemembers having top priority, followed by active-duty family members enrolled in TRICARE Prime, and then retirees, their family members, and survivors enrolled in TRICARE Prime. Priority for receiving medical care in military facilities is given to active-duty personnel and their dependents, followed by retirees and their family members. This prioritization ensures that active duty members can focus on their military service without worrying about healthcare for their dependents, especially when they are separated due to assignments overseas or aboard ship. Retirees, who are not subject to such separations, are in a better position to ensure their dependents receive care if needed outside of military facilities. This unique approach to healthcare delivery in the military recognizes the different needs of the military mission compared to civilian healthcare. The military offers generous benefits to servicemembers and retirees, including medical care at VA facilities. Despite a decrease in active duty personnel, costs for the military health system are expected to rise. Total system costs increased for inpatient and outpatient services but decreased for prescription drugs due to pricing standards. The DOD's pharmacy program is subject to federal pricing standards. The cost of the military health care system is projected to increase significantly, with average annual growth rates of 6.0% according to the CBO. Real growth rates for pharmaceuticals are estimated at 5.5% per year. DOD forecasts project Defense Health Program costs to rise by 3.4% in FY2014, 3.35% in FY2015, 3.6% in FY2016, and 3.9% in FY2017. This growth is due to inflation in healthcare costs and an increasing percentage of care for retirees and their dependents. By 2015, retirees and their dependents are expected to make up over 65% of DOD health care costs. The CBO found that TRICARE beneficiaries use inpatient and outpatient care at higher rates due to low out-of-pocket costs. DOD proposed new fees and cost-sharing increases for retiree TRICARE plans in their FY2013 budget submission, based on recommendations from a 2007 task force. Military health care premiums for individual retirees under 65 using TRICARE Prime have decreased from 11% to 4% of total costs. The proposed cost-sharing increases and new fees for TRICARE Prime have decreased from 11% to 4% of total health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not directly affect TRICARE administration, health care benefits, eligibility, or cost to beneficiaries, but it did open a special Medicare Part B enrollment window for certain individuals to gain coverage under the TRICARE for Life program. The ACA waived the Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty for military retirees, spouses, and dependent children eligible for TRICARE. The Secretary of Defense identifies and notifies individuals of their eligibility for the special enrollment period. The Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act clarified that this applies to Part B elections made after March 23, 2010. Health care providers treating TRICARE patients cannot bill more than 115% of authorized charges. Providers treating TRICARE patients are limited to billing 115% of authorized charges, with exceptions granted by DOD. Payment levels align with Medicare's fee schedule, with 90% equivalent and steps to adjust the rest. TRICARE implemented an outpatient payment system aligned with Medicare's reimbursement system for hospital outpatient services. Medicare's reimbursement payment system for hospital outpatient services, known as the OPPS, pays services based on APC groups and HCPCS codes. TRICARE providers must follow Medicare coding requirements, with exceptions for unique services. TRICARE pays providers for inpatient services according to published schedules. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) is a method for determining annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule. If Medicare costs exceed expectations, provider fees are reduced to bring expenditures back in line with targets. This requirement was added by Section 731 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. The SGR system has led to annual reductions in reimbursement rates, which Congress has overridden through temporary postponements known as \"doc fixes.\" The most recent override was in the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013, delaying cuts until March 31, 2014. TRICARE reimbursement rates are required to be equal to Medicare rates, but exceptions can be made for provider network adequacy or access to care. Active duty military personnel have been covered by Social Security and paid taxes since 1957. Congress created Medicare in 1965 to provide health insurance for those 65 and older. CHAMPUS was established in 1966 to provide medical care for retired military members and their dependents. Retirees become ineligible for CHAMPUS at age 65 when they qualify for Medicare. After debates on fairness, Congress provided TRICARE for Life (TFL) in 2001 to cover out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services for beneficiaries over 64. Disabled persons under 65 entitled to Medicare can still receive CHAMPUS benefits as a secondary payer to Medicare Parts A and B. Enrollment in Medicare Part B is required for TFL, with typical premiums of $104.90 per month. Enrollment in Medicare Part B, with premiums of $104.90 per month in 2013, is a concern for some beneficiaries, especially those who didn't enroll at 65 and face penalties. Waiving penalties for military retirees may be seen as unfair to other Medicare users. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act waived penalties for military retirees in 2004. The ACA created a special enrollment period for reservists and National Guardsmen on active duty. Reserve personnel on active duty have the same medical benefits as regular military personnel, including coverage for illnesses incurred during training or travel. Congress has expanded medical benefits for Reservists, with TRICARE coverage available up to 180 days before reporting for activation. Reservists serving more than 30 days in a contingency operation are eligible for 180 days of TRICARE coverage after service under TAMP. TRICARE Reserve Select is an optional program for Reserve Component members not on active duty. The TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) program is available to Reserve Component members not on active duty. Eligibility requires not being on active duty orders, not covered under the Transitional Assistance Management Program, and not enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. TRS coverage involves monthly premiums and does not guarantee \"free medical care for life\" as some personnel may have been led to believe. Access to military medical facilities for non-active-duty personnel is based on availability. The TRICARE Reserve Select program is available to Reserve Component members not on active duty, with eligibility requirements and monthly premiums. Rear Admiral Harold M. Koenig and Dr. Stephen C. Joseph discussed the misconception of \"free medical care for life\" for retirees, with differing views on the government's obligation. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act addressed this issue in Section 752. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) acknowledged a moral obligation to provide health care to retired military personnel in exchange for their service. Congress has allocated additional funding for medical research within the Department of Defense, including $25 million for breast cancer research in 1992. The DOD received $210 million for extramural breast cancer research in 1992, leading to the establishment of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) within USAMRMC. The Program manages $6 billion for research on various health concerns, with guidance on allocation provided in conference report language. This funding is not considered an earmark. The Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) manages $6 billion for research on various health concerns, with funding allocated to specific diseases and research areas through peer-reviewed, competitively awarded research grants. DOD policy prohibits the use of live animals for training and education, except in cases where no alternatives are available for pre-deployment training for medical personnel. The Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) manages $6 billion for research on various health concerns, with funding allocated to specific diseases and research areas through peer-reviewed, competitively awarded research grants. DOD policy prohibits the use of live animals for training and education, except in cases where no alternatives are available for pre-deployment training for medical personnel. Training includes infant intubation (ferrets); microsurgery (rodents); and combat trauma training (goats and swine)."
