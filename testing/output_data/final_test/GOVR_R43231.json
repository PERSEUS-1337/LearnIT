    "content": "The increased use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the United States has led to a surplus of natural gas, resulting in lower domestic prices. This has sparked interest in exporting liquefied natural gas to take advantage of higher prices in world markets. The report reviews federal laws and regulations governing the export of natural gas, crude oil, and coal. The report discusses federal laws and regulations governing the export of natural gas, crude oil, and coal. Transactions involving exports are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) enforced by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), with the need for an export license depending on various factors. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) provide instructions for exporters to determine if an export transaction requires a license, including submitting a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) or Automated Export System (AES) Record in certain circumstances. The declaration includes exporter identification, commodity details, export date, and destination country. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 prohibits the export of crude oil and natural gas produced in the United States, with exemptions allowed based on national interest and specific criteria. The regulations for these exemptions are outlined in the BIS regulations on Short Supply Controls at 15 C.F.R. \u00a7754.2. A license is required for exports of crude oil. The regulations require a license for exports of crude oil, including to Canada. BIS issues licenses for certain exemptions, such as exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet and exports to Canada for consumption. Other exemptions include exports in connection with refining, certain international agreements, and exports of foreign origin crude oil with documentation proving non-U.S. origin. BIS reviews applications for crude oil exports. The regulations require a license for exports of crude oil, including to Canada, with exemptions for certain cases like exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet and exports for consumption in Canada. BIS reviews applications for crude oil exports on a case-by-case basis, generally approving temporary exports or transactions that ensure an equal or greater quantity and quality of crude oil is imported. The regulations require a license for exports of crude oil, with exemptions for certain cases like exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet and exports for consumption in Canada. BIS reviews applications for crude oil exports on a case-by-case basis, generally approving temporary exports or transactions that ensure an equal or greater quantity and quality of crude oil is imported. The regulations also provide exceptions to the general license requirement, including foreign origin crude oil stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, small samples exported for testing purposes, and exports of oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act. Additionally, Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act prohibits the export of natural gas from the United States without Commission authorization. The Commission is authorized to grant export and import authorizations unless it finds it not in the public interest. The Federal Power Commission's responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1977. Title III of the DOE Organization Act transferred the authority to authorize natural gas imports and exports from the Federal Power Commission to DOE. Section 402(f) of the act specifies that FERC cannot regulate natural gas exports or imports unless assigned by the Secretary of Energy. The Office of Fossil Energy within DOE handles natural gas exporting responsibilities, with procedures for authorization outlined in 10 C.F.R. Part 590 regulations. These regulations establish filing requirements and review procedures, allowing interested parties to participate in the process before DOE issues orders. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 streamlined the authorization process for natural gas imports and exports to certain countries under NGA Section 3. Imports and exports to countries with free trade agreements are deemed consistent with the public interest and granted without delay. This provision eases the authorization process for specific countries. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 streamlined the authorization process for natural gas imports and exports to certain countries under NGA Section 3, including Canada and Mexico. State rights are protected in permitting decisions, and there have been legislative efforts to expand coal exports. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Secretary of Commerce to create a plan for expanding coal exports through ports on the East Coast or Gulf of Mexico. Laws and regulations applicable to export facilities could potentially affect coal exports, with various approval requirements for different types of facilities enabling the export of oil and natural gas. Additionally, federal approvals or authorizations may be required for facilities used in the export or import of fossil fuels. Facilities involved in the export or import of fossil fuels, such as ports, require federal approvals. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulates the construction and operation of ports in the United States, ensuring compliance with environmental acts. Coal exports do not have special facility permitting requirements, but facilities for exporting coal or other fossil fuels must meet federal regulations. Crude oil can be exported through pipelines or vessels, with border crossing facilities needing authorization. When crossing the border with Canada or Mexico, border crossing facilities for petroleum and other products must be authorized by the federal government. The U.S. State Department has authority over the construction and operation of these facilities since Executive Order 11423 in 1968, with Executive Order 13337 amending the procedures but not altering the delegation of authority to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State is designated to receive applications for permits for the construction, operation, or maintenance of pipelines, conveyor belts, facilities for water or sewage transportation, monorails, aerial tramways, and bridges at the borders of the United States. This authority was granted by Executive Order 13337, which amended procedures for Presidential Permits as outlined in Executive Order 11423. Executive Order 13337 designates the Secretary of State to authorize the construction, operation, or maintenance of facilities for the importation or exportation of fuels at the U.S. borders if it serves the national interest. The source of the permitting authority is not explicitly stated in the executive orders. The permitting authority for executive branch powers is not explicitly stated in the executive orders. Executive Order 11423 does not mention the source of its authority, while Executive Order 13337 refers to the Constitution and laws of the United States. Courts have found this delegation of authority to be legitimate under the President's constitutional authority. The President's constitutional authority over foreign affairs and as Commander in Chief allows for the issuance of Executive Orders governing permits for cross-border natural gas pipelines. Executive Order 10485 designates the Federal Power Commission to receive applications for permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the transmission of electric energy and natural gas between the United States and foreign countries. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to issue permits for the construction, operation, maintenance, or connection of natural gas facilities at the borders of the United States. This authority is similar to the State Department's authority over oil pipelines in Executive Orders 11423 and 13337. The Secretary of Energy can attach conditions to the permit as needed for the public interest. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to issue permits for natural gas facilities at US borders, citing statutory authority from the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 transferred the Federal Power Commission's functions to DOE and FERC. DOE took over the FPC's Presidential Permit authority for border crossing facilities. FERC was given the authority to issue Presidential Permits for natural gas pipeline border crossings in 2006. Section 3(e) of the NGA, as outlined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, grants FERC exclusive authority over the approval of LNG terminal applications. FERC is designated as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorizations and environmental compliance. The agency's regulations at 18 C.F.R. \u00a7153 govern the application process, starting with a pre-filing submission at least six months before the formal application. FERC requires pre-filing procedures at least six months before a formal LNG application. Detailed site engineering, safety evidence, and location details are needed for the formal application. Landowners must be notified of proposed LNG facilities. FERC provides blanket certificates for natural gas infrastructure projects. The Marrakesh Agreement under the WTO covers international trade agreements. The World Trade Organization (WTO) contains binding agreements for all members, including regulations for trade in energy products like LNG, coal, and oil under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT Article I requires equal treatment for products from all WTO members, impacting a nation's ability to restrict fossil fuels. This includes rules and formalities for importation and exportation, potentially affecting export prerequisites like licensing. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has binding agreements for all members, including regulations for trade in energy products like LNG, coal, and oil under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT Article I requires equal treatment for products from all WTO members, impacting a nation's ability to restrict fossil fuels. This includes rules and formalities for importation and exportation, such as licensing requirements. More favorable treatment given to imports from specific countries in the context of import licensing requirements may be considered an advantage under Article I of the GATT. There are exceptions to the Most Favored Nation Treatment requirements for Free Trade Agreements (FTA) under Article XXIV of GATT 1994. Article XXIV of GATT 1994 allows countries to provide more favorable treatment to countries with which they have established an FTA. The FTA must eliminate duties and restrictions on commerce for \"substantially all the trade in products originating in those territories.\" If the countries have a qualifying FTA, more favorable treatment towards energy products could be included without violating the GATT. Energy products are crucial to the agreement, with Article XI of the GATT addressing import and export restrictions. Article XI:1 prohibits quantitative restrictions on exports to any WTO member's territory, such as embargoes, quotas, and export licensing requirements. Only duties, taxes, and charges are allowed to restrict exports under the GATT. WTO panel decisions have consistently ruled that import bans through licensing systems violate Article XI, which will likely influence future decisions on the GATT-consistency of export bans and licensing. A licensing program that gives discretion to deny export licenses based on vague criteria violates Article XI of the GATT. Export licensing practices causing delays may also be inconsistent with Article XI. Restricting fossil fuel exports could lower domestic prices, potentially acting as a subsidy to downstream users like the petrochemical industry under the GATT 1994 and SCM Agreement. The SCM Agreement allows countervailing measures against actionable subsidies that harm a WTO member's interests. Export restraints on fossil fuels can lower input costs for downstream manufacturers, giving them a competitive advantage. The U.S. argued at the WTO that export restraints should be treated as subsidies. The USTR argued at the WTO that export restrictions could be seen as a subsidy to downstream producers. However, the panel rejected this argument, stating that such restrictions do not constitute a financial contribution by the government. This ruling suggests that future panels may be hesitant to consider export restrictions as subsidies under WTO rules. Under WTO rules, procedures that lead to export restrictions could be considered a subsidy. Article XX of the GATT allows exceptions for violations, with countries needing to show their actions fit under specific clauses. When it comes to trade in energy products, countries often use exceptions under Article XX(b) or XX(g) to justify their actions. Article XX(b) allows practices necessary for protecting life or health, while Article XX(g) permits measures related to conserving natural resources alongside restrictions on domestic production or consumption. Export restrictions under WTO rules may be considered a subsidy and must be justified under specific clauses like Article XX. Restrictions on fossil fuels for security reasons may be allowed under Article XXI, which permits actions for essential security interests during war or emergencies. Under Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT 1947), parties had broad discretion to identify an \"emergency\" for security reasons, allowing measures like trade embargoes and import quotas. The United States believes Article XXI is \"self-judging,\" meaning each member decides if its use of the exception is valid. There is currently no WTO case law on the use of national security exceptions. Some scholars speculate that a WTO panel may scrutinize a member's use of Article XXI of the GATT 1994 in the future. The United States is party to various FTAs, with some requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas. The United States is party to various FTAs with countries such as Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Republic of Korea, and Singapore. FTAs with Costa Rica and Israel do not require national treatment for natural gas trade. NAFTA imposes obligations on energy trade with Mexico and Canada, including requirements for export taxes and restrictions on invoking exceptions to the GATT. Compliance with FTAs involves additional obligations related to energy trade. Compliance with FTAs for energy trade involves additional obligations. Proposed FTAs like TPP and TTIP may include international obligations for automatic approval of LNG exports to countries like Japan or the European Union. Bills like S. 192 and H.R. 580 aim to expedite LNG exports to foreign countries with FTAs. The American Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act, introduced by then-Representative Ed Markey, aims to amend the Natural Gas Act to regulate the export of natural gas from the United States to foreign countries, including those with free trade agreements or deemed to promote national security interests. The American Natural Gas Security and Consumer Protection Act, introduced by then-Representative Ed Markey, aims to develop regulations for determining the public interest of exporting natural gas from the US. Factors considered include energy security, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and environmental impact assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act. H.R. 1191, the Keep American Natural Gas Here Act, also introduced by Markey, focuses on new oil and gas leases on federal lands. H.R. 1190, the Keep America's Oil Here Act, introduced by then-Representative Ed Markey, requires bidders for new oil and gas leases on federal lands to certify that oil and refined petroleum products will be sold only in the United States. S. 435, the American Oil for American Families Act of 2013, introduced by Senator Robert Menendez, aims to ban the export of crude oil or refined petroleum products. Recent bills introduced in Congress, such as H.R. 1190 and S. 435, aim to restrict the export of crude oil and refined petroleum products derived from federal lands. The possibility of expanding U.S. fossil fuel exports has sparked interest due to advancements in natural gas exploration technology. Export operations are subject to various federal laws and regulations, including the Natural Gas Act and laws governing construction and operation of export facilities. Compliance with these laws is necessary for any party wishing to export fossil fuels. Export restrictions on fossil fuels must comply with international trade rules, including GATT 1994. The exception for essential security interests under Article XXI may justify violations of GATT Articles I and XI. The United States traditionally considers this exception self-judging, but scrutiny from a panel or the Appellate Body is possible. Article XX of the GATT provides additional exceptions for member countries in violation of GATT obligations. However, Article XIII requires that any GATT inconsistent measure permitted under an Article XX exception must be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. Export restrictions on fossil fuels must comply with international trade rules, including GATT 1994. Article XIII requires that any GATT inconsistent measure permitted under an Article XX exception must be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner."
