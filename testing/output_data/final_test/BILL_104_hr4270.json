    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Care Research and Development and Consumer Protection Act.\" The Congress finds that public health is advanced by developing new drug therapies, which also aligns with controlling healthcare costs. The Federal Government needs to ensure drug sale revenues are reinvested in research. They are the largest supporter of biomedical research globally, spending $33 billion in 1994 alone. They provide 80% of funds for biomedical research at universities and non-profit institutions. The National Cancer Institute's new drug program developed 92 percent of cancer drugs with taxpayer funds. The public should not have to pay twice for healthcare inventions. The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for funding biomedical research and medical treatment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must ensure a reasonable relationship between drug pricing, public investment, and public health needs. The Department lacks crucial information on drug development costs, revenue, and taxpayer investment, hindering decision-making on drug prices and policies. SEC. 3. REPORT ON RESEARCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The Federal Government must report on any involvement in the development of approved drugs, including patents, agreements, funding sources, and research activities. The Federal Government must report on its involvement in supporting research and development activities for drugs, including funding sources, dates of agreements, and nature of the activities. The Secretary will make this report public. The Federal Government must report on research and development expenditures for drugs, including pre-clinical research and clinical trials. The Secretary will make this information public, with details on funding sources and activities. SEC. 4. REASONABLE PRICE AGREEMENT. If a Federal agency or non-profit entity conducts federally funded health care research and plans to provide a patent or exclusive right for a drug or health care technology, they must first agree to a reasonable pricing agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services or obtain a waiver based on public interest. Waivers require public notice and opportunity for comment before being granted by the Secretary. The Secretary must grant a waiver based on public interest for providing a patent or exclusive right for a drug or health care technology. SEC. 5. PURCHASE OF DRUGS DEVELOPED WITH TAXPAYER SUPPORT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services reviews drug prices for Federal reimbursements under certain programs, considering factors like public interest in research, contributions to research expenses, and Federal support. The Secretary of Health and Human Services evaluates drug prices for Federal reimbursements, considering factors such as research and development contributions, therapeutic value, expected patient demand, production and marketing costs, similar therapy costs, and other relevant factors. SEC. 6. MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can compel owners of biological substances or materials for research purposes through a materials transfer agreement. The agreement includes compensation for transfer costs, terms of use, no intellectual property rights granted, and restriction to research purposes only. SEC. 7. PROMOTION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The section promotes research and development by requiring persons manufacturing drugs for interstate commerce to establish accounts for reinvestment in health care technology research. The Secretary of Health and Human Services sets minimum reinvestment amounts based on drug sales revenue, with potential variations for different drug classes. The Secretary will establish regulations for research and development expenditures and reporting requirements for those manufacturing drugs for interstate commerce. SEC. 8. REPORTS ON SALES.\n\nManufacturers of approved drugs must report total sales and revenue to the Health Care Financing Administration, including sales outside the US.\n\nSEC. 9. GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services will annually report to Congress on the federal government's spending on prescription drugs, including those developed with significant federal support."
