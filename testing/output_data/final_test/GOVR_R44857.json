    "content": "The government has used various options like special prosecutors, independent counsels, and special counsels to investigate executive officials suspected of criminal wrongdoing. Independent investigations have been used to avoid conflicts of interest, especially after the Watergate scandal in 1972. The Watergate scandal in 1972 led to the appointment of an independent special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by senior officials. Despite public outcry, the President ordered the firing of the special prosecutor, leading to impeachment proceedings by Congress. Following the Watergate scandal and the firing of independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Congress enacted the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to appoint independent counsels for investigations and prosecutions of public officials. Appointments of independent counsels under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 involved investigations into Iran-Contra and Whitewater incidents. Lawrence E. Walsh investigated arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan contra rebels, resulting in criminal charges for 14 individuals. Kenneth Starr investigated potential violations related to President Clinton and Whitewater, leading to various convictions. The independent counsel statute required the Attorney General to conduct a preliminary investigation upon receiving information about potential wrongdoing by certain officials in the executive branch or from presidential campaign committees. If the information was specific and credible, a preliminary investigation was to be conducted for up to 90 days. The statute did not mandate acknowledgment or notification. The Attorney General was required to conduct a preliminary investigation for up to 90 days upon receiving specific and credible information about potential wrongdoing. If further investigation or prosecution was warranted, the Attorney General had to request the appointment of a special prosecutor by the court. The Attorney General was mandated to conduct a preliminary investigation for up to 90 days upon receiving credible information about potential wrongdoing. If further action was deemed necessary, the Attorney General had to request the appointment of a special prosecutor by the court. Additionally, if new information emerged after the initial investigation, the Attorney General was required to conduct another preliminary investigation and seek the appointment of an independent counsel if warranted. The decision to request an appointment under the statute was not subject to judicial review. The Attorney General was not authorized to appoint the independent counsel under the statute. The special division of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was responsible for appointing the independent counsel, composed of three federal judges or Justices. The panel had specific requirements for assignment, including representation from the D.C. Circuit and no more than one judge from any single court. The three-judge panel appointed the independent counsel, with specific requirements for assignment and jurisdiction. The independent counsel had full power and authority in investigative and prosecutorial functions. The independent counsel had full authority to conduct investigations, grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, review evidence, challenge testimonial privileges, seek immunity for witnesses, and carry out prosecutions in court. They could also request assistance from the Department of Justice for resources and personnel. The independent counsel had the authority to conduct investigations, grand jury proceedings, and prosecutions. They were not subject to control by other executive branch officials, except for removal by the Attorney General for specific reasons. If removed, the special division of the court and relevant congressional committees had to be notified. The inquiry could be terminated in two ways under the statute. The independent counsel statute allowed for termination in two ways: either by the independent counsel notifying the Attorney General upon completion of the investigation, or by the special division of the court terminating the office if the investigation was sufficiently completed. The independent counsel was required to submit a report detailing their work to the special division of the court. The independent counsel statute was originally enacted in 1978 and reauthorized multiple times until its expiration in 1999 due to concerns over the independent counsel's power. In 1999, DOJ established regulations for appointing special counsels under the Attorney General's authority, aiming for a balance between independence and accountability in sensitive investigations. The regulations were used infrequently, with one instance being the appointment of John Danforth as special counsel to investigate the Branch Davidian compound events in Waco, Texas, finding no federal law wrongdoing. In May 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to investigate Russian government influence in the 2016 election. The investigation found no wrongdoing by federal law enforcement officials in Waco, Texas. The Attorney General issued a non-public memorandum detailing the scope of the investigation and the special counsel's authority. This memorandum clarified that the public order was worded broadly to allow for public release without confirming specific investigations involving individuals. The Attorney General also has the authority to appoint DOJ staff for specific investigations, different from the special counsel regulations. For example, in 2003, Deputy Attorney General James Comey used this statutory authority to appoint individuals to investigate particular matters. General John Ashcroft appointed Patrick Fitzgerald to investigate the unlawful leak of a CIA officer's identity. Fitzgerald, serving as a U.S. Attorney, was named to lead the investigation, which differed from appointments under special counsel regulations. Special counsels appointed under regulations may be seen as more independent and insulated from removal. The DOJ can also assign other departments, like the Office of the Inspector General, to investigate sensitive cases. The Department, including the Office of the Inspector General, investigates high-profile matters related to the Department's compliance with legal requirements and internal policies. Attorney General Sessions considered but decided against a special counsel inquiry into prosecutorial and investigative determinations made in 2016 and 2017. Special counsel appointments are reserved for extraordinary circumstances where the public interest would be served by removing responsibility from the Department of Justice. The Attorney General assigned the DOJ's Inspector General to review suggested actions for a second special counsel inquiry. Instead, John W. Huber, U.S. Attorney for Utah, will lead the investigation into allegations of DOJ compliance with legal requirements and internal policies, working with the Inspector General from outside Washington, D.C. The authority to appoint a special counsel lies with the Attorney General under DOJ regulations. The Attorney General can appoint a Special Counsel to conduct investigations or prosecutions when there is a conflict of interest or extraordinary circumstances, and when the public interest requires it. The appointment is made to prevent any initial investigation from tainting subsequent ones. The Attorney General has discretion to appoint a Special Counsel when there is information warranting an independent investigation. The appointment can be immediate or preceded by an initial investigation to determine the need. If the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General will handle the appointment process. The Deputy Attorney General serves as the Acting Attorney General for the appointment process. Special counsels must be chosen from outside the federal government and have integrity, impartiality, and relevant experience. The Attorney General has sole authority to determine the scope of the special counsel's inquiry. The special counsel's jurisdiction is determined by a specific factual statement provided by the Attorney General at the outset of the appointment. They are authorized to investigate and prosecute federal crimes related to the investigation, with the possibility of expanding their jurisdiction as new matters arise. The special counsel's jurisdiction is initially determined by the Attorney General and can be expanded after consultation. The special counsel has broad authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes within their jurisdiction, with the power to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney. This authority has been challenged in the past, notably during Special Counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation resulting in indictments, including against Paul Manafort. Paul Manafort, former chairman of President Trump's 2016 campaign, faced indictments for various crimes including money laundering, tax fraud, and obstruction of justice. He challenged the indictment, arguing that the special counsel's authority was unlawfully exercised. Specifically, Manafort contended that the charges did not fall within the special counsel's original jurisdiction outlined in the appointment order. Manafort challenged the charges against him, claiming they were outside the special counsel's original jurisdiction. The government responded by providing additional documents outlining the scope of the investigation. DOJ acknowledged the need for a specific factual statement but stated it didn't have to be made public. The factual statement in an appointment order or made public is essential. A subsequent memorandum from Acting Attorney General Rosenstein provided a more specific description of authorized allegations for the special counsel investigation. Developing jurisdiction parameters during an investigation is necessary for effectiveness. Courts rejected Manafort's challenge to the special counsel's authority. The federal district court in Virginia upheld the special counsel's authority to investigate Manafort's connections with Russian government officials, including those from a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. Charges such as tax evasion related to Manafort's dealings with pro-Russian entities were deemed within the special counsel's jurisdiction. The federal district court in Virginia upheld the special counsel's authority to investigate Manafort's connections with pro-Russian entities, including tax evasion charges related to his dealings with them. The court rejected Manafort's argument that the special counsel had a \"blank check\" for limitless investigation, stating that the appointment order was tightly drafted to give the Special Counsel flexibility to pursue matters that arose directly from the investigation. The DOJ special counsel regulations provide flexibility for the investigation and allow pursuit of matters directly related to the issues at hand. Special counsels must adhere to DOJ rules and consult with appropriate offices, with oversight from the Attorney General. Misconduct can result in discipline, and special counsels must determine the extent of informing the Attorney General about their duties. The special counsel must notify the Attorney General of events in their investigation as per DOJ guidelines. This notification allows for consultation between the two, ensuring the AG can fulfill their responsibilities. Special counsels have flexibility in their investigations but must adhere to DOJ rules and consult with appropriate offices. The rules authorize the Attorney General to request explanations from the Special Counsel for investigative or prosecutorial steps. The Attorney General can review actions and, if deemed inappropriate, must notify Congress. The Attorney General has the authority to discipline or remove the special counsel personally. The Attorney General has the authority to remove the special counsel for \"good cause\" such as misconduct or conflicts of interest. The decision must be reported to Congress, and the special counsel must provide budget updates periodically. The special counsel must provide a proposed budget within 60 days of appointment and annual reports on the investigation and budget requests 90 days before the fiscal year. The Attorney General reviews the annual report to decide on the investigation's continuation and budget. Upon conclusion, the special counsel submits a confidential report to the Attorney General on decisions made during the inquiry. The report's disclosure is not specified, but the Attorney General must report to the Judiciary Committees of each house. The regulations require the special counsel to submit reports to Congress, including a concluding report with explanations for actions taken. The Attorney General's report may go beyond prosecutorial decisions, and there is no mandate for public release of information. The regulations allow the Attorney General discretion to determine if public release of reports to Congress is in the public interest. Legal doctrines like executive privilege and grand jury rules may restrict report contents. Questions arise about the constitutionality of independent criminal inquiries of executive branch officials. The Constitution assigns specific functions to each branch of government, with Congress responsible for legislative power and oversight of executive branch agencies. However, Congress cannot engage in criminal prosecutions, a function reserved for the executive branch. The Appointments Clause of Article II requires officers to be appointed by the President with Senate approval. The President can hold executive branch officers accountable through removal if necessary. The Supreme Court in Myers v. United States emphasized the President's power of removal to maintain administrative control. Congress can limit the President's removal power over certain offices. The appointment and removal powers are crucial for creating independent investigative offices. Challenges to the appointment of a special counsel have been unsuccessful, as seen in the D.C. Circuit's ruling in In re: Grand Jury Investigation. The D.C. Circuit ruled in In re: Grand Jury Investigation that the Appointments Clause did not require Special Counsel to be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, as the special counsel is considered an inferior officer. The court determined that the special counsel, although granted some independence by regulations, is ultimately subject to the control of a superior who is a principal officer nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the special counsel is an inferior officer who serves at the pleasure of the Attorney General, and his appointment by Rod Rosenstein was valid under the Appointments Clause. The court also cited United States v. Nixon to support the Attorney General's authority to appoint subordinate officers. The D.C. Circuit ruled that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, acting as the head of the Department of Justice due to Attorney General Sessions' recusal, had the authority to appoint Special Counsel Mueller. While legal questions on special counsel appointments have been resolved, the issue of their removal by a superior remains unsettled in the courts. The authority to remove a special counsel under current regulations poses legal questions as terms like \"misconduct\" and \"good cause\" are undefined. The specific grounds for removal are largely undetermined, and case law on similar statutory restrictions is limited. The authority to remove a special counsel under current regulations poses legal questions as terms like \"misconduct\" and \"good cause\" are undefined. The manner of removal without new legislation raises difficult legal issues, including the efficacy of regulations in limiting executive branch discretion. The Attorney General can remove a special counsel for various reasons, potentially influenced by the President, making challenges in court challenging. The current regulations make it difficult to challenge in court and do not create legal rights. Internal agency rules and guidelines, including those of the Justice Department, are not usually recognized as enforceable rights. Obtaining judicial review of a special counsel's removal may be challenging under current DOJ regulations. The regulations may not ultimately constrain the executive branch, as the Department likely has the discretion to rescind them. The Department likely has discretion to rescind the special counsel regulations without following notice and comment procedures required by the APA. This means the regulations could be repealed immediately, removing the for-cause removal provision for a special counsel. Ignoring the regulations raises legal questions, as they are not enforceable rights and may not constrain the executive branch. The regulations in force typically bind the executive branch with the force of law, as seen in Nixon v. United States. The Court stated that as long as the regulation defining the Special Prosecutor's authority remains in force, the Executive Branch is bound by it. The President and Attorney General must comply with special counsel regulations until repealed. The outcome of removing a special counsel in violation of regulations is uncertain, with potential legal challenges. Legal issues arise regarding the President's authority to supervise the executive branch and the extent to which agency regulations can limit this power. Special counsel regulations may bind the Department of Justice but may not restrict the President's powers under Article II. The Department of Justice does not restrict the President's powers under Article II, which vests executive power in the President. Regulations limiting the President's authority to remove high-level officers may intrude on this constitutional authority. The DOJ has previously declined to follow statutes it deems unconstitutional, and this argument could apply to regulations issued by a prior Administration. Legislative proposals are being considered due to questions about the current DOJ special counsel regulations. Several legislative proposals are being considered to impose restrictions on the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel, in response to the current DOJ regulations. These proposals aim to codify aspects of the regulations, including insulating a special counsel from removal and allowing a federal court to review such removal. Several legislative proposals are being considered to impose restrictions on the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel. One proposal would require the Attorney General to file an action with a three-judge court before removing a special counsel for misconduct or other good cause. Another proposal states that a special counsel appointed after May 17, 2017, can only be removed for good cause by the Attorney General or the highest ranking Justice Department official. The removed special counsel can challenge the action before a three-judge panel. The legislative proposals aim to restrict the executive branch's ability to remove a special counsel. One proposal requires the Attorney General to seek approval from a three-judge panel before removing a special counsel for misconduct. Another proposal allows a special counsel to challenge their removal within a 10-day window in federal court. These proposals raise constitutional questions about Congress's power to control executive functions. The Supreme Court has affirmed the President's power to remove executive branch officers, but there are statutory restrictions for certain offices. In Morrison v. Olson, restrictions on the removal of an independent counsel were upheld, raising questions about the constitutionality of legislative efforts to protect special counsels from removal. The Court's opinion in Morrison will likely determine the outcome, depending on a formalist or functionalist approach. Further guidance from the Court is needed for definitive conclusions on such efforts. In Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court upheld the independent counsel statute, which limited the President's removal authority over the independent counsel. Chief Justice Rehnquist determined that the independent counsel was an inferior officer with limited duties and jurisdiction. The Court also found that the Independent Counsel Act's restrictions on the authority of the President were permissible. The Supreme Court upheld the Independent Counsel Act in Morrison v. Olson, allowing limitations on the President's removal authority over the independent counsel. The Court applied a functional test to determine if Congress interfered with the President's executive power, ultimately finding that the statute provided sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure the President could fulfill his duties. Justice Scalia dissented, and Justice Kennedy did not participate in the decision. In Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court upheld the Independent Counsel Act 7-1, with Justice Scalia dissenting. Scalia argued the statute violated separation of powers by taking authority from the executive branch. He emphasized the President's control over prosecutors as a check against abuse. The Independent Counsel Act, upheld in Morrison v. Olson, was criticized by legal scholars and politicians for creating an unaccountable prosecutor outside of presidential control. The law expired in 1999 due to widespread opposition, with the Supreme Court applying a different standard in Edmond v. United States regarding the appointment of certain officers. In Edmond v. United States, Justice Scalia's opinion established a formal rule to determine inferior officers as those \"directed and supervised\" by a principal officer. The Court concluded that the appointment of members of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals by the Secretary of Transportation was consistent with Article II. Members of the Court lack final decision-making power without permission from a superior in the executive branch. The appointment of members of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals by the Secretary of Transportation was deemed constitutional as the members were considered inferior officers supervised by a principal officer. In the case of Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Court invalidated statutory provisions protecting members of the Board from removal without cause by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Court invalidated statutory removal protections for members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, concluding that the combination of dual \"for cause\" removal protections contradicted the President's executive power under Article II. The Court applied a different test than in Morrison, determining that the board members were now inferior officers due to oversight authority by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Court did not overrule Morrison's holding. The Court's decisions in Edmund and Free Enterprise Fund have not applied the reasoning in Morrison regarding the test for who qualifies as an inferior officer. It is unclear what removal restrictions are appropriate for principal officers or how determinations about the appointment power concern the scope of the removal power. The Edmond test, rather than the Morrison analysis, will guide the Court going forward. Free Enterprise Fund reflects a more formalist view of the Presidential power of removal than Morrison. The Supreme Court's approach to separation-of-powers matters related to appointment and removal has shifted since the Morrison decision. The current Court's stance on reauthorizing the independent counsel statute is uncertain. If the Court follows the functional approach in Morrison, requiring good cause to remove a special counsel would likely be constitutional. The Morrison decision approved of provisions in the independent counsel statute that imposed such requirements. Legislation proposing to protect a special counsel from removal without good cause is similar to the for-cause removal provisions upheld in Morrison. Some proposals are less restrictive of the President's power compared to the independent counsel statute, allowing the Attorney General to appoint and only the AG or a Senate-confirmed official to remove a special counsel. The proposed legislation aims to protect a special counsel from removal without good cause, similar to the for-cause removal provisions in Morrison. This framework is less intrusive of executive branch power compared to the independent counsel statute, allowing the Attorney General to appoint and only a Senate-confirmed official to remove a special counsel. The special counsel can only be removed for specific reasons outlined in current Justice regulations. The proposed legislation would likely permit the removal of a special counsel for a broader range of reasons than the now-expired independent counsel statute. This includes adding grounds such as misconduct, dereliction of duty, and conflict of interest for removal, with good cause defined to include violation of departmental policies. This provision would grant the Attorney General greater control over the special counsel compared to the independent counsel statute, aligning with a functionalist balancing approach. If the Court were to adopt a functionalist balancing approach in a challenge to a provision regarding the removal of a special counsel, it may affirm its constitutionality due to broader reasons for removal by the executive branch. However, bills aiming to protect a special counsel from removal could be constitutionally questionable if the Court were to overrule Morrison or narrow its application. In particular, if a special counsel with extensive investigative authority could only be removed for cause, the Court might consider them a principal officer under the Edmond test. The Coast Guard Court of Appeals judges were found to be removable at will and lacked the power to make final decisions of the executive branch. A special counsel with statutory removal protection would not be removable at will. The appointment of a special counsel as a principal officer would require the President's nomination with Senate confirmation. The Court has not resolved the conflict between its decisions in Morrison and Edmond regarding the appointment and removal of principal officers. The Court's recent formalist approach to separation of powers disputes, as seen in Free Enterprise Fund, may challenge for-cause removal protections for a special counsel. The emphasis on presidential control over executive branch officers conflicts with statutory removal restrictions, but a middle road is possible if Congress passes legislation insulating a special counsel from removal except for cause. One option for the Court regarding for-cause removal protections is to narrowly interpret them, allowing removal for a broad range of reasons. This could maintain executive branch authority over the special counsel without overruling Morrison. Bills proposing judicial review of special counsel removal decisions raise constitutional questions similar to those in Morrison. The Supreme Court has adjudicated suits from government officers removed from their position, with back pay being the traditional remedy. Bills limiting remedies to reinstatement may conflict with the independent counsel statute, which allows for \"other appropriate relief.\" Judicial orders for reinstatement could be seen as encroaching on the executive branch's authority, as seen in proposals like S. 1735. The Supreme Court has dealt with cases of government officers removed from their positions, typically awarding back pay as a remedy. Proposed bills like S. 1735 aim to limit remedies to reinstatement, potentially conflicting with the independent counsel statute. S. 1735 suggests involving the judiciary in the removal of a special counsel, requiring a court to determine grounds for dismissal before the executive branch official can be removed. This could exceed previous restrictions on the President's removal power set by the Supreme Court in prior cases like Humphrey's Executor and Morrison. The proposal suggests involving the judiciary in the removal of a special counsel, with two layers of removal protection, one being more stringent than the for-cause protection in Free Enterprise Fund. This would require a court to determine grounds for dismissal before the special counsel can be removed, exceeding previous restrictions on the President's removal power. The proposal involves two layers of removal protection for a special counsel, with one layer being more stringent than the for-cause protection in Free Enterprise Fund. This would require a court to determine grounds for dismissal before the special counsel can be removed, exceeding previous restrictions on the President's removal power. The Morrison Court's decision on ex post judicial review of removal decisions was based on the understanding that the executive branch retains discretion over removal decisions. The proposal suggests requiring an initial judicial finding of good cause to authorize the removal of a special counsel, potentially involving the judiciary in an executive function. However, a functional approach similar to the Morrison case could argue that this requirement does not impede the President's core responsibilities. The Attorney General would still have discretion to initiate removal, with a three-judge panel having the authority to review and potentially reinstate the special counsel. The bill proposes shifting the judicial role to require authorization before removing a special counsel, potentially impacting the executive branch's authority. However, the Attorney General retains discretion in appointing the special counsel, and removal can occur for a wider range of conduct compared to the independent counsel statute. The bill's provisions may intrude on the executive branch's Article II authority, but the overall impact is less intrusive. The Morrison Court balanced factors and found the independent counsel statute did not interfere with the President's duty. Applying Morrison may alleviate concerns about judicial approval for removal. Legislation requiring the Attorney General to petition a court before removing a special counsel could raise Article III questions. Federal courts' jurisdiction is limited to adjudicating \"cases\" and \"controversies\" under Article III, with doctrines limiting when disputes are adjudicated. Article III requires adversity between parties, a live dispute touching legal relations, and limits non-adjudicatory functions for judges. Legislation mandating judicial approval for removing a special counsel may raise Article III concerns due to lack of explicit authorization for the special counsel to participate. The supervision of executive branch officers, including the discretion to remove them, is traditionally an executive function. Bills aiming to protect special counsels from removal may raise questions about retroactivity. For example, S. 1741 (115th Congress) and S. 71 and H.R. 197 (116th Congress) propose that special counsels can only be removed for cause, retroactively applying to appointments made after specific dates. This could be seen as Congress interfering with the appointments process. The legislation allowing Members of Congress to appoint or remove executive branch officers has been invalidated. This could be seen as Congress trying to undermine the Appointments Clause by making an executive branch officer immune to removal through statute, potentially appointing them indefinitely. This may be viewed as an overreach of the executive's appointment power. The legislation granting removal protection to executive branch officers may raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it could be seen as an aggrandizement of the executive's appointment power. While there is no direct Supreme Court case addressing this issue, it may not significantly impact the special counsel's office, as similar requirements already exist in regulations. Firm conclusions on the provision's merit are premature due to the lack of relevant case law. The executive branch has used special prosecutors, independent counsels, and special counsels to investigate misconduct. Efforts to protect a special counsel from removal raise constitutional questions about separation of powers. Insulating a special counsel from removal except for specified reasons may align with the Court's opinion in Morrison, but could face constitutional objections if a more formal approach is taken. Efforts to protect a special counsel from removal might face constitutional objections, especially if a more formal approach is taken beyond the framework approved in Morrison."
