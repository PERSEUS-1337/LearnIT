    "content": "The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) outlines requirements for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices in the US. Devices must meet minimum standards, including being free from adulteration and misbranding, following good manufacturing practices, and proper labeling. Devices are classified based on risk levels (Class I, II, III) with specific requirements for each class. Class III devices are high-risk and crucial for supporting human life or preventing health impairment. Class III devices, essential for supporting human life or preventing health impairment, require premarket approval (PMA). Examples include replacement heart valves, silicone gel-filled breast implants, and pacemaker pulse generators. New devices are automatically Class III unless meeting exceptions like being substantially equivalent to a Class I or II device. The FDA determines if a new medical device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a predicate device, which could have been marketed before or after 1976. The new device must have the same intended use and technological characteristics as the predicate device, or different technological characteristics with safety and effectiveness data. The manufacturer chooses the predicate device for comparison, but the FDA can decide if the comparison is appropriate. This process is known as a Section 510(k) submission under the FFDCA. Class III medical devices may be marketed with a Section 510(k) submission if they are substantially equivalent to pre-1976 devices, without requiring a PMA. New Class III devices often reach the market through a 510(k) submission rather than FDA PMA. Premarket notification is required for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to pre-1976 devices, reclassified devices, or significantly modified devices, with a 90-day advance submission to the FDA. Before marketing a new Class III medical device, the manufacturer must submit a notification to the FDA for review. The FDA may determine if the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, request more information, withhold a decision, or advise that premarket notification is not required. Most Class III devices require a PMA application, where the FDA assesses safety and effectiveness. The PMA application must include details on labeling, investigations, manufacturing methods, device samples, and other information. The FDA assesses safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices through a PMA application, which includes details on labeling, investigations, manufacturing methods, and device samples. Approval may be denied if there are concerns about safety, manufacturing practices, labeling accuracy, or performance standards. Once approved, the device can only be marketed for its intended use. The FDA requires a PMA supplement for any changes affecting the safety or effectiveness of a medical device. This includes changes to labeling, packaging, sterilization procedures, and new indications for use. Preemption of state law tort claims with respect to medical devices will be discussed. The preemption doctrine, derived from the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, recognizes both express and implied forms of preemption in relation to state legislation, regulations, and common law. The FDA's changing position on preemption in medical device cases will also be discussed. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause, looks at congressional intent to determine if state actions are preempted by federal law. Express preemption occurs when a federal statute explicitly supplants state law, while implied preemption can occur in various ways. This includes federal occupation of the regulatory field and actual conflicts between federal and state laws. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause, looks at congressional intent to determine if state actions are preempted by federal law. Courts face challenges when federal law is silent on preemption, with a presumption against preemption. The Supreme Court emphasizes that Congress did not intend to displace state law unless clearly stated. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause, looks at congressional intent to determine if state actions are preempted by federal law. Courts face challenges when federal law is silent on preemption, with a presumption against preemption. The Supreme Court emphasizes that Congress did not intend to displace state law unless clearly stated. In the absence of persuasive reasons, federal preemption of state law is not favored. The Supreme Court has recognized the historical importance of states exercising their police powers to protect the health and safety of their citizens. States traditionally have had great latitude under their police powers to legislate for the protection of individuals. Arguments for federal preemption of state law in the medical device context focus on uniform national standards, the rigor of the PMA process, FDA expertise, and potential delays in new product development. Businesses tend to prefer preemption for uniform regulation. Medical device manufacturers and trade groups support federal preemption to avoid varying state regulations. They argue that state jury verdicts impose additional requirements beyond FDA regulations, affecting device design and labeling. The jury's finding of negligent failure to warn would require the manufacturer to change the label and package insert for the medical device, but federal law prohibits unilateral changes. Manufacturers must submit a Supplemental PMA for any proposed labeling changes affecting device safety. Advocates of preemption argue that the FDA, not state juries, has the expertise to balance the benefits and risks of products. Advocates of preemption argue that federal law should override state juries in deciding the benefits and risks of medical devices. They believe that delays in product development and recalls are rare, and market pressures will drive companies to improve safety. Critics argue against preemption, citing congressional intent, consumer protections, FDA's changing views, and the need for manufacturers to be held accountable for safety concerns. Opponents of federal preemption in the device area argue that Congress did not address tort suits in the MDA, indicating intent not to preempt such suits. In the wake of the Dalkon Shield cases, questions arise on whether Congress truly intended to shield manufacturers from liability. Some argue that tort law is essential for regulatory oversight, citing the FDA's stance on preemption before 2004. Proponents of preemption believe it protects business operations, while critics see it as a way for industries to avoid liability. The FDA's PMA is viewed as a preliminary safety judgment, not absolving manufacturers of improving device safety. Manufacturers play a crucial role in reporting risks or issues with FDA-approved devices before the FDA takes action. State tort laws act as a safety net, uncovering concerns that may have been missed by the FDA. Concerns have been raised that preemption of state tort claims could hinder companies from addressing safety issues or developing safer devices. The FDA's position on preemption of state tort law claims in medical device cases has evolved over the years. The FFDCA includes an express preemption provision for medical devices, enacted in 1976. This provision, 21 U.S.C. Section 360k(a), prohibits states from imposing requirements on devices intended for human use, except as provided in subsection (b). The FDA's preemption provision under the FFDCA prohibits states from imposing additional requirements on medical devices intended for human use, except in certain circumstances. State requirements may be exempt if they are \"more stringent\" or \"required by compelling local conditions.\" The FDA issued regulations interpreting this provision in 1978, which were later amended after a Supreme Court decision. The FDA's preemption provision under the FFDCA prohibits states from imposing additional requirements on medical devices intended for human use, except in certain circumstances. State requirements may be exempt if they are \"more stringent\" or \"required by compelling local conditions.\" The FDA issued regulations interpreting this provision in 1978, which were later amended after a Supreme Court decision. Against manufacturers of devices found by the FDA to be \"substantially equivalent\" under the Section 510(k) process were not preempted. The FDA's post-Lohr 1996 final rule noted that State tort and common law remedies are not preempted. State or local requirements are preempted only when specific FDA regulations are established or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under the act. Section 521(a) [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a)] does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability. The FDA's position on preemption provision in the early 2000s was against preemption, with a narrow interpretation and presumption against it. The agency had not addressed whether preemption applied to state tort claims before private lawsuits. In 1997, the FDA's Chief Counsel indicated that while the agency had not formally expressed its position on the issue, it was clear from previous contexts that preemption was not favored. The FDA's position on preemption provision in the early 2000s was against preemption for state tort claims under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k. The agency believed Congress intended to restrict preemption to positive enactments and argued that state tort claims were generally not preempted. In the early 2000s, the FDA's Chief Counsel Margaret J. Porter argued against preemption of state tort claims for medical devices under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360k. She emphasized that FDA regulation cannot anticipate all safety risks and preemption would remove a layer of consumer protection, leaving consumers without a remedy for injuries caused by defective devices. The agency believed that preemption of such claims was not intended by Congress and would create disparity in regulation between devices and drugs. The FDA's view on preemption in medical device cases shifted in the early 2000s, with the agency expressing support for preemption of state common law claims against PMA-approved devices. This shift was highlighted in the Horn v. Thoratec Corp. case in 2004, where the FDA submitted an amicus curiae brief supporting preemption. Others argue that the agency's support for preemption began even earlier, prior to the change of presidential administrations. The FDA's stance on preemption in medical device cases changed in the early 2000s, with the agency supporting preemption of state common law claims against PMA-approved devices. This shift was evident in the Horn v. Thoratec Corp. case in 2004, where the FDA disclaimed its previous view on preemption. The agency cited the detailed nature of the PMA process as a reason for the change in position. The FDA's position on preemption in medical device cases changed in the early 2000s, supporting preemption of state common law claims against PMA-approved devices. The agency viewed the PMA process as a minimum standard but acknowledged that state common law could provide additional consumer protection. The FDA's shift reflected federal court decisions following the Supreme Court's Lohr opinion. Under the George W. Bush Administration, the FDA believed state common law tort claims were preempted under 21 U.S.C. Section 360k due to PMA requirements imposed on Class III medical devices. The FDA's approval of medical devices through the PMA process imposes specific requirements for design, manufacturing, performance, labeling, and use based on the manufacturer's application. The agency's view on preemption during the Bush Administration stated that liability claims must align with FDA-approved standards. The Riegel decision predates the Obama Administration, but the President announced his policy on the matter. During the Obama Administration, the President issued a memorandum on preemption, emphasizing that executive departments should only preempt state law after considering state prerogatives and having a legal basis. The memorandum discouraged including preemption statements in regulatory preambles unless justified under legal principles governing preemption. This guidance was in line with President Clinton's Executive Order 13132 on federalism. The FDA has cited President Clinton's executive order on federalism and the Supreme Court's holding in Riegel when addressing preemption in recent regulations. A 2008 Associated Press article noted that 51 regulations proposed or adopted since 2005 had placed limits on lawsuits, with 41 coming from the FDA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In 2011, the FDA issued its preemption review, concluding its position on preemption. In 2011, the FDA reviewed its position on preemption, concluding that it could not be justified under legal principles. This decision was influenced by the Supreme Court's rulings in Wyeth v. Levine and Riegel, the latter involving the preemption of state tort suits regarding FDA-approved medical devices. The Riegel case specifically dealt with a catheter approved under the PMA process for marketing by Medtronic, Inc. The Supreme Court found that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) preempted state tort claims related to a catheter marketed by Medtronic, Inc. The catheter burst during a procedure on a patient, leading to serious health complications. The patient and his wife raised common law claims against the company for negligence in the design and marketing of the device. The Supreme Court ruled that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 preempted state tort law claims regarding a catheter. The Court found that federal requirements in the PMA process for medical devices under the MDA superseded state common law claims for negligence and strict liability. The Supreme Court ruled that federal requirements in the PMA process for medical devices under the MDA preempt state common law claims for negligence and strict liability. The Court determined that the federal government had established requirements applicable to the device at issue, Medtronic's catheter, and that PMA imposes requirements under the MDA. The Supreme Court ruled that federal requirements in the PMA process for medical devices under the MDA preempt state common law claims for negligence and strict liability. The Court distinguished its earlier decision in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, stating that PMA is device-specific and focused on safety, unlike substantial equivalence. PMA imposes requirements under the MDA, which are not exemptions like in the Lohr case. Devices that receive PMA must adhere to FDA-approved specifications. The Supreme Court ruled that federal requirements in the PMA process for medical devices under the MDA preempt state common law claims for negligence and strict liability. The Court held that New York's tort duties are considered \"requirements\" under the MDA, different from federal requirements. The MDA could potentially preempt general state common law under circumstances such as strict liability, negligence, and implied warranty claims. The Court addressed the Riegels' argument that general common law duties are not specific to medical devices and should not be preempted under the MDA. The FDA regulation 21 C.F.R. Section 808.1(d)(1) was discussed, stating that only common law duties established by court decision are exempt from preemption. The Court also discussed the statutory text and its interpretation of terms used in congressional enactments. The Court interpreted that state common-law duties are included in a State's 'requirements' unless indicated otherwise. State tort law may not be as important to preserve as state statutes or regulations due to potential conflicts with federal standards. New York's common law causes of action are preempted by the MDA only if they differ from federal requirements. Lawsuits that parallel federal requirements, such as state damages remedies for FDA violations, are not preempted. Justice Stevens agreed with the dissent's view on the preemption provision, stating that it covers more than intended by its authors. He emphasized that New York common law duties that differ from federal requirements are not preempted. Justice Ginsburg's dissent focused on the intent of Congress in enacting the MDA and emphasized congressional intent as the \"ultimate touchstone of pre-emption analysis.\" She argued that the MDA does not preempt state common law claims, as there are indications in the legislative history that support this view. Justice Ginsburg's dissent argues that the MDA does not preempt state common law claims, citing the act's consumer-oriented purpose and lack of federal compensation scheme for injured consumers. She also references the Court's plurality in Lohr, stating that there is no indication of a legislative design to preempt state tort actions. The dissent in the MDA case argues against preemption of state common law suits, citing the FDA's authority to order recalls and stating that compliance does not absolve liability. It also mentions the FDA's previous view that product approval and state tort liability are independent layers of consumer protection. The dissent questions the deference given to the FDA's new position on preemption. The dissent in the MDA case argues against preemption of state common law suits, citing the FDA's authority to order recalls and stating that compliance does not absolve liability. Justice Ginsburg notes that Congress included the preemption provision in the MDA to empower the FDA to control state premarket approval systems. The dissent in the MDA case argues against preemption of state common law suits for medical devices, highlighting the disparity between devices with PMA and drugs or biologics. It is noted that FDA approval of drugs does not preempt state tort suits, indicating congressional intent not to preempt such claims. Justice Ginsburg points out that device manufacturers may face two different standards of liability. Justice Ginsburg notes that device manufacturers may have defenses to state common law suits, including implied preemption and a regulatory compliance defense based on FDA approval. The Riegel Court held that state tort claims based on FDA regulations were not preempted by federal law. The Riegel Court ruled that state tort claims based on FDA regulations were not preempted by federal law, allowing individuals to sue device manufacturers for negligence in following FDA requirements. The decision did not address preemption in investigational device exemption or PMA supplement contexts. The Court discussed preemption in the context of PMA supplements, which are required for any change to a device subject to an approved application under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e] that affects safety or effectiveness. Justice Ginsburg noted that the Court's holding does not address the preemptive effect of \u00a7 360k(a) where evidence of a medical device's defect comes to light only after premarket approval. Manufacturers may lack the incentive to make their devices. Justice Ginsburg argued that manufacturers may lack the incentive to improve device safety after receiving PMA, as they can market the product as is. Medtronic's counsel countered by stating that the FDA could withdraw approval for a device if a safer alternative exists. Congressional critics point out that FDA withdrawal proceedings can be lengthy and that clinical trials may not uncover all risks. The Supreme Court ruling in Riegel is seen as part of a framework for preemption jurisprudence. It raises recurring issues about the presumption against preemption of state law and the deference courts should give to federal agencies. The Court's analysis in Lohr also addressed the presumption against preemption. The interpretation of pre-emption in the context of state and federal laws is guided by the presumption that Congress does not easily override state laws. The Riegel Court did not explicitly reject this presumption, but its stance on pre-emption may suggest a weakening of this traditional belief. The Riegels argued that federal statutes should not interfere with state police powers without clear Congressional intent. The Supreme Court's interpretation of pre-emption in the context of state and federal laws suggests a potential weakening of the traditional belief that Congress does not easily override state laws. The Court emphasized the importance of clear Congressional intent in federal statutes not interfering with state police powers. The Court also considered the deference given to the FDA's shifting position on preemption, highlighting the significance of agency interpretations in pre-emption cases. The Supreme Court found clear congressional intent in favor of preemption, bypassing the need for deference to the FDA's interpretation. If the statute had been ambiguous, Skidmore deference would have been considered. The weight of an administrative agency's interpretation depends on its thoroughness, reasoning validity, consistency, and persuasive power. The FDA's lack of consistency on preemption may be concerning, as different administrations have held opposing views. The Obama Administration has advised against preempting state law in regulations. Courts are likely to continue addressing preemption in FDA statutes and regulations. In post-Riegel cases involving medical devices with PMA, courts have dismissed claims for failing to overcome a preemption defense. These cases have been influenced by Supreme Court decisions like Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which raised the standards for pleadings, making it harder for plaintiffs to state plausible claims. Plaintiffs with parallel state law claims have struggled to meet the new plausibility requirements set by these cases. The pleading requirements in medical device PMA preemption cases post-Riegel have led to the dismissal of numerous lawsuits. There are calls for Congress to amend the MDA to address proper pleading and the impact of Twombly on plaintiff's claims. Medical device manufacturers argue for summary judgment if a case survives a motion to dismiss under Riegel. In post-Riegel cases, courts have found preemption in 77.3% of medical device lawsuits. Claims that have survived include those related to design changes without FDA approval. Claims related to design changes without FDA approval, manufacturer warranties, and manufacturing defects have been the focus of post-Riegel medical device lawsuits. While some lower courts have found success with these claims, others have not. The most common successful claims are those related to manufacturing defects. However, there is variation in the success of these claims across different courts. The types of parallel claims that may survive in lower courts vary by circuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted that the parallel claim exception is still undefined post-Riegel. Commonalities may emerge as more courts rule on parallel claims. In five federal circuit courts, parallel causes of action must be based on a violation of federal law or deviation from federal standards. The Court's decision in Riegel could impact agency regulations. The Court's decision in Riegel has potential implications for the FDA's responsibilities and regulatory authorities. While it does not grant the FDA greater responsibilities, it gives the agency more control over medical devices by preempting state law requirements for devices with FDA PMA. This could lead the FDA to more stringently examine devices undergoing the PMA process. The FDA may address the issue of notification from manufacturers about device problems post-PMA approval. Increased distribution of FDA-approved products can lead to more adverse events, requiring new warnings or product withdrawal. The Riegel case may have legislative implications, with some Members of Congress introducing legislation to overturn the Court's decision. Another potential legislative approach is to offer a remedy to those injured by a medical device that has received FDA PMA. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in Riegel, legislation was introduced in the 111th Congress to overturn the Court's decision. Bills such as H.R. 1346, H.R. 4816, and S. 540 were proposed, including the Medical Device Safety Act of 2009 by Representative Pallone and Senator Kennedy. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Riegel by adding a provision to 21 U.S.C. Section 360k. The bill would not affect state laws regarding damages or liability, and would apply to civil actions pending or filed after enactment. The language from H.R. 1346 / S. 540 was included in H.R. 4816, but the bill did not progress further. Various organizations and lawmakers supported overturning the Court's decision, citing potential impacts on patients. Some argue that overturning the Court's decision in Riegel would impact patients and states with strong consumer protection laws. Opposition to the legislation came from a former FDA chief counsel and the American Tort Reform Association, who criticized it as benefiting personal injury lawyers. One proposed solution for injured medical device consumers is to establish a compensation fund. The dissent in Riegel contended that Congress should not have removed all judicial recourse for consumers injured by FDA-approved devices, but the majority opinion stated that it is not their role to speculate on congressional motives. In Congress's estimation, solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices was outweighed by concern for those who would suffer without new medical devices if state tort law applied to all innovations. Congress has previously created compensation schemes when removing the ability to sue, such as the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. The Riegel Court held that a victim could seek compensation from the Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 or bring a tort action against a party involved in a conspiracy to hijack an aircraft. The Supreme Court's decision was based on previous rulings on state common law duties, without considering congressional intent or FDA regulations. Senator Kennedy and Representative Waxman argued in an amicus brief regarding the term \"requirement\" in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act. The Riegel Court's interpretation of the term \"requirement\" in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act differed from its interpretation in the Medical Device Amendments (MDA), highlighting the importance of Congress and legislative counsel being aware of terminology used in existing statutes and proposed legislation. This awareness is crucial regardless of congressional intent or the timing of the statute's enactment. Congress may have recognized that the term \"requirement\" in a preemption provision could preempt product liability claims. To avoid preemption of state common law claims, Congress could consider inserting savings clauses in legislation."
