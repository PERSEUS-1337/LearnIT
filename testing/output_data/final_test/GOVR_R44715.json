    "content": "Recent and planned nuclear reactor closures in the United States have sparked debate about the future of nuclear power. Supporters argue for preventing shutdowns to maintain reliable, low-carbon electricity, while opponents advocate for focusing on renewable energy and efficiency. Currently, there are 60 operating nuclear power plants in the U.S., contributing nearly 10% of utility-scale generating capacity and 20% of total power generation. In the U.S., nuclear plants are located in competitive or cost-of-service markets. Some plants in competitive markets face rate regulation to reduce financial risk. Regulatory bodies may decide on early plant retirement based on projected electricity prices. Other plants operate on a \"merchant\" basis, with prices subject to commodity price fluctuations. Merchant nuclear power plants in competitive power markets are subject to electricity price volatility due to supply and demand dynamics and fuel costs. Unlike cost-of-service market areas, where rates are regulated by state utility commissions, competitive markets determine revenues based on market conditions. This can lead to early closures or identified plants facing financial challenges. Several nuclear power plants in competitive markets are at risk of closure due to challenging economic conditions, increasing operating costs, and low wholesale power prices. Six reactors have shut down in the past five years, with 10 more announcing closure since 2010. Consultants and ratings agencies have identified 10 additional plants as \"at-risk\" of closing before their operating licenses expire, representing 20% of the current nuclear power fleet. Several nuclear power plants in competitive markets are at risk of closure due to challenging economic conditions. Some operate under rate regulation while others are merchant power plants subject to competitive power markets. The common link among reactors announcing closure is their location in competitive power markets. This report discusses recent plant closures, economic challenges for merchant nuclear power plants, and policy considerations for existing plants. The financial situation for each nuclear power plant is unique, with various factors such as operating costs, capital expenditures, power prices, and regulatory structures playing a role. While some plant-specific analysis is included, the report also provides generalized economic and financial information to highlight industry trends. Comprehensive data for a detailed plant-by-plant analysis is currently unavailable. Commercial-scale nuclear power generation in the US began in 1957 with the Shippingport plant. Power generation in the United States started in 1957 with the Shippingport reactor in Pennsylvania. It was a small plant but paved the way for larger nuclear power plants to provide an alternative to fossil fuel-fired plants. The goal was to meet the increasing demand for electricity by harnessing nuclear fission energy. The legal framework for the U.S. nuclear power industry was established by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, allowing private ownership and operation of nuclear facilities. The Price-Anderson Act of 1957 provided liability protection for reactor operators. Subsidies under the AEC's Power Reactor Demonstration Program helped build early commercial nuclear plants like Shippingport. Reactor suppliers began selling larger units to electric utilities in 1963. In the mid-1960s, electric utilities started ordering larger nuclear reactors, with sizes exceeding 500 megawatts. By 1973, a significant number of nuclear units were ordered, but the trend reversed due to surging energy prices, slowing electricity demand growth, escalating construction costs, and rising interest rates. The construction costs of power plants sharply increased in the 1970s, leading to cancellations of reactor orders. The growth in electricity demand was lower than expected, causing delays in the completion of many reactors. Ultimately, out of 256 reactor orders, 134 were completed and put into service. In the history of the U.S. nuclear power program, many early AEC demonstration plants were completed and put into service. Several reactors permanently shut down for various reasons, with nine small reactors closed by the late 1970s. The closure of reactors continued in the following decades, with four reactors shut down in the 1980s and 10 in the 1990s. The economic viability of nuclear power improved in the early 2000s due to rising natural gas prices, leading to existing reactors no longer being closed. The economic viability of nuclear power improved in the early 2000s due to rising natural gas prices, leading to existing reactors no longer being closed. However, gas prices fell sharply after 2009 and have remained low, primarily because of strong production of domestic shale gas. Six reactors have permanently shut down since the beginning of 2013, and additional closures have been announced. NRC has issued construction and operating licenses to seven new reactors and is currently considering applications for seven more. Since the beginning of the U.S. nuclear power program, 35 out of 134 commercial reactors have permanently closed, leaving 99 currently operating and 4 under construction. These reactors are located in 30 states at 60 plant sites and provide about 20% of total U.S. electricity generation. Nuclear power accounts for 61.6% of U.S. \"zero carbon\" electricity generation. Reactors are licensed to operate for 40 years with the option for 20-year renewals. As of July 2016, 80 of the 99 operating reactors have received renewals, with 12 more under review. The U.S. nuclear power industry is undergoing license renewals, with 20-year extensions allowing for up to 80 years of operation. While some reactors have closed in recent years, efforts in New York and Illinois have helped keep at-risk reactors operational. Shutdowns are categorized based on revenue dependency. The fundamental problem for at-risk nuclear plants is their reliance on regional wholesale electricity markets with insufficient prices to cover costs. Factors like oversupply and transmission congestion contribute to revenue challenges. Some single-unit plants struggle to compete even in markets with higher prices, leading to closure risks due to economic viability issues. Nuclear plant closures can be prompted by economic challenges, major repairs, and non-routine events. Factors like seismic safety concerns and changing competitive environments also contribute to shutdowns. The closure of the Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin in 2013 marked the beginning of a potential wave of shutdowns in the industry. Duke Energy decided to retire the Crystal River 3 reactor in Florida due to severe damage to the containment structure. The closure was prompted by uncertainty about the repair costs and duration. Many U.S. nuclear power plants use steam generators that require replacement after 20-30 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars per reactor. Some nuclear plants have opted to replace steam generators to avoid costly repairs, like Oregon's Trojan reactor in 1992. Steam generator replacement projects are routine in the industry, but issues like containment damage at Crystal River 3 and problems at San Onofre station have led to plant closures. Southern California Edison replaced steam generators at units 2 and 3 in 2010 and 2011. Southern California Edison replaced the steam generators in units 2 and 3 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. One of the new steam generators experienced internal leakage due to design flaws. After considering options, SCE announced the retirement of San Onofre 2 and 3 in June 2013, citing uncertainty about restart approval, repair costs, and license renewal. Entergy closed a single-reactor nuclear plant in December 2014 due to low power prices in New England causing chronic losses. Despite a 20-year license renewal in 2011, the plant began decommissioning in 2014. Competition from shale gas-fired generation and high operating costs were cited as reasons for closure. Another single-unit nuclear plant, Fort Calhoun in Nebraska, closed in October 2016 due to economic factors. The Fort Calhoun nuclear plant, owned by OPPD, closed to save $994 million over 20 years by purchasing low-cost replacement power. Ten reactors are facing permanent shutdowns, with FitzPatrick and Ginna in New York being the most imminent. FitzPatrick cited high operating costs as a reason for closure. Entergy cited high operating costs and low power demand as reasons for potential closure of the FitzPatrick nuclear plant in upstate New York. To address the economic challenges, the State of New York approved a Zero Emission Credits (ZECs) program to provide additional revenue for the plant and three other reactors, requiring Exelon to purchase FitzPatrick and operate all four reactors through 2029. Exelon has agreed to purchase and operate all four upstate New York reactors through 2029 with the ZEC funding provided. Despite the market price on carbon in New York State, the FitzPatrick and Ginna plants have not been profitable. Exelon announced the shutdown of the Clinton and Quad Cities plants in Illinois due to combined losses of $800 million in the past seven years. The Illinois General Assembly passed a bill to provide Zero Emission Credits (ZECs) to the Clinton and Quad Cities plants, similar to the New York ZEC program. Entergy announced the closure of its Palisades plant in Michigan, which operates under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Consumers Energy. Entergy announced the retirement of its Palisades plant in Michigan due to changing market conditions, leading to substantial cost savings for Consumers Energy. The closure is part of Entergy's plan to reduce electricity costs and align with market trends, with a similar decision to close the Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts in 2019. The Pilgrim plant in Massachusetts is facing rising operation and maintenance costs, requiring significant capital expenditures for safety-related equipment issues. Despite high wholesale power prices covering current costs, revenue is insufficient for long-term investments. The Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey, set to retire in 2019, faced similar challenges with compliance requirements for water discharge. Exelon considered building cooling towers at a cost of $700-$800 million. Exelon decided to close the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey in 2019 without building cooling towers, despite facing compliance challenges with warm water discharges into Barnegat Bay. In contrast, the Diablo Canyon plant in California, owned by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), is planned to shut down without economic reasons, as it is rate-regulated and considered a vital energy resource for the state, although safety concerns due to its location in a seismically active region have been raised by opponents. The environmental group Friends of the Earth strongly opposed PG&E's license renewal applications for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant due to safety risks in a seismically active region. PG&E reached an agreement with environmental and labor groups to abandon the license extensions in exchange for support for a state land lease extension. As a result, the Diablo Canyon reactors will operate until their current NRC licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. Several nuclear power units are at risk of permanent shutdown without specific dates or deadlines. Exelon's Nine Mile Point plant is losing money and may be retired in the future. FirstEnergy may close or sell its merchant nuclear and coal plants within 18 months unless they receive financial assistance. FirstEnergy's nuclear plants, including Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, are struggling to compete in regional power markets due to low-cost electricity from natural gas and wind turbines. Several other reactors, such as Byron 1 and 2, Palisades, and Three Mile Island, are also at risk of early retirement due to market conditions. Existing nuclear plants need to generate revenues that exceed their average total cost to remain operational. Some U.S. nuclear power plants are facing financial challenges as wholesale electricity prices decrease and average total costs of production increase. This has led to closures of some plants where costs exceed revenues, but the financial pressure varies across the nuclear fleet due to different market and cost variables. The financial challenges faced by some U.S. nuclear power plants are due to decreasing wholesale electricity prices and increasing production costs. Closures have occurred where costs exceed revenues, but the pressure varies across the nuclear fleet. Factors impacting financial and economic conditions include capacity payments, plant size, transmission constraints, generation mix, and marginal cost of electricity from price-setting fuels. Detailed plant-level financial analysis is limited in scope, with a focus on revenue items such as low natural gas prices and depressed wholesale market prices. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) reports that average total generating costs for nuclear electricity increased from $28.27 per megawatthour (MWh) to a peak of $39.70 per MWh in 2012, reaching $35.50 per MWh in 2015. Capital expenditures were the largest contributor to the cost increase, more than doubling over the same period. Total average costs can vary depending on the number of reactor units. Total average costs for nuclear electricity can vary based on the number of reactor units at each power plant. Multi-unit plants had costs of $32.90 per MWh in 2015, while single unit plants had costs of $44.52 per MWh. NEI's initiative \"Delivering the Nuclear Promise\" aims to reduce total generation costs by 30% by 2018 from the 2012 high of $39.70 per MWh. This initiative focuses on reducing operating costs. Average total costs of generation are used to compare revenues and costs for the industry as a whole. Additionally, CRS has access to 2015 plant-level fuel and O&M costs for 33 nuclear power plants in competitive markets. In competitive power markets, plant-level fuel and O&M costs are compared with nodal electricity prices to determine if revenue exceeds costs. Wholesale electricity prices are the primary revenue source for generators in competitive markets, determined by supply and demand curves. Price determination is influenced by Security Constrained Economic Dispatch, considering costs, transmission limitations, and reliability. Generators offer electricity at prices organized from lowest to highest to construct a supply curve. In competitive power markets, wholesale electricity prices are determined by supply and demand curves. The market clearing price is where demand and supply intersect, dictating the price received by generators. Generators offer electricity at different prices, but all receive the market clearing price if dispatched. This process is influenced by Security Constrained Economic Dispatch and considers costs, transmission limitations, and reliability. Merchant nuclear plants in wholesale power markets are considered \"price takers\" and aim to operate continuously, offering prices low enough to clear the market. Some generators may adjust to demand load patterns to boost electricity sales revenues. Profitability of nuclear plants depends on the market clearing price set by price-setting units, with wholesale power market price formation being complex. RTO/ISO manages system constraints in this process. Power markets are complex, with RTO/ISO managing system constraints like transmission and reliability. Wholesale electricity prices are determined by supply and demand fundamentals, with price offers based on fuel costs. Nuclear fuel costs around $7 per MWh, while wind generators may submit zero or negative prices due to out-of-market revenue sources. Natural gas and coal generators set prices based on fuel costs, affecting wholesale electricity prices. Gas prices impact electricity prices by influencing generator costs and market dynamics. Natural gas power generators set wholesale electricity prices by following demand patterns and being easily dispatched. They are a primary price-setting fuel in competitive power markets, as shown in Table 3. Data indicates that natural gas plays a significant role in setting prices in various RTOs, with an increasing contribution in MISO and PJM. While ERCOT data suggests a potential decline in natural gas's price-setting role, the Market Monitor report provides insights on this trend. The Market Monitor report indicates that lower natural gas prices drove a 34% decline in real-time energy prices in a specific market from 2014 to 2015. Natural gas has increased its price-setting role in some competitive markets, impacting wholesale electricity prices and revenue for power generators. Fuel costs for natural gas-derived electricity have decreased, while costs for nuclear power generation have increased since 2008. The combination of rising nuclear generation costs and declining natural gas prices is causing financial challenges for nuclear power plants in competitive markets. Each nuclear plant faces unique market variables affecting revenue from electricity sales. In competitive markets, electricity revenues depend on locational marginal prices (LMPs), which include energy, transmission congestion, and energy losses components. LMPs vary within each market region. Locational marginal prices (LMPs) are influenced by market variables like fuel prices, generation mix, and transmission constraints. Renewable energy projects can impact LMPs, sometimes causing them to drop below zero briefly. Fuel costs, such as natural gas and coal, also play a role in clearing prices, which can vary by location due to transportation costs and infrastructure limitations. This results in different electricity market clearing prices at various locations. The range of locational marginal prices (LMPs) for nuclear power plants in competitive markets may be lower than the average total cost (ATC) of nuclear electricity generation. The location and cost structure of each nuclear facility are crucial in assessing financial challenges. Revenue sources beyond electricity sales, such as capacity, uplift, and ancillary services in RTO/ISO markets, can provide additional income opportunities for power generators. Capacity, uplift, and ancillary services in RTO/ISO markets offer revenue opportunities for power generators beyond electricity sales. Capacity payments are a significant source of non-energy revenue, ensuring resource adequacy through capacity markets organized by RTO/ISOs. Payments can be made through bilateral contracts or participation in capacity auctions. Capacity payments in RTO/ISO markets vary by region and market design, impacting the value received by power generators. For example, PJM's RPM market had clearing prices ranging from $100 to $202 per MW-day in different zones. Nuclear power plants can benefit from changes in capacity market designs, with location also influencing payment values. Some nuclear power plants in competitive markets have power purchase agreements (PPAs) outside the RTO market, providing financial stability. At least six nuclear plants have PPAs for their generating capacity, potentially offering stability. The Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station in Cordova, IL, has two units. The Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station in Cordova, IL, consists of two nuclear reactors with a combined capacity of 1,820 Megawatts. Exelon announced plans to shut down the plant due to financial stress caused by volatile electricity prices and high production costs. PJM capacity payments provide some additional revenue. Exelon decided to shut down the Quad Cities plant due to low electricity prices and revenues not covering production costs, including fuel and O&M costs, without considering capital expenditures. Capacity payments in 2017 may help cover production costs, but the plant did not clear capacity auctions for 2018/2019 and 2019/2020. The Illinois legislature passed S.B. 2814, including a Zero Emissions Credit (ZEC) incentive program for nuclear plants. Analysis compared electricity revenue with fuel and O&M costs for 33 plants in competitive markets. Limited but included as initial financial assessment of merchant nuclear plants. The analysis compared electricity revenue with fuel and O&M costs for 33 nuclear power plants in competitive markets. 19 of the plants were estimated to have costs exceeding revenue in 2016, indicating economic challenges. Additional revenue sources and costs at the plant level were not included in the estimates, providing an incomplete view of nuclear power economic viability. The analysis of 33 nuclear power plants in competitive markets showed that 19 plants had costs exceeding revenue in 2016. Forward electricity prices are expected to rise, leading to a projected drop to seven plants facing economic challenges from 2017 to 2019. The increasing closures and retirements of nuclear power plants have sparked debate on whether the federal government should provide financial support. Supporters argue that nuclear power is crucial for providing reliable, low-carbon electricity, while opponents raise concerns about safety risks and waste management issues. Federal incentives for nuclear power face challenges due to drawbacks like accident risk and waste management issues. Owners of other generating assets may oppose financial support for existing nuclear power. Congress would need to consider various options, each with its own policy questions. Financial conditions vary across nuclear power facilities, with state-level actions being more prevalent. The federal government has limited authority to provide financial support for operating nuclear power plants, making it a state issue. The Department of Energy is working with regulatory authorities to preserve existing nuclear plants until the end of their useful life, in line with safety and environmental regulations. The Task Force emphasizes the importance of financial support for U.S. nuclear power plants to achieve carbon goals. Policy options are available to Congress for providing this support. The Nuclear Energy Institute and industry groups are advocating for market and price reforms in electric power markets to ensure all costs are included in clearing prices.FERC is involved in an Energy Price Formation initiative. FERC's Energy Price Formation initiative aims to evaluate electricity price formation in RTO and ISO markets by changing settlement procedures and shortage pricing triggers. Future rules could impact wholesale market prices, including potential oversight by Congress on nuclear power generators. A federal production tax credit is available for new nuclear power facilities, but existing ones do not receive federal tax incentives. Existing nuclear power plants do not receive federal tax incentives, unlike new facilities. Energy tax credits are available for new energy production facilities, but not for existing nuclear plants. Legislation extending these tax credits to existing nuclear power generation could provide financial support and help sustain at-risk plants. A carbon price policy, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade approach, could benefit existing nuclear power plants by increasing the cost of producing electricity from carbon-emitting fuels. The design of the policy would determine the financial advantage for nuclear power plants. A carbon tax could increase wholesale market prices for nuclear power plants, depending on the regulatory approach. A rate-based standard under the CPP may not include existing nuclear in emissions calculations, potentially leading to no change in emissions rate if a nuclear plant closes. Existing nuclear plants could impact a state's emissions rate if replaced by gas-fired plants. A mass-based approach incentivizes keeping nuclear power, as replacing it with gas would increase carbon emissions. EPA's analysis suggests nuclear generation is more competitive under a mass-based implementation. Power Purchase Agreements with federal agencies could help support at-risk nuclear plants. Federal agencies could provide electricity price certainty through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with nuclear plants using Contracts for Difference (CfD) contracts. This model sets a price level for electricity, ensuring price certainty for both parties without the need for physical delivery to federal facilities. Analysis of electricity revenues and costs for 33 nuclear power plants in competitive markets is provided in Table A-1. The analysis in Table A-1 compares electricity sales revenue and costs for 33 nuclear power plants in competitive markets within the United States. Revenue is based on nodal electricity prices paid to each plant, while costs include fuel and O&M expenses. This unique analysis provides insight into the financial state of these plants but does not consider other expenses like capital expenditures. The analysis compares revenue and costs for U.S. nuclear power plants in competitive markets. It focuses on electricity sales revenue, fuel, and O&M expenses, but does not include capital expenditures or other revenue sources. The estimates only show if sales cover fuel and O&M costs, not overall plant profitability. Other cost and revenue factors not included may affect plant viability. Data limitations prevented further analysis."
