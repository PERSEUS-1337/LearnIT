    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature declares that in 2011, there were 29,757 fatal motor vehicle crashes and 1,530,000 nonfatal serious injury crashes in the United States. Existing law mandates hospitals to contact a patient's representative within 24 hours if the patient is unconscious or unable to communicate. Emergency medical technicians and law enforcement do not have immediate access to family contact information after a motor vehicle crash involving unconscious individuals. Critical hours pass without family notification, leaving crash victims in the emergency department without family advocacy or important medical information. In 2008, AASHTO adopted a VinECON policy resolution urging motor vehicle manufacturers to create a national law enforcement vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database with the support of various organizations. The City of Los Angeles adopted a resolution in 2013 seeking a sponsor for California legislation related to vehicles enforcing the AASHTO VinECON policy resolution. This legislation would allow purchasers of new motor vehicles to voluntarily register an emergency contact in the VinECON database for use by law enforcement in case of a crash or emergency. The Department of Motor Vehicles administers the Business Partner Automation Program to improve registration services by licensing private industry partners to provide electronic portals for new motor vehicle dealers. The Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015 aims to enhance the DMV Business Partner Automation Program by allowing new vehicle purchasers to register an emergency contact in the VinECON database at the point of sale. This will help expedite the sharing of vital information with hospitals for unconscious crash victims. The Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015 requires motor vehicle manufacturers to establish a database in collaboration with law enforcement agencies and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. This applies to vehicles sold or leased in the state from January 2, 2016, onwards with a 2017 model year or later. New vehicle dealers must allow purchasers to voluntarily register an emergency contact in the VinECON database at the point of sale using electronic programs provided by a DMV licensed partner, with a fee not exceeding $31. The Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015 requires new motor vehicle dealers to charge a VinECON document processing fee of up to $85. VinECON data is stored in a national database accessible only to authorized law enforcement personnel. In case of a motor vehicle crash victim unable to communicate, law enforcement must provide VinECON data to the hospital. Law enforcement and the agency are not liable if the hospital cannot contact the emergency contact person. A new motor vehicle dealer must register accurate VinECON data provided by the purchaser at the point of sale. The manufacturer and dealer are not liable for damages due to inaccurate data. Violation of this requirement may result in disciplinary action. If the act incurs state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies will be made."
