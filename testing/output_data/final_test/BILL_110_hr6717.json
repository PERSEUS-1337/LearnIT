    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Energy Cut the Red Tape Now Act of 2008\". The Congress acknowledges the impact of skyrocketing gas prices on the economy, consumers, and businesses. Gas prices have risen significantly from $2.98 per gallon in July 2006 to $4.07 per gallon in July 2008. The US heavily relies on foreign imports for crude oil and fuel, despite having significant oil reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf areas. The United States has significant oil reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf areas, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and oil shale deposits in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. These Federal lands hold an estimated 1.23 trillion barrels of oil, more than 50 times the Nation's proven conventional oil reserves. Currently, there are no unconventional fuels leasing programs in place for oil exploration and drilling in the US. The Federal Government could open land in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming for oil exploration, potentially offsetting all imports from Saudi Arabia. The lack of new oil refineries in the US since 1981, along with bureaucratic permitting processes, leads to delays in exploring natural resources. It takes around seven years and $5 billion to build and permit one offshore platform for oil or gas production. SEC. 3. TERMINATION OR WAIVER OF RESTRICTIONS ON LEASING FOR EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRODUCTION OF OIL, GAS, AND OIL SHALE DURING PERIOD OF HIGH OIL PRICES. Termination of Federal laws prohibiting leasing of Federal lands for oil and gas exploration, development, or production. Secretary of the Interior can waive permit requirements for drilling during high oil prices. The Energy Information Administration's spot market price at Cushing, Oklahoma is less than $100 per barrel, and provisions will be waived when the price exceeds $100 per barrel. SEC. 4. REFINERY PROCESS AND PROCEDURES. In this section, a \"designated refinery\" is defined as a facility that processes crude oil to produce gasoline or other fuel. The term \"Federal refinery authorization\" refers to any required authorization under Federal law for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a refinery. This includes permits and special use approvals. A designated refinery is a facility that processes crude oil to produce gasoline or other fuel. It includes permits, special use authorizations, certifications, opinions, or other approvals required under Federal law for siting, construction, expansion, or operation. The refinery is designed to receive, store, transport, process, and refine crude oil through various chemical or physical processes to produce fuel. The Secretary of Energy defines a designated refinery as a facility that processes coal to produce liquid fuel. The Department of Energy is designated as the lead agency to coordinate all Federal refinery authorizations and environmental reviews. The Secretary shall establish a schedule for all Federal refinery authorizations, ensuring timely completion and compliance with applicable federal law schedules. Failure to meet the schedule by any agency or official will result in delays in approval proceedings. The Secretary will award approval of a Federal refinery authorization application within 30 days of any failure to meet the established schedule. A consolidated record of all decisions and actions related to Federal refinery authorizations will be maintained by the Secretary in collaboration with Federal and State agencies."
