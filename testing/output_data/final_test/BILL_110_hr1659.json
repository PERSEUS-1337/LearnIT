    "content": "The \"Rural Colorado Water Infrastructure Act\" defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"State\" and establishes a program. The Secretary may establish a pilot program to provide environmental assistance for water-related projects in the State, including wastewater treatment, water supply, conservation, stormwater retention, environmental restoration, and surface water protection. Assistance is only available for publicly owned projects. Before providing assistance under this section, the Secretary must enter into a local cooperation agreement with a non-Federal interest for the design and construction of the project. The agreement should include the development of a facilities or resource protection plan, as well as the establishment of legal and institutional structures. The establishment of legal and institutional structures is necessary for the long-term operation of the project by the non-Federal interest. The Federal share of project costs is 75 percent under local cooperation agreements, which can be in the form of grants or reimbursements. Before the agreement, the Federal share of pre-cooperative activities is 100 percent. The non-Federal interest can receive credit for design work, interest, and land, easements, and rights-of-way under local cooperation agreements with the Secretary for project costs. Non-Federal entities can receive credit for land, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations towards project costs, not exceeding 25% of total costs. They must cover 100% of operation and maintenance costs for projects funded under this section. Federal and State laws still apply. Authorization of $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and beyond to carry out projects under this section, with funds remaining available until expended."
