General William J. Donovan, the founder of OSS, received the nation's highest decorations, including the Medal of Honor. President Eisenhower referred to him as the \"last hero\" upon his death in 1959. During World War II, General William J. Donovan was chosen by President Roosevelt as his emissary to Great Britain and Europe. The OSS, which all military branches contributed personnel to, laid the foundation for present-day Special Operations Forces. The OSS included precursor units to the Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, and Air Force Special Operations Command. Marines like Sterling Hayden and Col. William Eddy, who received high honors, served in the OSS. The OSS, with predecessors like Lawrence of Arabia and Col. Peter Ortiz, played a crucial role in WWII, aiding resistance groups in Europe and Asia. General Eisenhower praised their covert efforts in France and credited their reconnaissance work before D-Day. Four future CIA directors served as OSS officers. The OSS, with key officers like William Casey, William Colby, Allen Dulles, and Richard Helms, had a diverse team including women like Virginia Hall and Julia Child, as well as German spy Fritz Kolbe. Leading scientists and scholars, such as Ralph Bunche and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., also served in the OSS Research and Analysis Branch.

James Donovan, who negotiated the release of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, served as General Counsel of the OSS. The OSS invented new technology through its Research and Development Branch, including the first underwater rebreathing apparatus known today as SCUBA. OSS Detachment 101 operated in Burma and pioneered unconventional warfare. The OSS deployed a large guerrilla army deep in enemy territory, achieving the highest kill/loss ratio for any infantry unit in American military history. They were awarded a Presidential Unit Citation. The OSS X-2 branch pioneered counterintelligence with the British, leading to the establishment of the modern counterintelligence community. Their networks and information aided Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. Operation Halyard rescued over 500 downed airmen in Yugoslavia, a daring and successful World War II rescue operation. OSS \"Mercy Missions\" at the war's end saved lives. The OSS \"Mercy Missions\" at the end of World War II saved thousands of Allied prisoners of war from potential Japanese murder. The members of the OSS, praised by General Donovan as performing brave acts, are part of the \"Greatest Generation\" but have not been collectively recognized for their heroic service. A Congressional Gold Medal is authorized to be presented to the OSS members in recognition of their superior service and contributions during World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike a gold medal for the Office of Strategic Services members in recognition of their service during World War II. The medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research, with Congress suggesting it be displayed at other relevant locations. The Secretary is authorized to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal for the Office of Strategic Services members. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under the law. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
