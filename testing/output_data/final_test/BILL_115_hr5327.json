    "content": "The \"Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act of 2018\" is introduced as a new section in the Public Health Service Act, aimed at establishing Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to establish or operate Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers for a period of 3 to 5 years, with the possibility of renewal. At least 10 Centers will be established across the United States. Fewer than 10 Centers will be established across the United States, with priority given to entities in high drug overdose mortality rate areas. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary, demonstrating their ability to carry out required activities. An eligible entity awarded a grant under subsection (a) shall use the funds to establish or operate a Center to carry out specified activities, including community outreach. If a Center cannot provide certain services, it must contract with other entities to ensure patients have access to those services. Each Center funded under the grant must train outreach staff to collaborate with various institutions and disseminate online resources on substance use disorders. Additionally, they are required to provide treatment services that meet patients' clinical needs and conduct regular assessments for meaningful recovery. The Center funded under the grant must provide a full continuum of treatment services for substance use disorders, including approved drugs and biological products, withdrawal management, and medically supervised detoxification. The Center funded under the grant must provide a full continuum of treatment services for substance use disorders, including counseling, residential rehabilitation, recovery housing, community-based support services, job training, and other best practices as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the Center must administer an onsite pharmacy, provide toxicology services, and establish a secure electronic health information system. The Center funded under the grant must offer family support services such as child care, family counseling, and parenting interventions to stabilize families impacted by substance use disorder. Data reporting and program oversight require the entity to submit data to the Secretary on funded programs, health outcomes of individuals with substance use disorder, and the effectiveness of interventions. The Center funded by the grant must provide family support services and submit data on program effectiveness and health outcomes. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023. The Secretary must report to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a preliminary report to Congress analyzing data on opioid recovery centers within a year of the Act's enactment. A final report, due within 1 year after the preliminary report, will include an evaluation of center effectiveness and recommendations on expanding the grant program. The grant program for opioid recovery centers will be reauthorized and expanded, including standards and best practices for treating substance use disorders. The House of Representatives passed the bill on June 12, 2018. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
