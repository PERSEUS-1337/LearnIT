    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act of 2017\" or the \"PAWS Act of 2017\". Congress finds that veteran suicide rates are alarming, with an average of 20 veterans dying by suicide each day in 2014. Mental health disorders, such as major depression, are linked to increased suicide risk. The percentage of Veterans Health Administration users with mental health conditions or substance use disorders has risen from 27% in 2001 to over 40% in 2014. Suicide rates are highest among patients with mental health and substance use disorders. The Department of Veterans Affairs needs to improve efforts to reduce veteran suicide rates related to mental health disorders. A pilot program studying the benefits of pairing service dogs with veterans with mental health disorders could help determine the effectiveness of this nontraditional therapy. Pairing a service dog with a veteran costs approximately $25,000, covering training for both the dog and the veteran. The Department of Veterans Affairs is implementing a pilot program to provide grants for service dogs to veterans with severe post-traumatic stress disorder. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will provide a $25,000 grant to eligible organizations for each veteran referred for a service dog pairing. The organization must provide veterinary health insurance and necessary hardware for the service dog and veteran participating in the pilot program. To be eligible for a grant under this section, organizations must assist veterans with diagnosed disorders by providing service dogs and covering travel expenses for obtaining the dog. If a veteran needs to replace a service dog, the Secretary will pay for travel expenses to obtain a new one. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a nonprofit organization must provide trained service dogs certified by Assistance Dogs International. The organization must offer one-on-one training for 30 hours or more over 90 days, provide a wellness verification from a licensed veterinarian for each dog, and have a residential facility for recipients to stay for at least 10 days while receiving training. The nonprofit organization must ensure all service dogs pass tests before placement and provide lifelong support for recipients to reach out for help and ensure proper care of the service dog. The nonprofit organization must ensure all service dogs pass tests before placement and provide lifelong support for recipients to reach out for help and ensure proper care of the service dog. Veterans receiving grants for service dogs must agree to cover additional costs, meet specific standards, and submit required information to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs reviews and approves eligible veterans for participation in the program within 90 days. Eligible veterans must be enrolled in the VA patient enrollment system and have completed evidence-based treatment for PTSD but still have a diagnosis. Veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder by a qualified health care provider may potentially benefit from a service dog if approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs. To remain eligible for the pilot program, veterans must continue to see their healthcare provider at the VA. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to be evaluated every six months to assess the effectiveness of their service dog. If a veteran can no longer care for the dog, the organization that provided it will determine the next steps for the safety of both parties. Providing a service dog is an additional benefit to any medical services offered by the VA for PTSD. The provision of a service dog for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder is an additional benefit to VA medical services. Improvement in symptoms will not affect eligibility for other benefits. The Secretary will develop metrics to measure veterans' psychosocial function, therapeutic compliance, and medication dependence. Processes will track veterans' progress and improvements under the pilot program. The Comptroller General will provide a briefing on the methodology of the pilot program to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. A report evaluating the approach and methodology of the program, specifically in helping veterans with severe post-traumatic stress disorder, will be submitted within 270 days after the program ends. The report will also include relevant metrics such as reduction in symptoms. The pilot program aims to reduce post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, improve psychosocial function, and decrease reliance on prescription medications. $10,000,000 is authorized for the program from 2018 to 2023, with a corresponding reduction in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The program will be evaluated, and a report submitted within 270 days after its completion. The pilot program allowing eligible veterans to keep service dogs after termination will end five years after enactment."
