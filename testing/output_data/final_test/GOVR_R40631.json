    "content": "Large-scale deployment of concentrating solar power (CSP) in the Southwest has the potential to impact water resources due to the varying water demand of CSP facilities based on their type and location. Uncertainty remains regarding the water implications of CSP deployment in the region, but water constraints may lead to the adoption of more freshwater-efficient technologies or decisions not to place CSP facilities in certain locations. Despite these challenges, reducing freshwater use at CSP facilities could still make CSP viable in the Southwest. The potential water implications of large-scale deployment of concentrating solar power (CSP) in the Southwest are being considered as part of energy and climate legislation discussions. The quantity of electricity produced, water intensity, and regional constraints on freshwater will impact the sustainability of CSP as a renewable energy technology. The implications of expanding solar generation in the region on people, economy, land, protected species, and water resources are receiving greater attention. The analysis of the impacts of CSP on the region includes considerations of local, regional, and national advantages and disadvantages compared to other electricity options. Factors such as water resources, cost, climate and air pollution emissions, land and ocean impacts, wildlife, and environment are weighed when evaluating energy tradeoffs. CSP, also known as solar thermal power, uses ground-based mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a heat transfer medium to generate steam for a steam turbine. PV solar is a separate solar technology class. CSP and PV solar are different solar technologies. CSP uses mirror arrays to concentrate sunlight onto a central location or piping to generate electricity without releasing greenhouse gases. CSP technologies include solar troughs and solar towers. The report focuses on solar trough and solar tower CSP technologies, which are better suited for larger facilities compared to PV installations. Electricity from a large CSP plant costs $0.10 per kWh over its operating life, while a large PV facility costs $0.26/kWh. Both PV and CSP facilities at the scale of 50 MW to 1,200 MW are in early stages of commercial adoption, producing electricity at more than twice the cost of conventional coal plants. CSP generation costs are expected to decrease with more installations and technology improvements. As of March 2009, 11 large solar trough facilities were operating in the United States. In the United States, there are currently 11 large solar trough facilities operating with a total capacity of 339 MW. Additionally, 16 more solar trough and solar tower plants are planned, with capacities totaling 4.0 GW in the West and a 75 MW facility planned in Florida. Thermal storage technologies, like molten salt storage, can enhance the economics of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) by allowing electricity production during night hours. CSP facilities have an advantage over Photovoltaic (PV) systems due to thermal storage capabilities. The first large-scale CSP plant with thermal storage started operating in Granada, Spain, in 2008. CSP technologies use thermal storage and a steam cycle to generate power, with water being recycled in a closed-loop system. Water is used to produce steam for the steam turbines, which is then condensed back into liquid water for reuse. Wet-cooling technologies are used for the condenser, with some make-up water needed to compensate for system leaks. The condenser in CSP facilities is cooled using wet cooling technology, where water is used to remove heat and then evaporated in a cooling tower. Dry cooling technologies, which do not use water, are used in areas with water constraints. Dry cooling involves blowing air over steam pipes to dissipate heat, but has lower heat carrying capacity than water. Dry cooling is less efficient than wet cooling in removing heat due to air's lower heat carrying capacity. Massive cooling fans are used in dry cooling, consuming electricity generated by the power plant. This method reduces water use but hinders thermal efficiency, especially on hot days. Hybrid wet and dry cooling technologies can be used for efficiency in water-constrained areas. Dry cooling is less efficient than wet cooling in removing heat due to air's lower heat carrying capacity. Hybrid wet and dry cooling technologies can be used for efficiency in water-constrained areas. CSP facilities are considering dry cooling in water-constrained areas like Southern California. Research on materials and thermal properties may increase electricity output by producing hotter steam for turbines. Combustion turbines could be added to increase output if higher-temperature steam is produced. Research at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) shows that an integrated solar combined cycle plant can be more efficient and cost-effective than a solar-only plant or a fossil-fuel combined-cycle plant. Water supply is a concern for locating thermoelectric power plants in water-constrained regions like the Southwest. Multiple power plants in such areas raise policy questions. The analysis highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future deployment of CSP and its potential impact on water resources in regions with existing constraints. More data and analysis are needed to assess the implications of CSP deployment on local water availability, which would aid decision-makers in evaluating policies and permitting decisions. The index developed by EPRI assesses the susceptibility of U.S. counties to water supply constraints based on renewable water supply, groundwater use, endangered species, and drought. EPRI produced Figure 1 showing susceptibility to constrained water supplies, with overlap in Arizona and California with NREL's CSP deployment projection in Figure 2. The analysis raises policy questions on promoting electricity generation in areas with water constraints and determining suitable solar technologies for counties susceptible to water supply limitations. Figure 2 projects CSP deployment based on federal and state policies, prices, and costs. NREL's CSP deployment projections for 2050 are influenced by federal and state policies, prices, and costs. The models are dynamic and subject to improvement, with updated projections planned based on changes in inputs. The Western Governors' Association is creating a map of potential renewable energy zones, focusing on transmission feasibility, which differs from NREL's analysis based on CSP market analysis. This results in different potential locations for solar facilities. The Western Governors' Association is mapping potential renewable energy zones, showing more opportunities for solar deployment in Utah and Colorado. The mapping effort does not consider water availability, raising concerns about CSP concentration in water-constrained regions like the Southwest. EPRI found that many counties with solar development zones are susceptible to water supply constraints. CSP is likely to be concentrated in the Southwest, while new fossil fuel facilities would be more dispersed. Investing in large-scale deployment of CSP in water-constrained regions raises concerns due to its higher water intensity compared to other generation technologies. CSP using wet cooling consumes more water per MWh, although less than geothermal-produced electricity. The majority of water consumption at a CSP plant is attributed to wet cooling. The majority of water consumption at a CSP facility occurs during the cooling process, with the water footprint being greater due to lower net steam cycle efficiency. Options for reducing water consumption exist but may reduce energy production and increase costs. Water use is directly related to electricity production, with the amount of electricity generated being a key factor in determining water usage at a CSP facility. The capacity factor of a CSP facility determines its electricity generation potential. Capacity is the maximum power output rate, and capacity factors are expressed as a percentage. Solar deployment goals are often stated in capacity terms (kW, MW, or GW) rather than electricity generated (kWh or MWh). Baseload plants have capacity factors over 70%, peaking plants around 25%, and cycling plants fall in between. Capacity factors for CSP facilities in the Southwest range from 25% to over 40% with thermal storage. Future parabolic trough plants could reach capacity factors exceeding 70%, competing with baseload plants. Uncertainty in capacity factors makes estimating water consumption for future CSP installations challenging. The trend for new thermoelectric generation, including CSP, in water-constrained areas is towards more freshwater-efficient cooling. Factors pushing adoption of freshwater-efficient cooling at CSP facilities include projected deployment scale, awareness of water use, and research on alternatives. A 2009 memo from the National Park Service highlights the shift towards more efficient cooling methods. Water availability and rights are key impacts to be evaluated in permitting renewable energy projects. The memo highlights water availability and rights issues in permitting renewable energy projects on federal lands, especially in arid settings where water demand from solar energy systems could strain limited resources. The Western Governors' Association aims for 8 GW of solar energy capacity by 2015, with potential water requirements of 43 thousand acre-feet per year for wet-cooled CSP without storage. Premium solar sites for investments are likely in Arizona and California. NREL projected 55 GW of CSP capacity by 2050 with 6 hours of storage, estimating a mean capacity factor of 43%. Water requirements for 55 GW using wet cooling would be roughly 505 ka-f/year, but could be lower with more water-efficient cooling or less thermal storage. According to NREL's analysis, the deployment of CSP with 12 hours of thermal storage could increase electricity exports from states like Arizona and New Mexico. This would result in a virtual export of water resources from producing states to consuming states, raising policy questions about concentrating electricity generation in a few regions. Virtual water imports and exports are not unique to electricity. Virtual water imports and exports are not unique to electricity, as water is embedded in locally produced agricultural products and manufactured goods distributed nationally or globally. Regional estimates of water use for CSP may not fully capture the impact on water use in states and counties with CSP facilities. The potential use of water by CSP in counties with water supply constraints may lead to the adoption of more freshwater-efficient facilities. The deployment of CSP facilities in Southwest counties with low water use may significantly increase water demand. Without new water supplies, CSP may purchase water from existing rights holders or develop its own supplies from impaired waters. Policy makers could reduce CSP's freshwater footprint by requiring more water-efficient cooling technologies or using alternate water sources. Emerging cooling technologies for CSP can reduce freshwater use, including dry cooling, hybrid dry-wet cooling, and cooling with non-freshwater fluids. Dry and hybrid cooling are the main alternatives in water-constrained areas, with dry cooling reducing water consumption to around 80-90 gal/MWh for solar troughs and towers. DOE found that dry cooling for CSP facilities can reduce water consumption to around 80-90 gal/MWh for solar troughs and towers. However, dry cooling may lead to a drop in electricity generation on hot days above 100\u00b0F. To address this issue, DOE researched hybrid cooling processes combining dry and wet cooling to balance energy generation, cost, and water use. Using wet cooling in parallel with dry cooling on hot days can reduce thermal efficiency losses. The frequency of wet cooling usage affects water consumption and thermal efficiency. A hybrid cooling system in the Southwest using 50% of the water of wet cooling would maintain 99% of performance, while using 10% of the water would maintain 97% of energy performance. There are potential opportunities to reduce freshwater footprint by using alternative water supplies like saline water, but information on feasibility is limited. Data on saline groundwater depths in areas for CSP deployment is unavailable. Data on the depth to saline groundwater for CSP deployment is currently unavailable, but future assessments may provide more information. Alternative water supplies like effluent from wastewater treatment facilities are not viable for CSP sites due to their remote locations. Water management conflicts, particularly in the West, arise from growing populations and competing demands for water resources. Debate over western water resources centers on conflicting needs for agriculture, urban development, thermoelectric cooling, endangered species, recreation, and scenic enjoyment. The debate over western water resources focuses on managing renewable yet sometimes scarce water for various uses, including agriculture. The deployment of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) in the Southwest adds to existing freshwater competition, with uncertainties about the amount and type of CSP capacity to be installed. Technological advances may alter the water intensity of CSP, while data gaps on water consumption and availability add uncertainty to analyzing CSP's freshwater use and alternatives. The deployment of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) in the Southwest adds to existing freshwater competition. Estimates of water consumption by CSP at regional levels are uncertain. Shifting water to CSP from agriculture would have costs and benefits. Managing water demands is up to the states, with potential for job creation and electricity production without significant greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government delegates most water management decisions to states, but federal policies can impact water-related investments. CRS analyzed NREL's CSP deployment scenario for 2050 to assess state and local water implications. This scenario was chosen for its county-level deployment estimates. NREL projected 55 GW of CSP deployment by 2050 with 6 hours of storage and a 43% capacity factor. If achieved with wet cooling, water requirements would be around 505 ka-f/year. CRS developed a scenario for distributing 55 GW of CSP capacity across five states, with varying water use depending on cooling methods and thermal storage. State water use impacts would change based on updated CSP deployment projections. The water footprint of CSP deployment in Arizona and California may vary based on actual deployment levels. Water consumption for 55 GW of CSP capacity is sensitive to the capacity factor used, ranging from 483 to 541 ka-f/year. Capacity factors were adjusted to reflect energy production differences based on solar resources in the Southwest. Uncertainties exist regarding the location and performance of future CSP facilities. The future water resource impacts of CSP deployment are uncertain due to factors like capacity factors, cooling technologies, and location specifics. A county-level scenario analysis for a 55 GW deployment shows that water demand for wet-cooled CSP could be significant in 2050, depending on capacity, cooling type, and existing water use. The future water demand of wet-cooled CSP in 2050 could be significant, leading to interest in non-freshwater sources and water-efficient cooling techniques. Some counties may face water supply constraints, even with dry cooling, under NREL deployment projections. This could drive the need for freshwater-efficient CSP facilities in certain counties."
