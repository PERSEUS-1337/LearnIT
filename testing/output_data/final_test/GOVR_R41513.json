In 1986, the act was amended to address concerns about funding and construction costs of presidential libraries. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 aimed to establish a system for preserving historical materials of Presidents and government officials. In 1986, the act was amended (P.L. 99-323; 100 Stat. 495) to shift the burden of building operations costs of future libraries from taxpayers to endowment funds. Presidential libraries are now funded through congressional appropriations and private sources, with the Archivist of the United States having the authority to accept land, facilities, and equipment for a library. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 established a system for preserving historical materials of Presidents and government officials. Congress must approve the costs and funding requirements of proposed libraries within 60 days. NARA currently operates 13 presidential libraries, including the George W. Bush library. Funding requirements were last updated in 2008. Presidential libraries are privately built for former Presidents and then deeded to the federal government. Private organizations, known as presidential library foundations, support the construction and exhibitions within the libraries. This partnership raises concerns about government funding for the libraries and exhibitions. Some scholars raise concerns about the balance and accuracy of presidential library exhibits, especially as they are used for educational programming. The report discusses the legislative history of the Presidential Libraries Act, existing library facilities, private organizations supporting construction, and potential legislative options for the act. The report discusses proposals for a future Barack Obama presidential library, including the selection process and requirements. It also examines factors that may impact public visitation to the facilities. The report analyzes factors affecting public visitation to presidential libraries and their use of social media for engagement. Traditions in library locations and operations have emerged, with the first four libraries following specific patterns. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library broke from tradition by being located on the University of Texas at Austin campus. The Archivist of the United States used his authority to supervise the Johnson Presidential Library without taking title to the facility. A similar agreement was made for the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library due to its location on the Ann Arbor campus. The Ford museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is part of the NARA presidential library system, sharing the same director as the Ford library. The George W. Bush library at Southern Methodist University was not deeded to the federal government but operates under federal supervision. Under the current arrangement, SMU retains sole ownership of the property and NARA is provided with exclusive rights to use their portion of the facility. Congress has occasionally provided specific funding for private facilities honoring former presidents, such as the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, Rutherford B. Hayes home, Abraham Lincoln library, and Ulysses S. Grant boyhood home. These funds support construction, maintenance, or other projects for these facilities, which are not part of the federal library system. Presidential libraries have adapted to the Internet, offering online access to records and virtual tours. They also share curricular resources for educators and utilize social media to reach a wider audience. Presidential libraries have embraced social media to reach a wider audience. The papers of the President were historically considered personal property, leading to challenges in archiving and preserving them. The establishment of the Executive Office of the President in 1939 led to increased interest in preserving presidential records. President Roosevelt aimed to create presidential libraries as a rich source of historical materials for his era. The Rutherford B. Hayes Library and the Hoover Library on War, Revolution, and Peace were established as prototype libraries in 1916 and 1919, respectively. President Roosevelt later developed the concept of privately built, publicly accessible presidential libraries. Roosevelt expanded on existing models to create a privately built, publicly maintained presidential library. In 1938, he formed an executive committee led by historian Waldo Gifford Leland to establish a presidential library for his records. The committee addressed various issues such as defining its functions, relationship to the government, potential legislation, materials to be kept, space requirements, and building costs. The executive committee, formed in 1938 by Roosevelt, decided to create a larger National Advisory Committee of historians and scholars to determine the contents of the presidential repository. They also established a group of 63 underwriters for the project, guaranteeing $450,000 in funding. The executive committee guaranteed $450,000 for the project and created the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Inc. Congress enacted chartering legislation for the library in 1939, and it was accepted by the Archivist of the United States in 1940. The museum opened to the public a year later, with a fee for visitors. Library materials became available for research in 1946. President Harry S. Truman also had concerns about preserving his records. Harry S. Truman, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, was concerned about preserving his records. In 1950, a Missouri corporation was created to establish a presidential library for Truman. However, Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act in 1955 to create a system for preserving and administering historical materials of former presidents. This act was amended in 1986 to shift the ongoing building operations costs of future libraries from taxpayers to endowment. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955, introduced by Representative Edward Herbert Rees, gave the Administrator of the General Services Administration authority to accept and preserve presidential papers and materials. This act, along with amendments, shapes how presidential records are collected and maintained, shifting building operation costs of future libraries from taxpayers to endowment funds. The committee report detailed the need for a presidential library system to preserve important presidential documents and enable Presidents to plan for the preservation of their papers with proper safeguards and restrictions on their use. The bill aimed to centralize presidential historical materials in one establishment and allow each President to choose the location for their records. It passed the House on July 5, 1955, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Government Operations on July 7, 1955. The Senate passed the bill with amendments on August 2, 1955, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Presidential Libraries Act into law on August 12, 1955. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 allowed the GSA Administrator to accept historical materials of Presidents and officials, take title to gifts for presidential archival depositories, and enter agreements for the use of such facilities without transfer of title. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 authorized the GSA Administrator to accept historical materials for presidential archival depositories without transferring title to the United States. The Administrator had to report to Congress before accepting any depository, including cost estimates and terms for maintaining and protecting the materials. Congressional approval and oversight were required for the Administrator's actions. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1955 allowed the GSA Administrator to accept historical materials for presidential archives without transferring title to the US. Congress had 60 days to review and disapprove proposals. Disagreements between branches persisted over costs and records. The Hoover Presidential Library's unique context lacked laws governing its future, but Hoover had established a library at Stanford University in 1919. Former President Hoover established the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa in 1960, utilizing the Presidential Records Act. The library opened on August 10, 1962, housing Hoover's papers previously held at Stanford University. By the 1980s, the costs of maintaining presidential libraries had significantly increased, prompting congressional interest in alternative funding sources. Bills were introduced in the 96th and 97th Congresses to centralize presidential records in one location, aiming to halt the construction of individual libraries. In 1981, Senator Lawton Chiles introduced a bill to establish design standards for presidential archive depositories. The bill was reintroduced in the 98th Congress but did not progress further. Senator David L. Boren also introduced a similar bill in 1984, but no action was taken on it. Senator David L. Boren introduced legislation (S. 2567) in the 98th Congress to authorize the GSA Administrator to create separate accounts within the National Archives Trust Fund for maintenance of depository land, buildings, and equipment. Donors could limit their donations for maintenance and utility costs, and the bill would have required an endowment for any land or building donated as a presidential library. The bill was not reported from committee, while another related bill, S. 905, was enacted. The National Archives and Records Administration Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-497) transferred responsibilities from the GSA Administrator to the Archivist of the United States, including those outlined in the Presidential Libraries Act. The Presidential Libraries Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-323) aimed to address concerns about taxpayer costs and strengthen the role of the Archivist in preserving the nation's heritage. Introduced by Representative Glenn English in 1985, the act was favorably reported by the House Committee on Government Operations. The House Committee on Government Operations favorably reported the bill in 1985, shifting building operation costs of future libraries to endowment funds provided by private parties. The bill passed the House in June 1985 and was sent to the Senate Committee on Government Operations. The Senate passed the bill in March 1986 with an amendment limiting library facilities to 70,000 square feet. The 1986 amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act required that the Archivist could not accept any land, facility, or equipment for a library unless the endowment covered at least 20% of the total costs. President Reagan signed the bill into law on May 27, 1986. The 1986 amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act required the endowment to cover at least 20% of the total costs for acquiring land or improvements to the land. Additional requirements were placed on facilities larger than 70,000 square feet. The 1986 amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act mandated endowment requirements for facilities larger than 70,000 square feet. Foundations constructing such facilities must increase their endowment based on the square footage exceeding 70,000. This additional amount is calculated by multiplying the total costs by a percentage determined by the excess square footage. Foundations can retain control of certain parts of the library for their use, sometimes sharing office space with NARA in a presidential archival depository. Endowment percentages historically apply only to NARA program or usable space, excluding foundation-controlled areas. The 1986 amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act mandated endowment requirements for facilities larger than 70,000 square feet. Congress distinguished between funding sources for archiving materials and supporting operations, maintenance, and programming. Endowment funds were designated for building operations costs to reduce the amount of appropriations needed. The 1986 amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act mandated endowment requirements for facilities larger than 70,000 square feet, with funds designated for building operations costs. The responsibility to preserve Presidential records is a government duty, and a study was conducted on creating a museum of the Presidents without federal funds. The report found difficulties in establishing a full-scale museum but suggested a modest exhibition program as part of a White House visitors center. In 2003, Congress increased the endowment funding requirement for Presidential libraries to 40% of total costs for Presidents taking office after July 1, 2002. The Archivist can reduce this requirement by up to 20% for libraries with cost-saving features. In 2008, Congress further amended the requirement. In 2008, Congress increased the endowment threshold for Presidential libraries to 60% for Presidents taking office after July 1, 2002. The Archivist was required to report to Congress on alternative models for presidential libraries to reduce costs, improve record preservation, and enhance public access to records. Private organizations, known as presidential library foundations, raise funds to support facility construction and programming. These foundations play a key role in raising private funds to meet the statutory requirements of the Presidential Libraries Act. Presidential library foundations are structured as tax-exempt public charities under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. They are regulated under the IRC and must not use earnings to benefit individuals with personal interests. Additionally, they are restricted from engaging in campaign activities or excessive lobbying. These foundations can undertake other charitable and educational activities as long as they align with their tax-exempt status. Presidential library foundations, as Section 501(c)(3) organizations, must file an annual Form 990 with the IRS. This form details their finances, expenses, assets, and activities that justify their tax-exempt status. The Form 990s are open to public inspection and can be requested from the IRS or the foundation. Recent Form 990s are available on Guidestar.org. Recent Form 990s for presidential library foundations can be found on Guidestar.org. Federal law generally does not require public disclosure of donor identities, except for donors who contribute at least $5,000 in a year, which must be disclosed to the IRS but not publicly. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) requires registered lobbyists contributing $200 or more to library foundations to publicly disclose their contributions. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2014 aimed to increase transparency by requiring presidential library foundations to report contributions of $200 or more quarterly to the Archivist. This reporting would include the amount, date, and source of the contribution, as well as the donor's address and occupation. The requirement would continue until the Archivist accepts the land or facility for the library. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2014 aimed to increase transparency by requiring presidential library foundations to report contributions of $200 or more quarterly to the Archivist. The Archivist would publish donor information on NARA's website, and it would be unlawful to make or accept donations in another person's name. No further action was taken on the bill, but some libraries voluntarily disclose donor information. The report discusses the disclosure of names and donation ranges of contributors to presidential libraries, addressing concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Scholars debate the accuracy of history in library exhibitions, the federated system's maintenance, and the relationship between presidential foundations and federal libraries. Private foundations fund exhibits in presidential libraries, supporting research and design. Scholars note internal tensions in presidential library design. The design of presidential libraries has an internal tension between being archival depositories and history museums. The focus has shifted towards museums, attracting millions of visitors annually. However, their original purpose was to house records for research and public use. Critics argue that these libraries now prioritize tourism and hero worship over accountability to Congress and the American people. The design of presidential libraries has shifted towards prioritizing tourism and hero worship over accountability to Congress and the American people. Scholars have raised concerns about the lack of oversight and impartial decisions in these libraries, which tend to shape public memory and morph presidential history into myth. In a 2006 issue of The Public Historian, scholars, including a representative from NARA, expressed similar concerns about the practices at presidential libraries. Presidential libraries raise concerns about historical accuracy and accountability. Scholars note a tension between history and \"heritage\" in these libraries, with exhibits often omitting controversial events or aspects of a president's life. For example, the Reagan library ignores the Iran-Contra scandal, the JFK library glosses over health issues and affairs, and the Nixon library omits certain details. The Nixon library fails to mention President Ford's pardon for Nixon's involvement in Watergate. NARA's Assistant Archivist emphasizes the need for historically accurate and balanced exhibits in presidential libraries, but the manual lacks specific guidelines. Funding shifts have led to less strict enforcement of exhibit approval by the assistant archivist. Scholar Larry J. Hackman criticizes NARA for lacking significant policies or guidelines for educational and public programs at presidential libraries, with exhibits not being evaluated effectively. NARA may avoid creating formal policies to prevent tension with influential individuals involved in exhibits. Hackman criticized NARA for lacking policies for vetting exhibits in presidential libraries, while Fawcett noted that foundations funding exhibits can choose not to support those with disagreeable content. Some libraries have collaborated with foundations to create temporary exhibits and public programs. The presidential library system is federated, with each library in a different physical location for various reasons. Some argue that keeping libraries in the hometowns of Presidents allows for a better understanding of their personalities. Since the 1955 enactment of the PLA, there has been debate over whether the federated system is the most practical for presidential libraries. The congressional debate surrounding the enactment of the PLA of 1986 highlighted concerns about the size and limitations of presidential libraries. Senator Lawton Chiles advocated for a single centralized library to prevent grander edifices, while others argued that the lack of distinctions between one- and two-term presidents penalized the latter in terms of storage space. Ms. Fawcett noted in 2006 that the William J. Clinton Presidential Library lacked space for collections and papers from President Clinton's postpresidential life. In 2006, concerns were raised about the limitations of presidential libraries, with suggestions for a centralized library to facilitate collaborative efforts and balanced exhibits on important issues spanning presidencies. This centralized approach could address concerns about historical views in museum and library exhibits. Some presidential libraries have partnerships with nonprofit foundations that support construction and funding of exhibitions. Relationships between foundations and libraries vary, with some being tense while others are smooth. Foundations may also support other institutions and charitable causes of the former president. Some foundations maintain control of parts of the library facility. Many presidential libraries now include public event spaces operated by foundations to generate revenue. Major museums rely on income from corporate and private events. Libraries built before amendments have also adopted this model, with spaces like the Air Force One Pavilion and White House East Room available for events. These revenue sources help libraries pay construction loans and meet their commitments. Library foundations rely on revenue sources to pay construction loans, support library programs, and fund charitable endeavors. Government support for public programs has decreased, making libraries more dependent on foundations. Some library directors also serve as CEOs of supporting foundations to align goals. Calls have been made for increased transparency in the relationships between foundations and libraries. Mr. Hackman emphasized the need for transparency in library foundations to ensure they operate in the public's interest. He highlighted the lack of information gathered by NARA's Office of Presidential Libraries regarding the boards of directors, annual reports, and federal filings of these organizations. Hackman stressed the importance of NARA reporting information about the plans, activities, and support of these foundations to the public. He outlined desired characteristics for the partnership between foundations and NARA, including clarity in roles, goals, and responsibilities to minimize friction and maximize success in the relationship. Collaboration in planning, resource development, and budgeting was also emphasized to ensure efficient use of resources. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a joint hearing on \"America's Presidential Libraries: Their Mission and Their Future\" on February 28, 2011. The library director is typically involved in the planning and decision-making of nonprofit partners, coordinating programs related to basic library functions. Financial support from nonprofit partners is dedicated to programs addressing library priorities that may not be supported by federal operations or library revenue. At a joint hearing on \"America's Presidential Libraries: Their Mission and Their Future,\" the Archivist of the United States testified that presidential libraries benefit local communities by generating additional revenue. Visitors to these libraries spend $100-$200 at local businesses, with an estimated $15 million added to the economy in Abilene, Kansas; $43 million in Boston; and $55 million in Austin, Texas. Representatives Mica and Crawford later hosted a forum on the future of the presidential library system. Representative Crawford inquired about efforts to attract young people to presidential libraries, with social media and technology being key strategies. All 13 libraries use Facebook, 10 have Twitter accounts, and 10 have YouTube channels. The Truman, Kennedy, and Bush libraries have been active on all three platforms since 2010. The popularity of NARA-affiliated presidential libraries on social media platforms varies greatly. The George W. Bush Library is the most popular with over 170,000 likes on Facebook. Each library has been active on social media, with regular updates on Facebook and Twitter. The National Archives and Records Administration's presidential libraries are active on social media platforms, with the George W. Bush Library being the most popular. They use social media for various purposes such as sharing administrative updates, commemorating important events, posting job openings, and promoting upcoming events. The presidential library system, including current job openings, events, and historic moments during the President's Administration, aims to increase visitation through social media and other means. Data from NARA shows a challenge in attracting visitors, with total visitors ranging from 1.1 million to 2.0 million per year from FY1975 to FY2012. The number of operating libraries has increased from 5 to 12 by 2012. The average number of visitors to presidential libraries per year is 1.46 million, with a rise to over 1.6 million in years when a new library opens. Initially, new libraries attract around 300,000 visitors, but this number declines over time. Five years after opening, visitation decreases by more than 36%, and after 10 years, it drops by 43%. Some libraries experience a decline of over 60% in a decade. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library had the highest number of visitors among 12 libraries open in FY2012, with 381,000. The National Archives in Washington, DC, attracts roughly 1 million visitors annually since 2004. Library popularity is not solely based on the President's term or location. Newer libraries do not necessarily attract more visitors over time. For example, the Gerald R. Ford Library consistently has more visitors than the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, despite opening earlier. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library had a resurgence in annual visitors in the early 2000s, drawing more visitors than the George Bush and William J. Clinton Presidential Libraries. A study suggested that a prospective library for President Obama in Chicago could attract 800,000 visitors annually due to its location in a densely populated area with access to public transportation. However, existing data on presidential libraries show that visitation levels are not always higher in densely populated areas. The National Archives oversees 13 presidential libraries, serving as repositories for archival materials. The Presidential Libraries Act, enacted in 1955, authorizes the preservation of historical materials of outgoing Presidents. Private nonprofit organizations fund and construct each library, with most libraries associated with the nonprofit. The Presidential Libraries Act places requirements on libraries and foundations to preserve presidential legacies. Congress has the authority to legislate the mission and operation of these libraries, determining the best method of preserving a President's legacy. NARA has final approval of exhibit content, but foundations often oversee the creation of public museum exhibits. Congress may consider giving NARA a more active role in creating and displaying library exhibitions, potentially coordinating exhibits among the 13 current libraries for a more comprehensive treatment of presidential history. They could also evaluate the cost and accessibility benefits of consolidating all presidential materials into one location, leading to decisions on the future use of existing library buildings. Moving all presidential materials into a single facility could impact scholarship on presidential history by making the collection easily accessible to researchers but potentially making research more difficult by removing records from locations relevant to the President's hometown. Researchers may have to travel across the country to access materials if a new archive is constructed in Washington, DC. The current system of dispersing presidential libraries to various hometowns may help scholars understand the environmental and social factors that influenced a President's decisions. However, consolidating all presidential materials into a single facility could impact scholarship by making research more accessible but potentially removing records from relevant locations. Congress may consider requiring future presidential libraries to be built in the hometown of the President to maintain this connection. The construction of future presidential libraries in the hometown of the President may become irrelevant as more records are put online. A centralized presidential archive could eliminate the need for individual libraries to have specialized facilities for sensitive materials. The construction of a centralized presidential library could impact research focus and raise concerns about relationships between libraries and supporting foundations. Congress has the authority to legislate on potential conflicts of interest in leadership roles within these organizations. Congress has the authority to legislate on conflicts of interest in leadership roles within presidential libraries and their supporting foundations, including determining the required endowment percentage for deeding a library to the federal government. The division of labor and property between libraries and foundations can be unclear due to their unique relationships. The division of labor and property between presidential libraries and their supporting foundations can be unclear. Legislation such as H.R. 1133 in the 113th Congress aimed to mandate public disclosure of funding sources for library fundraising organizations. This bill would have required quarterly reports on contributions over $200 to be filed with NARA, with certain information to be published on a publicly accessible website. H.R. 1133, reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, proposed changes to presidential libraries. NARA suggested separating libraries from museums, clarifying ownership, and disclosing admission fee division. The ownership and fee division of presidential libraries are not always clear to visitors. Some libraries have foundations that pay the federal government for access to government-owned portions of the facility. Congress has the authority to require transparency in fee allocation and could allow visitors to pay only for the areas they are interested in. This would ensure that visitors only pay for the parts of the facility they visit. The Barack Obama Foundation was established in 2014 to raise funds for the library endowment and institute beyond 2017. Led by a Board of Directors chaired by Martin Nesbitt, the foundation prioritizes economic development and community engagement. The site selection process for the facility began in 2014 with the release of RFQ and RFP documents, targeting universities for submissions. The RFP for the Barack Obama Foundation sought proposals from universities. Four university-affiliated proposals were submitted, including University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, Columbia University, and University of Hawaii. Decision expected by March 2015. RFP guidance covered organization, site and development, surrounding community, and academic collaboration. The Obama library proposals from universities have been submitted for review. Local stakeholders, including mayors and communities, are actively supporting the projects. The library will be the first facility constructed under the new requirements of the Presidential Historical Records Preservation Act of 2008. The Obama presidential library proposals are being reviewed, with a requirement to raise $225,000 a day for private funding. The library is expected to have characteristics similar to recent presidential libraries, including a well-funded foundation, university affiliation, and possibly a location outside the President's hometown. Congressional attention is likely to focus on private financing, the historical role of libraries, and the balance between private and public functions. The opening of new library facilities under NARA management and congressional oversight is of interest."
