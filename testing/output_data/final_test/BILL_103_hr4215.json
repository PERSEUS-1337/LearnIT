IRA Deduction now allowed to nonemployed spouses with special rules for certain married individuals. The maximum amount of deduction is increased to $2,500 for individuals filing a joint return, based on the compensation included in their gross income for the taxable year. Inflation adjustments are made to increase dollar amounts in subsections (b)(1)(A), (c)(1)(A), and (g)(3)(B) for taxable years after 1994 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The amendments made in 1992 to increase dollar limitations in various sections of the tax code will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993. SEC. 2. Repayable distributions from individual retirement accounts for educational expenses and first-time homebuyers. Section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for repayable distributions from individual retirement accounts for educational expenses and first-time homebuyers. Qualified distributions for these purposes are not included in gross income, with a repayment requirement if the taxpayer does not recontribute the full amount during the repayment period. The amount determined for repayment under subparagraph (B) is based on the ratio of required recontributions to the total required repayment. The total required repayment includes the qualified distribution and interest on the non-recontributed balance computed at the prime rate. The repayment period for a qualified distribution is the year of receipt and the following 15 years (10 years for certain distributions). The adjusted tax amount is the total tax reduction due to the exclusion of the distribution. The term 'prime rate' refers to the average predominant prime rate quoted by commercial banks to large businesses, as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. A 'qualified distribution' from an individual retirement plan includes distributions for first-time homebuyers or other non-qualified distributions. Qualified first-time homebuyer distributions are payments or distributions received by an individual and used within 60 days for a first-time home purchase. Qualified distributions from individual retirement plans must not exceed the taxpayer's higher education expenses for the year and should not reduce the plan balance below $1,000. Qualified first-time homebuyer distributions are payments received to cover qualified acquisition costs for a principal residence of a first-time homebuyer or their family members. Qualified acquisition costs include expenses related to acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, along with settlement, financing, and closing costs. The term 'first-time homebuyer' refers to any individual meeting specific criteria. A 'first-time homebuyer' is an individual who had no ownership interest in a principal residence for 3 years before acquiring the residence. This definition excludes individuals whose time specified in section 1034 was suspended by certain subsections. The term 'date of acquisition' refers to the date when a binding contract is entered into or construction of a principal residence begins. If a distribution from an individual retirement plan fails to meet requirements due to a delay in acquiring a residence, the amount may be contributed to another plan within 120 days. This contribution is exempt from certain rules and does not affect the eligibility of other contributions. The term 'qualified higher education expenses' includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment at an eligible educational institution for the taxpayer, spouse, child, or grandchild. The amount of these expenses for a taxable year is reduced by any other amount. Recontributions of qualified distributions to an individual retirement plan must be made during the repayment period and cannot exceed the required repayment amount reduced by any prior recontribution. Recontributions of qualified distributions to an individual retirement plan must be made during the repayment period and cannot exceed the required repayment amount reduced by any prior recontribution. The recontribution should be designated as such and specified for the qualified distribution it pertains to, treated as a rollover contribution for tax purposes. Other special rules apply. Other special rules apply to the tax treatment of distributions, including aggregation rules for qualified distributions received by an individual during a taxable year. The amendment made by this subsection applies to distributions received after December 31, 1993."
