    "content": "The expectation of constituent service has existed since the earliest Congresses, with requests for assistance leading to the establishment of select committees. Today, constituents contact congressional offices for various matters, including basic information about government entities or processes. Constituent service in congressional offices involves engaging with constituents, providing information about government functions, and serving as intermediaries for various programs and services. Member offices decide how to allocate resources for these activities, which can also serve as opportunities for outreach and education. Requests from constituents can offer feedback to Members of Congress on government programs and issues that need addressing. Constituent service in congressional offices involves engaging with constituents to provide information about government programs and services. Former House Members emphasize the importance of constituent service work in understanding the effectiveness of legislation. Congressional offices offer various services tailored to meet the needs of constituents, such as providing information on federal government processes and opportunities. Member offices provide information to constituents about federal contracting opportunities, procurement processes, and financial aid for college-age students. They offer publicly accessible information, refer constituents to government agencies, and provide website links or reference materials to assist with inquiries. The CRS casework web page offers useful links for congressional offices, including tools for federal government loans and benefit programs. Casework refers to the assistance provided by Members of Congress to constituents seeking help with federal agencies. This can include services like helping with Social Security applications, veterans' benefits, missing records from agencies, or immigration issues. Congressional offices have flexibility in defining and handling casework, which may also involve liaising between the federal government and local entities affected by federal laws. Casework involves Members of Congress assisting constituents with federal agency issues such as missing records, payments, or immigration matters. Congressional offices can intervene by requesting information, urging prompt consideration, arranging interviews, expressing judgments, or calling for reconsideration of administrative responses. Federal grants are available for state or local governments, nonprofits, research entities, and small businesses. For more information, refer to CRS reports on casework and congressional resources. Federal grants are awarded to state or local governments, nonprofits, research entities, and small businesses. Member offices can provide information and assistance to grant seekers, develop relationships with grants officers, and host workshops to educate constituents about federal assistance. Given the competition for federal grants, Member offices may also provide information on developing grant proposals. Member offices can assist constituents with developing grant proposals and identifying funding options. CRS resources provide information for grant-seekers approaching congressional offices, including how federal grants are administered and specific grant programs like community services block grants and student financial aid. Federal housing assistance programs, rural development programs, and student financial aid information can be found on the CRS grants and federal assistance web page. Business owners can also reach out to Members of Congress for federal government contract opportunities. Congressional offices can provide information on business registration requirements, opportunities, and the federal contracting process. Internship opportunities are available in most congressional offices, focusing on educational experiences. Interns in congressional offices play an educational role and cannot replace regular staff members. Each office has discretion in determining internships, including number of interns, length, location, qualifications, and compensation. More information on internships in Congress and other federal government opportunities is available. To apply to U.S. service academies like USMA, USNA, USAFA, or USMMA, an official nomination is required from a Member office. Nominations are limited by state quotas and must be submitted by January 31 for the upcoming academic year. Member offices have their own criteria for nominations, including deadlines and interviews with candidates. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL33213. The Senate Page Program is open to 16- or 17-year-old high school juniors sponsored by Senators, with four sessions each year providing lodging, schooling, and meals. K-12 students from participating House districts can compete in the Congressional App Challenge by designing and submitting their own software application. High school students from participating House districts can compete in the Congressional Art Competition, where a winning piece of visual artwork is chosen and displayed in the Capitol. Updated rules are released in January, with winners chosen by House Member offices typically announced in early December.

The U.S. Capitol offers free guided tours through the Capitol Visitor Center, with same-day passes available at information desks. Reservations can be made online up to three months in advance.

Gallery passes for the House or Senate chambers are not distributed by the CVC, but can be obtained through a Member office by presenting a written request to the chamber's Sergeant at Arms or appointments desk. Public requests for free White House tours must be submitted through a Member of Congress, with requests needing to be made at least 21 days in advance. Requests for tours of federal government sites in Washington, DC, including the White House, can be made up to three months in advance. Most sites do not require congressional requests, such as the Library of Congress, U.S. Supreme Court, national monuments, and Smithsonian museums. Some popular attractions may require timed-entry tickets and reservations in advance. Members of Congress can also write letters recognizing constituents' achievements. More information is available for House offices at https://housenet.house.gov/serving-constituents/dc-visitors/white-house-tours. Members of Congress can write letters recognizing constituents' public distinctions or achievements, such as public office appointments, acts of heroism, or key awards. They can identify individuals through local news or networks and encourage constituents to suggest recipients. Requests for a U.S. flag flown over the Capitol must be submitted through a Member of Congress to the Architect of the Capitol, with flags available in various sizes for purchase by the constituent. Requests should be made at least two weeks in advance, with no guarantees on the requested date due to weather conditions. The White House Greetings Office provides greetings for special occasions like birthdays, weddings, and awards. Requests must be made at least six weeks in advance through member offices.
