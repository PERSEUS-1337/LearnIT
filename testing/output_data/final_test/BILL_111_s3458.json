    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Section 8(a) Improvements Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges that despite progress made by businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals through the business development program under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, discrimination still poses significant barriers to their success in the marketplace. Recent evidence presented in Congressional hearings and studies highlights ongoing disparities that need to be addressed. Significant disparities persist in the number, size, and income of businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals compared to others, even after accounting for various factors. Discrimination hinders access to capital for these individuals, leading to loan denials and higher interest rates. Business owners often face discrimination from prime contractors and bonding companies, hindering their ability to compete for government contracts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
