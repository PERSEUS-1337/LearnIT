    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ensuring Medication Safety for Seniors Act\". Congress finds that prescription medications are crucial for Americans' health care, with 65 percent of the population using them annually. Medication errors, a common type of medical error, pose a significant threat to patient safety, leading to an estimated 7,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. These errors not only harm patients but also incur financial costs for healthcare organizations. The Act aims to promote the development of electronic prescribing systems in healthcare to enhance patient safety and quality of care by reducing preventable adverse drug events. Technology can play a crucial role in improving medication management processes and decreasing patient injuries, but investment costs remain a barrier for healthcare systems. The Act promotes electronic prescribing systems in healthcare to improve patient safety and care quality by reducing adverse drug events. Technology can enhance medication management and reduce patient injuries, but cost barriers hinder healthcare systems. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration program to provide assistance to Medicare healthcare providers for electronic prescribing systems. Assistance includes computer software, hardware, upgrades, and improvements. The Secretary may award grants to Medicare providers for purchasing, leasing, and installing electronic prescribing systems, communication capabilities, and providing education and training on computer information system technologies. Grants require a specific application process approved by the Secretary. Grants under this section are limited to one per Medicare health care provider or group, including those serving beneficiaries in various healthcare settings. The terms and conditions for grants are specified by the Secretary, and applicants must provide necessary information as required. The Secretary requires information to evaluate and monitor grant projects, with audits conducted as necessary. The demonstration project will be limited to 5 sites selected based on specific criteria, prioritizing areas with the highest Medicare beneficiary numbers. The Secretary will conduct evaluations of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the demonstration project, with reports submitted to Congress. The authority to provide assistance under this section will end on September 30, 2014, and the Secretary may waive certain requirements for the project's purposes. The report on the demonstration project must include an analysis of patient outcomes and costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Recommendations for project extension, expansion, or termination will be made by the Secretary. The term \"Medicare health care providers\" refers to entities that provide services reimbursed under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The term \"Medicare beneficiary\" refers to an individual entitled to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B of the Social Security Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005, with additional funding for 2006 and 2007. Amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) remain available without fiscal year limitation through September 30, 2014. The Secretary cannot implement the demonstration project until initial uniform standards for electronic prescription drug programs are developed under the Social Security Act."
