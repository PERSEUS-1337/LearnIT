    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"No Taxation Without Representation Act of 2001\". It includes findings. The \"No Taxation Without Representation Act of 2001\" states that residents of the District of Columbia, who pay Federal income taxes, should have voting representation in Congress. They are currently denied this right, despite meeting all requirements of American citizenship. This denial results in unequal representation compared to other taxpaying Americans. Residents of the District of Columbia pay high per capita income taxes to the Federal Government but lack voting representation in Congress, which goes against the founding principles of the Nation and American values. Residents of the District of Columbia will have full voting representation in Congress and be exempt from certain taxes under new legislation. Residents of the District of Columbia are exempt from taxation under certain conditions, including full voting representation in Congress by elected individuals with equal voting rights as state representatives. Individuals who are bona fide residents of the District for the entire taxable year are eligible for this exemption. Residents of the District of Columbia are exempt from taxation under certain conditions, including a period of at least 2 years before changing residence. Income attributable to that period of DC residence before the move is not taxed. Deductions and credits cannot be claimed against the excluded income. Residency for tax purposes is determined according to specific guidelines. The determination of DC residency for tax purposes is made according to regulations set by the Secretary. Individuals registered to vote in other jurisdictions cannot be considered DC residents for tax purposes. Wage withholding for services performed by an employee is exempt if it is reasonable to believe the employee will be a bona fide resident for the entire calendar year. The employee must be a bona fide resident of the District of Columbia for the entire calendar year for wage withholding exemption, as per tax regulations. A new item is added to the table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. Residents of the District of Columbia are subject to tax regulations for wage withholding exemption. Amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act, with withholding changes for remuneration paid post-enactment."
