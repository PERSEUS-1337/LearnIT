    "content": "The Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC) defines spyware as technologies deployed without user consent, impairing user control over changes, system resources, and personal information. Congress debates enacting new legislation or relying on industry self-regulation and enforcement by the FTC and DOJ. Opponents fear unintended consequences, while supporters advocate for new laws. Supporters of new legislation believe current laws are inadequate due to the rise in spyware incidents. They advocate for specific laws to require consent before software is downloaded onto a computer. Skeptics argue that defining spyware is challenging and legislation may have unintended consequences. They also point out that enforcing opt-in requirements on \"bad actors\" who are difficult to locate and prosecute, especially if they are overseas and not subject to U.S. law. The debate over spyware legislation is similar to the controversy surrounding spam laws. Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act, but questions remain about its effectiveness. Like with spam, consumer education and technological advancements are also needed to address the spyware threat. Software with spyware may be included in freeware programs, making it challenging to regulate. Spyware can be included in software products, like freeware, and may collect information about computer usage, including personally identifiable information. This data is then relayed back to the software manufacturer or a marketing company. Adware is another common form of spyware that can generate pop-up ads on a computer, even when not connected to the internet. Spyware can also refer to keylogging software that records keystrokes, allowing another party to obtain all typed information, including passwords. Concerns arise over the potential for credit card numbers and other personal data to be recorded. Commercial keylogging software has been available for some time. Spyware, including keylogging software, can record sensitive information like credit card numbers, leading to identity theft concerns. The lack of a clear definition complicates anti-spyware legislation, as some software may have legitimate uses. Consent for installation is a key issue in determining the legality of these applications. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the FTC track spyware cases at federal and state levels. The FTC provides consumer information on spyware, including warning signs of infection such as pop-up ads, hijacked browsers, and unexpected changes on the computer. The FTC alert warns about signs of computer infection like non-functional keys, error messages, and slow performance. Consumers are advised to update software, download from trusted sites, avoid unknown software, and use a personal firewall. If infected, get anti-spyware software from a trusted vendor. In March 2004, Utah became the first state to enact spyware legislation. By January 2009, at least 15 states had enacted spyware legislation. During the 110th Congress, two bills were introduced in the House of Representatives and one bill was introduced in the Senate regarding spyware. H.R. 964, introduced in March 2007, aims to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts related to computer control and information collection. It also requires the FTC to submit reports on cookie use in advertising and information collection programs. Reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in May 2007, it was referred to the Senate Committee. The \"I-SPY\" Act, introduced in March 2007, aims to impose fines and/or prison terms for unauthorized access to a protected computer for criminal offenses. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in June 2007. H.R. 1525 and the Counter Spy Act aim to prevent unauthorized installation of software on protected computers and the collection of sensitive personal information without consent. H.R. 1525 was reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary and referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 2007, while the Counter Spy Act was introduced by Senator Pryor in June 2007. S. 1625 aims to regulate software installation for adware, requiring clear disclosure and user consent. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in 2007, with a hearing held in 2008. No further action was taken. In the 108th Congress, multiple spyware bills were introduced in both the House and Senate, with similar legislation being proposed. The Senate Commerce Committee reported S. 2145 (Burns) and S. 687 (Burns) in 2005, with S. 687 being placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar in 2006. The House passed two spyware bills, H.R. 2929 and H.R. 4661. In the 108th Congress, the Senate Commerce Committee reported S. 2145 (Burns) and S. 687 (Burns) in 2005, with S. 687 being placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar in 2006. The House passed two spyware bills, H.R. 2929 and H.R. 4661, but none of these bills cleared that Congress. Hearings were held on spyware by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee's Subcommittee on Communications and the House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, but there was no further action taken."
