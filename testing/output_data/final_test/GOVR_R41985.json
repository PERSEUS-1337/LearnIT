    "content": "Agriculture-based renewable energy, such as biofuels and wind turbines, has been supported by U.S. policymakers through incentives and programs since the late 1970s. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, primarily made from corn and soybean oil, have received federal support. Federal biofuels subsidies under the 2008 farm bill and subsequent legislation exceeded $7 billion by 2010, driven by energy security, greenhouse gas reduction, and domestic demand for U.S. farm products. This report focuses on bioenergy policies in the 2008 farm bill and the outlook for bioenergy programs in future legislation. The 2008 farm bill bioenergy provisions are detailed in terms of function, goals, administration, funding, and implementation status. The report also discusses the outlook for bioenergy programs in future farm bills and emerging issues related to USDA energy programs. Tables provide data on funding for energy provisions in the 2008 farm bill and proposed funding for FY2014-FY2018 under current legislation. The 2013 Farm Bill compared Senate and House-passed bills with current law, along with analysis of renewable energy programs and biofuels provisions in relation to agricultural and energy policy. Federal programs supporting renewable energy production often extend beyond USDA jurisdiction and originate from legislation outside of farm bills. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and other federal biofuels policies were established outside of omnibus farm bill legislation. The RFS, originating in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, mandates increasing biofuels use. The volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC) and ethanol import tariff were also established separately from farm bills. The ethanol import tariff, established by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, expired on December 31, 2011. Various tax credits were available for biodiesel and small ethanol/biodiesel producers. Federal and state programs support renewable energy sources beyond biofuels, with the 2008 farm bill's energy title incentivizing research for agriculture-based renewable fuels. The 2002 farm bill included an energy title to promote research on agriculture-based renewable energy and expand their distribution and use. Interest in renewable energy has grown rapidly since then, driven by rising petroleum prices and increased biofuels production. U.S. ethanol production has significantly increased from under 2 billion gallons to nearly 14 billion gallons annually. The expansion of corn use for ethanol in the U.S. has grown rapidly since 2001, reaching nearly 14 billion gallons in 2011. This increase has raised concerns about higher prices for grains and oilseeds, livestock feed costs, food costs, and lower agricultural exports. Environmental worries have also emerged regarding the expansion of corn production onto non-traditional lands. Policymakers have sought to address these concerns. Policymakers in the 2008 farm bill aimed to shift biofuels policy towards non-corn feedstock, particularly cellulosic-based feedstock, in response to concerns about environmental impact and rising food prices. The bill, which became law six months after the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, included provisions to increase the use of \"advanced biofuels\" and expand federal incentives for renewable energy from non-corn sources. The 2008 farm bill included provisions to expand bio-based marketing, certification programs, support for biorefinery development, grants for advanced biofuels production, education on biodiesel, rural energy efficiency support, reauthorization of biofuels research programs, and incentives for cellulosic ethanol feedstock production. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for bio-based marketing, biorefinery development support, advanced biofuels production grants, biodiesel education, rural energy efficiency support, biofuels research program reauthorization, and incentives for cellulosic ethanol feedstock production. The bill also authorized funding for universities, laboratories, cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, biofuels market and environmental impact studies, and imported ethanol duty continuation. Funding in the farm bill can be mandatory or discretionary, with mandatory funds automatically allocated unless limited by Congress, and discretionary funds specified for certain programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized over $1 billion in mandatory funding for Title IX energy programs, including $320 million for the Biorefinery Assistance Program, $300 million for the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and $255 million for the Rural Energy for America Program. Discretionary funding for Title IX programs totaled $1.1 billion. Funding amounts are determined annually through the appropriations process. In the 2008 farm bill, discretionary funding for Title IX programs totaled $1.1 billion, with $600 million allocated to the Biorefinery Assistance Program. Actual appropriations for energy programs were below authorized levels at $106 million through FY2012. Renewable energy programs invested over $750 million in biorefineries and renewable energy systems, with nearly $900 million spent on BCAP. Mandatory and discretionary funding allocations for FY2008-FY2012 are detailed in the major energy provisions of the bill. The 2008 farm bill authorized funding for renewable energy programs, with mandatory funding only until FY2012. If policymakers want to continue these programs, they will need to find offsets for funding. The 112th Congress was unable to pass regular FY2013 appropriations bills, leading to a continuing resolution for FY2013 being signed into law on September 28, 2012. This CR covers all 12 regular appropriations bills, including Agriculture, providing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2012. Funding in the CR is effective from October 1, 2012, through March 27, 2013. Discretionary funding for the first half of FY2013 is provided at the rate funded in FY2012. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP; Section 9007) was the sole Title IX bioenergy program that received funding. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP; Section 9007) received $3.4 million in discretionary funds in FY2012. The 2008 farm bill provisions expired in September 2012, but were extended until September 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA). A subsequent CR in FY2013 maintained the $3.4 million in REAP funds as the sole allocation of discretionary funds for Title IX. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) included Title IX, which expanded programs for biofuels production. It replaced provisions from the 2002 farm bill and included sections on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. Research on renewable energy was in Title VII, while tax and trade provisions were in Title XV. Rural Development programs in Title VI supported rural renewable energy initiatives. Title VI (Rural Development) in the 2008 farm bill included programs for rural renewable energy production. Changes to bioenergy provisions were made under ATRA (P.L. 112-240). Section 9001 in Title IX of the bill outlines authorities, program descriptions, funding levels, and implementation status. The bill aimed to shift federal biofuels incentives towards renewable biomass sources, with new definitions for terms like \"advanced biofuels\". The 2013 Farm Bills proposed changes to expand the use of forest products as eligible biomass and define a \"Renewable Energy System\" to prohibit certain actions. H.R. 2642 expands the use of forest products as eligible biomass and defines a \"Renewable Energy System\" to prohibit certain actions at the retail level. The 2008 farm bill renamed the federal biobased products procurement preference program as the Biobased Markets Program, requiring federal agencies to establish a program for procuring biobased products and authorizing a voluntary labeling program for USDA Certified Biobased Products. Federal agencies and their contractors must purchase biobased products when procurement exceeds $10,000 or when quantities of functionally equivalent items purchased reach $10,000 or more. The Biobased Markets Program requires federal agencies and contractors to procure biobased products with the highest content levels in each category if items are reasonably available and meet performance standards. Funding includes mandatory Commodity Credit Corporation funding of $9 million, with discretionary funding authorized but not yet appropriated. No new mandatory funding was included under ATRA, but discretionary funding of $2 million was authorized. The Biobased Markets Program, also known as the BioPreferred\u00ae Program, was established under the 2002 farm bill as a federal procurement preference program for biobased products. Despite having discretionary funding authorized, no appropriations were made for FY2013. USDA has published guidelines and regulations for the program, designating 127 categories with over 10,000 products qualifying for preferred federal procurement. Additionally, a final rule for the voluntary labeling program for biobased products was published in January 2011. The Biobased Markets Program, established under the 2002 farm bill, is a federal procurement preference program for biobased products. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills would extend the program through FY2018 with new implementation requirements and funding allocations. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) supports the development of advanced biofuels through grants and loan guarantees for demonstration-scale biorefineries. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) provides grants and loan guarantees for converting renewable biomass to advanced biofuels. Grants can cover up to 30% of project costs, with loan guarantees limited to $250 million or 80% of project cost. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, funding includes mandatory CCC funding of $75 million in FY2009 and $245 million in FY2010 for loan guarantees. Discretionary funding of $150 million annually was authorized for grants under the 2008 farm bill and the ATRA extension, but no funding has been appropriated through FY2013. BAP was newly established under the 2008 farm bill. The Biorefinery Assistance Program (BAP) provides grants and loan guarantees for converting renewable biomass to advanced biofuels. Grants can cover up to 30% of project costs, with loan guarantees limited to $250 million or 80% of project cost. USDA has only implemented the loan guarantee portion of BAP due to lack of discretionary funding. The final rule for BAP's guaranteed loans was published in 2011. Project lenders submit loan guarantee applications which undergo multiple rounds of review, with an average processing time of nine months. Application fees include a guarantee fee and an annual renewal fee. In FY2009, $75 million was available for BAP loan guarantees, with three projects approved for a total of $159 million. In FY2010, $150 million was available, with four projects approved for $255 million. In FY2011, $129 million was available for guaranteed loans under BAP. The projects included cellulosic biofuel plants, an anaerobic digester, and an algae-to-diesel or jet fuel project. In FY2011, USDA received 13 applications valued at $1.3 billion for guaranteed loans under BAP. In FY2012, no new funding was available for these loans. In FY2013, a NOFA for $76 million to support guaranteed loans valued at $181 million was published. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills would extend the Biorefinery program. The House-passed 2013 farm bills would extend the Biorefinery Assistance Program through FY2018, with S. 954 expanding the program to include renewable chemicals and biobased product manufacturing. S. 954 authorizes mandatory funding of $100 million in FY2014 and $58 million each for FY2015-FY2016, with annual appropriations of $150 million for FY2014-FY2018. H.R. 2642 authorizes $75 million in annual appropriations for the program. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) provides payments to eligible biorefineries to encourage the use of renewable biomass as a replacement for fossil fuels. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) provides funding to eligible producers with a refining capacity exceeding 150 million gallons of advanced biofuel per year. Administered by: Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA. Funding: Mandatory CCC funding of $35 million for FY2009 was authorized, with discretionary funding of $15 million annually for FY2009-FY2013. Implementation Status: RAP was originally established under the 2002 farm bill as a grant program to help finance the cost of developing and constructing bio-refineries and biofuels production plants. The Repowering Assistance Program (RAP) focuses on converting fossil fuel burning plants to biomass or renewable fuel sources for energy processing. The program provides funding for projects demonstrating the commercial viability of converting biomass to fuels or chemicals. Individual project awards are limited to $5 million or 50% of total eligible project costs. USDA has announced funding for eligible plants in various fiscal years, including $20 million for FY2009, $8 million for FY2010, $25 million for FY2011, and $25 million for FY2012. The House-passed 2013 farm bill (H.R. 2642, \u00a78004) extends the Repowering Assistance Program through FY2018 with $10 million annually for FY2014-FY2018. The program aims to support and expand production of advanced biofuels derived from renewable biomass. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA, the program had mandatory CCC funding of $55 million for various fiscal years. The bioenergy program, administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, RD, USDA, had mandatory CCC funding of $55 million for various fiscal years. Additional discretionary funding was authorized but not appropriated through FY2013. The Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels was initially terminated in FY2007 but revived in 2008 under the 2008 farm bill's Section 9005. Producers of advanced biofuels can enter contracts with USDA to receive payments based on production quantity, renewable energy content, and other factors. Only one producer per refinery is eligible. Payments are made in two tiers, with the second tier serving as an incentive for increased production. Records must be submitted to document production. The Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels provides funding for producers based on production quantity and renewable energy content. Payments are distributed in two tiers, with caps per recipient and restrictions on funds for facilities exceeding 150 million gallons per year. Forest biomass biofuels are ineligible for certain payments. USDA has awarded contracts to biorefineries for advanced biofuels production. USDA announced various awards for advanced biofuels projects, including $30 million in FY2009, $40 million in FY2010, $80 million in a second FY2010 announcement, and $85 million in FY2011. In FY2012, up to $25 million was available for payments to advanced biofuel producers, with a limitation of $65 million imposed by the FY2012 Appropriations Act. In FY2012, $65 million was available for the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels. $40 million of mandatory funding was used for FY2011 payments. In FY2013, awards totaled $68.6 million and $30 million for prior years' production. USDA also announced $15.5 million in payments to producers. The 2013 farm bills would extend the program through FY2018 without mandatory funding. H.R. 2642 authorizes $50 million annually for the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program, which awards grants to educate vehicle fleets and the public about biodiesel fuel benefits. Administered by NIFA and USDA, the program was extended through FY2012 and implemented through continuation grants. The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program was initially awarded grants to the National Biodiesel Board and the University of Idaho. The program is monitored by the USDA Biodiesel Education Oversight Committee. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills would extend the program through FY2018 with different funding allocations. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides financial assistance for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvement projects, with appropriations of $2 million annually. Eligible entities include rural small businesses, agricultural producers, state, tribe, or local governments, and more. Renewable energy systems include bioenergy, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydropower. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides financial assistance for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvement projects. Eligible entities include rural small businesses, agricultural producers, state, tribe, or local governments. Renewable energy systems include bioenergy, geothermal, solar, wind, and hydropower. Funding for REAP includes mandatory CCC funds and discretionary appropriations, with varying amounts allocated annually. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act limited REAP mandatory spending to $22 million with discretionary funding at $3.4 million. The House and Senate considered amendments to prohibit the use of REAP funds for ethanol blender pumps or storage facilities, but they were not agreed upon. The final FY2012 Agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 112-55) did not include the House prohibition on using REAP funds for blender pumps or ethanol storage facilities. Under ATRA, no new mandatory funding was provided for REAP, but $25 million in discretionary funding was authorized for FY2013. The 2008 farm bill combined existing programs into the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), with certain provisions operating since 2005. Regulations for grants and loan guarantees were published in 2005 to implement the REAP provisions. The 2008 farm bill implemented the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) with various provisions. An interim rule in 2011 consolidated REAP programs, removing U.S. citizenship and rural area location requirements. The REAP Guaranteed Loan Program supports renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) supports renewable energy and energy efficiency projects by providing loan guarantees of up to 75% of the project's cost. Grants are available for energy audits, renewable energy development assistance, and purchasing/installing renewable energy systems for agricultural producers and rural small businesses. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) offers grants for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. Grants can cover up to 25% of project costs, with limits of $500,000 for renewable energy systems and $250,000 for energy efficiency improvements. Grant requests as low as $2,500 for renewable energy systems and $1,500 for energy efficiency improvements can be considered. At least 20% of grant funds must be for grants of $20,000 or less. The program also provides grants for energy audits and renewable energy development assistance, with grants of up to $100,000 available. Recipients of energy audits must pay at least 25% of the cost. The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) offers grants for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements, covering up to 25% of project costs with limits of $500,000 for renewable energy systems and $250,000 for energy efficiency improvements. Grants are also available for energy audits and renewable energy development assistance, with funding for feasibility studies and purchasing renewable energy systems. Federal Register notices have been used to implement the REAP provisions, with grants awarded on a competitive basis. In May 2009, a Federal Register notice was published regarding energy systems and efficiency improvements. For FY2010, USDA announced funding for renewable energy systems and efficiency grants and loans. Various notices were published in 2010 for energy audits, renewable energy development assistance, and feasibility studies. In FY2011, funds were available for grants, guaranteed loans, and combined grants for development. The USDA announced funding for renewable energy systems and efficiency improvements through grants, guaranteed loans, and combined grants in FY2011, with $70 million available. In FY2012, $25.4 million was allocated for similar activities, and in FY2013, $20.8 million was announced for these programs. In March 2013, USDA issued a NOFA announcing $20.8 million for REAP activities, supporting $10.4 million in grants and up to $43.4 million in guaranteed loans. By August 2013, over $21 million was awarded to 512 projects nationwide, including grants and loans. In September 2013, nearly $6 million in grants and $10 million in loans were awarded to 252 projects in 22 states. The USDA awarded over $339 million in grants and $262 million in loan guarantees to 252 projects in 22 states under the REAP program. This funding has supported more than 13,000 rural small businesses and agricultural producers, as well as over 1,000 solar projects and 560 wind projects. Proposed changes in the 2013 Farm Bills aim to extend REAP through FY2018 and impose limits on grant amounts. The USDA awarded grants and loan guarantees to numerous projects under the REAP program, supporting rural businesses and renewable energy projects. Proposed changes in the 2013 Farm Bills aim to extend REAP through FY2018 and impose limits on grant amounts. H.R. 2642 and S. 954 propose changes to funding for RES and EEI projects, with differences in grant ceilings and mandatory funding amounts. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) provides funding for research, development, and demonstration of biofuels and biobased energy innovations. Eligible entities include institutions of higher learning, national laboratories, federal or state research agencies, private-sector entities, and nonprofit organizations. BRDI aims to coordinate biomass research and development activities between USDA and DOE through the Biomass Research and Development Board and Technical Advisory Committee. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) was moved to Title IX of the 2008 farm bill and expanded its technical advisory committee. Administered jointly by NIFA, USDA, and DOE, it authorizes funding of $20 million for FY2009, $28 million for FY2010, $30 million for FY2011, and $40 million for FY2012. Discretionary funding of $35 million annually for FY2009-FY2012 was authorized but not appropriated. No cuts were made to the $40 million mandatory funding in FY2012. No new mandatory funding was included under ATRA, but $35 million discretionary funding was authorized for FY2013. USDA and DOE have announced annual funding allocations under BRDI since 2002. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) under the 2008 farm bill requires projects to focus on feedstock development, biofuels and biobased products development, and biofuels development analysis. Funding allocations have totaled over $202 million from FY2002 to FY2010, with $47 million awarded in FY2011 for eight new projects. The Biomass Research and Development Board announced a request for FY2011 applicants for $30 million in federal BRDI funding. USDA and DOE later announced $31 million in BRDI for new projects. USDA also announced $25 million in BRDI funding for additional projects in 2013. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills would extend BRDI through FY2018 with different funding structures. The Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative offers grants to rural communities for energy systems using renewable sources, with discretionary funding of $5 million annually. No mandatory funding is included, and grants can cover up to 50% of total costs. Administered by the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, USDA, no regulations have been announced yet. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills may impact the program's funding structure. The 2013 Farm Bills exclude the Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative extension. The Feedstock Flexibility Program aims to use surplus sugar for ethanol production, with USDA subsidizing the process through federal purchases. The program operates to avoid sugar forfeitures by allowing processors to borrow from CCC and repay with sugar production. The Feedstock Flexibility Program allows processors to borrow from CCC using sugar production as collateral. They must repay the loan or forfeit the collateral to CCC. If market rates are low, CCC purchases sugar to avoid forfeitures and sells it to bioenergy producers. Funding is provided by mandatory CCC funds. In July 2013, the sugar market indicated potential forfeitures for crop year 2012 due to a significant drop in sugar prices. To prevent this, USDA implemented the Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP) to purchase sugar and avoid forfeitures. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bills aim to extend the FFP through FY2018. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) offers financial aid to agricultural and forest landowners. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides assistance to owners and operators of agricultural and non-industrial private forest land for establishing, producing, and delivering biomass feedstocks. BCAP offers establishment and annual payments for perennial crops, as well as matching payments for collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible materials. Eligible producers can enter into contracts with USDA to produce biomass crops within designated project areas. BCAP project areas allow for the cultivation of biomass crops on contract acres of eligible land, excluding federal or state-owned land, native sod, or land enrolled in certain programs. Financial and technical assistance, including annual payments, are available for establishing these crops within designated project areas. BCAP project areas are established based on proposals submitted to FSA for cultivating biomass crops. Producers within the project area can enroll land into the program and receive matching payments for delivering eligible material to biomass conversion facilities. Invasive and noxious species are considered eligible material, and land ownership does not limit eligibility for payments. Administered by FSA, USDA with funding from mandatory CCC funds. Funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was provided through mandatory CCC funds under the 2008 farm bill for FY2008-FY2012. Funding for BCAP was limited in FY2010 and FY2011, and further reduced in FY2011. The President's FY2012 budget proposed to limit funding for BCAP to $70 million. There were conflicting proposals in the House and Senate FY2012 spending bills regarding BCAP funding. Ultimately, the final FY2012 Agriculture appropriations act maintained BCAP mandatory funding. In FY2012, BCAP mandatory spending was limited to $17 million under the Agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 112-55). No new mandatory funding was included for BCAP under ATRA, but $20 million in discretionary funding was authorized for FY2013. Implementation of matching payments for CHST of eligible materials for biomass conversion was addressed by President Obama in 2009. USDA published a NOFA in 2009 to implement the CHST matching payments component of BCAP, with a proposed rule published in 2010 and the final rule in 2010. USDA reported on the dissemination of best practice data from BCAP participants, with nearly $900 million paid out to projects in 31 states by June 2012. Due to funding limitations, an interim rule was published in 2011 to prioritize limited program funds for BCAP project areas. The interim rule prioritizes limited program funds for BCAP project areas, giving funding priority to establishment and annual payments for project area activities. Matching payments for CHST will only be funded if resources are available after funding all eligible project area applications. The 2013 Farm Bills aim to extend BCAP through FY2018, with additional restrictions on payments and a requirement for USDA to submit a report on best practice data. H.R. 2642 and S. 954 propose changes to the Forest Biomass for Energy program, with different funding approaches. H.R. 2642 removes criteria for eligible materials and support for CHST, authorizing $75 million annually without mandatory funding. S. 954 would provide $38.6 million annually for FY2014-FY2018. The program aims to encourage the use of forest biomass for energy, with eligibility for various entities to compete for funds. Priority is given to projects using low-value forest biomass for energy production, integrating bioenergy into manufacturing, developing new transportation fuels, and improving tree growth. The Forest Biomass for Energy program aims to encourage the use of forest biomass for energy production. It prioritizes projects using low-value forest biomass, integrating bioenergy into manufacturing, developing new transportation fuels, and improving tree growth. The program is administered by the Forest Service, USDA, with discretionary funding of $15 million annually authorized for FY2009-FY2012. No funding has been appropriated through FY2012, but under ATRA, $15 million was authorized for FY2013. The Forest Service has not announced any regulations for the program yet. The Forest Biomass for Energy Program requested $15 million and the Community Wood Energy Program requested $3.75 million. The Senate-passed bill would repeal the Forest Biomass program, while the House-passed bill excludes any provision for it. The Community Wood Energy Program provides matching grants for wood energy systems in public buildings. Administered by the Forest Service, USDA, it aims to reduce carbon intensity through conservation and use of low-value wood sources. The Forest Service has received funding for wood-to-energy projects from various sources, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. They are working on implementing the Community Wood Energy Program with coordination from Rural Development. Proposed changes in the 2013 Farm Bills include requests for funding for biomass energy programs. The Senate- and House-passed 2013 farm bills would extend the Community Wood Energy Program through FY2018, authorizing grants for biomass consumer cooperatives. S. 954 allows grants up to $50,000 with a 50% matching requirement, while H.R. 2642 is silent on this. S. 954 proposes annual appropriations of $5 million for FY2014-FY2018, while H.R. 2642 suggests $2 million annually with no mandatory funding. The 2008 farm bill requests a joint report on biofuels infrastructure needs, development approaches, and market trends. No specific funding has been announced or authorized for the study. The House-passed H.R. 2642 would repeal the Biofuels Infrastructure Study, while the Senate-passed S. 954 is silent on the matter. Section 9003 of the 2008 farm bill requires a report to be submitted to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees within one year. A report on the production of fertilizer from renewable energy sources in rural areas is to be submitted to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees within one year. The report will cover challenges, potential processes, technologies, and impacts of renewable fertilizer. Discretionary funding of $1 million was authorized for FY2009, but no new funding has been authorized. The 2013 farm bills propose to repeal the Renewable Fertilizer Study. The Sun Grant Initiative under Title VII of the 2008 farm bill focuses on renewable energy initiatives through a national network of universities and laboratories. It aims to establish a biobased economy and revive farming communities by emphasizing rural economic development through biobased renewable energy feedstocks. This initiative was added in 2003 and originally established with five national Sun Grant research centers. The Sun Grant Program, established under the 2008 farm bill, consists of regional centers across the country to promote collaboration in developing biobased energy technologies. Each center manages programs within its region and offers competitive grants to land-grant schools. The program is administered by NIFA, USDA, with discretionary funding of $75 million annually authorized for FY2008-FY2012. The Sun Grant Program, established under the 2008 farm bill, has discretionary funding of $75 million annually authorized for FY2008-FY2012. Only $2.25 million for FY2010 and $2.2 million for FY2012 have been appropriated. SGI has over 130 field studies on biomass feedstocks in progress. Proposed 2013 farm bills would extend the program with funding through FY2018. The 2008 farm bill established the Sun Grant Program with discretionary funding of $75 million annually through FY2018. It includes a USDA study on the use of animal manure as fertilizer and a new tax credit for cellulosic ethanol producers. No specific funding was announced for the study, and the Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit offers a higher rate than for corn-starch ethanol blenders. The Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit, which expired on December 31, 2012, was extended retroactively from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013. It provided a credit of $1.01 per gallon for producers of cellulosic ethanol in the United States. The credit was expanded to include second-generation biofuels from cultivated algae, cyanobacteria, or lemna. The ethanol blender, not the producer, was eligible for the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit of $0.51 per gallon. Section 15322 of the 2008 farm bill requires a report on biofuels, including production, impacts, and conversion of corn ethanol plants. The final report was due in June 2009 but has not been completed. No specific funding was announced for this study. The 2008 farm bill reduced the ethanol tax credit to $0.45 per gallon in 2009. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 limited qualifying biofuels to U.S. production. The tax credit was extended through December 31, 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312, \u00a7708) expired the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) on December 31, 2011. Ethanol is denatured with a small amount of gasoline to convert it to fuel ethanol. The 2008 farm bill reduced the permissible volume of denaturant to 2% for calculating the tax credit. Imports of ethyl alcohol are subject to specific duties and tariffs. The import duty on un-denatured ethyl alcohol was extended through December 31, 2011, by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. A Senate amendment to eliminate the import duty and VEETC failed in June 2011, leading to the expiration of both on December 31, 2011. Refunds of import duty are permitted under Section 1313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 for re-exported goods or goods used in exports. The 2008 farm bill eliminated the ability to obtain a duty refund for exported products containing no ethanol. This change was fully implemented. The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS) of USDA's Rural Development Agency administers programs for rural and agricultural activities, offering funding opportunities like payments, grants, loans, and loan guarantees for renewable energy development. Programs include Value-Added Producer Grant, Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan, Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant, Rural Business Enterprise Grants, and more. The USDA's NRCS and DOE offer various programs for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy projects, including grants, loans, and financial assistance. NRCS programs like Conservation Innovation Grants and EQIP can provide energy-efficiency assistance, while DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds research in these areas. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for reports on the impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies. Studies were mandated to assess how ethanol production affects the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices, including the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels, Biofuels Infrastructure Study, and economic impacts of expanded cellulosic biomass production. EPA, USDA, and DOE have conducted studies on various biofuel-related issues in response to these mandates. Since the 2008 farm bill, EPA, USDA, and DOE have conducted studies on biofuels. The 112th Congress reviewed farm programs in 2012 to prepare for the anticipated 2012 farm bill. Numerous studies by government, academia, and think-tanks on policy-driven biofuels production are listed in an Appendix to this report. The 112th Congress failed to pass a new five-year farm bill in 2012. Instead, the current 2008 farm bill was extended until September 30, 2013. In the 113th Congress, both the Senate-passed and House-passed bills aimed to extend most renewable energy provisions of Title IX. The Senate and House bills for the farm bill extension include various renewable energy programs, with differences in funding sources. The Senate bill provides $900 million in new mandatory funding over five years, while the House bill has no mandatory funding for these programs. The House bill, H.R. 2642, does not have mandatory funding for Title IX programs but authorizes $1.405 billion over five years. It eliminates support for the CHST component of BCAP, limiting its effectiveness. Funding for the next farm bill will be based on baseline projections and budgetary assumptions. Most bioenergy provisions of Title IX have mandatory funding only until FY2012, except for the Feedstock Flexibility Program. The ATRA farm bill extension reauthorized IX bioenergy programs for FY2013 without new mandatory funding, making them dependent on annual appropriations. Lack of mandatory funding is seen as a setback for long-term bioenergy program development. Various Title IX programs fund similar projects like anaerobic digesters, wind turbines, solar panels, and biofuels. Funding for these programs is compared in Table 3 of the House and Senate 2013 farm bills. The USDA and DOE have funded projects for advanced biofuels and renewable energy, with potential overlap in research areas. Some policymakers suggest merging or eliminating energy programs to avoid redundancy. The development of a cellulosic-based ethanol industry faces challenges. The potential development of a cellulosic-based ethanol industry in the United States is hindered by expensive conversion technology and slow commercial scale production. Despite this, the abundant supply of low-cost cellulosic plant material makes it an attractive feedstock. The 2008 farm bill energy title provided over $1 billion in incentives to support advanced biofuels, with the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) being a key program to kick start the sector. Despite federal support from programs like BCAP, the cellulosic ethanol sector has been slow to develop, with only small volumes produced commercially. Limited progress has led to EPA reducing support for the industry. Due to slow progress in cellulosic ethanol production, EPA has significantly reduced the cellulosic biofuel RFS mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2013. The EPA waiver of the mandates for four consecutive years, along with budget constraints and limitations on BCAP funding, has increased uncertainty for future investments in the sector. The Feedstock Production Interagency Working Group provided recommendations for federal research and development in biomass production, conversion, best management practices, logistics, and increasing feedstock production for biofuels. These recommendations were outlined in various reports by the Biomass Research Development Board between 2008 and 2011. The National Biofuels Action Plan and other federal government reports, including the impact of the Rural Energy for America Program and the Biobased Economy Indicators, provide valuable information on promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy. The U.S. Billion-Ton Update report also offers insights on biomass supply for a bioenergy and bioproducts industry. The USDA and U.S. EPA have published reports on renewable power opportunities, biofuels' effects on the economy, ethanol production, and the Renewable Fuel Standard Program. These reports provide valuable insights into the bioenergy and bioproducts industry. Several non-governmental reports have been published on topics such as the outlook for ethanol and conventional biofuel RINs, the reasons behind the conventional RIN price, renewable fuel standard waiver options during the 2012 drought, and the opportunities and challenges for renewable energy from biomass residuals. These reports offer valuable insights into the bioenergy and bioproducts industry. Several reports by Babcock from the International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development, FAPRI, and CARD analyze the impact of U.S. biofuels policies on agricultural price levels and volatility, ethanol blenders credit, ethanol subsidies on corn prices, and the need for mandates, tax credits, and tariffs in the biofuels industry. The U.S. biofuels industry's need for mandates, tax credits, and tariffs is analyzed in various reports by Babcock, FAPRI, and CARD. These reports examine the impact of biofuels policies on agricultural price levels, ethanol subsidies, and the industry's potential production capacity. The FAPRI-MU Report #06-08 from June 2008 discusses Farm Bill Provisions and other Biofuel Policy Options."
