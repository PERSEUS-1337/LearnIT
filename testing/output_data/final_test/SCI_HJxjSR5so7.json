    "content": "Training a model for domain adaptation involves adapting a model trained on data-rich source domains to perform well in data-poor target domains. CycleGAN is a framework that efficiently maps inputs between domains using adversarial training and cycle-consistency. A new approach proposed in this paper enforces cycle-consistency through an external task-specific model to preserve task-relevant content. The paper introduces a new approach for domain adaptation using an external task-specific model to preserve task-relevant content. This model relaxes cycle-consistency constraints and enhances the discriminator's role during training. Results show improved performance in speech recognition for female speakers and in low-resource visual domain adaptation. Domain adaptation BID14 BID31 BID1 aims to generalize a model from a source domain to a target domain by learning a mapping between domains using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs BID7) with cycle-consistency constraint. CycleGAN preserves the 'content' from the source domain while transferring the 'style' to match the target domain's distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness in various works BID32 BID20 BID10. Enforcing cycle-consistency in domain adaptation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been shown to effectively learn cross-domain mappings. However, when data are imbalanced across domains, the reconstruction error may lead to sub-optimal mappings. Learning a powerful discriminator becomes challenging when data from the target domain are scarce, resulting in mappings that may not require exact reconstruction for semantic preservation. The proposed augmented cyclic adversarial learning model (ACAL) for domain adaptation focuses on preserving 'semantic' information and matching 'style' distributions without requiring exact reconstruction. It replaces the reconstruction objective with a task-specific model to minimize loss and enhance modeling of the distribution in each domain. The task-specific model helps disentangle task-relevant information from 'style' information, improving mapping accuracy in imbalanced data scenarios. Our approach improves performance by 40% compared to the baseline on digit domain adaptation and by \u223c5% on the TIMIT dataset for speech adaptation between genders. It is related to domain adaptation using neural networks for supervised and unsupervised scenarios, focusing on minimizing distribution differences between domains when labels are available in the target domain. Our method enhances performance in domain adaptation by incorporating a domain classifier and leveraging attributes for fine-tuning the target model. Unlike other approaches, we use models from both domains to assist in adversarial learning. Our final model for supervised domain adaptation is trained on data from both the target and source domains. Recent works have utilized GAN framework for domain adaptation, but mostly focus on high-resource unsupervised scenarios. BID2 and BID29 propose different methods for domain adaptation using GANs and adversarial learning to match source and target domain representations. BID2 focuses on adapting data while training a classifier on both domains, while BID29 employs adversarial discriminative domain adaptation. CyCADA is a similar work that emphasizes cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation. Adversarial domain adaptation, like CyCADA, enforces cycle-consistency using task-specific models. The approach aims to augment limited target domain data by mapping source to target samples. An additional cycle starting from the target domain is included in this work to address low-resource target domains. The adaptation from source to low-resource target domain may fail due to difficulty in learning a good discriminator. Our model improves CycleGAN by enforcing content consistency and style adaptation through hidden representation learning. We utilize classification to assist GAN training, extending the idea to task-specific models like speech recognition to preserve task-specific information in the data. The definition of task model can be extended to unsupervised tasks like language or speech modeling in domains, using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to learn the true data distribution. CycleGAN extends this framework to multiple domains while learning to map samples. CycleGAN extends the GAN framework to multiple domains by mapping samples between them using adversarial learning. It introduces cycle-consistency to ensure invertibility of mappings. The model optimizes a combination of adversarial and reconstruction objectives to balance mapping functions. The adversarial objective in CycleGAN encourages mapping functions to generate samples close to the true distribution, while the reconstruction objective promotes identity mapping. Balancing these objectives works well with large training samples but may pose challenges in domain adaptation with sparse target domain data. Limited samples from the target domain make it difficult for the discriminator to model the actual distribution, leading to potential overfitting. Regularization in domain adaptation can lead to over-smoothing and under-fitting, causing weak sensitivity in probability outputs. Limited data in the target domain hinders meaningful cross-domain mappings as the discriminator's influence is restricted. The root issue lies in the strong emphasis on exact reconstruction and the reliance solely on the discriminator for mapping functions. To address issues in domain adaptation, a task-specific model enforces cycle-consistency and meaningful cross-domain mappings. The cycle-consistent objective uses task-specific loss to preserve semantic information in reverse mappings. This constraint is less strict than reconstruction, allowing for looser style consistency enforcement. The relaxed cycle-consistency objective in domain adaptation involves training task-specific models on data from different domains. The models are optimized using an adversarial objective to ensure consistency in mappings between domains. In unsupervised domain adaptation, task-specific models learn conditional probability distributions with assistance from the discriminator. The models capture information regarding the input data and target output, making learning the conditional model easier. This model helps in preserving useful information for predicting the output, mediating the influence of data not available to the discriminator. The proposed model uses adversarial learning with a source model to estimate the target conditional probability distribution. It can be extended to unsupervised domain adaptation and further to semi-supervised domain adaptation. The model is evaluated on domain adaptation for visual and speech recognition using various datasets. The model is evaluated on domain adaptation for visual and speech recognition using various datasets, including BID23, USPS, MNISTM, Synthetic Digits, and TIMIT dataset. Ablations are performed using SVHN as the source domain and MNIST as the target domain, with testing performance calculated on the full MNIST test set. The Modified LeNet model is used for domain adaptation from SVHN to MNIST, with testing on the full MNIST test set. Adversarial training is employed to match the distribution of adapted data, while preserving the content of the source domain data. The importance of the double cycle in learning the mapping between domains is also investigated. The study investigates the performance of one cycle only models for domain adaptation, denoted as (S\u2192T\u2192S)-One Cycle and (T\u2192S\u2192T)-One Cycle. The effectiveness of relaxed cycle-consistency and augmented adversarial loss is also tested by progressively adding these two losses to the models. The simple conditional model outperformed more complex cyclic models, possibly due to reduced complexity. The study compares the performance of cyclic models for domain adaptation, showing that single cycle models perform poorly with limited data. It is suggested that having cycles in both directions improves performance by learning both mappings via real examples. Relaxing the cycle-consistency constraint with task-specific losses reverses the trends observed. The study highlights the importance of task-specific losses in preserving cycle-consistency for domain adaptation. Augmenting the discriminator with task-specific loss improves adaptation performance significantly. Using a task-specific model enhances overall adaptation performance. In this section, experiments on domain adaptation for digit recognition are conducted. Different domains such as MNIST, USPS, MNISTM, SVHN, and Synthetic Digits are selected as targets. Two types of domain adaptation are performed, including low-resource supervised adaptation. Comparison with FADA (Motiian et al., 2017) is shown in TAB1. The proposed model is also applied to domain adaptation in speech recognition using the TIMIT dataset. The study shows that multi-discriminator training significantly impacts adaptation performance. In domain adaptation for speech recognition, the use of a multi-discriminator architecture for adversarial loss significantly improves performance. The adapted model shows comparable or better results than previous methods, especially in adapting male to female speech. With more data, the model outperforms the baseline by a noticeable margin. In this paper, augmented cycle-consistency adversarial learning is proposed for domain adaptation, introducing a task-specific model to facilitate learning domain mappings. Cycle-consistency is enforced using a task-specific loss instead of conventional reconstruction objectives. The task-specific model serves as additional information for the discriminator in the domain. Significant performance improvements are achieved in two domain adaptation tasks compared to the baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The method can be extended to unsupervised learning settings like speech modeling using wavenet BID30. Unsupervised tasks in domain adaptation include speech modeling with wavenet BID30 or language modeling with recurrent or transformer networks."
