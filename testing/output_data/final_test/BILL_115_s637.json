The \"Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2017\" mandates public disclosure of drug discounts, including PBMs' negotiation abilities and the amount of rebates passed to plan sponsors, to be available on the Department of Health and Human Services website starting January 1, 2018. The \"Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2017\" requires public disclosure of drug discounts without revealing specific details on rebates, discounts, and price concessions for individual drugs or plans. The amendments will be effective on January 1, 2018. The \"Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2017\" mandates minimum drug discounts to be passed through to the plan sponsor. The \"Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2017\" requires PBMs to pass through a minimum percentage of drug discounts to the plan sponsor starting January 1, 2020. The \"Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2017\" mandates PBMs to pass on a minimum percentage of drug discounts to the plan sponsor effective January 1, 2020. The Secretary will establish the minimum percent to ensure patients benefit from discounts while considering negotiation costs. PDP sponsors and MA organizations cannot contract with non-compliant PBMs. SEC. 4. PART D NEGOTIATED PRICES REQUIRED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL PRICE CONCESSIONS AT THE POINT-OF-SALE. Section 1860D-2(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act is amended to require negotiated prices for covered part D drugs to be provided at the point-of-sale, including all price concessions. The approximate negotiated price for covered part D drugs under the prescription drug plan or MA-PD plan shall be used if actual concessions cannot be calculated at the point-of-sale. The Secretary will ensure that this price reflects the estimated negotiated price based on previous negotiations. The negotiated price for covered part D drugs under the plan is based on previous year's concessions or other factors determined by the Secretary. This price allows for the use of value-based contracts between drug manufacturers, PDP sponsors, MA organizations, and pharmacies. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to plan years starting on or after January 1, 2019."
