    "content": "The Act titled as the \"Indian Tribal Development Consolidated Funding Act of 2000\" is established for the purpose of providing funding for Indian tribal development. Congress acknowledges the unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, as outlined in various legal documents. Despite significant federal funding, many Native Americans still face poverty and unemployment. The United States' efforts to support Native American communities have been hindered by fragmented authority and lack of coordination in decision-making and resources. The Act aims to enhance the effectiveness of Federal and tribal efforts in creating employment opportunities and economic growth in Native American communities through cooperative arrangements. It enables tribes to utilize Federal assistance more efficiently, target specific needs, and promote Federal-tribal partnerships for better outcomes. Indian tribes and tribal organizations can combine Federal and tribal resources for economic development projects, promote coordination of Native American economic programs, and establish a demonstration project to aid tribes in obtaining and administering Federal resources for self-governance and self-determination. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"applicant\" refers to an Indian tribe or tribal organization seeking assistance for various development projects. \"Assistance\" involves the transfer of value for public purposes authorized by US law and provided by the Federal Government through grants or contracts. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to assistance programs for Indian tribes, including \"assistance program,\" \"Indian tribe,\" \"project,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"tribal organization.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the eligibility and scope of federal assistance programs for tribes. The curr_chunk refers to the definition of a term in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Department of the Interior is the lead agency for implementing the Act, and participating tribes are selected accordingly. The Secretary may select up to 24 Indian tribes each fiscal year to participate in projects under the Act. Indian tribes can form consortia to participate as a single tribe. The applicant pool consists of tribes that have completed the planning phase, requested participation through official action, and demonstrated eligibility for 3 fiscal years. Each Indian tribe seeking to participate in a project under this Act must demonstrate financial stability and management capability by having no material audit exceptions in the required annual audit of self-determination contracts. The tribe must also complete a planning phase including legal and budgetary research, internal tribal government preparation, and organizational readiness to be eligible for a grant to plan and negotiate participation in the project. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY OF HEADS OF EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. The President, through executive agency heads, will create regulations to implement and enforce the Act. Covered agencies include Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Health, Housing, Interior, Labor, and EPA. Agency heads can collaborate on activities as needed. The executive agency heads, in agreement with another agency, can identify suitable federal programs for joint financing projects, assist in project planning, develop guidelines and application forms, review and modify administrative requirements, and establish common technical and administrative standards. The executive agency heads can establish common regulations and procedures for joint financing projects, including designating lead and managing agencies. They must also take appropriate actions and collaborate with other agencies to administer federal assistance programs. The executive agency heads can establish common regulations and procedures for joint financing projects with Indian tribes or tribal organizations using Federal assistance programs. SEC. 7. PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING REQUESTS FOR JOINT FINANCING. In processing applications for joint financing under this Act, the executive agency head must ensure expedited reviews, consider timing constraints, minimize interactions with federal representatives, promptly communicate decisions or issues, and not burden the applicant with unnecessary information requests. An applicant is not required to obtain information or assurances from one executive agency for another when the requesting agency can directly provide the information or assurances. SEC. 8. UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. The head of an executive agency may establish uniform regulations to simplify participation in projects by addressing inconsistent or conflicting requirements related to financial administration, payment timing, and provision of assistance. The head of an executive agency may simplify the processing of applications for assistance by grant rather than procurement contract and ensure accountability for records and property acquired with Federal assistance under a project. This may involve reviewing project proposals by a single panel, board, or committee to streamline the process. SEC. 9 allows the head of an executive agency to delegate supervision of projects jointly financed under the Act to another agency, ensuring compliance with Federal law. SEC. 10 addresses joint assistance funds and project facilitation. In accordance with the Act, executive agencies can establish joint assistance funds for projects to effectively administer funds from multiple Federal assistance programs. An agreement must be reached among the agencies involved to outline responsibilities, ensure information availability, and establish accountability for fund administration. Procedures for returning excess amounts must also be included. The curr_chunk discusses the procedures for returning an excess amount in a fund to participating executive agencies under the applicable appropriation. SEC. 11. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDITS. Recipients of funding under this Act must comply with chapter 75 of title 31, United States Code. They must maintain records for each project funded through a joint management fund, including details of assistance received, project costs, sources of funding, and other records for audit purposes. Records of a recipient receiving funding from a joint management fund under this Act must be made available for inspection and audit by the executive agency and the Comptroller General. SEC. 12. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PERSONNEL TRAINING.\n\nFunds for technical assistance and training in Federal assistance programs can be used for joint financing projects involving multiple assistance programs.\n\nSEC. 13. JOINT FINANCING FOR FEDERAL-TRIBAL ASSISTED PROJECTS.\n\nExecutive agencies can collaborate with States to extend benefits to projects involving both federal and tribal agencies.\n\nSEC. 14. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The President must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of enacting the Act, detailing the actions taken, evaluating its operation, and providing recommendations for its continuation or amendments. The report should also include information on the benefits and costs of jointly financed projects for participating Indian tribes and tribal organizations."
