    "content": "The organizations described in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as \"charitable organizations.\" They are organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition. These organizations cannot provide athletic facilities or equipment, must not benefit any private shareholder or individual, should not engage in propaganda or attempt to influence legislation, and must not participate in political campaigns. There are two types of 501(c)(3) organizations: public charities and private. 501(c)(3) organizations are divided into public charities and private foundations. Public charities receive contributions from various sources, while private foundations have limited sources and are often controlled by donors. Private foundations face stricter regulations due to abuse concerns. Examples of public charities include the Red Cross, churches, schools, hospitals, and more, while private foundations include the MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, and others. 501(c)(3) organizations are limited in lobbying and prohibited from political campaign activity. 501(c)(4) organizations, also known as social welfare organizations, are not limited in engaging in political campaign activity unlike 501(c)(3) organizations. Examples of 501(c)(4) organizations include the National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club. These organizations have some overlapping characteristics with 501(c)(3) organizations. 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations both operate for charitable purposes and are restricted from benefiting private individuals. The key differences are that 501(c)(3) organizations can receive tax-deductible contributions and have limitations on political activity, while 501(c)(4) organizations cannot receive tax-deductible contributions and have more freedom in political activities. Organizations must choose based on the importance of tax-deductible contributions or political activity. The organizations described in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(6) are trade associations such as business leagues, chambers of commerce, and professional football leagues. They are not organized for profit and do not benefit private shareholders. Examples include the Chamber of Commerce and the American Bar Association. On the other hand, organizations described in IRC \u00a7 527 are political organizations primarily focused on influencing elections. An exempt function under IRC \u00a7 527 includes influencing the selection or election of individuals to public office or political organizations. This encompasses various political committees, including candidate committees, political parties, and PACs. The term \"527 organization\" has been used to describe groups influencing federal elections, but the tax definition is broader. Qualifying for tax-exempt status can provide benefits from the federal government. Tax-exempt organizations, such as those described in IRC \u00a7\u00a7 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6), receive various benefits from the federal government, including tax exemptions. However, they may be taxed on income from unrelated business activities. Certain activities, such as political expenditures and excess lobbying, can subject 501(c) organizations to taxation. 527 political organizations are exempt from income tax if they only have exempt function income and engage in exempt function activities. Tax-exempt organizations receive benefits from the government but may be taxed on income from unrelated business activities. Exempt function income is crucial for 527 organizations to avoid taxation. Exemptions under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 501 and 527 do not cover employment taxes, except for certain exemptions for churches and organizations with low-wage employees. Additionally, exempt organizations generally pay federal unemployment tax, except for 501(c)(3) organizations. 501(c)(3) organizations are eligible for tax-deductible charitable contributions, determined by the IRS during the application process. Contributions to these organizations are not deductible if goods or services are provided in exchange. The excess amount beyond fair market value is not deductible. If a contribution to a 501(c)(3) organization exceeds the fair market value of goods or services provided, the excess amount may be tax-deductible. Donors must be informed if they receive more than $75 in exchange for goods or services. For contributions of $250 or more, donors need written acknowledgment from the organization, including a description of the contribution and a statement on whether anything was given in return. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires cash donations to be substantiated by a bank record or written communication from the organization. Contributors to 501(c)(3) organizations must receive written acknowledgment for contributions of $250 or more, with details of the donation and any goods or services received in return. Cash donations must be backed by bank records or written communication. Organizations must inform donors if their contribution is not tax-deductible, with exceptions for smaller organizations. Failure to comply may result in fines. Organizations failing to meet notification requirements may face fines of $1,000 per day, capped at $10,000 annually. Higher fines apply for intentional disregard. Tax-deductible dues for labor unions, trade associations, charitable, and social welfare organizations may be limited for lobbying purposes under IRC \u00a7 162(e). Tax-exempt organizations may qualify for non-tax benefits and federal grants, with some grants exclusive to organizations described in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3). Tax-exempt organizations, particularly those under IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3), may qualify for favorable mailing rates and beneficial treatment under federal laws. However, they may face restrictions on activities like lobbying and political campaign participation, along with annual reporting requirements and public disclosure obligations. 501(c)(3) organizations are the only type discussed in this report with limits on lobbying activity. They can only conduct a non-substantial amount of lobbying to maintain their exempt status and may face penalty taxes for excess lobbying. Other tax-exempt organizations can participate in lobbying as long as it aligns with their organizational definitions. Section 18 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act prohibits 501(c)(4) organizations from receiving federal grants if they engage in lobbying activities. Section 18 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act imposes registration and disclosure requirements on organizations with paid lobbyists exceeding certain limits. Except for 527 organizations, those discussed in the report are restricted by the Internal Revenue Code from political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition can result in loss of exempt status or penalties. An organization that violates the prohibition on political campaign activity may face penalties or loss of exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code. 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) organizations are allowed to engage in political campaign activity as long as it aligns with their exempt purpose. However, any 501(c) organization making an expenditure for an exempt function is subject to tax under IRC \u00a7 527(f). This tax is based on the organization's net investment income or the amount of the expenditure, at the highest corporate tax rate. This provision incentivizes organizations with substantial investment income to conduct campaign activities through a related 527 organization. The laws allow certain organizations under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) to engage in political campaign activity, while corporations and labor unions are banned from contributing to federal elections. This ban applies to both for-profit and tax-exempt corporations. Organizations may set up a 527 organization to navigate around these restrictions, but they must still comply with election laws. Exempt organizations often create affiliates or related entities to better fulfill their missions, such as labor unions having a 501(c)(3) scholarship fund and a 527 political action committee. Entities under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 501(c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) must apply for tax-exempt status, while 527 organizations only need to notify the IRS of their existence. Before applying for exempt status, organizations must establish themselves under state law as a nonprofit corporation. This process involves developing articles of incorporation. To establish tax-exempt status, nonprofit organizations must first form a nonprofit corporation by developing articles of incorporation and obtaining an EIN from the IRS. They can then apply for tax-exempt status by filing the appropriate forms with the IRS, such as Package 1023 for 501(c)(3) organizations. Failure to apply in a timely manner may result in the organization not being recognized as tax-exempt for the period between formation and IRS approval. Other types of organizations, such as churches and small organizations, may not need to apply for tax-exempt status. Nonprofit organizations file Package 1024 to establish tax-exempt status, with no specific deadline. Recognition of exempt status is retroactive to formation unless activities or charter have changed. Organizations must notify IRS of 527 status by filing Form 8871 within 24 hours, except for certain political organizations or those with anticipated gross receipts under $25,000. Tax-exempt organizations must report information to the IRS by filing information and tax returns. 501(c) and 527 organizations have similar reporting requirements, but 527 organizations must also report expenditures and contributions. Organizations under IRC \u00a7\u00a7 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), 501(c)(5), and 501(c)(6) must file various returns with the IRS, including information returns, income tax returns, and employment tax returns. They must also file an annual information return [Form 990 series], except for churches and certain small organizations. Tax-exempt organizations, including small organizations, must report information to the IRS such as sources of revenue, expenses, disbursements, and officer compensation. 501(c)(3) organizations must also report substantial contributors, lobbying expenditures, relationships with other organizations, and any taxes imposed for excess lobbying or political expenditures. 501(c)(4) organizations must provide information on excess benefit transactions. All 501(c) organizations conducting business activities unrelated to their exempt purpose must file Form 990-T. Additionally, organizations making expenditures for exempt functions must file Form 1120-POL, and those assessed penalty taxes must file Form 4720. Employment tax returns are also required for income tax withholding, social security, and medicare taxes. 527 organizations with gross receipts over $25,000 must file various tax returns. 527 organizations with gross receipts of at least $25,000 must file an annual information return (Form 990 series). They are not required to file Form 990 if they fall under certain exemptions. Form 990 includes revenue sources, expenses, and contributions over $5,000. Organizations with taxable income over $100 must file a tax return. 527 organizations with taxable income over $100 must file a tax return (Form 1120-POL) and employment tax returns. They also have to file periodic disclosures of contributions and expenditures with the IRS (Form 8872), which is an additional reporting requirement compared to 501(c) organizations. The requirements for reporting contributions and expenditures by state or local political organizations do not apply to expenditures that advocate for a candidate without their cooperation. Periodic reports must include contributor information for donations over $200 and expenditure details for recipients who received over $500 in a year. Contracts to spend or contribute are considered contributions or expenditures, and organizations can choose to file quarterly or monthly reports. Organizations must file Form 8872 electronically if annual contributions or expenditures exceed $50,000. Failure to file Form 990 incurs a penalty of $20 per day, up to $10,000 or 5% of gross receipts. For gross receipts over $1,000,000, the daily penalty is $100, up to $50,000. Late tax returns incur a penalty of 5% of tax due per month, up to 25%. If an organization fails to file Form 8872 or pay taxes on time, penalties apply. Late tax returns incur a penalty of 5% of tax due per month, up to 25%. Failure to pay taxes incurs a penalty of 0.5% of unpaid tax per month, up to 25%. Penalties can be avoided if failure is due to reasonable cause, but may increase for negligence or fraud. Organizations must also make estimated tax payments and handle employment taxes properly to avoid penalties. Under IRC \u00a7 6104, 501(c) organizations must make their Form 990 and exempt status materials available for public inspection. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added a requirement for 501(c)(3) organizations to disclose their Form 990-T. 527 organizations have similar disclosure requirements for Forms 990, 8871, and 8872. 501(c)(3) organizations disclose substantial contributors to the IRS on Form 990's Schedule B but not to the general public. 501(c) organizations must disclose Form 990 and exempt status materials to the public under IRC \u00a7 6104. 527 organizations have similar disclosure requirements for Forms 990, 8871, and 8872. Substantial contributors are disclosed to the IRS by 501(c)(3) organizations on Form 990's Schedule B but not to the general public. Public disclosure requirements include making forms and applications available for inspection at various offices and providing copies upon request, free of charge. The organization can charge for copying and mailing documents, must provide copies on the same day for in-person requests, and respond within 30 days for written requests. If documents are widely available, written requests may not require a response but must be available for inspection. Failure to comply results in a penalty of $20 per day, up to $10,000 for certain forms. Income and employment tax returns are generally not subject to public disclosure requirements. The IRS requires certain returns and applications to be publicly disclosed by organizations. This information can be obtained using Form 4506-A or through the IRS website. Forms 8871, 8872, and 990 for 527 organizations are also posted online by the IRS within 48 hours of filing."
