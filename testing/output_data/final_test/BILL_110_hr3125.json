    "content": "The Act titled \"Opt Out of Iraq War Act of 2007\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a new part allowing taxpayers to opt out of funding the Iraq war. Individuals can designate their income tax, gift tax, and estate tax payments to the Future Fund established by section 9511. The amount designated cannot exceed the Iraq war funding percentage of the payment made during a fiscal year. The Iraq war funding percentage, determined by the Comptroller of the United States, is the portion of the Federal budget spent on the war in Iraq during the preceding fiscal year. Certain spending, such as humanitarian aid and withdrawal costs, is not included in this calculation. The text discusses the exclusion of certain trust funds from the Federal budget and special rules related to income tax payments. It clarifies terms like income tax payment and income tax liability. The taxpayer's taxable income is reduced by allowable credits and designated amounts. Joint returns require both spouses to make the designation. Executors can designate estate tax payments. Designations can be made at the time of filing or later. Designations for Future Fund purposes can be made at the time of filing or later, as specified by the Secretary.
