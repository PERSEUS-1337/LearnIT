    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Chapter 6 of the Public Utilities Code mandates electrical or gas corporations and local publicly owned utilities to require recipients of rebates or incentives from energy efficiency programs to install demand response infrastructure. Additionally, Section 399.20 is amended to include these requirements. Section 399.20 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to encourage electrical generation from eligible renewable energy resources with specific criteria for electric generation facilities. An electrical corporation must submit a standard tariff for purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources. The commission has the authority to adjust requirements for smaller electrical corporations based on individual circumstances. The tariff for purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources shall include payment for every kilowatthour of electricity bought from an electric generation facility for 10, 15, or 20 years. The payment will be determined by the commission and cover environmental compliance costs. The commission will establish a methodology to determine the market price of electricity for different contract lengths. The commission may adjust payment rates based on the value of electricity products and ensure ratepayers are indifferent to service received under the tariff. An electrical corporation must offer fast interconnection procedures for a generation facility on a distribution circuit that offsets peak demand, as long as it doesn't harm the grid. The commission may set a value for such facilities. An electrical corporation must offer tariff to electric generation facilities upon request until meeting a statewide cap based on peak demand ratios. The commission shall direct electrical corporations to procure 250 megawatts of bioenergy projects by June 1, 2013, in addition to the 750 megawatts previously identified. Allocation will be based on peak demand ratios, with 110 megawatts for biogas projects and 90 megawatts for dairy and agricultural bioenergy. The commission directs electrical corporations to procure 250 megawatts of bioenergy projects by June 1, 2013, in addition to the previously identified 750 megawatts. Allocation is based on peak demand ratios, with 110 megawatts for biogas projects and 90 megawatts for dairy and agricultural bioenergy. For bioenergy from sustainable forest management byproducts, 50 megawatts will be allocated based on specific criteria. Electrical corporations are directed to develop standard contract terms and conditions reflecting project operational characteristics and to coordinate incentive programs with relevant agencies for maximum benefit to ratepayers. The commission may review and reallocate 250 additional megawatts for in-state biogas development. \"Bioenergy\" refers to biogas and biomass. The electrical corporation may offer a standard contract for bioenergy facilities, with electricity purchased counting towards renewable energy targets and resource adequacy requirements. The commission establishes performance standards for electric generation facilities over one megawatt to ensure expected electricity production and system reliability. The commission may adjust capacity limitations if needed for system reliability within an electrical corporation's service territory. An owner or operator of an electric generation facility that received ratepayer-funded incentives and participated in a net metering program before January 1, 2010, is eligible for a tariff or standard contract filed by an electrical corporation. The commission considers previous ratepayer-funded incentives when establishing tariffs for electric generation facilities. Reimbursement may be required for funds received from incentive programs to be eligible for a tariff. Customers under approved tariffs are not eligible for net metering programs. An owner or operator of an electric generation facility receiving service under an approved tariff or contract will continue until they no longer meet eligibility requirements or the service period established by the commission is completed. Within 10 days of receiving a tariff request from an electric generation facility owner or operator, the electrical corporation must post the request on its website, with certain proprietary information redacted. The corporation can deny the request if the facility doesn't meet requirements or if the grid for interconnection is inadequate. The electric generation facility must meet state and local laws, building standards, and utility interconnection requirements. If the aggregate of all facilities on a distribution circuit would impact utility operation, the owner can appeal a denial from the electrical corporation to the commission. To ensure safety and reliability, the owner of an electric generation facility receiving a tariff must provide an inspection and maintenance report every other year. The report must be prepared by a California-licensed contractor and include an inspection by a California-licensed electrician. The contract between the facility and the electrical corporation must ensure compliance with state and local laws, building standards, and utility interconnection requirements. All construction and installation of electrical facilities must be done by the electrical corporation. Interconnection facilities on the corporation's side of the transfer point and revenue metering equipment for electric generating facilities must also be owned and operated by the electrical corporation."
