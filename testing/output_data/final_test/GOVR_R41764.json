    "content": "One of the main congressional concerns in recent years has been the time-consuming nature of the budget process. The current process has been criticized as repetitive and inefficient, leading to interest in restructuring it for better efficiency. Despite the annual nature of the federal budget cycle, there is a need to maximize Congress's limited time for formulating, enacting, and executing the budget. The annual budget review allows Congress to influence funding and operations of programs, but many members are concerned about the high workload. Delays in budget legislation impact the overall process, leading to frustration and calls to streamline the process. Final action on appropriations typically occurs about 104 days after the fiscal year starts on October 1. The budget process has been criticized for being repetitive and inefficient, with debates on defense policy and funding levels being repeated multiple times each year. Critics suggest reforms such as automatic continuing resolutions or merging authorization and appropriations processes to streamline the process and promote efficiency. Advocates propose reforms like automatic continuing resolutions, joint budget resolutions, and merged authorization-appropriations processes to streamline the budget process and reduce legislative volume. Biennial budgeting is another approach to improve efficiency by changing the budget cycle from one year to two years. Biennial budgeting involves two-year budget resolutions, appropriations, and changes in legislation timing related to revenue and spending. Proposals may focus on enacting budgetary legislation for a two-year period or two succeeding one-year periods in a single measure. This concept requires executive branch planning and performance reviews to be based on a two-year cycle. The report provides background on options, issues, and previous congressional action related to biennial budgeting. Biennial budgeting proposals suggest two approaches: the stretch approach extends the budget process to two years for thorough consideration, while the split sessions approach divides budgetary and non-budgetary matters between sessions. Advocates argue each method encourages better oversight and planning. Biennial budgeting proposals can vary in levels of agency and program oversight, as well as the time frame for appropriations. This can include all appropriations enacted for a two-year period or for two succeeding one-year periods. The consideration of regular appropriations bills may also occur in stages over the biennium. Different approaches to biennial budgeting can have varying meanings for different individuals. This section provides an overview of options and selected issues related to two-year budget resolutions, appropriations acts, and potential changes in legislation timing associated with biennial budgeting. The budget process has revolved around the concurrent resolution on the budget since the Congressional Budget Act in 1974. Proposals for biennial budgeting have been considered, but the implications vary depending on the context and framework. The switch to a two-year cycle would involve coordinating budgetary actions over a longer period. The budget process typically revolves around an annual budget resolution, but there have been proposals to convert it to a two-year cycle. The Budget Act encourages Congress to plan beyond a single fiscal year, with requirements for binding figures for the upcoming year and planning levels for the following years. Budget resolutions have included planning levels for multiple years, and the Budget Act allows for enforcement of five-year totals for revenues and spending, as well as multi-year reconciliation instructions. The Senate's Pay-As-You-Go point of order prohibits legislation increasing on-budget deficit over six and eleven-year periods. The House's Cut-As-You-Go rule also restricts legislation increasing mandatory spending over the same periods. Congress may benefit from adopting fiscal policy outlines every two years to avoid annual fights over priorities. Congress has faced challenges in adopting budget resolutions for multiple fiscal years, leading to the suggestion of implementing a two-year budget resolution instead of an annual one. This change could help avoid frequent budgetary battles and provide more stability in fiscal policy setting. A biennial budget resolution could potentially bring uncertainty and weaken the budget process by eliminating the opportunity to alter current policy annually. It proposes a two-year cycle for appropriations, where all regular measures are considered in the first year of each Congress. Congress would not need to act on appropriations in the second year, except for emergencies. Proposals for a biennial budget cycle aim to extend the duration to 20 months, allowing more time for negotiations between Congress and the President. This would eliminate the need for appropriations in the off-year, except for emergencies. Advocates argue that a biennial budget would reduce congressional workload and provide additional time for oversight. Advocates propose a biennial budget cycle to extend the duration to 20 months, reducing the need for appropriations in the off-year. This could allow for more time for oversight and non-budgetary legislation consideration. Making certain budget practices mandatory for all programs could lead to more timely appropriations enactment. The proposal for a biennial budget cycle aims to streamline the appropriations process by extending the duration to 20 months. This could potentially reduce delays caused by routine appropriations and allow for more oversight and non-budgetary legislation consideration. However, mandating certain budget practices for all programs may not significantly improve the process, especially if unforeseen and contentious issues are the main cause of delays. The proposal for a biennial budget cycle aims to streamline the appropriations process by extending the duration to 20 months. This could reduce delays caused by routine appropriations and allow for more oversight and non-budgetary legislation consideration. Biennial budget proposals may address the timing of various legislation types within the biennial budgeting time frame. Many proposals require authorizations to be enacted for at least two fiscal years. The proposal for a biennial budget cycle aims to streamline the appropriations process by extending the duration to 20 months. This could reduce delays caused by routine appropriations and allow for more oversight and non-budgetary legislation consideration. Most proposals require authorizations to be enacted for at least two fiscal years, with exceptions for the Department of Defense and Intelligence authorizations. The impact of a multi-year authorization requirement on other policy issues is unclear, but one benefit could be a smoother working relationship between authorizers and appropriators. The proposal for a biennial budget cycle aims to streamline the appropriations process by extending the duration to 20 months. While the requirement for multi-year authorizations within biennial budgeting would only affect some programs, it could have major repercussions for specific issue areas like Defense and Intelligence authorizations. An attempt to experiment with two-year authorizations for the Department of Defense in the 1980s proved unsuccessful due to various factors. The budget summit between Congress and President Reagan led to extensive amendments in the second year of the two-year authorization, causing support for two-year defense authorizations to decline. The proposed split session approach aims to clarify the separation between authorizations and appropriations, but there are concerns about potential erosion of this separation. Members may resort to using appropriations bills for policy questions if authorizing legislation is not considered in the first year of a Congress. The split session approach aims to separate authorizations and appropriations, with concerns about potential erosion of this separation. Members may use appropriations bills for policy questions if authorizing legislation is not considered in the first year of a Congress. The extent of supplemental appropriations availability during the biennium depends on the type of budgeting enacted and allowed appropriations under a particular framework. Stretch models may limit the time frame for adjusting appropriations decisions. Reconciliation instructions in a biennial budget resolution aim to align revenue and spending laws with budget policies. This process typically occurs once every two years unless rules are modified. Some argue that this limits the flexibility of enacting reconciliation legislation, potentially impacting biennial budgeting. Some observers suggest a split session approach for biennial budgeting, limiting revenue or spending legislation to the first year of Congress. Arguments for and against biennial budgeting are drawn from congressional hearings, governmental committees, and scholarly articles analyzing budget process reform proposals. These arguments are not exhaustive but highlight key reasons for supporting or opposing biennial budgeting. Supporters of biennial budgeting argue that a two-year budget cycle would reduce congressional workload, allow for improved oversight and program review, and enable better long-term planning by agencies at various levels. This proposal has been debated for the past 30 years, with advocates suggesting that it would free up more congressional time for oversight activities. A two-year budget cycle could reduce competition for Congress members' time, improve oversight, and allow for better policy establishment. It may also lead to more effective management of federal programs and increase certainty in future funding levels for better long-term planning. The Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush Administrations have all supported biennial budgeting, as noted in various reports and budget submissions. Biennial budgeting would save time, improve efficiency, and provide more stable funding for government agencies. Supporters of biennial budgeting argue that it would provide more stable funding for government agencies and promote longer-range planning. They point to past budget summit agreements as evidence of its efficacy. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential drawbacks of this approach. Critics of biennial budgeting argue that reducing the frequency of budget considerations may increase conflict and delays. Accurate budget projections are crucial due to the significant impact of even small errors in the multi-trillion-dollar budget. Projecting revenues and expenditures for a two-year cycle requires forecasting up to 30 months in advance, which could lead to inaccurate budget projections. Critics argue that biennial budgeting may result in providing either too much or too little money for programs, leading to the need for budget revisions or supplemental appropriations. Critics also highlight the limited ability to anticipate future conditions under a two-year cycle. Critics argue that a two-year budget cycle could lead to challenges in making budget adjustments, loss of oversight through annual appropriations review, and varying institutional incentives based on budget outcomes. Critics argue that locking in future budgetary resources may face opposition from decision makers who believe a better decision can be made later. Some opponents believe that lessons from successful executive-congressional summits are limited and cannot be institutionalized. Some critics believe that institutionalizing the budget process may not be feasible without the political and budgetary context that brings Congress and the President to the bargaining table regularly. State practices, such as biennial budget cycles in 19 states, are often referenced in discussions on federal budget reform, but there is no clear consensus on the effectiveness of biennial budgeting based on state experiences. For example, Missouri enacts its operating budget annually but its capital budget biennially. Some states enact their operating budget annually and capital budget biennially, while others combine both budgets on a biennial cycle. States like Virginia and Oregon amend their biennial budget during the session, showing flexibility. There is a debate on adopting a two-year budget cycle at the federal level, with opponents pointing out a trend towards annual budget cycles in states with larger populations. The shift towards annual budget cycles in states with larger populations has led to a decrease in the use of biennial budgeting. Some states have switched back to biennial cycles after brief experiments with annual budgets, while others have adopted biennial budgeting after using an annual cycle for an extended period. Opponents of biennial budgeting argue that it could increase the President's authority. The shift towards annual budget cycles in states with larger populations has led to a decrease in the use of biennial budgeting. Both annual and biennial budget cycles at the state level have varying degrees of executive branch discretion and authority. The tension between longer planning horizons and budget projection accuracy remains unsolved in state budgeting due to the system of funding stability and incremental budget changes. Since the Congressional Budget Act in 1974, biennial budgeting has been a topic of interest in Congress, with discussions and hearings on the subject. Survey findings and cosponsorship of biennial budgeting proposals indicate congressional interest in the idea. Various federal committees and commissions have also considered biennial budgeting as a possible procedural change. Various federal committees and commissions have recommended biennial budgeting as a possible procedural reform to Congress. In 1993, proposals for a two-year budget cycle were included in recommendations to the Senate and House. House jurisdiction over budget process reform has been shared by the Committee on Rules and the Committee on the Budget, both considering biennial budgeting. In the Senate, jurisdiction over the budget process was shared by the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Committee on the Budget. The budget process was jointly shared by the Senate committees on Governmental Affairs and the Budget, with jurisdiction now held by the Senate Budget Committee. Various actions related to biennial budgeting were taken in different Congresses, but none were enacted. In the 112th Congress, a hearing was held on the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act of 2011, with no further action. In the 113th Congress, the Senate considered biennial budgeting. In the 113th Congress, the Senate adopted an amendment to create a deficit neutral reserve fund for a biennial budget and appropriations process.
