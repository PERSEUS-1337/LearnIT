    "content": "The \"Return on Investment Accountability Act\" is cited as the short title. It introduces a new section for payor state credit amount for individuals in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Return on Investment Accountability Act\" introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It allows taxpayers a credit against the tax imposed for each eligible individual, based on the payor State amount. The individual payor State amount is determined by the ratio of eligible individuals in the State for the previous calendar year. The Secretary calculates the Federal tax burden and outlays for each State annually based on taxes paid by eligible individuals. The Federal tax burden on a state is determined by the economic activity of legal business entities within that state. Federal outlays are calculated based on performance under Federal contracts in each state. Eligible individuals are defined as per the regulations. The term 'eligible individual' refers to the taxpayer, their spouse, or dependent who is a US citizen or lawfully present in the US, and a resident of the payor State for over half of the taxable year. This definition excludes individuals for whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer in the same calendar year. The credit allowed by subsection (a) shall be treated as allowed by subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amount of credit allowable under this section shall be reduced by refunds and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer under subsection (e). Each eligible individual for a calendar year is treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for that year. The advance refund amount is the credit that would have been allowed for the taxable year in which the calendar year begins. No interest is allowed on any overpayment attributable to this section. No credit allowed for individuals without valid identification numbers, specifically social security numbers issued by the Social Security Administration. Administrative amendments include the definition of deficiency in tax returns. The tax code is amended to include omissions of information required under section 6428(f) on returns. Additionally, section 1324(b) of title 31 is updated to include section 6428. The amendments made by this section, including the Payor State credit amount for individuals, will apply to taxable years beginning after one year from the enactment of this Act."
