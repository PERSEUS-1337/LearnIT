    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) administers programs to support small businesses, including venture capital and loan guaranty programs. These programs aim to provide capital and credit to small businesses with potential for job growth and economic impact. Small businesses often struggle to obtain loans due to their young age and limited credit history, making access to capital programs crucial for their success. Some suggest fixing the market failure in lending to small firms with innovative products through government programs. Congressional interest in SBA's access to capital programs has increased to enhance job creation and economic growth. Advocates propose providing additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital, while others advocate for business tax reduction and financial credit market regulation reform. Economists argue against federal assistance to small businesses for job creation, advocating instead for business tax reduction and financial credit market regulation reform. They believe jobs primarily depend on factors like population and demographics, with increased federal spending potentially creating short-term jobs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created or retained 785,955 jobs, addressing concerns about small businesses accessing capital during the economic crisis. Small businesses are crucial for job creation, but faced challenges due to limited access to capital. During the 111th Congress, laws were enacted to improve small business access to capital, including additional funding for the SBA and the establishment of the Small Business Lending Fund. During the 111th Congress, laws were enacted to improve small business access to capital, including funding for community banks, State Small Business Credit Initiative, changes to SBA programs, fee subsidies, and tax relief. P.L. 111-322 extended fee subsidies and 7(a) program's loan guaranty percentage until March 4, 2011. During the 112th Congress, efforts to enhance small business access to capital through the SBA, including extending fee subsidies and increasing the 7(a) program's loan guaranty percentage to 90%, were not adopted. Instead, legislation was passed to improve small business contracting opportunities, expand access to the SBA's surety bond guarantee program, amend size standard practices, review federal procurement small business goals, and expand mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. The SBA helped provide over $42 billion to small businesses through the Recovery Act and Jobs Act. During the 113th Congress, legislation increased the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) venture capital program's authorization amount to $4 billion. In the 114th Congress, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 waived the SBAExpress loan program's upfront fee for veterans and increased the 7(a) loan program's authorization limit to $23.5 billion. During the 114th Congress, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, expanded the projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC loan guaranty program and increased the SBIC program's family of funds limit to $350 million. The 7(a) loan program's authorization limit was also increased to $26.5 billion for FY2016. Subsequent acts in the 115th Congress further increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $27.5 billion for FY2017 and $27.5 billion for FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $29.0 billion for FY2018. This report discusses small business access to capital, job creation, supply and demand for small business loans, and recent laws to enhance access to capital. It also explores legislative options for the 116th Congress, including wait-and-see, enacting additional programs, or reducing existing programs. The Federal Reserve Board surveys senior loan officers quarterly on their bank's lending practices, including credit standards for small business loans. Responses indicate if standards have tightened or eased, providing insight into the market's supply of small business credit. Since 2007, senior loan officers have generally tightened small business loan credit standards, with some improvement since 2009 and slight tightening in 2016. The survey also assesses demand for small business loans, with responses indicating changes in demand levels. The demand for small business loans has fluctuated over the years, with a decline in 2007-2009, leveling off in 2010, and increasing from 2012-2015. Since then, demand has varied, increasing in some quarters and declining in others. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reports on small business lending data quarterly, showing the amount of outstanding small business loans. The amount of outstanding small business loans for non-agricultural purposes has fluctuated over the years, increasing steadily from 2006 to 2008, declining in the following years, and then increasing again since 2013. Changes in small business outstanding debt can signal difficulties in accessing capital for job growth. Selected financial statistics for the SBA from FY2005 to FY2018 are provided in Table 1, showing the extent of the SBA's programs to enhance small business access to capital. The SBA's programs aim to enhance small business access to capital. The first column shows total face value of non-disaster business loans disbursed from FY2005 to FY2018. The second column indicates approved non-disaster business loans. 7% to 10% of approved loans are typically canceled. The third column reports the contract value of bonds guaranteed under the SBA's surety bond guarantee program. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program helps small businesses by providing and managing surety bond guarantees. The program reduces the risk of contracting with small businesses without credit history or experience. The SBA reimburses participating sureties for losses due to contractor defaults on bonds. The outstanding principal balance of loans not charged off provides a measure of the SBA's lending scope. The SBA's lending scope declined in FY2008 and FY2009 but has generally exceeded pre-recession levels since FY2011. Factors contributing to the decline included reluctance from lending institutions, increased loan defaults, and a contracting secondary market for small business loans. About half of SBA guaranteed loans are resold by lenders for additional funds. In 2009, small business loans guaranteed by the SBA declined early in the year but saw modest increases in the second and third quarters. The number and amount briefly surpassed pre-recession levels in the fourth quarter due to fee subsidies and loan enhancements. The SBA's loan volume increased in FY2010 due to fee subsidies and loan enhancements from ARRA. The average weekly loan volume was 29% higher than FY2009. Demand for SBA loans surged in FY2011 as borrowers took advantage of expiring fee subsidies. The SBA approved nearly 22,000 small business loans totaling $10.47 billion in the first quarter of FY2011. During the first quarter of FY2011, SBA lending reached a record high of $12.16 billion. After fee subsidies ended, lending declined in the second quarter but increased in the final two quarters. Non-disaster small business loans have remained at or above pre-recession levels since FY2011. Laws enacted during the 110th and 111th Congresses aimed to improve small business access to capital in response to the financial credit market contraction starting in 2008. P.L. 110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to enhance loan supply for businesses. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was authorized to restore liquidity and stability to the US financial system by purchasing troubled assets. TARP's purchase authority was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Department of the Treasury disbursed $389 billion in TARP funds, including $337 million for SBA loan guaranty program securities. New TARP commitments expired in 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included provisions to enhance small business loans, such as establishing a temporary secondary market guarantee authority for SBA loans. The SBA was granted emergency rulemaking authority to issue regulations for the 504/CDC program loans within 15 days after enactment. Delays were experienced due to limited staff resources, but the program became operational in June 2010. The program was scheduled to end on February 16, 2011, or until $3 billion in new pools are created. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 extended the program and authorized the SBA to make below market interest rate direct loans to SBA-designated broker-dealers. The SBA established the Direct Loan Program for Systemically Important Secondary Market Broker-Dealers in 2009 to purchase SBA-guaranteed loans and sell them to investors. Delays in implementing the program were due to determining the extent of sharing potential losses. The program provided $255 million for a temporary small business stabilization program, later named the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program. The America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program ceased issuing new loan guarantees on September 30, 2010. The SBA's surety bond program received $15 million, with a temporary increase in maximum bond amount to $5 million. The SBA's Microloan program received $6 million for lending and $24 million for technical assistance. The funds available to SBA-licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) were increased to 300% of the company's private capital or $150,000,000. P.L. 111-240 authorized the SBA to guarantee 504/CDC loans for refinancing business expansion projects. P.L. 111-240 included provisions to enhance small business loans, such as the $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund and $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative. It also extended the SBA's guarantee authority and authorized a Small Business Intermediary Lending Pilot Program with $22.5 million in funding. The SBA announced a Pilot Program for direct loans to intermediaries serving small businesses. Funding was increased for the 7(a) loan guaranty program and loan guarantee limits were raised. The Microloan program's loan limit was also increased. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the SBA 7(a) Express Program's loan limit and established an online lending platform. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) created a regulatory structure for startups to raise capital through crowdfunding. The JOBS Act's crowdfunding provisions aim to help startups and small businesses raise capital through low dollar offerings of securities. The SEC implemented rules in 2016 to regulate crowdfunding, including limits on fundraising amounts and disclosure requirements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the annual authorization amount for the SBA's Small Business Investment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, increased the annual authorization amount for the SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program to $4 billion from $3 billion. The SBIC program provides equity capital to small businesses through loans and securities purchases to stimulate private equity capital flow. In FY2013, the SBA committed to guarantee $2.15 billion in SBIC small business investments, with an additional $1.34 billion from private capital, totaling almost $3.5 billion in financing for 1,068 small businesses. The SBA's commitment increased in subsequent years, reaching $2.52 billion in FY2018. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 also increased the supply of 7(a) loans. The authorization limit for 7(a) loans was increased to $23.5 billion in FY2015 and further to $26.5 billion in FY2016 to meet the increased demand. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 also expanded the 504/CDC loans by allowing refinancing for eligible projects without credit subsidy costs. Additionally, the act increased the supply of SBIC financings by raising the family of funds limit. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and 2018 increased the 7(a) program's authorization limit to $27.5 billion for FY2017 and $29.0 billion for FY2018 respectively. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $375 million to subsidize fees for SBA's loan guaranty programs and increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage. The ARRA provided funding to increase demand for SBA loans by reducing loan costs. Congress passed multiple laws to extend fee subsidies and a 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage, ensuring continued support through various dates in 2010. The ARRA provided funding to increase demand for SBA loans by reducing loan costs. Congress passed laws to extend fee subsidies and a 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through various dates in 2010, with funding exhausted by January 3, 2011. The ARRA included 11 tax relief provisions benefiting small businesses in various industries. Tax relief may lead to increased demand for small business loans as owners have more resources. Five provisions provided $5.7 billion in relief for small businesses, including extending the enhanced expensing allowance and allowing businesses with $15 million or less in annual gross receipts to carry back net operating losses for up to five years. The ARRA included tax relief provisions for small businesses, such as increased deduction limits for eligible assets, higher exclusion for gains on small business stock sales, and reduced recognition period for corporate tax on appreciated assets. Individuals with income from small businesses could base estimated tax payments on previous year's liability. $505 million was allocated to subsidize SBA loans and increase the maximum loan amount. The ARRA included tax relief provisions for small businesses and allocated $505 million to subsidize SBA loans. P.L. 111-240 temporarily subsidized SBA's fees, increased the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90%, and established alternative size standards for the SBA's loan guaranty programs. It aimed to increase the demand for small business loans by expanding eligibility for SBA assistance and provided small businesses with about $12 billion in tax relief. The ARRA provided small businesses with $12 billion in tax relief, including raising the exclusion of gains on qualified small business stock to 100%, increasing deductions for start-up expenditures, and allowing general business credits to be carried back five years. It also placed limitations on penalties for failure to disclose reportable transactions and allowed for a temporary reduction in the recognition period for built-in gains tax.

It also allowed for temporary reductions in penalties and recognition periods. Additionally, P.L. 114-38 made permanent the waiver of the loan guaranty fee for veteran loans under the SBAExpress program to encourage veterans to apply for small business loans. Congressional interest in the SBA's access to capital programs has increased in recent years. Congressional interest in the SBA's access to capital programs has grown due to the belief that helping small businesses access capital can boost job creation and economic growth. Some argue for increased resources for the SBA to aid small businesses in obtaining necessary capital, while others are concerned about the economic impact of programs that raise the federal deficit. Surveys show that small business owners rank financing issues low among their concerns. Advocates suggest small business tax cuts, financial credit market regulation reform, and federal fiscal restraint as better ways to support small businesses and promote growth. During the 111th and 112th Congress, bills were introduced to create a temporary SBA direct lending program for small businesses. H.R. 3854 and H.R. 3007 aimed to provide direct loans to small businesses with certain criteria. During the 113th Congress, various bills were introduced to authorize the SBA to provide direct loans to small businesses with specific criteria, such as annual revenues or number of employees. H.R. 5835 focused on veteran-owned businesses, while H.R. 2451 targeted small businesses with fewer than 20 employees, limiting each loan to $150,000 with a term of six years or less. The SBA has authority to make direct loans for disaster relief and business purposes. Direct business loan eligibility was limited in 1984, 1994, and 1996 to reduce costs. Until October 1, 1985, direct business loans were provided to qualified small businesses. From October 1, 1985, to September 30, 1994, eligibility was limited to qualified small businesses owned by individuals. The SBA limited business loan eligibility to qualified small businesses owned by individuals with low income or in high unemployment areas, Vietnam-era or disabled veterans, the handicapped, certain organizations employing them, or under the minority small business capital ownership development program. Direct loan eligibility was further restricted in 1994 and 1996. Funding for loans to the handicapped ended in 1996, with the last loan issued in FY1998. Currently, SBA offers direct business loans only to Microloan program intermediaries. Advocates argue for a temporary SBA direct lending program during economic downturns to provide rapid access to capital for small businesses. Opponents believe the SBA should guarantee loans, not compete with private lenders by providing direct loans. Opponents argue against the SBA providing direct loans to small businesses, citing concerns about increased risk, potential for higher fees, historical corruption issues, and the SBA's lack of capacity for direct lending. They suggest that the SBA should focus on guaranteeing loans instead of competing with the private sector. Some argue that the SBA lacks resources for direct loans and that its guaranteed loan programs are a small fraction of small business lending. They believe the private banking system is more significant in financing loans, making the SBA's role in the capital market largely irrelevant. Others advocate for increased funding to help small businesses access capital, while some worry about the long-term economic impact of spending programs. Some advocate for increased funding to help small businesses access capital, while others worry about the long-term economic impact of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. Recent SBA budget discussions in Congress have focused on reducing the SBA's budget without compromising its ability to assist small businesses and individuals cope with natural disasters. SBA's appropriations have varied significantly since FY2005, with peaks and lows due to disaster assistance and business loan credit subsidies. The Small Business Administration's appropriations have fluctuated significantly since FY2005, with peaks and lows due to disaster assistance and business loan credit subsidies. Recent increases in appropriations were seen in FY2009 and FY2010 to enhance small businesses' access to capital following the Great Recession. Appropriations are separated into four categories, including disaster assistance and other programs, to make comparisons over time more meaningful. For example, the SBA's appropriation nearly doubled from $1.337 billion in FY2017 to $2.360 billion in FY2018. The SBA's FY2018 appropriation of $2.360 billion was nearly double its FY2017 appropriation of $1.337 billion, with most of the increase attributed to supplemental funding for disaster assistance. The allocation included funding for various programs such as business loan credit subsidies, salaries and expenses, entrepreneurial development programs, administrative expenses, and more. Congress made changes during the 111th Congress to improve small business access to capital. During the 111th Congress, changes were approved to enhance small business access to capital. This included authorizing a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative Program. Various modifications were made to SBA programs to make them more accessible, such as increasing loan amounts and expanding refinancing options. Additionally, funding was provided to extend SBA fee subsidies and increase small business contracting opportunities. During the 112th Congress, legislation was passed to increase small business contracting opportunities and provide $12 billion in tax relief. Congress also approved a temporary reduction in payroll taxes for workers paying into Social Security. The NFIB advocated for a reduction in federal payroll taxes to reduce small business expenses. Additionally, legislation was passed to expand access to the SBA's surety bond guarantee program, amend size standards, review federal procurement goals, expand mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, and establish a regulatory structure for startups to raise capital through crowdfunding. During the 113th and 114th Congresses, legislation increased the SBA's SBIC program authorization to $4 billion, waived upfront fees for veteran loans, expanded eligible projects for the 504/CDC loan guarantee program, and raised the SBIC program's family of funds limit to $350 million. The 116th Congress must consider further actions to enhance small business access to capital, with options including a wait-and-see strategy focusing on oversight. Congress could adopt a wait-and-see strategy to oversee recent programmatic changes to the SBA's programs before taking further action to improve small business access to capital. Alternatively, Congress could consider additional changes like a direct lending program and increased funding for SBA fee subsidies and loans. Advocates suggest options like a direct lending program, increased funding for SBA fee subsidies, and modifying the Microloan program to improve small business access to capital and stimulate job growth. Congress could also consider repealing parts of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 or defunding certain SBA programs to streamline resources. The House Committee on Small Business recommended reducing funding for various SBA programs in its views and estimates letter for the FY2013 budget. This includes cutting funding for programs like 7(j) technical assistance, Women's Business Centers, Veterans Business Centers, and others. Advocates argue for alternative funding approaches instead of increasing federal funding for the SBA. Advocates suggest focusing on small business tax reduction and federal fiscal restraint instead of increasing federal funding for the SBA to support small businesses and promote economic growth and job creation."
