It also promoted the adoption of electronic health records and established a federal panel for comparative effectiveness research. The report discusses how the funds are being allocated and obligated by HHS agencies. The ARRA funds are available for obligation through FY2010. Health-related programs receive funding through regular appropriations acts. HHS appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010 were included in specific legislation. Tables summarize ARRA's discretionary health funding and distribution by HHS agency and office. The ARRA funds are distributed by HHS agency and office. Tables provide details on ARRA health funding and obligation of funds for FY2009 and FY2010. OMB issued guidance for transparency in ARRA fund use, with Recovery.gov allowing public tracking of spending. ARRA requires agencies to post specific information related to funding, including initial implementation plans and reports on obligations, expenditures, and unobligated balances. Recipients must submit quarterly reports detailing funds received, expenditures, and project details, including job creation and retention estimates. ARRA requires grantees to submit information on funding, job retention, and project details. It allocated funds for health and human services programs, including $100 million for senior nutrition and $5.15 billion for child care and development. The Secretary refers to the HHS Secretary. ARRA provided $2 billion to HRSA for grants to health centers under section 330 of the PHS Act. $1.5 billion is for construction, renovation, and HIT systems, while $500 million is for operating grants to increase healthcare access.

The ARRA provided $500 million to HRSA for health workforce programs, including the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and health professions education. NHSC offers scholarships and loan repayments for healthcare providers in shortage areas. Some funds may be used for telemedicine initiatives. The NHSC program received $135 million for FY2009 and $142 million for FY2010, with 80% of funds for scholarships and loan repayments. Title VII and Title VIII programs provide grants, scholarships, and loans to healthcare students and professionals. $200 million from ARRA was allocated for health workforce programs, with $148.4 million for NHSC. In FY2009 and FY2010, the NHSC program received $135 million and $142 million respectively, with 80% of funds for scholarships and loan repayments. Title VII and Title VIII programs provide grants, scholarships, and loans to healthcare students and professionals. $200 million from ARRA was allocated for health workforce programs, with $148.4 million targeting medical and dental professionals in primary care, nurses, disadvantaged students, and others. Additionally, $50 million is for equipment grants, and $1.5 million for interstate licensure agreements promoting telemedicine. The law provided $10.0 billion to the Office of the Director for broad support of NIH scientific research, with $8.2 billion transferred to NIH institutes and centers. $1 billion was allocated to the National Centers for Research Resources for construction and renovation of university research facilities, and $300 million for shared instrumentation and capital research equipment. The NIH received $30.3 billion in regular FY2009 appropriations and $30.9 billion in FY2010 appropriations, with an additional $8.2 billion in ARRA research funding. The ARRA funds are being used for competitive grant programs to stimulate the economy and create jobs, with $1 billion allocated for NCRR construction and renovation grants for extramural research facilities. The NIH received $30.3 billion in regular FY2009 appropriations and $30.9 billion in FY2010 appropriations, with an additional $8.2 billion in ARRA research funding. The $1 billion for NCRR construction and renovation grants for extramural research facilities is part of the ARRA funds, which are being used for competitive grant programs to stimulate the economy and create jobs. NIH activities with ARRA funding are being tracked on the NIH Recovery website, focusing on funding new research grant applications, giving supplemental awards to current grants, and supporting the NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science. President Obama announced nearly $5 billion in ARRA funding awarded by NIH in FY2009, supporting over 12,000 grants for research institutions nationwide. The funding included initiatives like NIH Challenge Grants and Research Infrastructure \"Grand Opportunities\" grants, with a focus on areas like cancer, heart disease, and autism research. The NIH released over $1 billion in research funding from the Human Genome Project in FY2009, including $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER) under ARRA. This funding aims to support research comparing clinical outcomes and promoting the use of electronic health data for generating outcomes data. AHRQ received $300 million for CER activities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER), with $300 million allocated to AHRQ, $400 million transferred to NIH, and $400 million at the Secretary's discretion. AHRQ can use up to 1% of its funding for additional FTEs. This funding represents a significant increase in federal research funding for CER. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER), with $300 million for AHRQ, $400 million for NIH, and $400 million at the Secretary's discretion. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report in 2009 identifying 100 high-priority areas for CER, including topics related to health care delivery, patient decision making, and utilization of medical procedures. The IOM emphasized the need for a robust CER infrastructure to sustain research efforts in the future. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research (CER) and established an interagency advisory panel to coordinate and support CER. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research was tasked with submitting annual reports on current federal CER activities and infrastructure needs, with a focus on future research priorities. The council's recommendations emphasized the importance of CER without mandating coverage, reimbursement, or treatment policies for public and private payers of healthcare. The initial report on June 30, 2009, focused on disseminating CER findings to doctors and patients, targeting priority populations, researching high-impact health arenas, and implementing three plans for ARRA-funded CER. NIH obligated almost half of its ARRA funds for CER in FY2009, with the remainder to be obligated in FY2010, while AHRQ and the Secretary will award almost all ARRA funds for CER in FY2010. In FY2010, AHRQ will award CER funds as per the Secretary's discretion. ARRA allocated $2 billion to ONC for HITECH Act activities, including $300 million for health information exchange networks and $20 million for HIT standards analysis at NIST. ONC's implementation plan for ARRA responsibilities can be found on the HHS Recovery Plans website. ONC also received $61 million in regular appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010. The HITECH Act received $61 million in regular appropriations in both FY2009 and FY2010. It aims to promote HIT adoption for electronic data sharing among healthcare providers. The Act codified ONC within the HHS Secretary's Office to oversee HIT activities and ensure interoperability, privacy, and security of electronic health information. The HITECH Act aims to promote HIT adoption for electronic data sharing among healthcare providers. It established grant programs for HIT infrastructure, authorized incentive payments under Medicare and Medicaid for using certified EHRs to improve healthcare quality and coordination. The HITECH Act incentivizes healthcare providers to adopt certified EHR technology to improve quality of care. It includes financial penalties for non-compliance, federal match payments for Medicaid providers, and enhanced privacy and security provisions under HIPAA. The HITECH Act incentivizes healthcare providers to adopt certified EHR technology with financial penalties for non-compliance and federal match payments for Medicaid providers. $2 billion in supplemental funding was allocated for HIT grant programs, with $693 million for the Health IT Extension Program to support Regional Extension Centers offering technical assistance for EHR adoption. The ONC announced awards to create 32 RECs for primary care providers in underserved areas, with plans for a second round of awards. A national HITRC will be established to promote collaboration and best practices in EHR adoption. $564 million is allocated for states and SDEs to facilitate HIE through EHR systems. Legal, financial, and technical support is crucial for statewide HIE. The State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program will fund state-level efforts for HIE establishment. The State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program funds state-level efforts to establish governance, policies, and network services for connectivity among providers. States and SDEs must match grant awards. $386 million was awarded to 34 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and US territories in the first cycle, with $162 million awarded to the remaining 16 states in the second cycle. $120 million is set aside for the Health IT Workforce Development Program. The funds will be used to award grants under four separate programs. The Community College Consortia Program will provide approximately $70 million to create or expand HIT training programs at about 70 community colleges. The Curriculum Development Centers Program will provide approximately $10 million to develop curriculum. The ONC has allocated $235 million for various programs to enhance workforce training in HIT. This includes agreements with non-profit institutions for curriculum development, a Competency Examination Program, and a University-Based Training Program. The Beacon Community Program will receive $220 million to strengthen HIT infrastructure in the US. The ONC has allocated $235 million for workforce training in HIT, including agreements with non-profit institutions for curriculum development. $220 million will be provided in cooperative agreements to support electronic HIE infrastructure, with $15 million for technical assistance and program evaluation. $60 million is allocated for the SHARP Program to fund research in key areas to address barriers to HIT adoption. The ARRA provided $1 billion for Prevention and Wellness Fund activities, including immunization grants, reducing healthcare-associated infections, and funding prevention programs for chronic diseases. $300 million was allocated for immunization grants to public health departments. The ARRA allocated $200 million to grantee specified amounts, $50 million for program operation grants to deliver vaccines and strengthen immunization programs, $18 million for innovation grants to increase vaccination rates, and $32 million for immunization information and education. Additionally, $50 million was designated to reduce healthcare-associated infections, with $40 million going to CDC for hospital infection control grants and $10 million to CMS for oversight in ambulatory surgical centers. The ARRA allocated $40 million to CDC for onsite reviews of ASCs to ensure Medicare standards are met, and for HAI prevention activities in states and territories. This funding aimed to support HHS HAI action plan implementation, enhance HAI surveillance, train public health staff, and complement other HAI investments. The Administration has highlighted that ARRA-funded CMS and CDC activities align with a national strategy to reduce HAIs. Congress provided funding for HAI prevention in FY2009 and FY2010, with additional funding requested for FY2011. The majority of the $650 million ARRA funds for prevention programs are managed by CDC, focusing on evidence-based strategies for chronic disease prevention. The ARRA funding focuses on chronic disease prevention goals such as increasing physical activity, improving nutrition, reducing obesity and smoking rates. Funds must be obligated in FY2010 as per the law. HHS did not allocate funds for similar activities in regular appropriations for FY2011. CDC's annual chronic disease prevention appropriations differ from ARRA funding as they are disease-specific. The ARRA funding targets disease risk factors like behavioral or lifestyle-based issues, not specific diseases. Health reform proposals aim to provide baseline funding for prevention and wellness activities. CDC requests new appropriations language to address leading causes of death. ARRA provided $500 million for Indian Health Service activities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received $227 million for health care facilities construction, $100 million for maintenance and improvement, $68 million for sanitation facilities construction, and $20 million for equipment. Additionally, $85 million was allocated for HIT activities, including telehealth services. IHS has obligated over 65% of these funds as of January 29, 2010, with the remaining to be obligated by the end of FY2010. Comparisons with regular IHS appropriations for the same activities are shown in Table 4. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received $227 million for health care facilities construction, with funds obligated for projects in Alaska and South Dakota. Approximately $150 million had been obligated by January 29, 2010, creating an estimated 95 jobs. Funds for maintenance, sanitation facilities construction, and medical equipment were also allocated for FY2009 and FY2010. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received $227 million for health care facilities construction, with funds obligated for projects in Alaska and South Dakota. Approximately $150 million had been obligated by January 29, 2010, creating an estimated 95 jobs. The table includes information on project completion dates, job estimates, and HIT funds allocation for existing management and EHR software, telehealth infrastructure, and hardware. IHS allocated $61.4 million for EHR development, $2.45 million for personal health record development, $16.96 million for telehealth and network infrastructure, and $4.0 million for administration. $53.55 million of HIT funds were obligated by January 29, 2010, with the rest to be obligated by the end of FY2010. IHS received appropriations under ARRA's Title VII for Interior and Environment, exempting health facilities funds from spending caps and prevailing wage rate requirements. The ARRA report language for Title VII allowed agencies covered by the title to expend up to 5% of ARRA funds for administrative and support costs. Oversight of IHS activities under ARRA was to be included in the general oversight of HHS's ARRA activities funded under Title VIII. Information on IHS's ARRA expenditures, by project category, is available on the HHS Recovery website. For more details on IHS appropriations in FY2009 and FY2010, refer to CRS Report R40685.
