    "content": "New sources of crude oil from the Bakken region of North Dakota, the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in Texas, and western Canada have led to new routes for shipping crude oil to U.S. and Canadian refineries. While pipelines are the traditional method for transporting crude, rail and waterborne transportation are increasingly used due to capacity limitations. Barge and tanker shipments have significantly increased, with the quantity of oil moving by barge on the Mississippi River growing ten-fold from 2009 to 2013. Tanker shipments between the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Canada have also seen rapid growth. The increase in crude oil shipments by barge or tanker to Gulf Coast refineries has been significant since 2012. Refineries in the Northeast are mainly equipped to handle Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian crudes, while those on the Gulf and West Coasts have more flexibility. Refinery reconfiguration to process different types of crude is possible but costly, depending on relative costs, availability, and price spreads. The shift towards domestic crude sourcing has influenced shipping patterns. The shift towards domestic crude sourcing raises concerns about the safety and efficiency of the maritime supply chain, particularly regarding the Coast Guard's role in preventing oil spills and the impact of the Jones Act on U.S. producers' shipping decisions. Most U.S. refineries are located along the coast and may lack pipeline connections to receive domestic crude. Large amounts of oil are being moved out of production areas by truck or rail, then transferred to barges or tanker ships for the last leg of the trip to a refinery. Crude oil produced at Eagle Ford, TX, is conveniently located for waterborne transport due to its proximity to the coast, with most of it moving through the port of Corpus Christi. The nearby port of Victoria, TX, has also seen a significant increase in crude oil barge traffic. Texas crude primarily goes to coastal refineries in Texas and Louisiana or to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). Some Eagle Ford crude oil moves by water to refineries near New York Harbor and the Delaware River. Oil from the Bakken region is transported to refineries by rail and water. Intermodal routes include rail to barge transfers at various locations for transport to Gulf, East Coast, and West Coast refineries. Pipeline to barge transfer also occurs at Cushing, OK, for transport to Gulf Coast refineries. New waterborne services move crude oil from the Bakken or Texas to Gulf Coast refineries using smaller vessels than trans-oceanic tankers. The fleet includes \"brownwater\" vessels for inland and near-shore waters and \"bluewater\" vessels for the open ocean. River barges can hold 10,000 to 30,000 barrels, with speeds of 4 to 5 mph. Coastal tank barges (ATBs) can hold 50,000 to 185,000 barrels, with newer ones carrying up to 340,000 barrels. Seagoing barges can carry 240,000 to 340,000 barrels, comparable to coastal tankers. River barges can be used in \"drop and swap\" operations, unlike tank ships. Coastal tank ships hold 300,000 to 650,000 barrels, with speeds of 12-15 knots. Tankers moving Alaska oil carry between. The Jones Act-eligible fleet of crude oil tankers consists of 11 ships, all employed in moving Alaska crude oil to the U.S. West Coast or to a refinery in Alaska. Seagoing barges can carry more than 130,000 barrels, while river barges can be used in \"drop and swap\" operations. Tankers moving Alaska oil carry between 800,000 and 1.3 million barrels of oil. The limited fleet of Jones Act-eligible tankers has led some refineries with direct ocean access to ship domestic oil by barge or train, or to rely on foreign sources. Tank vessels do not readily alternate between carrying dirty oil and refined petroleum products due to the extensive washing required. However, with the increase in domestic crude oil production, some tankers have shifted from carrying clean products to crude oil. The Gulf Coast to Florida (via the Port of Tampa) is now using barges to move refined products, leading to higher gasoline prices in Florida. The decline in oil imports from overseas may free up lightering fleet for domestic crude trade. West Coast refineries sourcing more crude from Bakken or Canada could also free up Jones Act tankers. The crude oil boom has increased U.S. refinery output, creating strong demand for clean product tankers. The most economic tank vessel size depends on voyage distance. The most economic tank vessel size depends largely on voyage distance. VLCCs were first built when the Suez Canal was closed in the late 1960s, leading to longer routes around South Africa. Larger tankers have disadvantages in port, while smaller vessels are used for shorter voyages. Aframax and Suezmax tankers are used for shipping oil over medium distances. The most economic tank vessel size depends largely on voyage distance, with Aframax or Suezmax tankers being preferred for shipments from Texas ports to Delaware River and New York Harbor oil terminals, a distance of 1,900 to 2,000 nautical miles. Handysize tankers currently used may be smaller than the preferred size, with average haul distances of 1,000 nautical miles for handysize tankers and 1,700 nautical miles for Aframax and Suezmax tankers. ATBs are used for shorter coastal voyages, with an average haul distance of about 420 nautical miles. In 2010, newer ATBs are larger and faster, deployed on longer voyages. Coastal tank barges less than 10 years old accounted for majority of shipments over 500 miles. Domestic waterborne shipment of crude oil and refined products is increasing, prompting Coast Guard to reevaluate regulations and industry oversight. Barges are crucial for moving Bakken and Texas oil by water, with Coast Guard establishing safety inspection regime. The Coast Guard was directed by Congress to establish a barge safety inspection regime similar to that for ships, including structural and crew standards. This regime is more significant for river tank barges than seagoing ones. The Coast Guard was also authorized to evaluate crew hours-of-service limits for towing vessels, in line with a 1999 NTSB recommendation. The Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on barge inspections and work hours, highlighting the accumulation of sleep debt and fatigue levels on multi-day voyages. ATB operators and maritime unions have differing views on mandatory rest periods, with the NTSB supporting an eight-hour rest period. Final regulations have not been issued yet. The American coastwise shipping business is dominated by tugs and barges due to high costs. The Coast Guard's pending decision on hours of service could force ATBs to carry larger crews, possibly negating their economic advantage compared to tankers. This occurred previously with a precursor to the ATB called the integrated tug barge: when the Coast Guard increased their manning requirements in 1981, integrated tug barges lost their economic edge. The Coast Guard increased manning requirements in 1981, causing integrated tug barges to lose their economic advantage. Since then, no integrated tug barges have been built. The crewing requirements for ships and ATBs have been criticized for distorting the domestic shipping market. Congress has expressed concerns about the pace of barge safety regulations under the 2004 law. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, Congress mandated rulemakings for oil pollution prevention and barge inspection to be finalized within 18 months. The act also required additional regulations to reduce oil spill risks in oil transfer operations. The Coast Guard's ability to oversee maritime operations effectively has been a concern due to staff rotation practices hindering technical expertise development. The Coast Guard made changes to increase civilian safety positions and develop a career path for inspectors. Towing operators criticized the emphasis on yearly inspections over human factors. The lack of thorough investigations and a \"near-miss\" reporting system was noted by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General. The USCG lacks processes to investigate and enforce regulations related to marine accidents, leading to delays in identifying causes, taking corrective actions, and sharing lessons learned. Insufficient personnel, resources, and training contribute to these shortcomings, potentially hindering the development of new safety standards. The Coast Guard lacks qualified accident inspectors and investigators, with two-thirds not meeting qualification standards. A shortage of personnel is expected to worsen with new towing vessel safety regulations. Congress requested an annual report on the adequacy of the marine safety workforce. The Jones Act mandates U.S.-built, crewed, and owned vessels for cargo transport between U.S. points. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built vessels for cargo transport to support the national defense and commerce. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built vessels for cargo transport to support national defense and commerce. Jones Act ships must be capable of serving as naval and military auxiliaries, owned and operated by U.S. citizens, composed of the best-equipped vessels, and manned with trained personnel. These ships tend to be more costly to build and operate compared to foreign-flag ocean carriers due to restrictions on shipbuilding and crewing. Oil shippers report higher costs for moving crude oil on Jones Act tankers compared to foreign carriers. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built vessels for cargo transport, resulting in higher costs for moving crude oil on Jones Act tankers compared to foreign carriers. Shipping rates from the Gulf Coast to the U.S. Northeast on Jones Act tankers are $5 to $6 per barrel, while moving it to eastern Canada on foreign-flag tankers is $2. This rate difference leads to more Gulf Coast crude oil being shipped to Canada than to U.S. Northeast refineries. Refineries in the U.S. Northeast consume more crude oil from fields offshore of eastern Canada than from the Gulf Coast, as well as imports from other countries at lower shipping rates. The cost of shipping Gulf Coast oil to eastern Canada is higher due to the use of ice-class tankers. Shipping Bakken oil from Washington or Oregon to California refineries via Jones Act tankers is estimated at $4 to $5 per barrel. Eagle Ford oil shipping through the Panama Canal costs $10 per barrel. Comparatively, shipping oil from Ecuador to West Coast refineries costs $3.25 per barrel, and Iraqi oil costs $2.30 per barrel. Jones Act rates for shipping Alaska oil to West Coast refineries are not available. Alaska oil producers may resume exports to Asia to replace lost shipments to the U.S. West Coast, following Congress' requirement for U.S.-crewed and -flagged tankers. After the export ban was lifted in 1995, 5%-7% of Alaskan oil was exported to South Korea, Japan, and China. Coastal refineries base the price they are willing to pay on the international oil price, favoring barges over ships to minimize transportation costs. The decline in domestic oil transportation by tankers is evident in the reduced capacity of the Jones Act-eligible tanker fleet, with many being replaced by tank barges. Factors contributing to this decline include the shift to larger foreign-built tankers post-World War II, the double-hull requirement for tank vessels in 1990, and the decrease in oil production in Alaska. The cost of domestically built crude oil tankers is approximately four times higher than tankers built in foreign shipyards, with Asian shipyards dominating the market. U.S. shipyards' prices are higher despite major ship components being built overseas. Tank ships are more expensive to build than ATBs, but the purchase price of new river tugs and barges in the United States is not as prohibitive. Tank ships are more expensive to build than ATBs but have advantages such as operating in adverse weather conditions, being faster, and having superior fuel economy. Moving crude oil by tanker from the Gulf Coast to Northeast refineries is estimated to be about half the cost of moving it by barge. U.S.-flag ships face a 50% duty on non-emergency repairs in foreign shipyards. The 2011 MARAD study compared ship repair costs for U.S.-flag and foreign-flag ships in international trade, finding U.S.-flag ships' costs to be 1.3 times higher. Despite a 50% duty on repairs in foreign shipyards, many U.S. ships opt for foreign repairs due to lower total costs. Another study in 2011 showed U.S.-flag vessels' operating costs in international trade were 2.7 times higher, with daily operating costs for foreign-flag ships estimated to be under $6,000. A MARAD study in June 2012 found that U.S.-flag vessels cost more to operate due to being crewed by U.S. citizens, with daily operating costs for a Jones Act tanker at $22,000 compared to $13,000 for an ATB. ATBs may require additional sailing time but offer cost savings over tankers, especially for shorter voyages. The high operating costs of Jones Act tankers make them less competitive for international cargo, leading to empty travel miles and increased costs for shipowners. Improving economic competitiveness involves reducing empty travel miles and ensuring price competitiveness for Jones Act product tankers. Jones Act product tankers face high operating costs, leading to empty travel miles and reduced competitiveness in the international market. To overcome this, a triangular trade route has been developed to circumvent Jones Act requirements, involving shipping gasoline from Gulf Coast refineries to the Bahamas. The Jones Act restricts U.S. oil shippers from taking advantage of the surplus in the world tanker fleet. To bypass this, a triangular trade route is used, where gasoline is shipped from Gulf Coast refineries to the Bahamas for processing before being sent to the U.S. Northeast. Foreign-flag tankers are used for both water movements to save costs. Some shippers prefer chartering over long-term commitments like building pipelines or rail terminals due to the flexibility it offers in the rapidly changing U.S. oil market. The Jones Act restricts U.S. oil shippers, leading to high charter rates for Jones Act-qualified tankers. In the spot market, charter rates for tankers of similar size are lower, providing flexibility and cost savings for oil companies. The Jones Act restricts U.S. oil shippers, leading to high charter rates for Jones Act-qualified tankers. By pooling tanker supply in the spot market, the fleet is used more efficiently. Tank vessels and pipelines were the primary options for moving oil before shale deposits. Pipelines have a transportation cost advantage over vessels due to economies of scale. Oil companies typically share use of a large pipeline. Pipelines have advantages such as cost efficiency and dependability in delivering products on time. They face challenges in acquiring rights of way and maintaining infrastructure. Despite a decrease in pipeline mileage, capacity has increased due to larger pipes. Tankers have a speed advantage over pipelines, which can be crucial during volatile oil prices. The shift from tankers to barges in coastwise transport has led to a significant increase in the use of smaller vessels. In 2012, barges accounted for 82% of the total cargo capacity, carrying about 65% of the coastwise refined product tonnage. This shift is driven by regulations rather than cost efficiency, resulting in a divergence in economies of scale between pipeline and waterborne modes. The modal share of pipelines and waterborne carriers for crude oil and refined products has shifted significantly over the years. In 1979, pipelines handled 58% of crude oil shipments and 44% of refined products, while waterborne carriers handled 41% of crude oil and 48% of refined products. By 2009, pipelines were carrying 80% of crude oil shipments and 63% of refined products, compared to waterborne carriers handling 19% and 26% respectively. Tanker ships are now primarily used in domestic trade where there is no pipeline service, such as crude oil shipments from Alaska to the lower 48 states and gasoline shipments from the Gulf Coast to Florida. Pipelines are preferred over river transport for moving Gulf Coast crude oil north to the Upper. Pipelines are heavily used to transport Gulf Coast crude oil north to the Upper Midwest, moving about 30 million barrels a month. Barges have less than 10% market share for refined products between the Gulf Coast and Upper Midwest. Phillips 66 uses rail, vessels, and coastal transport to supply its Bayway refinery in New Jersey with crude oil from Eagle Ford, Bakken oil, and imported oil from West Africa. Rail and coastal transport compete in supplying crude oil to coastal refineries. Coastal refineries rely on vessels, especially tankers, for moving crude oil due to their superior economics. Tankers can transport the equivalent of multiple unit trains of oil, providing a significant supply to refineries. Rail terminals are being developed to match refinery delivery needs, but challenges remain in loading/unloading efficiently. In contrast, coastal refineries already have the infrastructure to receive vessels, making them a preferred mode of transportation. Tankers are a cheaper option than rail for transporting crude oil to refineries due to existing infrastructure and federal support for navigation channels. Coastal refineries like Bayway use waterborne transport as a supplement to rail due to limited availability of Jones Act-eligible tankers. Phillips 66 would transport 100,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast oil to Bayway if eligible tankers were available. In 2013, an average of 22,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast oil was shipped. In 2013, an average of 22,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast oil was shipped to all seven U.S. Northeast refineries. Bayway refinery receives 50,000 barrels per day by rail and is completing a rail terminal with capacity for 75,000 barrels per day. Eagle Ford crude oil is not currently shipped to California refineries, but estimated shipping costs are $14.50 per barrel by rail and $10 per barrel through the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal route is cheaper than rail and moving Bakken oil to California refineries via the Pacific Northwest. After the completion of the expansion project in 2015, tankers with a capacity of 600,000 barrels could pass through the canal, doubling the size of current tankers. This could potentially lower the cost of ocean transport, especially if Jones Act-eligible vessels of that size are available. Tankers may play a role in transporting Bakken oil to East or West Coast refineries, although the route would be longer compared to rail. Bakken oil is currently transported to Gulf Coast terminals for refining, and tankers could then transport the oil to East or West Coast refineries. However, existing rail and pipeline connections to Great Lakes ports may not make moving Bakken oil to Northeast refineries economically feasible. The Jones Act hinders economically feasible routing options for Midwest oil exports. Higher domestic shipping rates push sales to foreign buyers, similar to Texas oil. The U.S. lumber industry faced similar challenges in the past. Oregon and Washington export forest products by water, while the East Coast imports them. Eagle Ford and Bakken oil producers could benefit from accessing foreign-flag tankers at lower international rates. Oil producers could benefit from accessing foreign-flag tankers at lower international rates for oil shipments, potentially shifting from rail to water transport. Congress is concerned about the safety of shipping crude oil by rail due to inadequate tank car designs and the risk of fires and explosions. Railroads have increased inspections and reduced speeds of unit trains carrying crude oil to improve safety. Recent incidents have highlighted the risk of derailed tank cars puncturing and releasing oil even at lower speeds. Concerns persist regarding the capability and resources of local responders to crude-by-rail incidents. In contrast, tankers have double hulls and emergency response equipment in place to mitigate spills. The Coast Guard regulates tanker transits through harbors, with states imposing additional safeguards. While environmental damage from spills remains a concern, tanker incidents generally do not require evacuations of towns and cities. reliance on railroads to move crude oil has caused disruptions in the rail system, affecting passengers and freight shippers. The number of crude oil rail car loadings has significantly increased from 2008 to 2013, with expectations to move even more tank cars in 2014. This has led to delays for other shippers in the Upper Midwest, with Amtrak having to cancel trains and substitute bus service due to rail congestion. Local rail backups can have nationwide service ramifications. Some railroads are installing new track to address the issue. The executive branch has the authority to waive the Jones Act \"in the interest of national defense.\" In 2011, the Act was waived to move 25 million barrels of SPR crude oil on foreign-flag tankers to refineries. One delivery was made in a Jones Act vessel. The Act has been temporarily waived after disruptions. The Jones Act has been temporarily waived after disruptions to oil supply routes in the Gulf and Northeast due to natural disasters. Foreign-flagged tankers transported millions of barrels of refined products during past waivers. Limited capacity exists in U.S. shipyards to build tankers, with several petroleum tankers and ATBs on order for delivery before 2016. Some tankers are planned to replace Alaska tankers for crude oil transport. Tanker ships built in US shipyards by General Dynamics NASSCO and Aker Philadelphia Shipyard have specialized equipment for carrying refined products without contamination. NASSCO can build four large vessels per year, while Aker can build three. Recent ATBs have been constructed by various shipyards across the country. NASSCO partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Aker with Hyundai Mipo Dockyards for design and engineering support. NASSCO and Aker Philadelphia Shipyard have specialized equipment for building tanker ships in the US. Shipyard unions have opposed agreements with Korean shipbuilders due to imported components. Coast Guard regulations define a U.S. built vessel based on hull and superstructure fabrication. The federal government provides financial assistance to domestic shipyards through the \"Title XI\" program. The \"Title XI\" program provides government-backed loan guarantees for U.S.-built vessels and shipyard modernization. In FY2014, Congress allocated $38 million for the program. The House passed bill H.R. 4745 would rescind $29 million, while the Senate reported bill S. 2438 provides $7 million. MARAD had $73 million available for new guarantees as of April 2014, covering approximately $735 million of loans and a current portfolio of outstanding loan guarantees totaling $1.7 billion. The Title XI program provides loan guarantees for U.S.-built vessels and shipyard modernization, with a current portfolio totaling $1.7 billion. The program has faced controversy due to defaults by large loan recipients. Congress created a grant program for small shipyards in 2006, offering up to 75% of facility improvement costs. About $10-$15 million annually has been allocated for this program. MARAD administers the Capital Construction Fund program, allowing U.S.-flag operators to defer taxes on income used to purchase or reconstruct U.S. built ships. Congress is debating crude oil exports, while domestic natural gas producers seek federal export permits. Current law does not require exports to be carried in U.S.-flagged ships. During the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 markup, amendments were proposed to require LNG exports to be transported in U.S.-crewed and eventually U.S.-built tankers. However, these amendments were withdrawn in favor of a Government Accountability Office study on maritime employment. Additionally, amendments to a House-passed energy bill sought to mandate LNG exports in U.S.-flag tankers and prioritize export terminal projects using U.S.-flag vessels. Amendments to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2015 aimed to tie federal approval of LNG export terminals to the use of U.S.-flag tankers, but were defeated. The debate over whether U.S.-flag tankers should be used for energy trade has been ongoing in Congress. In 2006, Congress prioritized licenses for offshore LNG import terminals supplied by U.S.-flag tankers for national security reasons. LNG shippers argued that restricting trade routes to certain flag vessels would hinder supply under short-term contracts. In the 1970s, the Energy Transportation Security Act aimed to require U.S.-flag tankers to carry 30% of imported oil, but was pocket-vetoed. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in response to the oil supply crisis, with half of the oil shipped by vessel mandated to be transported by U.S.-flag tankers. In 1977, a modified version of the ETSA requiring 9.5% of imported oil to be carried in U.S.-flag tankers was passed by the House but defeated in a recorded vote. The House passed a bill by voice vote, but it was later defeated in a recorded vote. Supporters cited national security and boosting domestic shipbuilding, while opponents mentioned costs and potential retaliation. The Senate did not take up the measure. At a 2014 industry symposium, participants suggested requiring a certain amount of LNG exports to be carried in U.S.-flag or U.S.-built ships. At a 2014 industry symposium, participants discussed additional requirements for U.S.-flag or U.S.-built ships. The focus was on addressing the decline in cargoes, with little mention of efficiency improvements to lower shipping costs. Several bills in Congress address safety and commercial issues in waterborne transportation of oil. The Coast Guard is directed to submit a national maritime strategy to enhance U.S.-flag vessels' competitiveness in international trade and increase their use for imports, exports, and domestic commerce. S. 2444, the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016, includes requirements for reporting marine casualties and responding to oil spills. H.R. 2838 and S. 1483 propose changes to oil spill response plans and exemptions for certain tankers from the Jones Act. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 emphasizes the importance of the Jones Act in supporting the domestic maritime industry for national security and economic vitality."
