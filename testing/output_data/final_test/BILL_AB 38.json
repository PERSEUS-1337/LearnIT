    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the challenges in managing mental illness within the healthcare system, especially for the insured population. There are significant differences in delivery systems for Medi-Cal and private insurance recipients, requiring immediate attention to better serve those with mental health needs. The challenges in managing mental illness within the healthcare system for insured individuals include limited providers, lack of treatment facilities, and difficulties in coordinating ancillary services. Developing accessible provider networks that integrate with ancillary services will require significant time and resources. Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) programs offer integrated care with early intervention, assessment, diagnosis, treatment plans, and outpatient coordination by interdisciplinary teams. The Legislature intends to provide funding for EDAPT programs to enhance health benefit plan coverage and offer patients necessary services. This includes adding a new section to the Welfare and Institutions Code for the EDAPT Funding Pilot Program. The Early Diagnosis and Preventive Treatment (EDAPT) Program Fund is established within the State Treasury to receive private funds for providing reimbursement to EDAPT programs when the fund reaches $1,200,000. Funds distributed under this part cannot be used for services covered by private health plans, only to enhance coverage. The \"EDAPT program\" provides early intervention and necessary services for severe mental illness and emotional disturbance. The Regents of the University of California must report to the Legislature on the effectiveness of the early psychosis approach in reducing untreated psychosis, improving symptoms, and reducing costs compared to standard treatment. The Regents of the University of California must report on the number of patients served by an EDAPT program with private health benefit plans, their stabilization rate, additional services needed, and any other relevant information. If federal funds are received for the program, a report must be issued to the Legislature as required by law. The report required by the University of California Regents for an EDAPT program must comply with Government Code Section 9795. This part will be in effect until January 1, 2023, unless extended or deleted by a later statute enacted before that date."
