    "content": "The \"Health Care Access Improvement Act\" establishes a nonrefundable credit for primary health service providers in health professional shortage areas under section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Health Care Access Improvement Act\" provides a nonrefundable tax credit for qualified primary health services providers in health professional shortage areas. The credit amount is calculated based on the number of months in a mandatory service period, up to a maximum of 60 months, multiplied by $1,000. A qualified primary health services provider is defined as any physician serving during a mandatory service period. A qualified primary health services provider, as defined by the \"Health Care Access Improvement Act,\" is a physician certified by the Bureau to provide full-time primary health services to individuals, with at least 80% residing in a health professional shortage area. They must not be receiving certain scholarships or loan repayments, fulfilling service obligations, or have defaulted on obligations during the mandatory service period. The term 'mandatory service period' refers to a 60-month period for qualified primary health services providers. Definitions include the Bureau of Health Care Delivery, physician, and primary health services provider. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of 'primary health services provider' and 'health professional shortage area' as per the Public Health Service Act. It also explains the recapture of credit in case of a recapture event during a taxable year. The curr_chunk explains the applicable recapture percentage for taxpayers under this section for prior taxable years. The curr_chunk outlines the recapture percentages based on the timing of the recapture event, starting from 100% in months 1-24 and decreasing to 0% after month 61. A recapture event is defined as the failure of certain conditions. The term 'recapture event' refers to the taxpayer not being a qualified primary health services provider during a mandatory service period. The cessation of designation of an area as a shortage area does not trigger a recapture event, and the Secretary can waive events due to extraordinary circumstances. Any tax increase under this provision does not count towards tax credits. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended. Section 25B provides primary health services in health professional shortage areas. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1997."
