    "content": "The Supreme Court in Rodriguez rejected the challenge to Texas' public school financing system, ruling that it did not violate equal protection or interfere with a fundamental right to education. The system, based on local property taxes, was deemed valid under equal protection jurisprudence. The Rodriguez Court concluded that the Texas financing system did not discriminate based on wealth or interfere with a fundamental right to education, as there was no impermissible classification or discrimination against a suspect class. The Constitution did not guarantee a right to education explicitly or implicitly, and the system did not result in inadequate education that would hinder exercising other fundamental rights. This determination was crucial in establishing the system's validity. The Rodriguez Court upheld the Texas school funding system under rational basis review, finding it related to the state's interest in local control over education and taxation. This decision closed off federal constitutional claims for school finance issues, leading to an increase in state constitutional lawsuits on education finance. The shift from federal to state law in education finance litigation focused on equity and adequacy. Litigants argued for equal funding among school districts based on state constitutions. Serrano v. Priest exemplified equity-based claims in education finance. The Supreme Court of California ruled that the state's public school finance system violated the equal protection provisions in the California constitution due to discrimination based on district wealth. Despite initial success with equity-based litigation, achieving equal educational opportunity through fiscal neutrality proved challenging. By the mid-1980s, there was a shift in court decisions, with plaintiffs winning only two cases in the early '80s. As of 1988, plaintiffs in school financing cases faced challenges as 15 State Supreme Courts denied relief, compared to seven states where plaintiffs prevailed. Implementation difficulties in equalizing funding among districts led to a shift towards adequacy-based claims. State courts began considering arguments on educational adequacy alongside equal protection in education finance cases. Some plaintiffs shifted towards arguing that inadequate funding levels violated state constitutional provisions guaranteeing an adequate education, rather than equal protection. State courts began considering educational adequacy claims alongside equal protection in education finance cases. In a significant adequacy case, the Supreme Court of Kentucky found the state's education financing system inadequate and unconstitutional, requiring every child to have an equal opportunity for an adequate education. State education finance litigation typically involves adequacy-based claims, with 45 out of 50 states having been involved in such lawsuits. Adequacy has become a predominant theme in recent court decisions, providing judicially manageable standards for effective remedies."
