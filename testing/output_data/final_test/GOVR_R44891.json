    "content": "The report highlights the potential historic change in the U.S. role in the world, which could have significant effects on security, freedom, and prosperity. Congress faces the issue of how to respond to these developments, which could impact various areas such as defense, trade, foreign assistance, and human rights. The U.S. role in the world is a critical issue for Congress with significant implications for policies, budgets, and foreign policymaking. The report provides a glossary of key terms and discusses the U.S. role since World War II. The U.S. role in the world post-World War II has been described in various terms like global leader, superpower, world policeman, and more. It has also been associated with internationalist foreign policy, liberal order building, and seeking world hegemony. The U.S. role in the world post-World War II has focused on defending and promoting the liberal international order, which includes respect for territorial integrity, peaceful dispute resolution, adherence to international law, and strong international institutions. The liberal international order, established by the United States post-World War II, promotes open economic engagement, development, and prosperity through global rules and norms. It aims to prevent major wars and economic disruptions by treating international waters, air space, outer space, and cyberspace as international commons. The liberal international order, established by the United States post-World War II, aims to maintain global peace and prosperity through international rules and norms. U.S. involvement in this order is seen as serving national self-interest by enhancing security, political, and economic objectives. Critics argue about the costs and benefits of this order. Some critics argue that the liberal international order primarily serves U.S. interests and promotes U.S. world primacy. The order is incomplete, aspirational, subject to evolution, and sometimes violated by its supporters. It is debated whether the order is more of a myth than a reality. The U.S. role in the world since World War II has included defending freedom, democracy, and human rights as universal values, while opposing authoritarian governments. This role is consistent with the democratic peace theory, which suggests that democratic countries are less likely to engage in wars of aggression. Additionally, the U.S. has worked to prevent the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia. The U.S. has aimed to prevent the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia since World War II, due to the potential threat to vital U.S. interests. While the overall U.S. role in the world has been stable, specific foreign policy approaches have changed over the past 70 years. The U.S. role in the world has been generally stable over the past 70 years, but there is ongoing debate about whether it should continue its active internationalist role or adopt a more restrained approach. Critics offer alternative concepts for the U.S. role in world affairs. The ongoing debate about the future U.S. role in world affairs revolves around the balance between pursuing material interests and promoting values like democracy and human rights, as well as the use of hard power versus soft power in foreign policy. Stakeholders have varying positions on these issues, with some advocating for a more restrained U.S. role. This discussion is further explored in the \"Issues for Congress\" section, particularly in the part titled \"Should the U.S. Role Change?\" The ongoing debate about the future U.S. role in world affairs revolves around the balance between pursuing material interests and promoting values like democracy and human rights, as well as the use of hard power versus soft power in foreign policy. Stakeholders have varying positions on these issues, with some advocating for a more restrained U.S. role. The overall issue for Congress is how to respond to recent developments regarding the U.S. role in the world, including whether the role is changing, how other countries are responding, and the implications for world order. Some argue that the U.S. role is undergoing a potentially historic change under the Trump Administration. The U.S. role in the world is shifting under the Trump Administration towards a more restrained, unilateralist approach. Observers note a retreat from global leadership, skepticism towards certain allies, and less support for multilateral agreements. The Trump Administration is shifting towards a more protectionist trade policy, less emphasis on defending universal values like freedom and democracy, and relying more on military power. This shift is evident in actions such as the \"America First\" theme and emphasis on national sovereignty. The Trump Administration's foreign policy actions in 2017 aimed to weaken the State Department, reduce staffing and funding levels, withdraw from international agreements like TPP, Paris climate agreement, Iran nuclear agreement, and GCM, not cooperate with ICC, limit exposure to ICJ decisions. The Trump Administration's foreign policy in 2017 included skepticism towards allies like NATO, focus on defense spending and trade imbalances, reluctance to criticize Russia, reduced involvement in Syria, and acceptance of Russia as a major power broker. The Trump Administration's foreign policy in 2017 included skepticism towards allies like NATO, focus on defense spending and trade imbalances, reluctance to criticize Russia, reduced involvement in Syria, acceptance of Russia as a major power broker, and various actions that raised concerns about support for democracy and human rights. Opponents of the Trump Administration's foreign policy argue that the U.S. retreat from global leadership is a significant mistake, weakening alliances, reducing soft power, and creating vacuums in global leadership. The Trump Administration's foreign policy is creating vacuums in global leadership, allowing other countries to fill the void at the expense of U.S. interests. Supporters believe the change is necessary to respond to evolving global circumstances and defend U.S. interests. They argue that the administration's actions reflect a principled realism and prioritize U.S. sovereignty in international relations. The Trump Administration's foreign policy is seen as effective in standing up for U.S. interests in relations with China, enhancing deterrence of regional aggression, and making progress in denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. Some observers believe there is less change in the U.S. role globally under the Trump Administration, with actions reflecting more continuity than perceived by President Trump's statements. The Trump Administration's foreign policy is viewed as maintaining continuity with the U.S. role of the past 70 years, as evidenced by various actions such as the national security strategy and defense strategy documents. The Trump Administration's foreign policy maintains continuity with past U.S. roles, including counterterrorism strategies, military operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East, support for NATO, actions against Russia, a more confrontational policy towards China, and increased funding for foreign assistance programs. The Trump Administration plans to increase funding for U.S. foreign assistance programs to compete with China in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They also emphasize the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific region as a framework for U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, there are U.S. trade actions aimed at making free trade more sustainable and fair. Statements on human rights and the U.S. withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council reflect support for human rights. Some observers debate whether there has been significant change in the U.S. role under the Trump Administration. Supporters of the U.S. role in the world over the past 70 years tend to see less change under the Trump Administration, while advocates for a more restrained U.S. role are disappointed with the lack of movement in that direction. Some argue that the shift to a more restrained role began during the Obama Administration with a focus on reducing military presence and ending combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Obama Administration focused on reducing military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, while showing restraint in responding to conflicts in Syria, Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine. Some argue that the shift to a more restrained U.S. role began earlier, under previous administrations. The question of whether the U.S. role is changing is difficult to assess. The U.S. role under the Trump Administration is difficult to assess due to mixed signals on issues like policy towards Russia, NATO, North Korea, and trade. Observers note differences between President Trump and senior officials, leading to an unpredictable approach to foreign policy decisions. Supporters argue that adding unpredictability is advantageous. The Trump Administration's foreign policy is seen as unpredictable due to mixed signals on various issues. While some argue that adding an element of unpredictability is advantageous, critics believe that it may raise doubts in other countries about U.S. policy goals and reliability as an ally or negotiating partner. The Trump Administration's foreign policy is viewed as unpredictable, with debates on potential advantages and disadvantages. Observers struggle to define a \"Trump Doctrine\" due to varying conclusions on key characteristics. Assessments suggest a potential historic change in the U.S. role, continuity, changes predating Trump, and difficulty in assessing the degree of change. The U.S. role in the world has been stable for 70 years, but there is debate on whether it should change. Critics offer alternative concepts, fueled by factors like changes in the security environment and budget deficits. The debate on the U.S. role in the world is influenced by changes in the security environment, budget deficits, and public opinion. Advocates of a more-restrained U.S. role include Andrew Bacevich, Doug Bandow, Ted Galen Carpenter, John Mearsheimer, Barry Posen, Christopher Preble, and William Ruger. Authors like Doug Bandow, Ted Galen Carpenter, John Mearsheimer, Barry Posen, Christopher Preble, William Ruger, and Stephen Walt have proposed various ideas for a more-restrained U.S. role, using terms like offshore balancing, realism, and retrenchment. These ideas may not align with potential changes under the Trump Administration. Advocates argue about the costs and benefits to the U.S. in terms of casualties, financial impacts, diplomatic consequences, and effects on domestic values and politics. The costs of defending and promoting the liberal international order have been underestimated, with U.S. interventions in Eurasia proving to be more costly and less successful than anticipated. Future budget deficits and debt projections suggest that the U.S. will no longer be able to afford its current expansive global role, potentially leading to excessive federal debt and unaddressed domestic issues. The United States' historical record dating back to 1776 shows periods of restraint rather than high levels of international engagement. Returning to a more traditional, restrained role would align with this historical norm. The U.S. lacks sufficient moral standing to impose its values on other countries, and interventionist policies can erode domestic values. It is unclear if U.S. public opinion supports maintaining a global role. The U.S. historical record shows periods of restraint rather than high international engagement. There is uncertainty if U.S. public opinion supports maintaining a global role as expansive as in the past 70 years, especially if it means sacrificing resources for domestic priorities. Americans often express support for a more restrained U.S. role in polls, particularly regarding acting as the world's police force, foreign assistance funding, participation in international organizations, and defense expenditures for allies. Observers argue that with the rapid growth of China and other countries, the U.S. is no longer as globally dominant and will face increasing challenges and costs over time. The United States should acknowledge the changing global distribution of power and work with China and other countries to define a new international order that incorporates ideas from these other countries. Eurasia can now be more self-regulating in terms of preventing the emergence of regional hegemons, reducing the need for U.S. intervention. The current substantial level of U.S. intervention in Eurasia discourages countries from acting independently to prevent regional hegemons. Even if regional hegemons emerge, it would not necessarily pose a threat to vital U.S. interests. Supporters of the U.S. role in the world reject these arguments and advocate for continued intervention. The benefits of the United States' role in the world over the past 70 years have outweighed the costs, despite significant expenses. Interventions in Eurasia have successfully prevented major power conflicts and protected vital U.S. interests. A more restrained U.S. role could be cheaper in the short term but may jeopardize long-term security, liberty, and prosperity. The United States, despite facing future budget deficits and debt, is a wealthy country capable of playing an expansive role in international affairs. Projections on deficits are driven by decisions on revenues and domestic expenditures, not defense or foreign-policy expenses. It is argued that getting the country's fiscal house in order should focus on revenues and domestic mandatory expenditures, rather than scaling back the U.S. role in the world. The United States, with ample moral authority, should maintain an engaged foreign policy due to changes in technology and global dynamics. Despite future budget concerns, the country's fiscal focus should be on domestic expenditures rather than reducing its international role. The United States remains a powerful global leader despite challenges from countries like China and Russia. While these countries have seen growth in wealth and power, they face uncertainties in their future growth rates. The US maintains advantages in demographics, economy, military power, technology, and innovation, positioning it as the world's most powerful country. The United States remains the world's most powerful country across all dimensions of power. The liberal international order, reflecting U.S. interests and values, would be jeopardized by incorporating ideas from authoritarian countries like China. Americans are accustomed to a world aligned with U.S. values and would resist a shift towards Chinese values. The notion of Eurasia self-regulating to prevent regional hegemons is unproven. A regional hegemon in Eurasia poses a risk to vital U.S. interests and could lead to war due to conflicts with other hegemons. Balancing material U.S. interests with promoting values like democracy and human rights is a key debate in the future U.S. role. Supporters of focusing on material U.S. interests argue that working with allies with poor human rights records is necessary for deterring regional aggressors. On the other hand, proponents of emphasizing U.S. and universal values in foreign policy believe that these values attract allies and enhance U.S. leverage. Another aspect of the debate is the balance between hard power and soft power in U.S. foreign policy, with some suggesting that undervaluing soft power could be detrimental. Some argue that relying more on hard power over soft power could make the U.S. more reliant on military power, which may be costly and less effective. There is a debate over the value of allies, with concerns that the U.S. is becoming more skeptical of allies under the Trump Administration. The value of allies and alliances to the United States over the past 70 years has been reflected in a global network of alliance relationships. Skeptics argue that allies are capable of defending themselves without U.S. help and often shift security costs to the U.S. There are concerns that allies would do more to balance against potential regional hegemons if the U.S. were not involved. Supporters of the current U.S. approach to allies and alliances argue that alliances are necessary for deterring potential aggressors and balancing against hegemonic powers in Eurasia. They believe alliances give the U.S. an advantage in dealing with major powers like Russia and China. Alliances, such as those with Russia and China, offer mutual defense benefits and other advantages like sharing intelligence and technology. A transactional approach to alliances overlooks the collective benefits of maintaining alliances with multiple countries in a region. U.S. public opinion plays a crucial role in shaping debates on the country's role in the world, influencing decisions on international agreements, military force employment, and defense funding levels. U.S. public opinion influences policymaker decisions on defense funding levels and foreign assistance. There is debate on whether the public feels U.S. leaders have broken a social contract regarding global leadership benefits. Public opinion is a key factor in discussions on the country's role in the world. The debate over the future U.S. role in the world includes arguments about factors such as China's rise, U.S. budget constraints, and fading collective memory of past conflicts. Public opinion plays a significant role in shaping discussions on the country's global leadership benefits. The debate over the future U.S. role in the world includes factors like economic disruption, technological developments, and changing power dynamics among nations. Some argue for a change in the U.S. role, while others advocate for its continuation. Some argue for adjustments in the U.S. role considering factors like economic growth, demographic changes, and technological developments such as internet, social media, cyber operations, artificial intelligence, and gene editing. The U.S. role in the world is being questioned in light of advancements in quantum computing, robotics, energy production, nanotechnology, and gene editing. Other countries, especially China and Russia, are responding to this potential shift, which could impact U.S. national security. China is seen as potentially capable of building a successor world order amid concerns about the United States retreating from its global leadership role. China is expanding its economic and political influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to separate the US from its allies, work with Russia to reduce US influence in Eurasia, and revise the international order to align with Chinese values. China is expanding its influence to potentially replace the United States as a world leader, with some perceiving US actions as containment efforts. Russia may also be aligning with China against US trade actions. Russia, like China, is aiming to establish greater influence and control over countries on its periphery, weaken the NATO alliance, work closely with China to reduce U.S. influence in Eurasia, and promote illiberal approaches to government in Europe and elsewhere. Despite initial hopes for better relations with the U.S. under the Trump Administration, Russia is now perceived to have given up on this possibility. Some observers are concerned that recent U.S. actions, including sanctions against Russia and a more confrontational policy towards China, may push Russia and China closer politically. They argue that this could lead to strategic cooperation between the two countries, potentially to the detriment of U.S. interests in Eurasia and beyond. Some observers are worried about the potential for Russia and China to form a strategic alliance, which could diminish U.S. influence in Eurasia. Russia is cautious of China's growing power and wealth, fearing it may overshadow Russia in the region. The impact of a changing U.S. role on Russia's response remains uncertain. President Trump's admiration for authoritarian leaders is empowering them to suppress opposition and freedom of the press, potentially spreading authoritarianism globally. Countries like China, Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are mentioned in this context. This trend poses a challenge to democracy and universal values of freedom and human rights. The 2019 Freedom House report highlights a global decline in freedom for the 13th consecutive year, affecting countries across regions. Antiliberal movements in Europe and the US have emboldened similar movements worldwide, damaging democracies and weakening core civil and political rights. Antiliberal leaders' attacks on the media contribute to increasing polarization and physical threats against journalists, providing cover for authoritarian leaders who cry \"fake news.\" Punitive immigration approaches by democracies result in human rights abuses, such as Australia's confinement of migrants in squalid camps and the US separating migrant children from parents, offering excuses for aggressive policies towards migrants and refugees. Populist politicians' appeals to \"unique\" or \"traditional\" national values threaten individual rights as a universal value, allowing authoritarian states to justify human rights violations. Antiliberal governments weaken international institutions, hindering their ability to constrain authoritarian powers. The United States must strengthen alliances with democracies and defend democracy as a universal right. The importance of defending democracy as a universal right and the role of the United States in promoting democratic norms globally. The decline of US democracy could lead to a decline in global democracy, with other nations closely watching the conduct of the oldest functioning democracy. Ronald Reagan's belief in the US as a global exemplar is highlighted as a call to renew democratic strength. The United States' role as a global exemplar of democracy is being discredited, despite a majority of Americans supporting democracy promotion. President's actions undermine democracy globally, with attacks on judiciary and press, resistance to anticorruption measures, and unfounded claims of voting fraud. Trump's behavior aligns with tactics used by foreign autocrats and populist leaders to consolidate power, weakening America's commitment to global democracy progress. President Trump's reluctance to uphold collective defense treaties with traditional democratic allies undermines international security. His refusal to advocate for democratic values and praise for dictators erode America's role as a global leader in democracy. Trump's actions weaken alliances and embolden forces opposing democratic principles. In countries with weaker defenses against attacks on democratic institutions, violations of norms can lead to systemic changes that increase repression and entrench authoritarian governance. The United States' diminishing global advocacy for freedom and justice may prompt nations to turn to China as an alternative leader. The Chinese Communist Party promotes its authoritarian system as a model for developing nations, causing damage to the liberal international order established after World War II. Repairing this damage will be challenging once Trump leaves office. The diminishing global advocacy for human rights by the United States may be seen as tacitly encouraging violations by other governments worldwide. Some argue that human rights violations are not solely the fault of the Trump Administration but also a result of changes in foreign governments and the international security environment. Reactions from U.S. allies and partner countries to a shift in the U.S. role in the world could have significant implications for national security. The potential implications of reactions from U.S. allies and partner countries to a shift in the U.S. role in the world could have significant implications for U.S. national security, particularly in terms of foreign policy and defense initiatives. This includes considerations of balance-vs.-bandwagon dynamics and free-rider issues, testing the merits of the U.S. role in the world over the past 70 years. The debate over the U.S. role in the world of the past 70 years questions if allies would balance against China and Russia or bandwagon with them. Supporters of the current U.S. role argue that a more-restrained U.S. could lead to bandwagoning, shifting global power against the United States. They believe strong U.S. actions encourage others to balance, creating a virtuous cycle. Supporters of a more-restrained U.S. role argue that it would encourage countries to balance against potential regional hegemons, preserving global and regional power balances favorable to the United States at a lower cost. They believe a strong U.S. role may lead to free riders under the U.S. security umbrella, while a more-restrained approach could address long-term challenges in reducing the free-rider effect. The United States faces a challenge in reducing the free-rider effect among its allies in the transatlantic alliance, particularly under the NATO treaty. Concerns have been raised about President Trump's views on NATO potentially straining the alliance, but some argue that it has weathered strains in the past. The free-rider issue within the alliance is a key concern for U.S. security and diplomacy. The issue of the status of the transatlantic alliance and the free-rider problem with NATO allies has been a recurring concern for the United States. The Trump Administration has pressured NATO allies to increase defense spending, resulting in stronger commitments from them. Critics agree on reducing free riding but question the approach taken by the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration pressured NATO allies to increase defense spending, resulting in stronger commitments. Critics argue that the confrontational tactics used were not worth the damage to alliance relationships. European countries are considering increasing their autonomy from the United States in response. EU member states are taking steps to enhance their security capabilities. The Baltic and Nordic states in Europe are enhancing their defense capabilities and collaborating more closely on security issues. European countries are also defending international trade arrangements and the Iran nuclear agreement. There are concerns about the reliability of the United States as an ally in Europe, leading Germany to consider closer ties with Russia on trade. In Asia, countries like Japan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and India are increasing efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indo-Pacific region, countries like Japan, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and India are taking actions to counter China. The Philippines and ASEAN countries have varying approaches towards China's actions in the South China Sea. Japan led efforts to finalize the TPP agreement after the U.S. withdrawal. The 11 remaining partners in the pact finalized the TPP agreement, aiming to counter a more China-centric trading system in the Indo-Pacific region. Japan supports a free and open Indo-Pacific and is actively promoting the concept. Some Latin American and African countries are turning to China due to perceived reduced U.S. engagement. Senior Trump Administration officials have visited Latin America to reaffirm U.S. commitment and caution against potential downsides. The U.S. is cautioning countries in the region about the risks of increasing cooperation with China. Observers note that President Trump's foreign policy is reshaping global interactions, with countries either criticizing or welcoming his America First agenda. The responses are varied and not straightforward. The authors discuss nine distinct approaches to foreign policy, ranging from resistance to exploitation, all impacting the relationship between the United States and the world. These behaviors, influenced by Trump's agenda, will shape the international environment and be affected by his future decisions. Various countries' responses to these approaches vary, reflecting the changing global landscape. The authors discuss how countries are responding to Trump's presidency, with some seeking to minimize its effects while others are trying to benefit from them. Governments worldwide are adjusting to the disruptions caused by Trump's policies. Foreign actors' strategies may benefit the US by sustaining the international order post-World War II, but there are limits to allied efforts to compensate for the US's geopolitical disengagement. The liabilities of global adjustment to America First outweigh the benefits from a U.S. perspective. Many democracies and U.S. partners are struggling to mitigate the effects of America First, while revisionist powers seek to exploit the situation. Most states are uncertain and hedging their bets in response to America First, with Germany pursuing various strategies. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's approach has led many states, including Germany, to pursue diverse strategies in response. The current instability in U.S. policy could shift global reactions, influenced by debates within the administration and the fluctuating influence of key personnel. Continued volatility in U.S. policy under Trump's presidency may lead to varied global responses. International reactions to America First will depend on how lasting other countries perceive this shift to be. The duration of the Trump era will ultimately determine the impact on global strategies. The discussion focuses on how other countries are responding to a possible change in the U.S. role in the world. Some observers believe that certain countries like Russia aim to erode the liberal international order, while China could potentially challenge and revise the current world order. The collapse of the liberal international order may be influenced by a shift in the U.S. role or other factors. A collapse of the liberal international order could result in a less ordered world or a new international order based on different characteristics and values, with significant implications for U.S. security, freedom, and prosperity. Some believe the U.S. role change is contributing to the weakening of the order, while others attribute it to the rise of China and other countries challenging U.S. dominance in world affairs. Some argue that the weakening or collapse of the liberal international order is exaggerated, suggesting that the U.S. role has not changed significantly and that China is more interested in revising than replacing the order. Congress must consider the implications of a changed U.S. role on its powers and prerogatives in foreign policy and national security. The U.S. Congress has various powers that influence the country's role in foreign policy, including control over appropriations, authorizations for military force, approval of agreements, confirmation of executive branch nominees, and oversight of operations. The U.S. Congress plays a significant role in foreign policy through control over appropriations, military force authorizations, agreement approvals, nominee confirmations, and oversight of executive branch operations. The Constitution sets the stage for an ongoing debate on the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch in foreign policymaking, including war powers, NATO withdrawal authority, and modern warfare challenges. The U.S. Congress has control over foreign policy through appropriations, military authorizations, agreement approvals, and oversight of executive branch operations. Key issues include NATO withdrawal authority, ceding authority to the executive branch, spending funds, and keeping Congress informed on U.S. diplomacy and operations abroad. Congress must consider if the current presidential and congressional activities in foreign policy are appropriate for a potentially historic change in the U.S. role in the world. One observer noted in February 2017 that congressional grants of authority to the executive branch, such as the power to levy \"emergency\" tariffs, were established in a different era when presidents of both parties agreed on the importance of remaining engaged in trade and collective security. Lawmakers did not anticipate the current breakdown in national consensus or the rise of America Firsters in positions of power. Congressional decisions on U.S. foreign policy could involve areas like war powers and tariffs. The U.S. role in the world involves war powers, tariffs, trade negotiations, foreign policy programs, and executive branch actions. Congress may need to adapt its organization and operations for foreign policy given a changing U.S. role. Democracy in the U.S. could impact how the country defends and promotes democracy globally. The U.S. role in the world, particularly in defending and promoting democracy, was seen as crucial during the Cold War. The effectiveness of U.S. democracy at different levels was instrumental in showcasing Western-style democracy as superior and inspiring resistance against authoritarianism. This demonstration of democracy was considered a form of U.S. soft power. The end of the Cold War led to a decrease in the debate between democracy and authoritarianism. The shift to renewed great power competition has sparked a new ideological debate about Western-style democracy versus modern authoritarian forms. China's state-controlled media sometimes criticizes U.S. democracy. In a period of renewed ideological competition, China's state-controlled media criticizes U.S. democracy while Russia promotes its authoritarian form of government. Congress may need to consider how U.S. democracy is perceived globally and whether a change in the U.S. role in the world could be reversible in the future. Potential questions for Congress include the reversibility of changes in the U.S. role due to technological advancements, international power shifts, and public opinion. How decisions made now by Congress and the executive branch could impact future reversibility and what actions should be taken to preserve the option for reversing changes in the U.S. role. Additionally, considering the views of other countries on the potential reversibility of U.S. role changes. The curr_chunk discusses the potential reversibility of changes in the U.S. role in foreign policy and how it may impact other countries' foreign policies. Key terms such as \"role in the world\" and \"grand strategy\" are defined in the glossary. The curr_chunk discusses a country's grand strategy, which includes diplomatic, informational, military, and economic tools. Leaders may keep elements of the strategy secret, but a country's role in the world reflects its grand strategy. The term international order or world order refers to the collection of organizations, institutions, treaties, rules, norms, and practices that organize foreign policy discussions. International orders are established by major world powers to regulate international relations. They are incomplete, aspirational, and subject to challenges. Terms like unipolar, bipolar, tripolar, and multipolar are used to describe the number of top-tier world powers in a given historical period. The Cold War was a bipolar competition between the US and the Soviet Union. The post-Cold War era was unipolar with the US as the sole superpower. Recently, there has been a shift to a tripolar or multipolar world with renewed great power competition between the US, China, and Russia. Other observers may include additional top-tier world powers like the European Union. The term Eurasia refers to the land mass encompassing Europe and Asia, including fringing islands, from Portugal to Japan and Russia to India. It also includes Central Asia, Southwest Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Regional hegemon refers to a powerful country in a specific region. The term regional hegemon refers to a powerful country in a specific region that can dominate the affairs of that region and compel other countries to support its key policy goals. In a spheres-of-influence world, multiple regions have their own hegemon, creating a structure with multiple top-tier powers. In a multipolar world, major world powers have not achieved regional hegemon status, leading to highly segmented international relations on a regional basis. Geopolitics focuses on the influence of geographic features on international relations. Geopolitics examines how geographic features impact international relations, including factors like oil, water, geographic barriers, and transportation links. In foreign policy, hard power refers to military and economic coercion, while soft power involves persuasion through diplomacy, development aid, and cultural influence. \"America's Foreign Policy Power Is Changing Under Trump; Washington no longer shapes world events as it did in the Cold War's aftermath.

According to a survey by Pew Research Center, protecting the U.S. from terrorist attacks, safeguarding American jobs, and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction are top priorities for the country. There are significant differences between Republicans and Democrats on various foreign policy goals, with Democrats prioritizing improving relationships with U.S. allies more than Republicans.

A 2018 report highlighted concerns over President Trump's foreign policy stance and the impact on US security alliances and trade relationships. Despite the Trump administration's unilateral actions in foreign policy, the majority of Americans support active US engagement in world affairs and multilateral diplomacy. This shift in public opinion marks the largest majority since 1974, with a record number of Americans recognizing the benefits of international cooperation. A record number of Americans support international trade and agreements despite US withdrawal from certain deals. Majority of Americans want US to remain engaged in world affairs and support sending troops to defend allies. Public opinion shows increased commitment to global cooperation. A majority of Americans believe in working with allies and other countries to achieve foreign policy goals, rather than tackling world problems alone. They support making decisions with allies, even if it means not always getting their preferred policy outcomes. Two-thirds also believe in being more willing to make decisions within the United Nations, even if it means sometimes going along with policies that are not their first choice. Support for US participation in international agreements like the Iran deal and the Paris Agreement has increased, with a majority of Americans preferring to work with allies and make decisions within the United Nations, even if it means not always getting their preferred policy outcomes. The administration's use of coercive rhetoric to change US influence has not been well-received by the public. The public perceives the United States as more feared than admired globally, with many Americans expressing concerns about strained relations with allies and losing allies. Despite this, a majority believes that admiration is more important than fear for achieving US foreign policy goals. Additionally, there is a desire to maintain or increase commitment to NATO, even as some administration officials have praised the alliance. Support for NATO remains strong among Americans, with a majority favoring maintaining or increasing US commitment to the alliance. Additionally, there is growing support for using US troops to defend key allies, with a majority in favor of maintaining long-term military bases in South Korea, Japan, and Germany. Americans continue to support maintaining US bases in Germany (60%) and sending troops to defend South Korea (64%), Japan (64%), and Baltic NATO allies (54%) if attacked. Public opinion on trade is positive, with large majorities saying it benefits consumers (85%), the economy (82%), and job creation (67%). Despite criticism of NAFTA and TPP, 63% now view NAFTA as beneficial for the US economy. According to a recent survey, 63 percent of Americans believe NAFTA is good for the US economy, up from 53 percent in 2017. Additionally, 61% of Americans support the US participating in the CPTPP. Concerns about trade disruptions with China are high, with 70% of Americans worried about the impact on their local economy. Trade disputes with Mexico are somewhat less concerning to the US public. Just over half of the US public are concerned about the impact of a trade war with Mexico on their local economy. The majority of Americans prefer active US engagement and working with allies over the Trump administration's bold attempts to reshape US foreign policy. They believe in the effectiveness of US soft power and are worried about losing allies and world respect due to recent White House actions. Americans are more likely to endorse participating in international agreements like the Iran nuclear deal, Paris Agreement, and TPP. They support traditional US foreign policy approaches such as maintaining military bases abroad, defending key allies, and supporting trade. A 2018 Chicago Council on Global Affairs report highlighted generational differences in US public opinion on foreign policy, showing a rejection of the \"America First\" platform. Many observers have voiced doubts about public support for American internationalism, citing concerns about military intervention, free trade, and global alliances. The question of whether younger Americans, particularly Millennials, will take up the mantle of global leadership is crucial as they are now the largest generation in the country. Millennials' views on foreign policy may differ from older generations, showing less concern about international threats and less support for an activist approach. Survey data from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs since 1974 highlights this generational shift in attitudes towards global issues. Findings reveal that generations share opinions on international threats, foreign policy goals, and approaches to engaging the world. Each generation since the Silent Generation is less supportive of expansive American internationalism, with recent generations showing lower support for militarized approaches. Successor generations prioritize maintaining military power less, support international cooperation and free trade, and favor cooperative approaches to foreign policy. Younger Americans are more inclined towards international cooperation and globalization. Younger Americans today are more liberal, less likely to identify as Republican, and more likely not to identify with either party. This shift in ideology and party identification influences their views on foreign policy, leading to differences with older generations. Younger Americans play a significant role in shaping generation gaps on foreign policy issues, with differences across generations remaining politically significant. Shifting demographics and attitudes are likely to influence debates on US engagement with the world as younger Americans replace older generations. The impact of these generational differences on foreign policy attitudes remains uncertain. The Trump Administration's America First theme signaled a departure from past foreign policy. The appeal of protectionism, security ally reassessment, and immigration restrictions remains limited among the American public, mainly appealing to core Trump supporters. Immigration appeals mainly to core Trump supporters, while most Americans prefer traditional US foreign policy post-World War II. Public support for defending allies, trade benefits, and a path to citizenship for undocumented workers has increased. Americans strongly support maintaining existing alliances as an effective foreign policy tool, with 49% considering it \"very effective.\" They also have confidence in Asian and European allies to handle global issues responsibly. Additionally, solid majorities favor maintaining or increasing US military presence in the Asia-Pacific (78%), Europe (73%), and the Middle East (70%). Americans strongly support maintaining existing alliances as an effective foreign policy tool, with 49% considering it \"very effective.\" A majority now say NATO is essential to US security, and are willing to use US troops to defend South Korea or NATO allies like Latvia, Lithuania, or Estonia. President Trump wishes for allied countries to contribute more to collective defense, but most Americans prefer persuasion over threats to ensure allies pay their fair share. This shows that Americans value the advantages that alliances bring. A majority of Americans appreciate the benefits of alliances with Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East. Core Trump supporters are skeptical about the benefits of alliances, but still see NATO as essential to US security. A record percentage of Americans now recognize the positive impact of international trade on consumers, the economy, and job creation. A majority of Americans believe international trade is beneficial for US consumers, the economy, and job creation. There is a growing recognition of the positive impact of trade deals between the United States and other countries. However, there are differing opinions on who benefits more from these deals, with some Americans, especially core Trump supporters, believing other countries benefit more. Despite blaming poor trade deals for job losses, Americans are divided on whether the current administration's policies will help or harm US workers. US workers have differing expectations for the new administration's policies, with clear partisan divides. Core Trump supporters and Republicans are more optimistic about the benefits of international trade, while Democrats may be reacting against past trade-bashing rhetoric. Concern over immigration is at its lowest point, with fewer Americans alarmed by the potential threat of immigrants and refugees entering the US. Support for providing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship has increased, with two-thirds of Americans in favor. Concern over immigration as a threat has decreased, with just 37% considering it a critical issue. There are still significant differences between Democrats and Republicans, with core Trump supporters most likely to view immigration as a threat. Support for providing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship has increased, with two-thirds of Americans in favor. Democrats overwhelmingly support a pathway to citizenship, while Republicans are divided between deportation and citizenship. Majority of Americans continue to support US participation in the Paris Agreement, although Republican support has declined significantly since 2016. Support for the Paris Accord has decreased among Republicans, with only 37% in favor compared to 57% in 2016. Democrats (83%) and Independents (60%) still support the agreement, but at slightly lower levels. Concern over climate change has reached a peak, with 46% of Americans viewing it as a critical threat. Democrats are more concerned about climate change, with 70% seeing it as a critical threat compared to 16% of Republicans and 12% of core Trump supporters. Fractures within the Republican Party Base Headlines over the past year have proclaimed an internal battle within the Republican Party between President Trump's supporters and those who oppose his policies. The 2017 Chicago Council Survey data illustrate fissures between self-described Republicans who have a very favorable view of President Trump (\"Trump Republicans\") and those who do not (\"non-Trump Republicans\"). Non-Trump Republicans align more with average US public opinion than they do with Trump Republicans, especially on issues like NAFTA and defense spending. Despite internal divisions within the Republican Party, Americans overall show enduring support for an active US role in world affairs, security alliances, and trade relationships. While there are differences among Republicans on issues like defense spending and immigration, the public as a whole favors offering illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. This support is often overlooked by political leaders, despite some concerns about the benefits of security alliances and trade agreements. President Trump has adjusted some of his campaign positions since taking office, no longer deeming NATO obsolete and reassuring allies of U.S. defense commitments. His administration officials hold more mainstream views on defense issues and have traveled to allied nations to ease tensions. Trump has also moderated his anti-trade rhetoric, seeking to renegotiate NAFTA and backing away from accusations of Chinese currency manipulation. These shifts align more closely with mainstream American views and those of non-core Republican supporters. The 2016 Pew Research Center survey shows that most Americans are apprehensive about America's role in the world and prefer focusing on domestic issues. Public support for increased defense spending has risen, with 35% in favor of more spending, 24% wanting cuts, and 40% wanting spending to remain the same. This marks a 12 percentage point increase in support for more defense spending since the 9/11 attacks. The new survey conducted in April 2016 among 2,008 U.S. adults shows that 57% of Americans prefer dealing with domestic issues over helping other countries. Support for U.S. internationalism has slightly increased since 2013, but 49% of Americans view U.S. involvement in the global economy negatively, citing lower wages and job losses as concerns. Many Americans view the economy negatively, citing lower wages and job losses as concerns. Despite some increase in support for U.S. internationalism since 2013, nearly half believe the U.S. has become a less powerful and important world leader in the past decade. Republicans are more likely than independents or Democrats to hold this view. According to a Pew Research Center survey, a majority of Americans believe the United States is the world's leading economic power, with China in second place. A 2016 report on U.S. public opinion data highlighted how Donald Trump has tapped into American anxieties to gain political support. Donald Trump has mobilized a segment of the American public concerned about globalization's impact on the economy and changing demographics. Despite minority support on key issues, Trump's tough stance on immigration and trade has resonated with this group, giving him traction in the presidential race. Americans overall support continued immigration into the United States, favor reform for unauthorized immigrants, and see benefits in globalization and free trade. Core supporters of Donald Trump still value traditional alliances, US leadership abroad, and military superiority, although they are more cautious about alliances and active US involvement in world affairs. The Charles Koch Institute and the Center for the National Interest conducted a survey in December 2016 on U.S. public opinion regarding foreign policy. The results showed that a majority of Americans believe diplomacy and trade are better for improving U.S. security than military intervention. William Ruger, vice president for research, noted that more than half of Americans think U.S. foreign policy in the last 15 years has made the country less safe. Americans want a different approach in foreign policy, favoring caution in military intervention, burden sharing by wealthy allies, and diplomacy over regime change. The public's call for peace and change reflects disenchantment with the status quo, with a preference for trade and diplomacy for national security. Voters also support a strong military and balanced alliances. Poll results show that Americans believe recent U.S. foreign policy has made them less safe, with a majority expressing concerns about safety. There is a call for a new model of American leadership that moves beyond past mistakes. Americans favor peaceful engagement over military intervention, with 70% agreeing that the U.S. should work with existing governments to promote peace. 49% prioritize diplomacy over military intervention for safety, while 40% want to increase military spending. Only 20% believe regime change attempts would improve safety. Americans prioritize peaceful engagement and diplomacy over military intervention, with 70% supporting working with existing governments to promote peace. When asked about improving safety, 45% believe cutting the number of U.S. regime change attempts would be beneficial. Additionally, 54% think working more through the United Nations would enhance U.S. safety. Respondents also prefer expanding U.S. alliance commitments (50%) over reducing them (27%), but only 26% agree that the U.S. should automatically defend Baltic countries in a conflict with Russia. American voters have mixed views on international relationships. While 55% believe increasing trade would improve U.S. safety, only 22% think decreasing trade would make the country safer. Over half see Russia as a potential partner, with 38% viewing them as both an adversary and a partner. When it comes to China, 93% do not see them as an ally, but 89% also do not consider them an enemy. Americans prefer to view China as a competitor rather than an enemy. When it comes to military actions abroad, a plurality believe that Congress should impeach a president who does not seek approval.

Only 22% support increasing military presence in the Middle East. Voters want President-elect Trump to audit the Pentagon. Americans want President-elect Trump to audit the Pentagon and believe NATO countries should increase defense spending. There is divided opinion on strengthening the U.S. military's relationship with Saudi Arabia and the Iran deal. In a survey regarding the Iran deal, 32% favored renegotiation, 28% favored respect, 17% favored walking away, and 23% were unsure. Observers note that President Trump's \"America First\" approach is gaining support, with no popular outcry against his trade battles. Experts predict a prolonged international trade war regardless of the next president. Trump's immigration policies, while more popular with Republicans, are not a major focus for Democratic politicians. Isolationism, anti-immigration sentiment, and protectionism are pillars of America Firstism, with the old consensus on America's global security role collapsing in both parties. Republican voters support Trump's efforts for better ties with Russia, accepting Moscow's actions in Ukraine and the Middle East. They also approve of Trump's negotiations with North Korea. Democrats appear to rally against Trump's denigration of the liberal order. Most Democratic politicians and voters oppose Trump's foreign policy, but their views on military spending and overseas presence differ. Americans in both parties agree that old allies should take more responsibility for their defense. Few support committing American lives to defend smaller nations like Montenegro, reflecting a shift towards isolationism and skepticism of traditional security alliances. President Obama was more internationalist than Mr. Trump, expanding NATO, intervening in Libya, and negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership. However, Democrats do not necessarily miss these policies. Mr. Trump's unilateralist and nationalist approach may align more with the general public's views. While Trump's presidency has influenced America's current posture, public opinion plays a significant role in shaping foreign policy decisions. During the interwar period, American public opinion was against overseas involvement, regardless of the president's stance. It took significant events like Hitler's conquests and Pearl Harbor to shift public opinion. In recent times, the America First approach has been gaining momentum since the Cold War ended. Presidents like George H.W. Bush had to downplay foreign policy to appeal to voters, while George W. Bush promised reduced global involvement. In recent times, American presidents have been elected on promises to reduce global involvement in foreign conflicts. The shift towards a more isolationist approach has been gaining momentum since the end of the Cold War. Foreign policy experts are questioning whether this trend is a new direction or a return to older traditions in American foreign policy. The shift towards a more isolationist approach in American foreign policy is seen as a return to older traditions, where the US stayed on the sidelines while fascism and militarism threatened the world. Americans accepted the idea of defending faraway frontiers and leading the global economy, alliances, and institutions, believing in the benefits of a stable, prosperous, and liberal world order. The 2016 presidential election raised doubts about the bipartisan consensus on American leadership in the world order. There are two interpretations of this issue, pointing in different directions regarding American attitudes on foreign affairs. Despite signs of public opinion shifts, the support for American internationalism remains unclear. Most recent polling data shows strong support for globalization and international trade among Americans, with 65% seeing globalization as \"mostly good\" for the US and 64% viewing international trade as beneficial for their standard of living. Even the Trans-Pacific Partnership had 60% support. Despite some signs of public alienation from American internationalism, polls indicate that the majority of Americans believe trade and business ties with other countries are positive for the US. Despite some signs of public alienation from American internationalism, recent polls show strong support for maintaining U.S. alliances, with 77% seeing NATO membership as positive and 89% believing alliances are effective for U.S. foreign policy goals. Additionally, there is little demand for military retrenchment, as 75% of respondents in 2016 supported increasing or maintaining defense spending. Support for overseas bases and troop deployments remains strong, indicating limited public appetite for significant military intervention. Despite public skepticism towards the cost of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, polls show strong support for military campaigns like against the Islamic State. Despite criticism of international institutions, most Americans view the United Nations favorably and support participation in the Paris Agreement. Over 50% of Americans prefer to let other countries take the lead on global issues. Despite some public skepticism towards U.S. involvement in global issues, recent survey data shows that a majority of Americans still believe in the country's role in world affairs. Over 50% of Americans prefer to let other countries handle global problems, but there is bipartisan support for the U.S. to continue playing an active role internationally. The national mood towards American internationalism remains strong, but there is a growing crisis weakening its political foundations. Trump's election signifies profound political effects, reflecting a shift from nation-building abroad to nation-building at home. Despite public skepticism, there is bipartisan support for the U.S. to continue playing an active role in world affairs. The decline in public support for promoting democracy abroad and the credibility of experts in foreign policy have contributed to the crisis of American internationalism. The rupturing of the political-economic bargain that underpinned internationalism has also played a role, with free trade disadvantaging workers and industries. The rise of American internationalism post-World War II aimed to offset costs for workers and industries affected by global competition, ensuring upward social mobility. However, this bargain has eroded since the late 1970s, with many Americans, especially the less-educated, experiencing worsening economic prospects. Despite some reassuring public opinion polling on trade and globalization, there is a clear backlash evident, with a plurality of Americans expressing concerns in 2016. In 2016, a majority of Americans expressed concerns about U.S. involvement in the global economy, citing lower wages and job losses. There is a growing sentiment for the U.S. to focus on its own issues rather than international affairs, with a significant portion of the population supporting this view. Despite some support for free trade, there is a noticeable backlash against globalization among certain groups in the U.S. The rise of Trump highlighted the disconnect between American foreign policy and the interests of the population, leading to a sense that American internationalism is no longer aligned with American nationalism. Globalization has caused many voters to feel that elites prioritize international agendas over the wellbeing of ordinary Americans. Immigration from Mexico and Central America has also contributed to these sentiments. The rise of Trump exposed the disconnect between American foreign policy and the interests of the population, leading to a belief that American internationalism no longer aligns with American nationalism. Globalization and immigration have fueled concerns about the prioritization of international agendas over the wellbeing of ordinary Americans. The future of American internationalism involves elements of both interpretations, with no clear trend towards isolationism despite Trump's victory. American internationalism faces challenges post-Trump's election, with doubts on its political vitality. Trump's victory was seen as an anomaly rather than a reflection of public opinion on foreign policy. The election campaign focused more on candidates' unpopularity than substantive foreign policy debates. Trump's defeat in the popular vote by a member of the foreign policy establishment highlights the uncertainty surrounding American internationalism's future trajectory. Despite doubts post-Trump's election, polling data shows strong support for American internationalism. Surveys indicate majority belief in globalization's benefits and effectiveness of U.S. alliances in achieving foreign policy goals. Support for military primacy, intervention against threats like ISIS, and backing for the UN and Paris climate accords remain robust. Analysis suggests no wholesale rejection of American internationalism among the public. Despite Trump's anti-internationalist platform, there is still strong bipartisan support for American internationalism. Trump has had to adjust his agenda, but his radical views on foreign policy did not disqualify him in the eyes of American voters. Trump's rise has highlighted five key strains weakening American internationalism: difficulty in identifying global threats post-Cold War, value of U.S. internationalism in shaping global order, and challenges confronting successors. U.S. internationalism has been valuable in shaping the international system, but nation-building missions in Afghanistan and Iraq have been costly and unrewarding. Many Americans are questioning the effectiveness of resources devoted to foreign policy, leading to a decline in support for promoting democracy as a key objective. The credibility of the U.S. foreign policy establishment has been weakened due to high-profile disasters like the Iraq War and subsequent security vacuum in Iraq. The declining economic fortunes of the working and middle classes have weakened U.S. internationalism, making them less enthusiastic about bearing the costs of foreign policy. Globalization and free trade have exacerbated economic insecurity, particularly for the working class, with China's integration into the global economy taking a toll on manufacturing. The integration of China into the global economy has negatively impacted manufacturing and employment in the United States. Many Trump voters believed that U.S. involvement in the international economy was detrimental. There is a growing sense among voters that U.S. internationalism has prioritized the well-to-do over ordinary Americans. This sentiment is reflected in the belief that the United States focuses too much on other countries' issues and not enough on its own. American internationalism is facing cracks in its political consensus, allowing Trump to emerge in 2016. While not dead yet, it has serious long-term issues that could be fatal. The bipartisan foreign-policy establishment saw an opportunity to extend the liberal order after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but the public, especially Jacksonians, were skeptical. There have been debates throughout history on how the U.S. should engage with the world. After the Soviet collapse, American elites believed in the end of history and pursued foreign policy initiatives like expanding NATO and promoting global democracy. However, American voters have consistently favored domestic-focused leaders over those advocating for deep global engagement. This trend was evident in elections like Clinton over Bush in 1992 and Bush over Gore. The disconnect between the establishment's global agenda and limited voter support is a core problem in American foreign policy. The establishment is realizing the challenges of building a liberal world order are more difficult and expensive than previously thought. There is a growing divide between elite and public opinion, with no strong consensus on U.S. foreign policy. Washington's foreign-policy establishment is not as wise or competent as it believes itself to be, while the world is becoming more dangerous. The U.S. lacks a strong consensus on foreign policy. Washington needs more than grudging support from the American people. The Trump administration should embrace a new realistic national strategy. Leaders must make the case for global engagement to a skeptical public. The establishment's focus on Trump's shortcomings avoids addressing failures in post-Cold War foreign policy. Trump's presidency is a result of establishment failure. The U.S. lacks a strong consensus on foreign policy. In an April 2017 blog post, a foreign policy specialist highlighted the recurring pattern of American debates on their global role every 20 years. The discussion typically begins with a scaled-down foreign policy after a costly war, but questions arise about its robustness when unexpected challenges emerge. This cycle involves various stakeholders questioning America's strategy and capabilities. The U.S. lacks a strong consensus on foreign policy, with debates recurring every 20 years about America's global role. Stakeholders question whether the U.S. should do more despite doubts about its economy, domestic priorities, and public readiness. The foreign-policy establishment is divided, and there are concerns about the effectiveness of traditional Washington solutions in addressing international issues. Polls show the public is open to new approaches but unsure how to choose among them. The Pew Research Center reported that 70 percent of voters preferred the next president to focus on domestic affairs over foreign policy. Majority of Democrats, Republicans, and independents supported policies to maintain the US as the only military superpower. Trump's approach combined relief from global leadership burdens with nationalist self-assertion, allowing America to reduce its global investment while still exerting influence. Conservative Republicans also expressed a desire for the US to maintain its global military dominance. Trump's strategy appealed to those who wanted a strong America without excessive military involvement, focusing on domestic issues and avoiding nation-building abroad. The election of Trump signaled a desire for change in foreign policy, according to a poll by the Charles Koch Institute and Center for the National Interest. The public's desire for a fresh start in foreign policy aligns with Trump's campaign rhetoric. There is an opportunity for Trump to redefine the debate, with many Americans open to persuasion. Majority believe US foreign policy has not made them safer or the world, citing negative effects of wars in the Middle East. The poll results show that many Americans are concerned about the impact of wars in the Middle East on their sense of security. A significant percentage want a decreased military presence in the region and are unsure about maintaining strong military ties with Saudi Arabia. Over half oppose deploying ground troops to Syria. There is a growing sentiment that reducing the military presence abroad would enhance American security. Americans are adopting a more cautious approach towards foreign relations. The poll results indicate that Americans are ambivalent about their relationships with other countries. Many view them as competitors rather than friends or foes. There is uncertainty about defending Baltic countries in a conflict with Russia and the inclusion of Montenegro in NATO. A significant percentage see Russia as both an adversary and a potential partner, showing unease with the current foreign policy status quo. Americans are uneasy with the current foreign policy status quo, preferring diplomacy over military power. A majority believe in working through the United Nations for security and increasing trade for safety. Trump's talk of burden sharing and a critical look at existing policies may have merit. Trump's focus on burden sharing and challenging establishment foreign policy resonates with a growing \"restraint constituency\" in American politics. This constituency questions the benefits of alliance relationships and emphasizes the need for unilateral action to defend core foreign policy interests, making it challenging to establish a foreign policy consensus in the future. The growing \"restraint constituency\" in American politics challenges establishment foreign policy, making it difficult for the next President to establish a consensus and combat perceptions of American decline. John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt propose a new \"grand strategy\" for the United States, focusing on cuts in defense spending, withdrawals from Europe and the Middle East, and a focus on China as the main rival. The professors propose a new \"grand strategy\" for the United States, focusing on cuts in defense spending, withdrawals from Europe and the Middle East, and a focus on China as the main rival. However, data shows that fewer Americans are advocating for a less activist foreign policy, with a majority wanting the U.S. to focus on its own problems. Three years ago, 51% of Americans believed the U.S. did \"too much\" in solving world problems, which has now dropped to 41%. This trend is consistent across Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Despite calls for a more focused foreign policy, there is still strong support for the U.S. maintaining its role as the only military superpower. While some propose cutting defense spending and withdrawing troops from Europe, the majority of Americans view NATO positively and see Russia as a major threat."
