In this Act, key definitions include Director as the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agency as any agency defined under title 5, Federal financial assistance as aid provided to non-Federal entities, local government as a political subdivision of a State, and non-Federal entity as a State, local government, or nonprofit organization. A nonprofit organization is defined as an entity operated for public interest, not for profit, and uses proceeds to maintain operations. A State is defined as any state within the United States and its territories. The curr_chunk defines terms related to governmental entities, including Tribal government and uniform administrative rule. The curr_chunk outlines the duties of federal agencies. Federal agencies must develop and implement a plan within 18 months of this Act's enactment to streamline application procedures, participate in interagency processes, use a common application system, designate a lead official, and allow electronic application and reporting for financial assistance programs. The agency must ensure recipients provide high-quality information in response to reporting requirements and establish annual goals to measure performance. If agencies cannot comply, the Director will report to the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee. The Director may extend the period for plan development and implementation for noncompliant agencies for up to 12 months. Each agency must publish the plan in the Federal Register for public comment and consultation with non-Federal entities during development and implementation.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development must develop policies within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The plan establishes procedures for applicants with technical deficiencies in their Federal financial assistance application. Applicants must be promptly notified of deficiencies and given 7 days to correct them. The agency will continue to consider the application during this period, and if the deficiency is corrected within 7 days, the application will still be considered. The agency will continue to consider the application even if there is a technical deficiency, which may not impact eligibility for funding. The duties of the director are outlined in Section 6. The Director, in consultation with agency heads and representatives of non-Federal entities, shall direct, coordinate, and assist Federal agencies in establishing a common application and system for Federal financial assistance programs, along with uniform administrative rules.
