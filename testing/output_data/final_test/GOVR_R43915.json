    "content": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified climate change as a significant risk facing the federal government. Efforts are underway to address vulnerabilities of federal agencies to projected climate change, with the executive branch guiding adaptation planning. President Obama's Climate Action Plan and Executive Order 13653 in 2013 emphasized the importance of preparing for the impacts of climate change. Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, focused on federal climate change preparedness through agency adaptation planning. Over 30 federal departments and agencies had produced climate change adaptation plans by December 2014, identifying vulnerabilities and opportunities. Congressional concerns may include resource diversion from other challenges. The report synthesizes federal government efforts to adapt to climate change, based on adaptation planning documents from various departments and agencies. Key policy issues include determining investment levels and mechanisms for federal agency adaptation. The focus is on addressing potential vulnerabilities of agency missions. The review focuses on federal agencies addressing potential vulnerabilities related to projected climate change, not on how agencies may help nonfederal entities adapt. For example, USDA programs may assist agricultural producers in preparing for climate change, while the EPA may work on expanding water utilities' understanding of climate change risks. The report reviews adaptation plans of selected agencies and federal actions to prepare for climate change. The United States' climate has been changing, with climatic variables becoming less predictable. The federal government faces fiscal exposures to climate change due to infrastructure vulnerabilities. The federal government is responsible for protecting property and crops from climate impacts, providing data and assistance to manage climate change, and offering aid during disasters. Climate change brings risks and opportunities, such as increased flood risk from sea-level rise and new opportunities in the Arctic for resource development and tourism. Many factors contribute to wildfires, with researchers expecting further warming and precipitation changes to increase risks on federally owned lands. High temperatures and extreme weather have caused failures in highways, railways, and aviation facilities. The Department of Defense anticipates impacts on military training and installations from thawing permafrost and rising sea levels. The Department of Health and Human Services acknowledges climate change affecting its mission. USDA's APHIS predicts increased demand for genetically engineered crops due to changing climate conditions. Anticipating and preparing for climate change can have significant benefits, with every dollar spent on risk mitigation projects potentially generating multiple monetary benefits. Many believe that proactive adaptation measures are more efficient than reactive responses to climate impacts. As the climate system moves further from historical norms, the benefits of adaptation are expected to increase. Stakeholders across various sectors recognize the importance of preparing for and reducing risks associated with climate change. Federal agencies are recommended to start the adaptation process for climate change, which involves various actions such as developing new plant varieties, making investments to address risks like sea route openings in the Arctic, and examining assumptions in decision-support models. The aim is to use projected changes in temperature and precipitation for adaptation planning. The report focuses on using projected changes in temperature and precipitation for adaptation planning in the continental United States. It highlights the ranges of projections used by agencies and recent initiatives like the Climate Data Initiative and Climate Resilience Fund to support adaptation efforts. Federal agencies have increased planning efforts to adapt to projected impacts of climate change. Since 2009, federal agencies have prioritized climate change adaptation, with initiatives like Executive Order 13514 directing agencies to assess risks and vulnerabilities. State and local governments have also invested in research for adaptation, but comprehensive assessments are lacking. Obama Administration initiatives have increased the focus on federal adaptation to climate change. The Obama Administration strengthened directives on climate change adaptation in 2013 with E.O. 13653, establishing a Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to coordinate efforts across federal agencies. The Obama Administration's E.O. 13653 established a Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to coordinate efforts across federal agencies. The executive order mandated an interagency inventory and assessment of policies to make ecosystems more resilient to climate change. It also created a State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. The Council published \"Priority Agenda: Enhancing the Climate Resilience of America's Natural Resources\" in response to E.O. 13653. It outlines four priority strategies to make U.S. natural resources more resilient to climate change. The Council published a \"Priority Agenda\" to enhance the climate resilience of America's natural resources. The agenda includes strategies to foster climate-resilient lands and waters, manage U.S. carbon sinks, enhance community preparedness, and modernize federal programs. The CNRWG will track implementation under the direction of the interagency Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. Federal agencies will conduct a 12-month appraisal of implementation in 2015. Adaptation planning is crucial for federal agencies to address the impacts of climate change on their missions and operations. Integration of climate change adaptation into government operations will ensure effective services in current and future climate conditions. Common planning steps for federal agencies include setting clear objectives, understanding climate change impacts, developing and implementing actions, evaluating progress, and building awareness and skills. The CCATF provided guiding principles for agencies to build federal resilience to climate change, emphasizing wise investment of resources and maintaining effective operations. Government agencies were encouraged to make efficient decisions, prioritizing options where the benefits of adaptation outweigh the costs. E.O. 13653 promoted integrating climate change efforts into existing processes rather than creating separate offices. E.O. 13653 promoted integrating climate change efforts into existing processes through various interagency working groups. CEQ issued updated draft guidance for federal agencies to consider GHG emissions and climate change effects in their evaluations of proposed actions. The draft guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) advises federal agencies to consider alternatives resilient to climate change effects in proposed actions. It applies to all federal actions, excluding those without agency control. Examples include actions impacting water sources affected by diminishing snowpack or adding heat to water bodies. The NEPA guidance advises federal agencies to consider climate change risks in proposed actions, such as impacts on water sources from decreased snowpack or increased atmospheric temperatures. The guidance is relevant for long-lived projects and recommends engaging environmental justice experts for identifying approaches. The Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice collaborates to mitigate adverse effects on vulnerable communities. Effective coordination is facilitated through the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. The Climate and Natural Resources Working Group focuses on enhancing climate resilience of natural resources and promoting innovative infrastructure. The Climate and Natural Resources Working Group focuses on promoting innovative infrastructure that integrates natural systems into community development and modernizing Federal programs to enhance resilience and carbon storage. The group will monitor the implementation of their Priority Agenda through interagency coordination and appraisal in 2015. Additional mechanisms for information sharing include FedCenter.gov and an Interagency Forum on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations. The Administration has supported cross-agency data exchange efforts such as the Climate Data Initiative to facilitate agency adaptation planning. Coordination among agencies varies, with some departments showing strong collaboration while others lack clear mechanisms. Overall, there is a growing effort in many agencies to address potential climate changes and their impacts. Numerous federal policies and programs exist to reduce agencies' vulnerabilities to climate change, but they may not be labeled as adaptation projects. For example, the requirement to reduce potable water intensity by 2% annually could improve resilience to climate-induced shortages. Identifying these programs may be challenging as they are not explicitly categorized as climate change adaptation. President Obama announced the Climate Data Initiative in March 2014 to provide resources for understanding and preparing for coastal flooding and sea-level rise. The initiative offers access to federal climate change-related statistics and information, aiding agencies in vulnerability assessments and planning efforts. By December 1, 2014, 38 federal departments and agencies were utilizing the data portal. As of December 1, 2014, 38 federal departments and agencies had developed Climate Change Adaptation Plans, with DOD being the most advanced in assessing vulnerabilities. Most agencies' assessments have been at a \"high level\" with generalized information. Many federal agencies are in early stages of assessing climate change risks to their property and operations, with some releasing adaptation plans lacking vulnerability assessments. Many federal agencies are in early stages of assessing climate change risks to their property and operations, with some releasing adaptation plans lacking vulnerability assessments. However, these plans may lack specific location- and event-specific analysis, with little updating occurring between 2012 and 2014. There are few specific adaptation actions taken that tangibly alter federal vulnerabilities at this time. Some federal agencies are taking actions to reduce their vulnerabilities to climate change, especially in identifying mission-critical infrastructure at risk. However, these actions are not yet widespread and may not be fully captured in agency-level planning processes. Pilot activities are being conducted that could lead to broader risk reduction efforts in the future. Federal agencies are using common approaches for climate change adaptation, including researching, assessing, planning, implementing initial actions, developing decision tools, demonstrating response measures, and arranging outreach and training. Climate change has traditionally been addressed separately from agency missions. Some federal agencies have started integrating climate change considerations into their operations, moving away from separate efforts. The goal is to mainstream climate change data into programmatic decisions and actions, rather than creating isolated teams or efforts. Some federal agencies are integrating climate change considerations into their operations to mainstream climate change data into programmatic decisions and actions. Active examples include the Northwoods Climate Change Response Framework in northern Wisconsin and the Exotic Plant Management Teams of the National Park Service. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Facilities Design Guide includes climate change-related principles for project managers and Architect-Engineer firms. The Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has launched the Comprehensive Evaluation of Projects with Respect to Sea Level Change (CESL) to assess coastal project vulnerability to sea-level change. The web-based tool allows users to enter data, view project information, SLC curves for tidal gauges, Extreme Water Level information, and projects on a map interface. DOD is addressing sea-level rise in the Hampton Roads, VA region. CRS identified examples of adaptation efforts but not widespread changes in federal decision making. To be effective, policies must lead to changes in decision-making practices by agency resource managers. Agencies have focused on understanding vulnerabilities and benefits of climate change. Climate shifts may impact operations and assets, such as increased activity in the Arctic prompting attention to an evolving Arctic Strategy. DOD's Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap highlighted the real impacts on military missions. The military may need to provide more support for civil authorities and disaster relief due to increasing natural disasters. Coastal installations are at risk from rising sea levels and flooding, while extreme weather could impact training activities and supply chains. Climate change is already affecting DOD facilities, with wildfires expected to increase significantly by 2050. The USDA's Farm Service Agency is evaluating if its crop programs promote climate adaptation. Many NASA facilities have been damaged by natural disasters. An agency-wide assessment found that changing climate will impact operations and infrastructure. NASA and NPS are addressing climate-related vulnerabilities to their missions and facilities, including impacts on infrastructure, natural resources, quality of life, and the economy. NASA is conducting detailed analysis and planning at multiple facilities, while NPS is mainstreaming climate change adaptation at a policy level. The National Park Service (NPS) is rethinking its mission of preserving lands in their historical condition in light of climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is examining how climate change could increase contaminant releases at various sites, posing risks to health and the environment. Saltwater intrusion and increased groundwater salinity may impact waste sites, potentially allowing contaminants to spread. Hoover Dam is implementing actions to improve resilience to a changing climate. Agencies are regionalizing their approaches to climate change adaptation, which may complicate assessments due to differing definitions of regions. This includes discrepancies in geographic regions used by different programs and agencies. The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) uses Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) and Climate Science Centers (CSCs) for climate monitoring. Different federal agencies have varying regional schemes, leading to challenges in accessing relevant information on climate change impacts. Most federal agencies have regional schemes tied to their missions and resources, posing challenges for sharing information. Adaptation planning focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change, with some agencies prioritizing assistance to clients. Most federal agencies have regional schemes tied to their missions and resources, posing challenges for sharing information. Adaptation planning focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and opportunities to climate change, with some agencies prioritizing assistance to clients. However, agencies have done little to understand their own vulnerabilities or opportunities. Some agencies have started implementing adaptation measures, mainly as pilot or demonstration efforts. Agencies like DOD, EPA, NASA, and DOT are more advanced in preparing for climate change, while others focus on helping clients prepare. Action plans have identified benefits from planning for climate change adaptation. Planning for climate change adaptation involves identifying actions with no cost or net benefits, limiting federal financial liability for disaster losses, modifying infrastructure specifications, making assets and operations robust to potential disruptions, and facilitating rapid responses to acute weather events. Examples include identifying toxic chemicals in flood zones, increasing community preparedness for extreme weather events, reviewing building requirements for future climate conditions, and maintaining essential operations during water shortages. Climate change adaptation involves identifying potential benefits such as increased accessibility of Arctic resources and longer growing seasons. Evaluations are needed to assess the effectiveness, costs, and barriers to adaptation efforts. Adaptation efforts face challenges due to limited funds, lack of site-specific data, and unclear roles among agencies. Communication and report-writing are prioritized, but sharing information and making decisions remain difficult. Adaptation efforts encounter challenges such as funding constraints, information management issues, and uncertainty. Lack of funding is a primary obstacle, with resources for decision-making often more accessible than those for adaptation actions. Agencies may struggle to estimate the costs of adaptation efforts and few have requested specific appropriations for such activities in budget requests. Budget constraints and federal scrutiny limit financial resources for federal adaptation actions. The President's FY2016 budget request and other announcements mention adaptation to climate change, but most programs are outside the scope of this report. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided for details on agency adaptation plans. Accessing climate data and having the right skill sets remain challenges for federal and nonfederal entities. Accessing climate data and having the right skill sets remain important obstacles for federal agencies in preparing for climate change. Lack of information on projections of demographic, economic, and technological factors, as well as built infrastructure, hinders the development of adaptation plans. The Obama Administration initiated an Internet portal to address these challenges. The Obama Administration initiated an Internet portal (http://www.data.gov/climate/) to provide climate-related data and tools for users. The website offers data sets, mapping tools, and challenges for developing applications to address specific climate-related problems. Agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey are also working to provide climate change information to assist in adaptation assessment. The Obama Administration launched a climate data initiative to make climate-related data more accessible. Efforts include a publicly available archive of high-resolution climate projections and the USGCRP's MATCH portal for accessing government-held data related to health, environment, and climate science. Organizations need to utilize climate change information effectively. Improving expertise and institutional flexibility to use climate change information is crucial for adaptation planning. Uncertainties in global climate projections increase over time, especially at regional and local levels. Federal adaptation planners must integrate future climate scenarios with local data for effective decision-making. Planning for climate change involves discerning when it may become important and how it may exceed existing assets' adaptability. Statistical methods are crucial for making robust decisions, especially in determining potential \"tipping points\" where climate change may exceed tolerance levels. The White House has guided federal agency adaptation planning, but Congress may oversee and provide advice on adaptation efforts. Congress may consider reviewing the significance and nature of climate change risks to the federal government, evaluating cost-beneficial adaptations, and providing direction to federal agencies on organizing and funding adaptation efforts. They may also assess the accessibility of adaptation-relevant information and review strategies in place. Congress may consider options for authorities, directions, and resources to overcome data management and accessibility challenges related to climate change adaptation. This includes evaluating the role, costs, and benefits of adapting federal agencies to projected climate change, as well as considering broader public policy concerns such as natural disaster preparedness, energy management, and public health. Improved information and analysis are needed to support examination of various adaptation approaches in these fields. The federal government is addressing climate change adaptation through various approaches, with over 30 departments and agencies producing reports on their efforts. The Department of Agriculture manages a significant amount of national land. Additional agencies and updates may be included in the summaries, subject to congressional interest. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) manages national forests and provides assistance for agricultural production. Climate change impacts agriculture and forest landscapes, requiring adaptation and new management techniques. Forest ecosystems and agricultural land play a crucial role in mitigating rising carbon levels by removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in vegetation and soil. However, the rapid pace and magnitude of climate change may exceed the resistance and resilience capacity of many forests, making appropriate management of disturbances critical to avoid potential future releases of large amounts of carbon. The USDA issued Departmental Regulation 1070-001 in June 2011, establishing its Official Policy Statement on Climate Change Adaptation. The Climate Change Program Office (CCPO) was designated as the point of contact for developing the Adaptation Plan required by Executive Order 13514. The CCPO also represents USDA to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, chairs the USDA Global Change Task Force, and oversees departmental greenhouse gas accounting capabilities. Additionally, USDA offices and agencies provided input for the USDA Climate Change Adaptation Plan under the direction of the CCPO. The USDA Climate Change Adaptation Plan includes specific plans from various USDA agencies and offices such as ARS, APHIS, FSA, FAS, FS, GIPSA, NASS, NIFA, NRCS, RMA, and RD. Each agency outlined actions for climate change adaptation with timelines, performance metrics, and agency leads provided in tabular format. The full plan and individual sections can be accessed on USDA's climate change website. The USDA's Climate Change Adaptation Plan focuses on Goal 2 of its strategic plan for FY2010-FY2015, which aims to make national forests and private working lands more resilient to climate change. This goal is reflected in the annual budget request, adaptation plan, and various agency activities. The full plan and individual sections can be found on USDA's climate change website. The USDA's Climate Change Program Office is responsible for coordinating and leading the department's response to climate change. This includes analysis, planning, research coordination, developing response strategies, liaising with other federal agencies, and integrating climate change concerns into USDA's decision-making processes. USDA also participates in various interagency efforts related to climate change. The USDA announced the creation of regional hubs for climate change adaptation and mitigation in February 2014. These hubs provide support for agricultural producers, assess risks to agricultural production, and educate clients about the impact of climate change on agriculture and forests. The U.S. Forest Service, an agency within USDA, aims to sustain the health and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands for future generations. The U.S. Forest Service (FS) is responsible for managing national forests and grasslands, conducting forestry research, and providing assistance to forestry agencies. FS plays a significant role in climate change activities within USDA, focusing on federal land management, research, and outreach. They address climate change through strategic planning, policy initiatives, and responding to wildfires. The U.S. Forest Service (FS) manages national forests and grasslands, conducts forestry research, and provides assistance to forestry agencies. Climate change research is a priority area for FS, with a focus on adaptation, mitigation, and decision-support strategies. FS also offers technical and financial assistance for forest health management projects and collaborates with USDA Regional Climate Hubs. Additionally, FS conducts regular forest inventory and analysis programs to monitor ecosystem changes over time and addresses climate change in international forestry issues. The U.S. Forest Service (FS) focuses on climate change research, adaptation, and mitigation strategies. They offer technical assistance for forest health management and collaborate with USDA Regional Climate Hubs. FS also conducts regular forest inventory programs to monitor ecosystem changes over time and addresses climate change in international forestry issues through policy engagement and technical cooperation. The Climate Change Resource Center provides tools for land managers and decision makers to incorporate climate change management activities into planning and project management. FS has developed policy initiatives in response to climate change, including the Strategic Framework for Responding to Climate Change with seven overarching goals. The U.S. Forest Service (FS) published the National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change in 2011, outlining three modes of action: assessing risks, engaging stakeholders, and managing for resilience. A performance scorecard was developed to measure progress, with a goal for national forests to achieve 7 out of 10 benchmarks by 2015. By 2013, 49% of national forests were in compliance with the roadmap. The U.S. Forest Service is establishing a restoration and resilience policy to manage national forests sustainably. The policy focuses on restoration strategies to enhance ecosystem capacity and resilience post-disturbance. The FS 2012 Planning Rule provides an adaptive framework for incorporating resilience goals into land management planning. The adaptive framework for land management planning includes an expanded inventory and monitoring system to assess progress towards restoration goals. The Forest Service has programs like the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program to accelerate large-scale restoration projects. The Natural Resources Conservation Service assists private landowners with addressing natural resource concerns through technical assistance and financial incentive programs. The NRCS found that conservation practices are effective for mitigating greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. Recommendations include integrating climate adaptation into current conservation structures and adjusting planning approaches for a more holistic conservation delivery. The ARS is the research agency at USDA organized into \"National Programs.\" The ARS is the in-house research agency at USDA, organized into \"National Programs\" that coordinate research. Under the National Climate Change, Soils, and Emissions program, ARS works to improve atmosphere and soil quality affected by agriculture and prepare for climate change adaptation. They support soil and atmospheric research projects, including AgMIP, to enhance world food security and adaptation capacity. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) provides federal crop insurance and other risk management products to assist producers in minimizing risks from climate change and weather-related conditions. Collaborations with state departments of agriculture and universities aim to develop tools for adaptation. RMA's report in 2010 highlighted varying impacts of climate change on crop insurance across different regions, with the South and Southeast being more negatively affected. Partnerships, such as with Oregon State University to build PRISM, focus on climate and weather data management. Program implementation procedures are being updated by the agency. The Risk Management Agency is updating program implementation procedures for crop insurance to reflect changes in climate and agronomics. Congress has shifted risk management for agriculture towards more permanent disaster support programs and federal crop insurance. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports research, education, and extension programs in the Land-Grant University System and other organizations, with a focus on climate change as a priority science area. Projects are administered through the Institute of Bioenergy, Climate, and Environment (IBCE) to help agricultural systems adapt to climate variables. NIFA-funded grants for climate change are multimillion-dollar projects addressing adaptation. NIFA-funded climate change projects are multimillion-dollar, transdisciplinary efforts focusing on adapting food, feed, and fiber production systems to changing climates. The agency anticipates the need to balance research, modeling, and educational programs to address climate change issues in agriculture. APHIS is responsible for safeguarding U.S. agriculture's health. APHIS plays a crucial role in protecting U.S. agriculture and natural resources from pests and diseases amidst climate change. The agency focuses on plant health programs, early-warning systems for vector-borne diseases, trade regulations, emergency preparedness, and collaboration with various partners. APHIS does not foresee the need to modify its authority due to climate change and plans to continue its efforts. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) plans to adopt regulations and policies to address pest and disease scenarios, including climate change adaptation actions such as amending policy, providing outreach to producers, and preparing for crop failures. The agency administers financial incentives for farmers through various programs reauthorized by the 2014 farm bill. The USDA has various programs in place for climate change response, but they have not been specifically amended for adaptation. Agriculture and forestry face challenges from weather, disease, and pests that could be impacted by climate change. The USDA could play a crucial role in assisting producers with climate adaptation, but challenges remain in this area. The USDA's existing federal policies may hinder adaptation-related activities in agriculture and forestry. Producers are not required to adopt recommended practices, which could slow adaptation to climate change. Federal funding for research and conservation in this area has declined, with some private-sector funding filling the gap. There is a growing concern that private-sector funding in research and conservation focuses more on applied research rather than addressing basic problems and long-term challenges in agriculture and forestry, such as climate adaptation. The rising cost of suppressing wildfires is also a funding concern. While there is recognition at the department level for a coordinated response to climate adaptation, agency-level actions appear to diverge, resulting in inconsistent application of adaptation plans across USDA agencies. The USDA has recognized the need to adapt programs to climate change, with tangible results like RMA expanding coverage to new crop areas. Other agencies lack flexibility or funding for adaptation measures. The Department of Commerce focuses on promoting U.S. business and foreign trade. The Department of Commerce focuses on promoting U.S. business, increasing foreign trade, improving technological competitiveness, encouraging economic development, fostering environmental stewardship, and analyzing statistical information on the economy and population. In response to E.O. 13514, the Secretary of Commerce signed DAO 216-18, establishing a Climate Coordinating Committee to develop a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (CCAS) to ensure the department's mission and operations in a changing climate. The CCAS was released in 2012 and updated in 2014. The Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (CCAS) for the Department of Commerce was updated in June 2014 to incorporate lessons learned and guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality. It identifies key climate change vulnerabilities and priority adaptation actions organized by strategic themes such as economic growth, science, environmental stewardship, and infrastructure management. The CCAS also includes five-year strategic goals, interagency coordination support, barriers to federal climate resilience investment, and opportunities for improvement. The Department of Commerce's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (CCAS) addresses barriers to federal climate resilience investment and identifies opportunities for climate resilient investments by states, local communities, and tribes. Businesses may face challenges from climate change affecting production, transportation, and infrastructure, but also have opportunities in clean energy and climate-friendly technologies. The Department of Commerce's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (CCAS) aims to assist companies in turning innovative climate-friendly technologies into a competitive advantage for the U.S. economy. It identifies adaptation actions for economic growth, such as incorporating resiliency into economic development investments and helping businesses capitalize on the demand for green technologies. Lead offices within DOC are designated for each action. The Department of Commerce aims to improve the processing of patent applications for climate change adaptation technologies. Scientific knowledge is enhanced to support innovation, economic growth, and public safety. Climate change is expected to increase the demand for climate-related data in various sectors for modeling and assessing changes. This data is crucial for adaptation efforts by federal agencies. Understanding climate-related changes can benefit the U.S. economy, society, and the environment. Improving understanding of climate change can minimize risks to public safety and economic losses. The Department of Commerce will enhance information collection and scientific capabilities to meet the data needs of federal partners, state and local government, and businesses vulnerable to climate change. Adaptation actions include coordinating research partnerships to better understand climate impacts. The Department of Commerce is working on partnerships to understand climate variability and its effects on communities and ecological processes. They are developing frameworks and tools for coral reef managers, building designs resistant to extreme weather, preparing for ocean acidification, and supporting adaptation decisions through the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). Lead offices include NOAA and NIST. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports adaptation decisions with climate data, forecasts, and tools to respond to extreme weather and water events. They also develop climate change adaptation information for the Arctic region as part of their mission to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts. NOAA's focus on climate adaptation is essential for building resilient ecosystems, communities, and economies. NOAA's mission includes modifying management systems to increase resilience to climate change impacts like rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and ocean acidification. Climate change may also affect coastal and ocean ecosystems by allowing pathogens, parasites, and invasive species to thrive in new areas, leading to shifts in fish stocks and marine organisms. To address vulnerabilities, NOAA will need to incorporate climate considerations into natural resource and coastal planning for healthy and resilient coastal communities. NOAA is taking adaptation actions to address vulnerabilities related to environmental stewardship. This includes developing networks of \"sentinel sites\" to improve response to sea-level change impacts, tracking climate-related impacts on marine ecosystems and fish stocks, assessing climate vulnerability of fish stocks and fishing communities, providing training to coastal communities to adapt to climate change, enhancing climate resilience of endangered corals, and developing climate-ready protection for Pacific Northwest salmon and other riverine-dependent species. Climate change could impact DOC's ability to deliver services effectively and efficiently, affecting facilities and infrastructure. Adaptation actions in FY2014 included assessing vulnerabilities of leased facilities and collaborating with GSA to analyze climate change risks for real property assets. The Department of Commerce faces challenges in implementing actions related to climate change in ocean and marine areas, requiring coordination among federal agencies and other entities. Elevated carbon dioxide levels, warming oceans, and sea-level rise will impact marine ecosystems and coastal infrastructure. Coordination among federal, state, and local authorities is crucial to address these challenges and avoid duplication in climate change adaptation efforts. Effective communication is needed to ensure information flow among agencies and governments. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlights the involvement of various federal agencies in ocean and coastal policy development. The Department of Defense is vulnerable to climate change impacts, affecting geopolitics, national security, military operations, infrastructure, and readiness. The Air Force and Army Corps of Engineers are facing challenges due to climate change, such as coastal erosion in Alaska. Congress mandated assessments of climate change risks for military planners in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 mandated assessments of climate change risks for military planners. This led to updates in defense plans, including incorporating climate mitigation strategies and developing capabilities to reduce future impacts. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review and national security strategy included discussions on climate change, laying the foundation for the Department of Defense's strategic policy on the issue. The 2010 QDR is the basis for DOD's strategic policy on climate change adaptation. DOD has published Climate Change Adaptation Roadmaps in 2012, 2013, and 2014, addressing the risks posed by climate change to military operations worldwide. Climate change can impact military operations by potentially leading to conflicts between nations, instability within nations, and more severe natural disasters. The military may need to adjust the type, scope, frequency, and location of operations in response to these scenarios. Additionally, climate change can alter the physical environment in which the military operates, affecting amphibious landings, operational timing, and intelligence-gathering capabilities. Climate change can exacerbate conflict and instability by impacting geopolitical factors such as poverty, environmental degradation, and water scarcity. The 2014 National Intelligence Strategy highlighted that governments will struggle to meet basic needs due to demographic changes, resource constraints, climate change effects, and global infectious diseases. These effects act as threat multipliers, increasing the risk of conflict, mass atrocities, and terrorist activities. The National Intelligence Council found that Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Central and Southeast Asia are most vulnerable to climate change-related impacts like drought, flooding, and extreme weather, leading to food insecurity. The Department of Defense (DOD) may need to respond to climate change-related conflict or instability, affecting military roles and missions. DOD has a mission for humanitarian assistance/disaster relief and has historically provided support to foreign nations for humanitarian needs, building military capacity, and strengthening governments. The Department of Defense (DOD) utilizes its unique capabilities to provide foreign assistance, including state-building measures and addressing climate-related challenges. DOD's resources, such as manpower and organizational assets, allow for preemptive actions to prevent conflict, instability, and humanitarian crises. For instance, DOD can produce drinking water from sea water using a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, aiding remote populations during crises. The Army Corps of Engineers can assist nations in developing infrastructure for critical government services like water access. The Department of Defense maintains over 555,000 facilities worldwide, valued at $874 billion, facing risks from climate change impacts. DOD's operational readiness relies on reliable access to installations and facilities. The Department of Defense's installations face direct risks from climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, storm surge, drought, extreme heat, and changes in weather conditions. Climate-related effects are already observed at military installations globally. The impacts of climate change on military installations vary by region and could increase maintenance costs and affect operational support. DOD relies on non-DOD infrastructure, and changes in local towns or cities could impact nearby bases. DOD's FY 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap outlines goals for addressing climate change. The Department of Defense is incorporating climate change considerations into planning and policy, collaborating with other agencies and organizations. Dr. Daniel Chiu stated that a review in 2013 identified 28 policies for update, with five already completed. This is in addition to DOD's climate change adaptation roadmap. DOD established goals for reducing energy, water, and fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing sustainable practices to create climate-resilient installations. Research on climate change impacts includes the need for vulnerability assessments and adaptive responses. DOD plans to conduct research on climate system modeling and adaptation methods to manage climate change risks strategically. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) develop a plan with milestones to assess vulnerabilities of its installations to climate change. DOD is partnering with the Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) to conduct research on climate change impacts and adaptation methods. SERDP, established in 1990 to coordinate environmental research across military services, is developing climate change assessment tools for DOD installations. DOD is producing reports on adaptation science and vulnerability assessment. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is overseeing climate change adaptation, with each military department undertaking adaptation activities. The Army has a climate change working group. The Army and Air Force are actively addressing climate change concerns by forming working groups, conducting vulnerability assessments, and incorporating climate change considerations into policies and plans. Reports have been issued to guide adaptation efforts, with the Air Force also including climate change in its strategic environment assessment. The Navy's climate change adaptation activities are well-developed, with Task Force Climate Change established earlier than other military services. Facility-specific assessments have been initiated, and the Navy released its first Arctic Roadmap in 2009. The Navy does not plan to issue an updated climate change roadmap as all services now work within the DOD-wide task force. The Department of Defense Arctic Strategy highlights fiscal constraints that may impact investment in the Arctic. The Department of Defense's Arctic Strategy acknowledges fiscal constraints that could delay necessary investments in Arctic capabilities. As the Department downsizes to meet budget targets, prioritizing engagements for a smaller force becomes crucial. There is a risk that desired investments in Arctic capabilities may not compete successfully against other budgetary priorities. DOD's approach is to monitor changes in the Arctic and geostrategic situation to determine the timing for future capability investment. Congress may need to consider where climate change ranks in DOD priorities and how much resources should be allocated to address potential risks posed by climate change and the evolving Arctic climate. Congress may need to consider the extent to which DOD is preparing for the potential effects of climate change globally, including identifying vulnerable regions, incorporating climate change impacts into plans, operations, and infrastructure maintenance, and dedicating resources to mitigate risks. Additionally, Congress should assess the potential risks climate change poses to the industrial base supporting DOD, as climate-related effects are already being observed at DOD installations. The Army Corps of Engineers (USACE or the Corps) within DOD plans, builds, and maintains water resources facilities sensitive to climate changes like droughts, floods, storms, and sea-level rise. It is unclear if DOD will assess the impact of climate change on critical industrial base facilities or evaluate contractor readiness for environmental changes. The Army Corps of Engineers (USACE or the Corps) within DOD is expected to be affected by climate change, impacting its responsibilities for navigation, flood control, hydropower, and ecosystem restoration. Vulnerabilities due to flooding, drought, and wetland degradation/sea-level rise have been identified in various projects. The Corps aims to understand potential threats and implement adaptation strategies in response to climate change. The Army Corps of Engineers is facing threats to its missions and operations due to climate change. While the Corps considers climate science outside its primary mission, its adaptation strategies and policies can impact nonfederal entities relying on its infrastructure. The Corps' climate change planning aligns with the Obama Administration's policy framework. The Corps is actively involved in climate change adaptation efforts, aligning with federal policies and participating in interagency working groups. Their 2011 Climate Change Adaptation Policy Statement guides their integration of climate planning into agency missions and projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has integrated climate change adaptation into its missions, operations, programs, and projects. They established the Responses to Climate Change (RCC) program in 2010 to reduce vulnerability of Corps facilities. The program focuses on developing assessment frameworks and tools to characterize vulnerabilities and incorporate changes into planning processes. In 2011, the Corps collaborated with NOAA and USGS to create guidance for assessing the impact of sea-level change.

In FY2015, EPA plans to promote climate change adaptation in water, wastewater, and stormwater systems by increasing the role of the CRWU Initiative in emergency response and preparedness efforts. Funds realigned from the water security program will be used to develop a more robust climate resilience evaluation tool that incorporates sea-level rise and storm surge components. OSWER will prioritize actions to manage waste and debris from extreme climate-related events, including cooperation with DHS. Inspector training and guidelines will be enhanced to prevent contamination from chemical releases. The EPA is taking steps to address climate change adaptation in various areas such as waste cleanup, laboratory asset vulnerability reduction, and enforcement compliance assistance. Measures include gathering information, increasing outreach, applying screening analysis mapping, and incorporating climate change criteria in grant development. The EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance (OECA) inspects facilities managing hazardous wastes, oil, toxic chemicals, and stormwater in FEMA flood zones for environmental compliance. EPA Regional Offices are also incorporating climate adaptations into post-disaster redevelopment plans and identifying vulnerable populations for air quality emergencies. The EPA's adaptation plan prioritizes addressing vulnerabilities to climate change, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, low-income communities, and tribes. Limited studies exist on the vulnerability of health and environmental protection to climate change, with three quantitative Strategic Measures set by the agency. However, the October 2014 report lacked specific discussion on progress towards achieving these measures. The EPA has developed resources to assist in assessing water resource and management issues related to climate change. One of their early efforts was supporting the development of Heat Health Watch/Warning Systems to reduce deaths from extreme heat events. For example, EPA helped the Philadelphia Department of Public Health develop a heat warning system that saved 117 lives between 1995 and 1998. The EPA has developed a heat warning system that saved 117 lives between 1995 and 1998. Congress may consider issues related to climate change adaptation, such as the reliability of climate data, accessibility of information, and EPA's authority in pursuing adaptation measures. The EPA may need to determine its authorities regarding climate change impacts in setting standards or issuing permits. Oversight interest may lie in the relationships between EPA's statutory authorities and expenditures for climate initiatives. Quantifying adaptation outcomes for health and the environment in budget justifications could pose challenges. It may be difficult to separate resources allocated to climate change adaptation activities from core mission activities in the water sector. The allocation of resources to adaptation activities and their impact on core statutory missions may need clarification. The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) focuses on reducing loss from all hazards, including climate change impacts. FEMA leads the nation in emergency management for preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. FEMA plays a key role in guiding nationwide adaptation to climate change related to extreme weather events. FEMA expects climate change to impact the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, leading to more natural disasters such as heavy precipitation, flooding, heat waves, and droughts. This may result in new risks for communities, but not all changes will have negative outcomes. FEMA is working to integrate climate change adaptation into existing programs and policies to mitigate threats from natural disasters. Climate change is identified as a key driver of future emergency management needs. The agency notes climate change as a key driver of future emergency management needs, with implications exacerbated by aging infrastructure, lower government budgets, and demographic concentration in cities and coastal areas.

This includes the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and DOI Climate Science Centers, which support research and data synthesis at regional levels. The National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) is located at the USGS headquarters in Reston, VA. The Climate Science Centers (CSCs) were once regional hubs of the NCCWSC but now have broader missions to evaluate climate change impacts on DOI's resources. In FY2013, DOI mandated that the centers incorporate climate change adaptation into their policies and programs. USGS manages and maintains the CSCs. The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) were created in 2009 under S.O. 3289 to address the effects of climate change on land and water resources. Each LCC focuses on a specific region of the United States and is a collaboration of research institutions, federal resource managers, and scientists. There is a concern in Congress about potential overlap and duplication among DOI agencies and other federal agencies in addressing global climate change. Agencies have increased focus on global climate change, leading to concerns about overlap, duplication, and gaps in agency science and adaptation efforts. It is challenging to determine if duplication is due to similar names or confusing agency histories. The relationship among DOI programs is unclear, with differing cultures and missions potentially affecting views on science and data needs. Constraints on reducing duplication or gaps could be statutory, budgetary, or cultural. Effectiveness of adaptation measures for DOI may be hindered by uncertainties surrounding climate change and its impacts on resources. The uncertainties surrounding climate change and its effects on resources make it difficult to develop reliable metrics for adaptation effectiveness. The Fish and Wildlife Service's LCC program has provided decision-support tools for conservation managers, but the effectiveness of these efforts is unclear. Assessing the effectiveness of adaptation programs is challenging due to varying climatic conditions nationwide and changing conditions at the regional level. Agency budgets and appropriations for climate change adaptation activities are also important issues to consider. Issues related to agency budgets and appropriations for climate change adaptation activities, including congressional interest in appropriations levels for DOI agency activities, efforts to expand or restrict monitoring programs, and initiatives to alter DOI agency participation in cooperative climate programs. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers 247.3 million acres of federal lands in 12 western states, with Alaska and Nevada holding the majority. BLM manages lands for multiple uses including recreation, grazing, energy development, and conservation. The Bureau of Land Management inventories its lands and resources, develops land use plans, and allows public use for diverse opportunities. Climate change is a factor in changes to western lands, leading to desertification, decreased rangeland productivity, increased vulnerability of forested lands to insects and disease, larger wildfires, and melting glaciers in Alaska. BLM is focused on adapting to these changes. The Bureau of Land Management is adapting to climate change by focusing on a landscape approach to managing lands and conducting rapid ecoregional assessments.
