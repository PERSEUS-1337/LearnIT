    "content": "The 111th Congress is focused on supporting federal research and development (R&D) activities for national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security. The government funds a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D to advance knowledge, develop the workforce, and enhance innovation and competitiveness. Federal R&D efforts have led to breakthroughs in technologies like jet aircraft, the Internet, communications satellites, and disease defenses. President Obama requested $147.620 billion for R&D in May 2009. President Obama requested $147.620 billion for R&D in FY2010, with a focus on increasing funding for physical sciences and engineering. This included increased funding for the Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. President Obama aimed to increase national R&D investment to over 3% of the U.S. GDP, but did not provide specifics on how to achieve this goal. In 2007, total U.S. R&D expenditures were $368.1 billion, approximately 2.7% of GDP. Reaching the 3% goal would require a 12.5% real increase in national R&D funding. Increasing federal R&D funding by 12.5% in FY2010 would have required over $18 billion above President Obama's request. Concerns were raised about the negative effects of a \"boom-bust\" approach to funding, as seen in the biomedical research community after the NIH budget doubled in FY2003. The NIH budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009, leading to adverse effects on research, grant funding, student interest in graduate studies, and job prospects for biomedical researchers. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by factors such as inconsistent reporting and the inclusion of funding for facilities and equipment in FY2009 and FY2010. The inclusion of funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) impacted federal R&D funding for FY2009 and FY2010. ARRA funds supplemented funding provided to agencies in previous legislation. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) reported R&D agency figures, which may differ from agency budget analyses. Federal R&D funding can be analyzed from various perspectives for unique insights. The authorization and appropriations process views federal R&D funding primarily from agency and program perspectives. Table 1 provides data on R&D by agency for FY2008 (actual), FY2009 (estimate), ARRA, and FY2010 (request) as reported by OMB. President Obama's FY2010 budget request allocated 95.1% of total federal R&D funding to six agencies: DOD (54.0%), HHS (21.0%), NASA (7.7%), DOE (7.3%), NSF (3.6%), and USDA (1.5%). This report analyzes the R&D budget requests for these agencies and others like DOC, Homeland Security, DOI, DOT, and EPA. In FY2010, President Obama aimed to double federal investment in basic research agencies like DOE's Office of Science, NSF, and DOC's NIST labs. This continued the American Competitiveness Initiative started by President Bush to increase physical sciences and engineering research. Congress authorized significant R&D increases under the America COMPETES Act, setting a more aggressive seven-year doubling course. In FY2010, President Obama proposed significant increases in federal R&D funding for agencies like NASA, Department of Health and Human Services, and National Science Foundation. The budget included $30.884 billion for basic research, $28.139 billion for applied research, $84.054 billion for development, and $4.543 billion for facilities and equipment. Federal R&D funding is allocated for basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. The government is the largest supporter of basic research, funding 59.0% in 2007, with the Department of Health and Human Services (primarily NIH) contributing over half of all federal funding for basic research in FY2009. Industry is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, accounting for 61.1% in 2007. In 2007, industry provided 83.2% of funding for development, while the federal government provided 15.7%. HHS is the largest funder of applied research, accounting for nearly half of all federally funded applied research in FY2009. DOD is the primary federal agency funder of development, accounting for 87.6% of total federal development funding in FY2009. Federal R&D funding includes multi-agency efforts like the National Nanotechnology Initiative and presidential initiatives like the American Competitiveness Initiative. President Obama aimed to double funding for basic research over ten years at agencies like NSF and DOE's Office of. President Obama proposed doubling funding for basic research over ten years at agencies like NSF, DOE's Office of Science, and NIST. However, actual funding fell below doubling targets in FY2008. For FY2010, Obama proposed $12.638 billion in funding, an increase of $731 million (6.1%) from FY2009. Congress appropriated $11.907 billion in FY2009, an increase of $1.176 billion (11.0%) from FY2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided additional funding for ACI agencies, totaling approximately $5.182 billion. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $1.637 billion for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, a decrease of $17 million from FY2009. All twelve FY2010 appropriations bills have been enacted. In FY2010, there was a decrease in funding for DOD nanotechnology R&D, offset by increases in other agencies like NSF, HHS, and DOE. President Obama requested $3.927 billion for the NITRD program, with increases for NSF and DOE but a decrease for DOD. The Obama Administration proposed $2.026 billion for the Climate Change Science Program in FY2010. In FY2010, the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) was allocated $2.026 billion, with significant funding increases for NSF and DOI's U.S. Geological Survey, offset by reductions in funding for NOAA and NASA. Congress also supports research and development in the Department of Defense through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation. The Department of Defense (DOD) allocates funds for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) in various parts of the defense appropriation bill, including the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. These programs support health care delivery to DOD personnel, Congressionally directed research in medical areas, and activities to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions. Additionally, funds for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) are also requested. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF) contains additional RDT&E funds, administered by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office. These funds are typically allocated in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill and are separate from the RDT&E funds for the Global War on Terror/Overseas Contingency Operations. The Bush and Obama Administrations requested funds for activities related to the Global War on Terror/Overseas Contingency Operations (GWOT/OCO) separately. These funds include the Iraqi Freedom Fund, Iraqi Security Forces Fund, Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, Mine Resistant and Ambush Protected Vehicle Fund, and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. Congress typically makes a single appropriation for each fund and authorizes the Secretary to make transfers to other accounts as needed. In FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $78.634 billion for these activities. The Obama Administration requested $78.634 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E in FY2010, which was $2 billion less than the previous year. Additional funding was requested for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments and DOD agencies, and can be categorized by budget activity. The DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) includes basic research, applied research, and advanced development. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on developing specific weapon systems, while 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Congress is interested in S&T funding for developing new technologies to maintain U.S. military superiority. The DOD's Science and Technology Program aims to stabilize baseline S&T funding at 3% of DOD's overall funding. The FY2010 baseline S&T funding request was $11.650 billion, falling short of the 3% goal. Basic research (6.1) receives special attention, especially from universities. The DOD's basic research budget receives special attention from universities, with over half of it spent at universities. The FY2010 request for basic research was slightly less than the FY2008 appropriation. The House approved $1.9 billion for basic research in the defense appropriations bill. The House approved a technical revision shifting $26 million to the RDT&E account within the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. Despite a recommended cut of $50 million in the RDT&E account, the House added $50 million back into the program. Additionally, the House approved $214 million in RDT&E for Overseas Contingency Operations, reducing the Navy's request by declaring some line items as non-emergency or insufficiently justified. The Senate passed its version of the FY2010 defense appropriations bill, approving $78.450 billion for baseline Title IV RDTE, including $12.319 billion for S&T with $1.785 billion for basic research. The Senate approved $999 million for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program, $401 million for RDT&E in the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and $294 million for OCO RDT&E. Differences between the House and Senate versions included reallocation of funds within the Army's Future Combat System program and changes to the Navy's Executive Helicopter Development program. The final enacted FY2010 DOD appropriation bill (P.L. 111-118) provided $80.2 billion for Title IV RDT&E, with $14 billion allocated to S&T funding, representing 2.2% of the $600 billion baseline DOD appropriation. The bill also included $1.3 billion for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and $401 million for RDT&E in other areas. The FY2010 DOD appropriation bill provided funding for various RDT&E programs, including $1.3 billion for the Defense Health Program, $401 million for Chemical Agent and Munitions Destruction, and $268 million for OCO-related RDT&E. Funding was allocated for Army's Future Combat System, Aerial Common Sensor program, Executive Helicopter Development program, and next-generation tanker aircraft. Conferees agreed on Joint Strike Fighter funding but differed on OCO RDT&E funding. The Senate disagreed with the House on OCO RDT&E funding and added $9 million for a Marine Immersive Training program. The Obama Administration included FY2010 OCO request in the baseline DOD budget and made an FY2009 supplemental OCO request. The House and Senate passed their versions of the bill, with the conference committee recommending $833 million for Title IV RDT&E funds to accelerate technology development for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration requested $34 million in RDT&E funding for research in information technologies in support of the Wounded, Ill, and Injured program. The House provided $201 million, with $168 million directed towards research in traumatic brain injuries, psychological health, and orthopedics. The Senate recommended the requested $34 million, while the conference committee recommended $160 million. Differences between the House and Senate versions include the Navy's Manned Reconnaissance Systems request being zeroed by the House and increased by $26 million by the Senate. The Senate also added $61 million to the Air Force request for LINK 16 Support and Sustainment. The House and Senate versions differed in their recommendations for RDT&E funding in the Defense Health Program. The conference committee ultimately split the differences between the two versions, with the House recommendations adopted for Navy and Defensewide accounts, and Senate recommendations for Army and Air Force accounts. The conference also reached a compromise on RDT&E funding in the Defense Health Program. The final bill was passed by the House on June 16, the Senate on June 18, and signed into law by President Obama on June 24, 2009. Additionally, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 13, which included $300 million for DOD Title IV RDT&E. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.354 billion for R&D programs in FY2010, with allocations for S&T, DNDO, and Coast Guard RDT&E. The House and Senate bills differed in funding allocations, with the House proposing $1.403 billion and the Senate proposing $1.384 billion. The final bill (P.L. 111-83) provided a total of $1.401 billion for DHS R&D programs in FY2010, with $999 million for the S&T Directorate, $375 million for DNDO, and $25 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The S&T Directorate is the primary DHS R&D organization, headed by the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, conducting R&D in its own laboratories and funding R&D by national laboratories, industry, and universities. The Administration requested $968 million for the S&T Directorate, a 4% increase from the FY2009 appropriation. The request included increases for cyber security R&D and explosives division. The proposed increase of $25 million for the Explosives Division includes funding for high-throughput screening of air cargo and detection of improvised explosive devices. There is a proposed reduction of $31 million for the Infrastructure and Geophysical Division, which includes the elimination of funding for local and regional initiatives. Additionally, there is a proposed increase of $16 million for the Transition program, which includes funding for the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute. The S&T Directorate received $15 million for BioWatch Generation 3 testing. The House bill allocated $10 million for local initiatives and excluded NBAF construction funding. The Senate bill provided $23 million more for local initiatives and approved NBAF construction funding. The final bill provided $1,006 million for the S&T Directorate, an increase of $38 million above the request. It allocated $30 million more for Infrastructure and Geophysical to fund local and regional initiatives, and $32 million for NBAF construction. The final bill allocated $32 million for NBAF construction and included safety and security assessment requirements. It also rescinded $6.9 million in unobligated appropriations. The bill directed the S&T Directorate to be involved in testing BioWatch Generation 3 and to provide quarterly briefings on test and evaluation status for all level 1 acquisitions. The S&T Directorate in Congress faces issues such as setting priorities, relationships with other R&D organizations, budgeting, and resource allocation. The start of NBAF construction in FY2011 will require increased funding and may lead to more congressional oversight. DHS expects to need $687 million for NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning between FY2011 and FY2014. The total cost of the NBAF project has increased from $451 million. The cost of NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning increased from $451 million in December 2006 to $615 million in May 2009. Congress authorized DHS to offset costs by selling Plum Island. Kansas State University and partners will contribute $110 million in-kind. Congress has been interested in the role of the S&T Directorate in testing large acquisition projects. The current DHS policy designates the Director of the Test and Evaluation and Standards Division (TSD) to establish testing and evaluation policies, while the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) administers them. Currently, the same person holds both roles, potentially blurring the distinction between policy-setting and policy-administration functions. Congress may need to assess the independence of the OT&E Director's reporting on programs in other divisions due to TSD's own programs. The FY2010 appropriations bills emphasized the involvement of the S&T Directorate in testing BioWatch Generation 3 and other acquisition programs. The Homeland Security Institute was replaced by the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute and the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute, funded by S&T programs and other agencies. The FY2010 DHS congressional budget justification estimated reimbursable obligations totaling $122 million in FY2009 and $143 million in FY2010. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support. The Administration requested $366 million for DNDO in FY2010, a 29% reduction from FY2009. No funds were requested for Systems Acquisition in FY2010 as unobligated funds from previous years are available. The FY2010 DHS budget did not require additional funds due to unobligated funds from previous years and delayed certification of ASP technology. The final bill allocated $383 million for DNDO, an increase of $17 million from the request, and $20 million for Securing the Cities in the Systems Acquisition account. The FY2010 DHS budget did not require additional funds due to unobligated funds from previous years and delayed certification of ASP technology. Congressional attention has focused on DNDO's testing and analysis for ASP procurement. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO and the roles of DNDO and the S&T Directorate in research and development are also of interest to Congress. Issues of congressional interest in research, development, testing, and evaluation, including the acquisition mission of DNDO, are highlighted. Congress may need to assess the alignment of DNDO's acquisition mission with reduced funding for Systems Acquisition. DNDO's role in acquiring and deploying radiation detection technologies for DHS components is also noted. President Obama's FY2010 budget request included a $443 million increase for NIH, totaling $30.696 billion. Congress provided $30.946 billion for FY2010, with additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Recovery Act allocated $10.400 billion to NIH, with half obligated in FY2009. Funding requests for radiation detection equipment will now be sought by end users like the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Patrol. The NIH received a total of $10.4 billion in funding, with half obligated in FY2009 and the remainder in FY2010. The funding comes primarily from the annual appropriations bill for Labor/HHS and Interior/Environment. Additionally, NIH receives mandatory funding for diabetes research and the National Library of Medicine. Congress has also allocated a portion of NIH's budget to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria since FY2002. The U.S. contributes $300 million to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria from NIH funding. The House passed bills providing NIH with $31.196 billion in FY2010, $943 million more than FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 3293 (Labor/HHS) on August 4, 2009, but the bill was never considered by the full Senate. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2996 (Interior/Environment) on September 24, 2009. The Senate bills would have provided a program level total of $30.696 billion, the same amount as requested, but the distribution among NIH institutes varied somewhat from the request. NIH operated at FY2009 rates with temporary funding until Congress completed action on its FY2010 appropriations. In FY2003, NIH reached peak purchasing power from regular appropriations after a five-year doubling of the budget. However, annual appropriations have not kept up with inflation for medical research, leading to a decline in buying power. Increases in funding dropped to 1.0% to 3.2% annually from FY2004 to FY2009, below the biomedical research inflation rate of 3.7% to 4.6% per year. The projected changes in the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI) are 3.8% for FY2009 and 3.3% for FY2010. In FY2010, NIH funding in constant 2009 dollars decreased by 12.7% from the FY2003 peak. The agency consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers, each managing its research programs. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, the OD, and a Buildings and Facilities account. In FY2010, the NIH requested budget increases for most of the ICs, with a history of treating institutes and centers equally in percentage terms. Special initiatives have led to increased funding for research on cancer, HIV/AIDS, bioterrorism, and genome sciences. The FY2010 request included initiatives in cancer research and autism spectrum disorders, with a proposed increase of $268 million for cancer research over eight years. The FY2010 budget proposed a $6 billion increase in funding for cancer research over eight years, with a 3.6% increase for the National Cancer Institute. Additionally, there was a proposed $1 billion investment in autism-related activities and a 15.6% increase in NIH's spending on autism. Nanotechnology-related research received a 4.8% boost, including a $9 million increase for the human health impact of nanotechnology at NIEHS. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not set specific funding levels for particular diseases. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concern over setting specific funding levels for diseases outside of the peer review system. The final Labor/HHS appropriation provided an overall increase of 2.3% for NIH, with most ICs receiving 2.7% increases. NIEHS funding increased by 4.1% and NCRR by 3.5%. The Office of the Director and Buildings and Facilities account saw a decrease in funding for FY2010 compared to FY2009. The Office of the Director's funding dropped by $70 million to $1,177 million in the conference agreement, mainly due to the NIH Director's Bridge Award program not being funded. Other programs managed by OD were proposed for sustained or increased funding. The House and Senate committees agreed with the Office of the Director's request for sustained or increased funding, except for the Common Fund. The President requested funding for the National Children's Study, which both committees agreed to, but the cost projections have increased substantially. The Senate committee deferred specifying an amount for the study. The House committee agreed to include $97 million for research on medical countermeasures against nuclear, radiological, and chemical threats. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for a new program in bioethics research and training, and $5 million to expand ongoing trans-NIH stewardship and oversight activities. A total of $181 million was designated for program coordination offices working with the ICs. The NIH Common Fund, supporting NIH Roadmap initiatives, received funding through the OD account. The President requested $549 million for the Roadmap/Common Fund for FY2010, with the Senate committee bill concurring. The NIH Buildings and Facilities program received $544 million, up $3 million from FY2009. Some Roadmap programs are transitioning to ICs for continued support. The B&F appropriation was decreased to $100 million, a 20.4% decrease from FY2009. Additional spending for repairs and construction will be done with the $500 million NIH received. The NIH received $500 million for repairs and construction from the Recovery Act. About 84% of NIH funds go to research grants, contracts, and awards supporting over 300,000 scientists at various institutions. Competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs) make up 53% of NIH's budget, totaling $16.4 billion in FY2010. This funding would support an estimated 38,042 awards, including 9,849 competing RPGs. The House committee's funding level for NIH in FY2010 would support 38,888 total grants, including 10,739 new and competing grants. The request and House bill proposed 2% inflation-adjustment increases for noncompeting continuation awards and a 2.0% increase in the average cost of competing RPGs. The success rate of applications receiving funding was expected to be around 21%, with estimated success rates for different ICs ranging from 12% to 50%. Several NIH efforts focus on supporting new investigators to encourage young scientists in research careers. The Pathway to Independence program provides mentored grants that convert to independent RPGs, with $102 million allocated by the House committee. The NIH Director's New Innovator Award program supports creative investigators with $80 million planned for about 35 awards in FY2010. Special consideration is given to Early Stage Investigators in peer review for research support applications. The NIH requested an increase of $8 million for the National Research Service Awards to support 17,742 Full-Time Training Positions. The House bill provided funding for a 2% average increase in research training stipends, while the Senate committee did not specify a stipend increase. The conference agreement included funding for a 1% increase in stipends. Other proposed changes in the NIH budget included increased support for research centers, with a $40 million increase to $3.056 billion. This funding also supported the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) at an estimated $467 million. In FY2010, the NIH budget proposed increases in various areas: $25 million for Other Research grants, $33 million for R&D contracts, $24 million for the TRNDI program, $48 million for the intramural research program, and $25 million for research management and support. No new funding was requested for extramural research facilities construction and renovation. The Recovery Act provided $1.0 billion for this purpose. In FY2010, the NIH budget proposed increases in various areas, with the Recovery Act providing $1.0 billion for extramural research facilities construction and renovation. NIH is the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, with a set-aside cap of 2.5% for assessing federal health programs. In FY2010, NIH received $10.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. More than $5 billion remained to be obligated in FY2010, with funds allocated for extramural research, research facility construction, NIH buildings, and comparative effectiveness research. NIH's ARRA funding supports activities to stimulate the economy and create scientific progress. Funding opportunities focus on new research grants, supplemental awards, and the NIH Challenge Grants initiative. NIH's ARRA funding, totaling $5 billion, supported over 12,000 grants for research institutions nationwide. The funding included the Challenge Grants initiative and the Grand Opportunities grants for large-scale research projects in various areas such as cancer, heart disease, and autism. President Obama announced the funding on September 30, 2009, with a focus on advancing research using technology from the Human Genome Project. The Administration requested over $1 billion for research applying technology from the Human Genome Project in FY2010. The Department of Energy (DOE) requested $11.464 billion for R&D and related programs, with activities in science, national security, and energy. The final bill provided $11.143 billion, with the DOE Office of Science receiving $4.942 billion, a 3.9% increase from FY2009. The Administration aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The America COMPETES Act authorized $5.814 billion for the Office of Science in FY2010, with the final appropriation being $4.904 billion. The request for basic energy sciences included funding for two energy innovation hubs, one focused on materials for energy storage and the other on direct production of fuels from solar energy. The House funded one hub while the Senate funded both. The final bill did not fund the energy innovation hubs for materials for energy storage and direct production of fuels from solar energy. There were discrepancies in funding for advanced scientific computing research, with the House providing the requested amount, the Senate providing $10 million less, and the final bill providing $15 million less. In fusion energy sciences, there were concerns about cost increases and schedule delays for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The House provided the requested amount for fusion energy sciences and allocated an additional $20 million for laser fusion research at the Naval Research Laboratory. The final bill provided $426 million in funding, including $20 million for laser fusion research at the Naval Research Laboratory. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) received $10 million, down from the regular FY2009 appropriation of $15 million. The House and Senate did not provide FY2010 funding for ARPA-E, citing available Recovery Act funds. The final bill did not provide new funds for ARPA-E and suggested a lack of commitment to the program by the Committee. The request for DOE national security R&D was $3.300 billion, a 2.9% increase from FY2009. Proposed increases for naval reactors program included more funding for R&D on reactor and power plant technology, as well as for refueling and modernization. A proposed decrease for nonproliferation and verification R&D was mostly due to a shift of funding to other DOE activities. The House provided $3.307 billion, with adjustments to funding for inertial confinement fusion. The Senate provided $3.408 billion for DOE energy R&D, including increases for inertial confinement fusion and nuclear detection technologies. The final bill allocated $3.296 billion, with additional funding for inertial confinement fusion and nuclear detection technology, but decreases for naval reactor development and defense site environmental cleanup technology. The request for DOE energy R&D was $3.212 billion, with increases for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electric power grid R&D, and decreases for fossil fuel and nuclear energy R&D. The DOE requested increases in funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D, including solar energy, vehicle energy efficiency, building energy efficiency, and a new program for education and workforce development in energy science and engineering. The funding would have been partly offset by a decrease for fuel cell technology. Additionally, there was a proposed doubling of funding for electricity delivery and energy reliability R&D, with a new energy innovation hub on grid materials, devices, and systems. The DOE funded a new energy innovation hub on grid materials, devices, and systems. A 30% reduction in fossil energy R&D was proposed due to no new funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative, which was already well-supported. This reduction was partially offset by $35 million for a new innovation hub on carbon capture and storage. Additionally, there were proposed reductions in Nuclear Power 2010 funding, offset by requests for new energy innovation hubs on modeling and simulation and extreme materials. The House provided $3.104 billion for energy R&D, including increases for nuclear energy, vehicle energy efficiency, fuel cell technology, and more. The Senate provided $3.072 billion for energy R&D, with increases for fossil energy and nuclear energy, and decreases for smart grid R&D and energy efficiency. The final bill allocated $2.944 billion, with increases for fossil energy and nuclear energy, and decreases for fuel cell technology, solar energy, and program support. The FY2010 budget request included a decrease in funding for smart grid R&D and energy efficiency, with increases for fossil energy, nuclear energy, hydrogen, wind, and water power. The National Science Foundation (NSF) received a 8.5% increase in funding under President Obama's Plan for Science and Innovation, aiming to double federal investment in basic research agencies over 10 years. The FY2010 budget request included strategies to expand the scientific workforce, increase Graduate Research Fellowships, enhance international partnerships, and maintain a portfolio of transformative research. The NSF aims to double federal investment in basic research agencies over 10 years. The FY2010 budget request for NSF included $5.733 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 10.6% increase from FY2009. The funding aims to support transformative, high-risk, high-reward research to drive innovation, develop world-class facilities, and maintain a competitive workforce in science and engineering. The FY2010 budget request for NSF included $5.733 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), with a focus on supporting research projects, facilities, and education. Concerns have been raised about the imbalance between support for life sciences and physical sciences, with the America COMPETES Act authorizing increased federal research support in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The MPS Directorate would have received $1.380 billion, a 9.9% increase over FY2009, to support fundamental research, facilities, and instruments in mathematics and physical sciences. The FY2010 budget request for NSF included $271.1 million for Integrative Activities (IA), which also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. EPSCoR funding was transferred to IA in FY2008, with a request of $147.1 million in FY2010. The funding supported research infrastructure, co-funding, and outreach strategies for EPSCoR jurisdictions. Approximately half of the funding was allocated for new awards and research infrastructure improvement grants. The NSF requested $49.0 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) in FY2010, an 11.3% increase over FY2009. The OISE manages NSF's offices in Beijing, Paris, and Tokyo, facilitating coordination and implementation of NSF research and education efforts. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) in the R&RA is the primary source of U.S. support for basic research in polar regions. The NSF's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is a key source of U.S. support for basic research in polar regions, with a focus on arctic and antarctic sciences.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in areas such as ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and water; supplies information on the oceans and atmosphere; and conserves coastal and marine organisms and environments. NOAA was created in 1970 by Reorganization Plan No. 4 to unify the nation's environmental activities. NOAA's R&D efforts focus on climate, weather, air quality, and ocean resources. President Obama requested $568 million in R&D funding for NOAA in FY2010, a 7.0% decrease from the previous year. President Obama requested $568 million in R&D funding for NOAA in FY2010, a 7.0% decrease from the previous year. R&D accounted for nearly 12.7% of NOAA's total FY2010 discretionary budget request of $4.474 billion, with 93% for research and 7% for development. The R&D funding would support intramural and extramural programs within NOAA's five line offices and Program Support. The Office of Marine and Aviation Services (OMAO) is part of the primary center for research and development within NOAA. In FY2010, OAR received $305.9 million for R&D, which accounted for 53.9% of the total NOAA R&D request. The budget supported activities such as climate research, weather, air quality research, and ecosystem management. Funding for NOS R&D decreased by $2.1 million, while NESDIS funding decreased by $0.8 million. NWS R&D funding would have decreased by $9.4 million, and OMAO funding would have fallen to $104.0 million. NMFS R&D funding would have increased to $55.4 million. In FY2010, NOAA's R&D funding increased by $4.9 million to $55.4 million. The budget allocation by function was: ecosystems 32%, climate 31%, weather and water 14%, commerce and transportation 1%, and mission support 22%. Key R&D accomplishments included upgrading prediction systems, developing bycatch reduction devices, predicting harmful algal blooms, integrating radar data for weather forecasts, and implementing a soil moisture network. Funding for NOAA line offices included both R&D and non-R&D activities, making it difficult to determine precise R&D funding levels for each office. In FY2010, NOAA's R&D funding increased to $55.4 million, with allocations for ecosystems, climate, weather, commerce, and mission support. The House and Senate passed appropriations bills recommending funding increases for NOAA, with the Senate proposing $4.773 billion, a 9.3% increase over FY2009. Total NOAA funding is discussed to provide an indication of R&D funding levels. In FY2010, NOAA's R&D funding increased to $55.4 million, with allocations for ecosystems, climate, weather, commerce, and mission support. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 providing $4.737 billion for NOAA, an 8.5% increase over FY2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $830 million to NOAA, with only $500,000 classified as R&D. The Administration requested $13.709 billion for NASA R&D in FY2010, with the House bill proposing $13.161 billion and the Senate bill proposing $13.714 million. The Vision for Space Exploration, endorsed by Congress, includes priorities such as retiring the space shuttle by 2010, completing the International Space Station by 2015, and returning humans to the moon by 2020. However, future-year spending plans may not support this goal. An independent review of NASA's human spaceflight activities is in question. The Augustine report estimated an additional $3 billion per year would be needed for NASA's human spaceflight activities. The Administration requested $4.477 billion for Science in FY2010, with increases for Earth Science, Planetary Science, and Heliophysics offset by a decrease for Astrophysics. NASA is considering options after the loss of the Orbital Carbon Observatory, with the House increasing funding for Earth Science and Astrophysics. The Senate increased funding for Astrophysics by $49 million and Heliophysics by $42 million, partly offset by reallocating unobligated balances from prior years. This resulted in a net increase in Science funding of $40 million above the request, with a final appropriation of $4.469 billion, $8 million less than the request. Increases for Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science were offset by transfers of costs to other accounts and a reduction of $59 million. The increase for Earth Science included funds to initiate a replacement for the OCO. The FY2010 budget for Exploration saw a 13.1% increase for the Constellation Systems program, focusing on the development of the Orion crew vehicle and Ares I launch vehicle. NASA's funding projections aim for an initial crewed flight in March 2015, but doubts exist regarding the timeline for returning humans to the moon by 2020. The House provided $670 million less than the requested amount for Exploration. The House and Senate provided less funding than requested for NASA's Exploration program, with the final appropriation being $3.746 billion, a reduction of $217 million from the request. This included changes in funding for various components such as Orion, Ares I, Ares V, and Advanced Capabilities. The bill also renamed the Constellation Systems funding line as Human Exploration. The final bill provided $3.746 billion for NASA's Exploration program, a reduction of $217 million from the request. It renamed the Constellation Systems funding line as Human Exploration Architecture Development but prohibited NASA from making changes without approval from Congress. The conference report emphasized the need for thoughtful consideration before recommending detailed funding levels. The final bill allocated funds for NASA's Exploration program, with a reduction in funding and a renaming of the Constellation Systems line. Recommendations were made for congressional review and budgeting of resources. NASA funds were made available for two years in the Senate bill, with Construction and Environmental Compliance funds available for six years. The FY2010 request for research and education activities in the USDA saw a decrease from the previous year. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDA's research agency with 100 labs nationwide focusing on food production, biocontrols for pest management, and regulatory programs. In FY2010, ARS received $1.173 billion, $33.6 million less than FY2009. The Administration proposed redirecting $40.0 million from discontinued projects to genetic databases, market expansion, new feedstock varieties, animal health, and feed efficiency. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established in the 2008 Farm Bill to develop linkages between federal and state agricultural research, extension, and education systems. NIFA distributes funds to various institutions for agricultural research and outreach, including partnerships with land-grant universities. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) funds research at various institutions, including 1862 land-grant institutions, 1890 historically black colleges, 1994 tribal land-grant colleges, and Hispanic-serving institutions. Funding is distributed through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. The FY2010 budget for NIFA was $1.320 billion, with a focus on expanding competitive research funding for critical national issues. The FY2010 budget for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) was $201.5 million, with a focus on developing training and technology applications in agriculture. AFRI funding supports research projects for graduate students and aims to increase opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. The FY2010 budget for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) was $201.5 million, with a focus on developing training and technology applications in agriculture. AFRI funding supports research projects for graduate students and aims to increase opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. The Administration proposed support for initiatives in agricultural genomics, emerging issues in food and agricultural security, the ecology and economics of biological invasions, and plant biotechnology. Research was proposed that moves beyond water quality issues to extend to water availability, reuse, and conservation. The FY2010 request for USDA provided $82.5 million for the Economic Research Service (ERS), $2.5 million above the FY2009 estimated level. ERS supports both economic and social science information analysis on agriculture, rural development, food and the environment. ERS collects and disseminates data concerning USDA programs and policies to various. The FY2010 budget for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) was proposed at $161.8 million, with funding to improve research efforts in bioenergy production impacts and commodity production concerns. Additional research areas include biomass materials, distillers' grains, and ethanol production plants. Funding also allowed for the restoration of chemical use data series on major crops and the first year of the 2012 Census of Agriculture. The 2012 Census of Agriculture is the first year of a five-year cycle to measure trends in the agricultural community. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, increasing USDA's funding by $28.0 billion. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, FY2010 provided $2.981 billion for USDA research and education, including funds for ARS and NIFA. In FY2010, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provided $1.251 billion for the ARS and $1.487 billion for NIFA, exceeding the Administration's requests. The act also allocated $82.5 million for the ERS and $161.8 million for the NASS, consistent with the Administration's proposal. President Obama proposed $745.1 million for DOI R&D, with $649.3 million designated for USGS R&D, primarily for initiatives like Climate Impacts and A New Energy Frontier. In FY2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $140 million to USGS for R&D activities such as repair, construction, and restoration of facilities, equipment replacement, national map activities, and other improvement projects. USGS R&D is conducted in geographic research, geological resources, water resources, biological research, enterprise information, and global change. The President's FY2010 budget included increases in biological research and global change areas. USGS geographic research efforts aim to map the nation's terrain, monitor changes, and analyze reasons for these changes.

The program utilizes 17 research centers, field stations, a technology center, and 40 cooperative research units for research on fish, wildlife, and habitats. The USGS received increased funding for global climate change research and enterprise information in FY2010. The Minerals Management Service also saw a funding increase for environmental studies, while the National Park Service received $29.0 million in the same fiscal year. In FY2010, the National Park Service received $29.0 million, an increase of $2.5 million (9.4%) from FY2009. The Bureau of Reclamation received $12.9 million, up by $0.7 million (5.8%) from the previous year. The Bureau of Land Management received $9.7 million, a decrease of $1.3 million (-11.8%) from FY2009. Congress passed the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-88) in late October 2009, signed into law by President Obama on October 30, 2009. R&D funding within DOI agencies is not clearly specified in the legislation. In FY2010, DOI R&D funding is estimated at $759.0 million, with USGS receiving $660.9 million, an increase from FY2009 levels. EPA also funds a variety of R&D activities for environmental pollution control laws. The EPA funds R&D activities to support decisions on preventing environmental pollution, with funding from the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The agency's scientific research is mainly funded through the Science and Technology (S&T) appropriations account, which includes transfers from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. In FY2010, the EPA S&T account received $872.9 million in funding, with a total enacted funding of $56.4 million. The FY2010 enacted funding for the EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account was $56.4 million above the previous year's appropriation. This accounted for 8.5% of the total agency funding for FY2010. The S&T account includes elements of the former EPA Research and Development (R&D) account and receives transfers from the Superfund account for research on contaminated sites. The EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account funds research conducted by universities, foundations, and other non-federal entities with grants awarded by EPA, as well as research conducted by the agency at its own laboratories and facilities. These R&D activities are primarily managed by EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD). The EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account funds research managed by EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) and also supports applied science and technology activities in program offices. Funding for research programs in areas such as climate protection, clean air, global change, clean water, and human health saw increases in FY2010 compared to FY2009 appropriations. In FY2010, the EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account saw increases in funding for research programs in areas such as global change, clean water, and human health. The largest increase was $248.4 million for human health and ecosystem research, exceeding the FY2009 enacted appropriation by more than 8%. This funding level was higher than the Senate and President's FY2010 request but lower than the House recommendation. The FY2010 EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account saw a decrease in funding for the Water Security Initiative compared to the President's request. The $18.7 million included in P.L. 111-88 was below the requested $23.7 million, resulting in a 21.1% decrease. P.L. 111-88 also mandated a study on black carbon emissions. The EPA was mandated to conduct a study on black carbon emissions to quantify its climatic effects and compare them to other greenhouse gases. The results of the study are to be reported to Congress within 18 months. Congressional interest in addressing climate change and greenhouse gas emissions was high during the FY2010 appropriations debate. EPA's laboratories and facilities require significant funding for rent, utilities, and security, with expenses previously covered under the EPM appropriations account. Starting in FY2007, more funding was allocated for these expenses. Funding for EPA's scientific research activities has been a concern for some Members of Congress and stakeholders. The allocation for these expenses within the S&T account has increased since FY2007, ranging from 8% to 11% of the total S&T account in FY2010. This change has impacted comparisons of S&T appropriations over time. Some Members of Congress, scientists, and environmental organizations are concerned about the decrease in federal resources for scientific research. The debate revolves around the use of \"sound science\" in federal regulatory actions and policy development. President Obama requested $939 million for Department of Transportation (DOT) R&D in FY2010, with the majority allocated to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The request included a $360 million increase for FAA R&D, focusing on the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) to improve airspace capacity and efficiency. The President's FY2010 budget request included increased funding for NextGen R&D in the FAA, with a $39 million increase compared to FY2009. No specific figure was available for FHWA R&D funding in the request. The Department of Transportation receives R&D funds through regular appropriations and the Transportation Trust Fund. The expired SAFETEA-LU Act provided increased DOT R&D funding from FY2005 to FY2009. The SAFETEA-LU Act expired in 2009, posing challenges for agencies receiving funding. The FY2010 Budget did not include policy recommendations for programs subject to reauthorization, such as R&D in highway programs. The Federal Transit Administration saw a $0.9 million reduction in R&D funding, while funding levels for other DOT agencies remained stable. The House passed H.R. 3288 for transportation. The House passed H.R. 3288, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010, on July 23, 2009. The Senate passed its version of the bill on September 17, 2009. Funding for DOT and other agencies was extended through December 18, 2009, by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (H.R. 3288) was signed into law on December 16, 2009, providing funding for DOT agencies. R&D funding levels for FY2010 were estimated at approximately $954 million, an increase of $37 million from FY2009. In FY2010, the FHWA received $430 million in R&D funding, $8 million more than FY2009, and $3 million above the request. The FAA received $363 million in R&D funding, $32 million more than FY2009, and $15 million above the request."
