    "content": "Stakeholders challenge Services' ESA actions under APA, courts review for arbitrariness. Deference given unless record lacks support or climate change not adequately considered. Selected examples provided below. The report highlights examples of how Services and courts have addressed ESA and climate change issues, focusing on listing species as endangered or threatened. Legal challenges often revolve around this decision to trigger ESA protections. The Trump Administration's regulatory revisions in August 2019 are also discussed. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered and threatened species based on the risk of extinction. Listing decisions consider factors like habitat destruction, overutilization, disease, regulatory inadequacy, and other threats. Decisions must be based on scientific evidence. The Endangered Species Act requires the Services to base listing decisions on the best scientific and commercial data available, including considering the impact of climate change on species survival. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the extent to which climate change affects species and the validity of using model-based climate predictions for listing decisions. Legal challenges have been made to both compel the listing of species threatened by climate change and to question the validity of listing decisions based on climate predictions. The Endangered Species Act requires listing decisions to be based on the best available scientific and commercial data, including considering the impact of climate change on species survival. Legal challenges have questioned the Services' interpretation of ambiguous terms and their assessment of climate science in listing decisions. Courts uphold decisions if rational and evidence-based, but have faulted inadequate consideration of climate change effects or reliance on scientific uncertainty in denying species listing petitions. The Endangered Species Act requires listing decisions to consider the impact of climate change on species survival. Legal challenges highlight the difficulty in predicting species endangerment due to climate change effects. The term \"foreseeable future\" is undefined, leading to varying time frames for foreseeability based on species and habitat. Services base decisions on predictive modeling of climate threats to determine a species' survival. How a Service defines a species' foreseeable future can impact its listing decision under the ESA. The Services' definition of a species' foreseeable future can influence its listing decision under the ESA, especially regarding climate change effects. Legal challenges, like the polar bear case, show how courts interpret ESA standards for data on climate change impacts. In the case of polar bears, the court upheld their listing as threatened based on projected climate change effects. The D.C. Circuit upheld the listing of polar bears as threatened under the ESA due to projected climate change effects on their sea ice habitat. The court rejected challenges to the scientific assessment, stating they were merely differing views on policy and science. It also dismissed arguments that climate science was too uncertain, affirming that FWS's reliance on climate projections was sufficient to support the listing decision. The Ninth Circuit upheld the listing of Arctic bearded seals as threatened based on climate change models predicting sea ice loss by 2095. Plaintiffs' claim that models couldn't predict beyond 2050 was rejected, stating NMFS can use long-term projections for listing decisions under the ESA. The court upheld the listing of Arctic bearded seals as threatened based on climate change models predicting sea ice loss by 2095. The Ninth Circuit reversed a decision to vacate the listing of the Arctic subspecies of the ringed seal as threatened, stating NMFS does not need definitive quantitative data to list a species under the ESA. The court upheld NMFS's decision not to list the ribbon seal as threatened under the ESA, despite a likely population decline related to sea ice loss and ocean acidification. The court found NMFS's reliance on a 40-year time horizon to project negative effects from climate change on the sea ice habitat to be reasonable. The court upheld NMFS's decision not to list the ribbon seal as threatened under the ESA, despite a likely population decline related to sea ice loss and ocean acidification. NMFS determined that climate models beyond 2050 were unreliable and too divergent to assess future threats to the ribbon seal due to uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions projections. This highlights the court's deference to NMFS's expertise in interpreting climate modeling data and foreseeability of climate change effects on the ribbon seal. The Services finalized revisions to the ESA regulations in August 2019, defining the \"foreseeable future\" as extending only as far as they can reasonably determine future threats and species' responses. They will continue to evaluate uncertainty and probabilities associated with climate change effects on individual species and habitats. The final rule on the ESA regulations defines the \"foreseeable future\" as the extent to which future threats and species' responses can be reasonably determined. Legal challenges highlight concerns about the increased certainty requirement for protection under the ESA from future effects of climate change. The Services' decisions on listing or delisting species under the ESA are influenced by scientific uncertainty. Stakeholders have challenged the Services' approach to this uncertainty. Delisting a species requires determining that none of the five factors threaten its existence. Courts generally defer to FWS's decisions on delisting species under the ESA based on scientific uncertainty, unless FWS fails to justify how uncertainty supports its decision. For example, in 2011, the Ninth Circuit vacated FWS's delisting of the Yellowstone grizzly bear due to failure to address climate change impacts on whitebark pine, a primary food source for grizzlies. The Ninth Circuit refused to defer to FWS's claims of scientific uncertainty regarding the impact of declining food supplies from climate change on grizzly bears. Evidence showed that climate change reduced whitebark pine seeds, increasing grizzly bear mortality and decreasing reproduction, leading to a negative effect on the grizzly bear population. In a similar case, the Ninth Circuit rejected FWS's decision not to list the Upper Missouri River Valley distinct population segment of Arctic grayling as endangered or threatened. In v. Zinke, the court found FWS acted arbitrarily by not explaining why uncertainty of climate change effects on Arctic grayling justified not listing it. FWS was faulted for not considering synergistic and additive effects of climate change on the species. Other courts criticized FWS for demanding excessive scientific certainty on climate change effects in listing decisions. In Defenders of Wildlife v. Jewell, a court ruled FWS's withdrawal of the proposed listing of the North American wolverine as threatened was arbitrary and capricious. In Defenders of Wildlife v. Jewell, the court found FWS's reversal on listing the wolverine as threatened was arbitrary. FWS questioned climate change data certainty but was criticized for demanding excessive scientific proof. FWS reopened public comments but has not made a final decision yet. In 2019, a federal court criticized FWS for denying a petition to delist the Bone Cave harvestman spider as an endangered species due to lack of evidence on climate change effects. The court found FWS's decision arbitrary and not based on the best available data. The court criticized FWS for denying a petition to delist the Bone Cave harvestman spider as an endangered species due to lack of evidence on climate change effects. FWS's decision was deemed arbitrary, and the court remanded the case for further consideration. In the 2019 revised ESA regulations, the Services acknowledged the challenge of making listing or delisting decisions with uncertainty. They emphasized the use of 'best available' data and considered climate change effects in critical habitat designation. The ESA requires habitat designation for threatened or endangered species, as clarified by the Supreme Court's decision in Weyerhauser Co. v. FWS. The Services may designate two types of habitat as critical habitat under the ESA. Under the ESA, critical habitat can be designated as specific areas within the species' geographical area, essential for conservation, or outside areas deemed necessary for species conservation. Once designated, federal agencies are restricted from actions that could harm the habitat. Challenges arise when designating critical habitat based on habitat shifts due to climate change, as seen in legal disputes over the polar bear's critical habitat designation. The challenges to FWS's designation of the polar bear's critical habitat involved deference to FWS's interpretation of climate change data. In Alaska Oil & Gas Association v. Jewell, the Ninth Circuit upheld the designation of 187,000 square miles as critical habitat. FWS based this on climate change projections, designating areas with essential elements for polar bear survival. The district court questioned the evidence for two areas but asked FWS to prove current polar bear use. The Ninth Circuit disagreed with the district court's narrow interpretation of the ESA critical habitat requirements for polar bears. The court emphasized that the ESA aims to protect the future of the species, not just existing bears, and allows the use of the best available technology for habitat designation based on climate science and sea ice data. The court deferred to FWS's consideration of climate change effects for polar bear habitat preservation. The 2019 final rule clarified criteria for designating unoccupied areas as critical habitat under the ESA. It requires the area to be essential for species conservation, with a \"reasonable certainty\" of contributing to conservation and containing necessary features. The revised regulations for designating unoccupied critical habitat under the ESA may limit the Services' ability to protect species affected by climate change. Stakeholders are concerned that the new rules imposing an \"elevated certainty requirement\" may prevent the designation of currently unoccupied areas essential for species conservation. The revised regulations for designating unoccupied critical habitat under the ESA may limit the Services' ability to protect species affected by climate change. Stakeholders believe the changes comply with the Supreme Court's decision in Weyerhauser Co. v. FWS, ensuring areas must have essential features for species conservation to be considered habitat. Landowners argue that the new rules remove regulatory burdens associated with critical habitat designations, such as consultation requirements for permits affecting habitat. If FWS or NMFS base listing decisions on climate change effects, they must also assess federal actions contributing to climate change. The Services must determine if federal actions contributing to climate change jeopardize species under the ESA. They can tailor \"take\" prohibitions for threatened species using Section 4(d) rules. ESA Section 9 prohibits unauthorized \"take\" of endangered species, defined as harming or killing. The ESA does not prohibit taking of threatened species unless FWS or NMFS extends the prohibitions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows for the extension of take prohibitions to threatened species through Section 4(d) rules. In 2019, revisions to the ESA regulations rescinded the blanket 4(d) rule for newly listed or reclassified species, aligning FWS with NMFS's practice of issuing species-specific rules. There is ongoing debate about whether take prohibitions should apply to GHG-emitting activities that contribute to climate change. Stakeholders argue that GHG emissions causing harm to species should be considered a violation of the ESA Section 9 take prohibitions. However, critics believe that these prohibitions only apply if GHG-emitting activities directly harm the species or its habitat. A federal court decision in a case challenging the polar bear's 4(d) rule highlighted the difficulty of applying take prohibitions to GHG-emitting activities. The rule did not prohibit activities outside the polar bear's range that could indirectly harm the species, such as GHG emissions leading to the loss of sea ice habitat. The court rejected the argument that the ESA's take prohibitions should be extended to regulate offsite GHG-producing activities that could indirectly harm the polar bear's habitat. FWS stated that there was insufficient evidence to show a direct conservation benefit to the polar bear from regulating these activities. The court acknowledged the challenge of using the ESA to address the threat of climate change. Based on a judicial opinion, it is unlikely that Section 4(d) rules will be used to prohibit GHG-emitting activities without further scientific advancements establishing a direct causal link to adverse effects on species or habitat. FWS rescinded the blanket 4(d) rule for threatened species in 2019, opting for species-specific rules instead. This aligns with NMFS's approach. The rescission of FWS's blanket 4(d) rule may impact the protection of species threatened by climate change, depending on its implementation. Concerns exist that delays in issuing species-specific 4(d) rules could weaken protections, but it may not affect the prohibition of GHG-emitting activities. Limited 4(d) rules have been criticized for not effectively addressing the primary factor contributing to species decline - climate change. Some stakeholders and legal scholars see the ESA Section 7 consultation as a tool to limit GHG-emitting activities that harm endangered species due to climate change effects. While climate change is considered during consultations, agencies are not required to curb activities contributing to climate change to protect species. ESA Section 7 mandates federal agencies to ensure actions do not harm endangered species or their habitats. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires federal agencies to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) or Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) if their actions may harm listed species or their habitats. Consultations involve determining if proposed actions will jeopardize species or critical habitat, with agencies required to follow Service recommendations or seek exemptions if harm is likely. This consultation process is seen as a potential tool to address climate change impacts on endangered species, although agencies are not mandated to mitigate activities contributing to climate change. The BiOp must include an incidental take statement specifying the permissible extent of harm to a species. Court decisions have criticized the Services for not considering climate change effects when assessing harm to listed species. In a 2007 case, FWS was found to have acted arbitrarily by not addressing climate change impacts on the threatened delta smelt in a water diversion project. The court criticized the BiOp for failing to analyze climate change effects, leading to rulings against FWS and NMFS for not adequately considering the impact on listed species. The court criticized the BiOp for not adequately analyzing climate change effects on the hatchery's operations and water use. NMFS failed to address the potential impacts of climate change, with the court emphasizing the importance of considering such effects in federal actions. In Turtle Island Restoration Network v. Department of Commerce, the Ninth Circuit 2017 majority opinion examined NMFS's BiOp on fishery expansion's impact on endangered loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles. The court ruled NMFS acted arbitrarily by not considering climate-model data predicting exacerbation of loggerhead population decline due to climate change. However, NMFS's no-jeopardy conclusion for leatherback sea turtles was upheld, despite criticism for limiting the temporal scale of analysis to 25 years. The Ninth Circuit 2017 majority opinion examined NMFS's BiOp on fishery expansion's impact on endangered loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles. NMFS's no-jeopardy conclusion for leatherback sea turtles was upheld, despite criticism for limiting the temporal scale of analysis to 25 years. Stakeholders argue that agencies should consult with the Services if a proposed federal action contributes to climate change that may jeopardize the species or its habitat. The Department of the Interior issued a Solicitor's Opinion stating that Section 7 consultation is not required without evidence of a causal connection between a proposed federal action and climate change effects on listed species. This policy has been used by federal agencies and the Services to comply with Section 7 consultation obligations, as codified in the 2019 ESA regulation revisions. The 2019 ESA rule revised the definition of \"effects of the action\" to include all consequences to listed species or critical habitat caused by the proposed action. It specified that a consequence is \"caused by the proposed action if it would not occur but for the proposed action and it is reasonably certain to occur.\" The Services provided a two-part test to identify a consequence: (1) whether the effect or activity would not occur but for the action and (2) whether the effect or activity is reasonably certain to result from the action. The preamble discusses stakeholders' views on proposed revisions to Section 7 consultation requirements under the ESA. Some support the changes to reduce resources needed for consultation, while others argue it may limit consultation on climate change effects. Congress did not initially consider climate change in ESA conservation efforts, but there is ongoing debate on its inclusion. The debate continues on whether the ESA can adequately protect species threatened by climate change effects. Stakeholders disagree on the ESA's role in addressing climate change, with some arguing it is not equipped for this task. Legal scholars agree that litigation has influenced how climate change effects are considered in ESA decisions, ensuring projected impacts are taken into account. However, courts have not expanded the ESA to regulate activities contributing to climate change. The ESA may need revisions to address climate change effects on species. Congress could clarify if ESA prohibitions apply to indirect harms from activities contributing to climate change. Scientific uncertainty in predicting climate change effects on species may need to be addressed in listing determinations. Legislative proposals are ongoing in this area. Legal battles may continue over how the Services interpret climate change effects in ESA decisions."
