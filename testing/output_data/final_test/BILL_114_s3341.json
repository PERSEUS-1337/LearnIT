The pre-apprenticeship program must adhere to safety protocols, not displace paid employees, and have a formal agreement with a sponsor for participants to enter the apprenticeship program. The pre-apprenticeship program allows participants to earn credit for skills acquired before entering an apprenticeship program. Related instruction provides theoretical and technical knowledge for success in the occupation. The Secretary of Labor oversees the program, and a sponsor, such as an employer or labor-management partnership, supports apprentices.

States must submit an application with a strategic plan to be eligible for the grant. The State agency chosen by the Governor will administer the grant.
