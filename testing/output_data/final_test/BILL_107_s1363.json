    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act.\" The upper Connecticut River watershed in New Hampshire and Vermont is a scenic region with historic villages, farms, forests, and the Connecticut River. It provides habitat for fish and wildlife, recreation, and hydropower generation. The area is part of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, recognized by Congress. Citizens in the watershed show interest in stewardship of the River. The citizens living in the watershed led to the Presidential designation of the River as 1 of 14 American Heritage Rivers on July 30, 1998. The River is home to the bistate Connecticut River Scenic Byway, fostering heritage tourism. The legislatures of Vermont and New Hampshire have established a commission for the Connecticut River watershed, known as the \"Connecticut River Joint Commissions,\" working together since 1989 to promote cooperation between Federal agencies, States, communities, and citizens. The Connecticut River Joint Commissions, along with 5 bistate local river subcommittees, created the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This year, the legislatures requested Congress to continue supporting the commissions in implementing the plan's recommendations. This Act implements key recommendations from the plan. The Act authorizes the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance to New Hampshire and Vermont for the management of the Connecticut River through the Joint Commissions. The recommendations from the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan will be implemented with support from local communities and organizations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"River\" refers to the Connecticut River, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"State\" includes the State of New Hampshire and the State of Vermont. The Secretary of the Interior can provide technical and financial assistance to the States through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions for managing the River. This includes developing joint policies for water quality, flow management, and recreational boating, protection plans for tributaries, monitoring river quality, restoring riverbanks, and assisting landowners in establishing riparian buffers. The Connecticut River Joint Commissions can provide assistance to states in managing the river by establishing riparian buffers, preventing pollution, protecting shoreland and wetlands, managing stormwater runoff, evaluating dam decommissioning, restoring habitat, protecting native trout and wildlife, promoting local agricultural markets, and encouraging sustainable agriculture. The Connecticut River Joint Commissions support sustainable agriculture, heritage tourism, and local stewardship. They aim to strengthen nonregulatory protection of heritage resources, promote historically compact village centers, establish indicators of sustainability, and monitor the impact of tourism on natural and historic resources. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
