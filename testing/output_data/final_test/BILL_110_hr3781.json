The biodiesel industry in the United States is crucial for reducing dependence on foreign petroleum, enhancing energy security, promoting economic development, creating jobs, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A federally-implemented biodiesel standard is necessary for efficient pricing and ensuring high-quality biodiesel is dispensed, contributing to cleaner air and greenhouse gas reductions. Biodiesel is an environmentally safe fuel that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. A USDA study shows a 78.4% reduction in CO2 emissions for B100 biodiesel. 1 billion gallons of biodiesel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 16.12 billion pounds, equivalent to removing 1.4 million passenger vehicles from the roads. In 2006, biodiesel's impact on reducing emissions was like removing 350,000 vehicles from the roads. The biodiesel fuel standard is addressed in Section 3. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include a new subsection (p) on biodiesel fuel, defining terms like ASTM and bio-based diesel replacement. The Clean Air Act's Section 211(p) defines biodiesel as monoalkyl esters meeting ASTM standards and bio-based diesel for fuel volume measurement. The Clean Air Act's Section 211(p) defines biodiesel as bio-based diesel replacement meeting registration requirements or ASTM standards. Biodiesel blend is a mix of biodiesel fuel meeting ASTM standard D6751 with petroleum-based diesel. The Administrator must establish regulations within a year to ensure compliant diesel fuel in the US market. The Clean Air Act's Section 211(p) defines biodiesel as bio-based diesel meeting ASTM standards. Biodiesel blends must contain a specified volume of biodiesel based on calendar years 2008 through 2012. The applicable volumes range from 450 million gallons in 2008 to 1,000 million gallons in 2011. The Clean Air Act's Section 211(p) defines biodiesel as bio-based diesel meeting ASTM standards. Biodiesel blends must contain a specified volume of biodiesel based on calendar years 2008 through 2012, ranging from 450 million gallons in 2008 to 1,000 million gallons in 2011. For calendar year 2013 and beyond, the Administrator will determine the applicable volume in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, based on a review of the program's impact on the environment, air quality, energy security, job creation, and rural economic development. The regulations under Section 211(p) of the Clean Air Act require a minimum of 80 percent biodiesel in the applicable volume for calendar years 2008 through 2012. Compliance provisions are in place for refineries, blenders, distributors, and importers to ensure requirements are met without restricting geographic areas or imposing per-gallon obligations. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, will evaluate the impact of biodiesel requirements on diesel fuel prices. If there is a biodiesel feedstock disruption or market circumstances making biodiesel fuel prices unreasonable, a waiver may be granted. The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, may issue an order to temporarily reduce the required quantity of biodiesel by up to 15% if biodiesel prices are deemed unreasonable. Factors considered include the purposes of the Act and the price difference between diesel fuel and biodiesel. The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, may issue an order to reduce the quantity of biodiesel required under certain circumstances for an additional 60-day period. The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, may issue an order to increase the quantity of biodiesel required under certain circumstances to account for unused gallons during a waiver or extension period. During a waiver or extension period, the provisions of this section supersede any state law mandating biodiesel use, except for mandates enacted as of January 1, 2008. The provisions of this section supersede any state law mandating biodiesel use, except for mandates enacted as of January 1, 2008. SEC. 4. BIODIESEL QUALITY. Amendment to the Clean Air Act requires regulations for high-quality biodiesel meeting ASTM standards to be introduced into commerce, with an inspection program for enforcement. The Clean Air Act requires regulations for biodiesel meeting ASTM standards to be enforced, with penalties for violations and funding allocated for implementation. SEC. 5. BIODIESEL LABELING. The Clean Air Act is amended to require labeling on retail diesel fuel pumps to inform consumers of the percentage of biodiesel in the blend. The Administrator will establish labeling requirements within 180 days of enactment, including for blends with up to 5% biodiesel that meet ASTM D975 specifications. Biodiesel blends meeting ASTM D975 diesel specifications do not need extra labels. Blends with 5-20% biodiesel should be labeled as such, while blends with over 20% biodiesel should be labeled accordingly."
