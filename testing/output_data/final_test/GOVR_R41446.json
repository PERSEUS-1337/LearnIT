    "content": "Hezbollah is a Shiite Islamist militia, political party, and social welfare organization in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government and has strong paramilitary capabilities supported by Iran and Syria. The group has been involved in kidnappings and terrorist attacks against U.S., European, and Israeli interests since the 1980s. The political process in Lebanon is currently focused on Hezbollah's role in the country's security sector despite its terrorist designation. Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, holds political power in Lebanon with 10 parliamentary seats and control over key ministries. Despite justifying its actions as resistance to Israeli occupation, Hezbollah faces pressure to adapt its rhetoric due to Israel's withdrawal in 2000 and the strengthening of Lebanese security forces since 2006. Hezbollah in Lebanon faces pressure to adapt its policies and rhetoric, particularly regarding disputed areas with Israel. The current government asserts Lebanon's right to defend itself and its resources through legitimate means. Despite calls for disarmament in past agreements, Hezbollah aims to maintain its role in national defense. Hezbollah in Lebanon defines itself as a resistance movement opposed to U.S. and Israeli intervention. It refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and opposes negotiations for Arab-Israeli disputes. Despite slim prospects for engagement with the U.S., Hezbollah's influence in Lebanese politics and regional peace efforts is increasing. The Obama Administration is requesting $246 million. The Obama Administration is requesting $246 million in FY2011 foreign assistance to increase the central authority of the Lebanese state and deter non-state actors. The United States has provided over $1.35 billion in assistance for Lebanon since FY2006, with more than $690 million invested in the capabilities of the LAF and ISF. Lebanon's political leadership is unlikely to solve the dilemma of Hezbollah's militia without outside intervention. National Dialogue consultations on a defense strategy are at an impasse due to political paralysis. Discussions over Hezbollah's weapons are sensitive and ongoing. Hariri and other leaders emphasize the sensitivity of discussions on Hezbollah's weapons, as external actors like the US, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Israel try to influence Lebanon's politics. Key issues for US policymakers include assessing assistance programs for the LAF and ISF, addressing obstacles to Lebanon's security forces' expansion, managing relations with external actors to prevent conflict, and limiting weapons transfers to Hezbollah. The current chunk discusses the importance of influencing Lebanon's National Dialogue regarding a national defense strategy and Hezbollah's weapons, while also preparing for potential negative consequences such as a return to civil conflict. Critics argue that the US has not taken direct action to limit Hezbollah's influence or stop the flow of weapons to the group. The current chunk discusses potential measures to weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon and the region, including diplomatic, assistance, and security-related actions. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair provided an assessment of Hezbollah's capabilities and intentions in February 2010. Hizballah, supported by Iran, is considered a significant terrorist group with thousands of members and operatives. While not actively planning attacks on the US, they could strike if they feel threatened. They receive financial aid from Iranian sources and engage in legal and illegal businesses, including drug activities. Hezbollah, supported by Iran, engages in legal and illegal businesses, including drug activities. The group receives training, weapons, and support from Iran and Syria, and provides assistance to various terrorist organizations. Reports suggest Hezbollah has provided training to Iraqi insurgents and may have received Scud missiles from Syria. The United States condemns the transfer of Scud missiles from Syria to Hezbollah, citing destabilization in the region and threats to Israel and Lebanon's security. Israeli reports indicate that the missiles transferred so far are M-600s with a 185-mile range. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman expressed concerns about the situation in June 2010. Hezbollah, formed during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the 1980s, has roots in the Shiite Islamic revival in southern Iraq. It was led by Najaf-educated clerics and students who mobilized Lebanon's Shiite community during the civil war. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman warned of potential U.S. targeting if tensions with Iran over its nuclear program escalate. The Lebanese civil war, Israel's invasion of Lebanon, Imam Musa Sadr's disappearance, and the Iranian revolution were key events shaping Shiite politics. Leaders split over the Israeli invasion in 1982, with some forming Islamic Amal, later evolving into Hezbollah with support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Hezbollah, initially known as Islamic Amal, received significant support from Iran, allowing it to expand its operations from the Bekaa valley to Beirut and southern Lebanon. The group conducted attacks on Israeli and U.S. targets, positioning themselves as leaders of resistance. In 1985, Hezbollah released a manifesto outlining its militant, conservative, and anti-imperialist ideology, solidifying its identity. Hezbollah, initially known as Islamic Amal, received support from Iran, allowing it to expand operations. In 1985, Hezbollah released a manifesto echoing Iranian ideology, calling for the \"obliteration\" of Israel and the adoption of Islamic system by the people. Tension and armed clashes with Amal intensified during the civil war. Hezbollah and its rivals in Amal competed for leadership in the Lebanese Shiite community at the end of the civil war in 1989. The Taif Accord called for the disarmament of militia groups, leading Hezbollah to rebrand its armed elements as an \"Islamic resistance\" force against Israel. Debate over the role of this force has been central to Lebanese politics. Hezbollah continued its military campaign against the Israeli Defense Forces and the Southern Lebanese Army in the 1990s despite Israeli operations to destroy it. Hezbollah's resistance against Israeli forces in the 1990s, despite failed attempts to dislodge them from Lebanon, led to their eventual withdrawal in 2000. The ongoing dispute over the Shib'a Farms area has been a central justification for Hezbollah's possession of weapons and resistance to Israeli occupation. The erosion of Hezbollah's popular support among Lebanese Shiites may be key to subordinating the group to state institutions. Hezbollah's popularity among Lebanese Shiites is strong due to its military campaign against Israel, Lebanese identity, advocacy for marginalized Shiites, religious piety, and social services network. Many supporters see its military capability as irrelevant and endorse it as a political party for its social services and religious piety. The group continues to pursue political, social, and military programs, positioning itself primarily as a resistance movement. Hezbollah transitioned to an active role in Lebanese politics in the early 1990s, advocating for an \"Islamic system\" of governance. With Iran's support, they participated in the 1992 elections, winning eight parliamentary seats. Over the years, they have continued to field candidates and achieved electoral success. In the 2009 elections, Hezbollah won 10 seats and now holds two cabinet positions. Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite group, competes for the loyalty of its followers through various social, economic, and security initiatives, often referred to as \"a state within the state.\" While promoting a distinct Shiite identity, Hezbollah has adapted its religious messaging to coexist with a pluralistic society. The group has strong military capabilities, demonstrated in the 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah's military capabilities, including the use of missiles and long-range rockets, surprised Israeli leaders. They utilized civilian areas for command and control, making it difficult for Israel to limit civilian casualties. Hezbollah also effectively deployed anti-armor weaponry against Israeli ground forces. Concerns have been raised about the group replenishing and improving its arsenal since 2006, with reports indicating significant upgrades in long-range weaponry. Hezbollah's military capabilities have significantly developed since 2006, with an arsenal of thousands of rockets, including long-range solid-fuel rockets. Brigadier General Yossi Baidatz highlighted their ability to launch from deep inside Lebanon with greater range. The organization has a unified leadership structure and offers full party membership based on allegiance to its ideological program. Hezbollah's leadership is in the hands of the seven-member Majlis al Shura, which selects the secretary general. Current Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was elected in 1993. The council amended its rules to allow a secretary general to extend his candidacy beyond two terms. Five sub-councils oversee different aspects of Hezbollah's activities. The Majlis al Shura oversees Hezbollah's leadership, with Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah elected in 1993. The council amended rules for extended candidacy. Five sub-councils manage various activities, including oversight, recruitment, training, equipment, security, legislative analysis, constituent services, political party management, social, cultural, and educational activities, religious rulings, and conflict mediation. The assassination of Imad Mughniyah in 2008 was a significant blow to Hezbollah's leadership. Other key figures include Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem. Hezbollah's leadership, including Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem, continues to be guided by their 1985 manifesto. They draw on Shiite religious traditions and oppose the imbalance of power favoring the US and Israel. Hezbollah views global power imbalance in favor of the US and Israel, driven by US foreign policy to consolidate hegemony under the guise of combating terrorism. Recent events have complicated Hezbollah's legitimacy beyond core supporters, prompting leaders to restate positions. Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah presented an updated political vision in a televised press conference on November 30, 2009. The speech addressed issues such as U.S.-Israeli tyranny, military defeats, and political failures, highlighting a state of confusion and inability to control developments in the Arab and Islamic world. Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah discussed the retreat of the United States as a hegemonic power and the disintegration of the unipolar system in favor of pluralism. He also mentioned the historic eclipse of the Zionist entity and reaffirmed their firm stance on the Palestinian issue and agreements made in the past. The firm rejection of settling with Israel remains unchanged, even if the world recognizes it. Iran's ideology is centered on Palestine, opposing Israel and US policies, and should be seen as a source of inspiration and strategic influence. Syria has supported resistance movements in the region and emphasized the need to maintain strong relations with Lebanon for mutual political, security, and economic interests. The text emphasizes the need to restore relations between countries, highlights Hezbollah's role in Lebanon's security, and the necessity for a defensive formula to protect against Israeli threats. The success of the resistance in facing the enemy and the ongoing Israeli threat to Lebanon are also mentioned. The continued Israeli threat to Lebanon necessitates the resistance to strengthen its capabilities to fulfill its duty of liberating occupied territories and defending the land and its people. Hezbollah's role in Lebanon's future political and security arrangements is a topic of intense debate. Hezbollah's aim to maintain armed capabilities alongside the national army has sparked debate within Lebanon's political leadership, especially regarding its opposition to Israel. The resolution of territorial disputes with Israel could lead to conflicting views on Hezbollah's role in national security. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, believes in the need for a \"union\" of Hezbollah and state forces as long as the state lacks military capabilities to defend against external threats, particularly from Israel. Nasrallah argues that a strong state would eliminate the need for this union, but he doubts the Lebanese state's ability to develop sufficient military power. This stance suggests a desire to maintain the current status quo indefinitely. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, believes in a \"union\" of Hezbollah and state forces due to the state's lack of military capabilities against Israel. The March 14 movement pays lip service to opposing Israeli occupation while pressuring Hezbollah through public debate. Critiques of Hezbollah's proposal to maintain a \"state within a state\" have been raised. Prime Minister Saad al Hariri calls for dialogue on Hezbollah's weapons. The ongoing dialogue regarding Hezbollah's weapons is crucial, with decisions being consensual and sensitive. Prime Minister Hariri's statements are closely monitored before National Dialogue sessions, which have not produced agreements on national defense. Concerns about potential political paralysis and sectarian tension persist, with the next session scheduled for October. Hezbollah's popularity among Lebanese Shiites and in historically controlled areas is strong, based on its military campaign against Israel, Lebanese identity, advocacy for marginalized Shiites, religious piety, and social services network. Subordinating Hezbollah to state institutions may depend on eroding its popular support. Hezbollah's popularity among Lebanese Shiites is strong due to its military campaign against Israel, advocacy for marginalized Shiites, and social services network. The challenge of limiting Hezbollah's influence is compounded by its popular support, with many Lebanese supporters viewing its military capability as irrelevant. The dispute over the Shib'a Farms adds to the complexity, with Lebanon and Syria asserting it is part of Lebanese territory, while third parties argue it is part of the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights. The United Nations has not established any binding precedents regarding the Shib'a Farms in southern Lebanon. Resolution 1701 called for a proposal to delineate Lebanon's borders, including the disputed enclave. The Secretary-General's report in 2007 provided a provisional definition of the Farms, urging Israel, Syria, and Lebanon to respond for border demarcation progress. The U.N. Secretary-General provided a provisional definition of the Shib'a Farms in southern Lebanon to advance border demarcation and resolve the dispute over Israeli occupation. Hezbollah has expressed willingness for international intervention if the Farms are returned to Lebanese sovereignty, but maintains that disarmament is not linked to this issue. Former Prime Minister Siniora also emphasized the separation of Israel's withdrawal from Hezbollah's weapons. The U.N. Secretary-General defined the Shib'a Farms in southern Lebanon for border demarcation. Hezbollah supports international intervention for the Farms' return to Lebanese control but insists disarmament is separate. Former Prime Minister Siniora stressed the distinction between Israel's withdrawal and Hezbollah's weapons. Prime Minister Hariri also calls for Israel's withdrawal from Al Ghajar, citing it as Lebanese territory. The U.N. Secretary-General stated in 2007 that Israel's withdrawal from northern Al Ghajar is necessary for compliance with Resolution 1701. Israel has proposed withdrawing from the northern part of the village, causing division among locals. The unresolved dispute over Kfar Shouba hills adds complexity to the tri-border area. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon in The Hague has yet to issue indictments in the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. In 2009, officials who headed Lebanon's security services at the time of Hariri's assassination were released. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon questioned Hezbollah officials in 2010, with a potential indictment expected later that year. Foreign governments are concerned about potential instability if indictments are issued. Hezbollah is mounting a public relations campaign to discredit the tribunal investigating the Hariri assassination. Lebanese security forces arrested many individuals on charges of spying for Israel, with Hezbollah linking the spy networks to create discord in Lebanon. Nasrallah claimed to have evidence implicating Israel in the assassination and called for an internal Lebanese investigation. Hezbollah is urging for a Lebanese commission to investigate the assassination of Hariri, claiming to have evidence of Israeli involvement. Nasrallah stated that an Israeli drone was surveilling the area before the murder, and offered to provide video evidence. He also accused some of spending $500 million to tarnish Hezbollah's image and engage in a battle for public opinion. The March 14 coalition and the opposition have been exchanging criticisms in response to Nasrallah's statements. Prime Minister Hariri's recent statements suggest that Hezbollah's media campaign may be influencing the March 14 coalition. In an interview, Hariri appeared to backtrack on his accusation against Syria for his father's assassination, emphasizing the need to build a realistic and solid relationship with Syria based on past mistakes. The tribunal investigating the assassination of the martyred premier is not linked to political accusations. Hariri's statements have raised concerns about the increasing political costs of supporting the STL. Analysts question if indictments will be issued at all. Bellemare emphasizes the need for a credible investigation unaffected by Lebanese politics. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon responded to recent exchanges between Hariri and Hezbollah. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the Special Tribunal on Lebanon's future is not at risk despite political remarks. The Obama Administration has expressed concerns about Syria's increasing support for Hezbollah, with assessments indicating a substantial rise in military aid since the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war. President Bashar al-Asad's strong political and military support for Hizballah deepens the strategic relationship between Syria and the organization. Hizballah's actions in Lebanon and beyond violate Security Council Resolution 1701, fuel sectarian tensions, and pose a threat to regional peace. Ambassador Feltman highlights the persistent threat posed by Hizballah's weapons and Syria's backing, emphasizing the obstacles they create for peace in the region. The Obama Administration's limited engagement strategy with Syria aims to communicate U.S. views and interests clearly, particularly regarding Syria's support for Hezbollah. Efforts to convince Syria to stop supporting Hezbollah have had limited success, despite concerns about the transfer of advanced weapons to the group. The relationship between Syria and Hezbollah poses a threat to regional peace and stability. The Obama Administration supports Lebanon in assessing border management needs and improving security, amid challenges with Syrian-Lebanese relations and border demarcation. The Obama Administration is aiding Lebanon in evaluating border management needs and enhancing capabilities, focusing on training and equipping a new joint LAF-ISF Common Border Force to patrol the eastern border with Syria. Iran is identified as Hezbollah's primary source of external support. Iran has been involved in Lebanon since the early days of the Islamic Republic, supporting Lebanese Hizballah through the IRGC-QF with financial, weapons, training, and logistical support. This relationship allows Iran to maintain a capability to strike Israel directly. Iran supports Lebanese Hizballah with financial, weapons, training, and logistical support, allowing them to exceed armament levels from the 2006 conflict. The IRGC-QF operates training camps in Lebanon for Hizballah fighters, with Iran providing significant funding of $100-200 million annually. Experts are divided on the extent of Iranian influence on Hizballah's decisions and engagement in Lebanon's political process. Some argue that Hezbollah's independence is maintained due to its crucial role for Iran, giving them leverage in discussions. Iranian influence over Hezbollah varies across different elements and political contexts, with the IRGC having more influence over Hezbollah's \"resistance\" elements than its political cadres. Hezbollah's domestic political interests and transnational security priorities create competing pressures. In 2008, their armed response to Lebanese government control efforts damaged their image as nationalist resistance fighters. Hezbollah's network extends beyond Lebanon, with experts divided on its extent and nature. In a 2006 hearing, Frank Urbancic, Jr. discussed Hezbollah's activities. Hezbollah's global support network includes fundraising activities in the Middle East and support for Palestinian terrorist groups since 2000. While there is little evidence of operational cells in Latin America, supporters are involved in fundraising and illegal activities. Financing also comes from the Shiite diaspora in West and Central Africa. Hezbollah's international patronage networks involve criminal enterprises supported by ethnic Lebanese in various regions, including South America, North America, Europe, and West Africa. There are concerns that these networks could also serve as \"sleeper cells\" for potential attacks on U.S. or Israeli interests. Additionally, Hezbollah has a strong presence in the Levant and extends its support network into the Gulf for fundraising activities. Hezbollah has been involved in supporting Palestinian terrorist groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) since 2000, providing financial, training, and logistical support. They have also expanded their reach by training Iraqi Shia militants in using improvised explosive devices. Hezbollah receives significant financing from the Shiite Muslim diaspora in West and Central Africa, with Lebanese diaspora businesses controlling key commodities in the region. Lebanese traders in West Africa have significant control over basic commodities like rice and chicken, as well as diamond exports. Contributions to Hezbollah are often made in cash and collected by couriers, providing safe haven for fighters. The Lebanese community in West Africa reflects religious and political divisions present in Lebanon. In Latin America, Hezbollah has supporters and sympathizers involved in fundraising through legal and illegal means. Hezbollah supporters and sympathizers engage in illegal activities to fund the terrorist group, including smuggling, drug trafficking, money laundering, and fraud. The group has been implicated in attacks in Argentina and is active in Latin America, particularly in the tri-border area between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Lebanese immigrant Assad Barakat funneled about $6 million a year to Hezbollah from 1999 to 2003 through smuggling and counterfeiting operations. The FBI, along with other government agencies, works to shut down Middle East charitable organizations funneling money to terrorist groups. In specific cases, individuals have been convicted for providing material support to Hezbollah through illegal activities like racketeering and money laundering. The Department of the Treasury has also identified and closed fundraising fronts for terrorist organizations in the United States. The United States has imposed financial and immigration sanctions on Hezbollah and its supporters, including blocking assets, prohibiting financial support, and designating individuals associated with Hezbollah as terrorists. The U.S. government has designated several individuals and entities affiliated with Hezbollah as SDGTs, including spiritual adviser Sayyid Hussayn Fadlallah, Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and others involved in Hezbollah's support networks. Organizations designated include financial conduits like the Islamic Resistance Support Organization and Hezbollah's construction arms. The United States has also targeted supporters of Hezbollah in Iran and Syria with financial sanctions. In 2004, President Bush issued Executive Order 13338 targeting individuals involved with Syria's support of U.S.-designated terrorists, including Military Intelligence Director Assef Shawkat and Ghazi Kanaan. President Bush also issued Executive Order 13441 in 2007, targeting individuals undermining Lebanon's democratic processes or supporting Syrian interference in Lebanon. The United States has taken actions against individuals involved in supporting U.S.-designated terrorists in Syria and undermining Lebanese sovereignty. This includes designating Syrian officials like Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik for coordinating with Hezbollah. Additionally, measures have been taken to exclude Iran's Bank Saderat from the U.S. financial system for facilitating Hezbollah's financial activities. The U.S. has also supported UN resolutions calling for the disarmament of non-state actors in Lebanon and preventing weapons trafficking from Iran to Lebanon. Enforcement actions have been taken by the U.S. Navy against suspected violators. The U.S. Navy has enforced actions against suspected Iranian-origin weaponry shipments to Lebanon. In January 2009, they boarded and searched the MV Monchegorsk in the Red Sea, later detained in Cypriot waters for inspection. The United Nations Sanctions Committee found military ordnance and raw materials for munitions on board, violating the arms embargo from Iran. European governments have varied approaches to Hezbollah, with some resisting designating it as a terrorist group. European governments have differing approaches to Hezbollah, with some resisting labeling it as a terrorist group. Calls have been made by members of Congress for the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization to target its activities in Europe. Germany has engaged in negotiations between Hezbollah and Israel since the mid-1990s. EU officials have differing views on Hezbollah, with some supporting engagement based on its role in Lebanon's government. Previous High Representatives have met with Hezbollah officials, while challenges posed by Hezbollah remain unresolved. Despite international efforts to prevent weapon smuggling from Iran and Syria into Lebanon, Lebanese security capabilities are still developing. Iran continues to support Hezbollah with weapons, training, and financing, posing a threat to Israel's security and Lebanese sovereignty. Hezbollah's political influence complicates engagement with Lebanon on security and reform issues, as the country's political environment is divided by sectarian and political rivalries. Hezbollah's legitimacy is based on an ideology that promotes resistance to foreign \"occupiers.\" Critics argue that the US has not taken direct action to limit Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon and the region, stop weapon flow, or disarm its militant wing. Analysts suggest diplomatic, assistance, and security measures to weaken Hezbollah. Hezbollah's legitimacy is rooted in an ideology of resisting foreign occupiers, particularly Israel. Historical grievances against Israel justify their weapons arsenal. Some analysts propose that resolving these grievances, such as Israeli withdrawal from Al Ghajar village and ending overflights in southern Lebanon, could shift Hezbollah's focus to domestic issues. Nasrallah expressed readiness to develop a defense strategy for Lebanon in 2008. Nasrallah expressed readiness to develop a defense strategy for Lebanon, including releasing prisoners and liberating territories to close the liberation file. He emphasized the ongoing threats from Israel and stated that if alternative means of defense are found, the resistance may no longer be necessary. Nasrallah proposes a new defense strategy for Lebanon, emphasizing the need for southerners to return home. The strategy depends on Israel's willingness to make concessions and the US's ability to pressure Israel. There are concerns that Hezbollah may use any concessions to gain public support, but some argue that this could lead to a loss of legitimacy in the long run. Critics suggest that engaging with Hezbollah may be the best way to contain the group. Retired Ambassador Ryan Crocker advocates for the U.S. to engage with Hezbollah to better understand the organization and potentially disarm it. Critics argue that Hezbollah remains a violent organization despite its political presence in Lebanon. Hezbollah is seen as a violent organization committed to war with Israel and challenging U.S. interests. The Obama Administration initially considered engaging with Hezbollah but later reaffirmed the policy of not negotiating with terrorist groups. Syrian and Iranian support for Hezbollah is well-documented. Some analysts suggest increasing costs of support for Hezbollah by pursuing U.N. sanctions against Syria and Iran for violations. This could potentially lead to legitimizing airstrikes against Syrian facilities near Lebanon border if transfers of advanced weapons continue. The United States may be able to influence Syria to reduce support for Hezbollah and interference in Lebanon by easing sanctions or brokering a peace agreement with Israel, potentially breaking the alliance between Syria and Iran. The Obama Administration has worked to improve relations with Syria, but Syria's cooperation depends on U.S. ability to secure concessions from Israel, particularly regarding the Golan Heights. The United States lacks domestic political support to expand engagement with Syria, as shown by the unconfirmed ambassadorial nomination of Robert Ford to Damascus. Analysts question if the U.S. has the leverage to bring Israel to negotiations over disputed territories. U.S. economic assistance to Lebanon has increased since Syria's withdrawal in 2005, aiming to promote political and economic reforms in Lebanon. Some observers question the levels of Economic Support Funds (ESF) assistance compared to military aid. Some observers question if U.S. assistance strategy in Lebanon is too focused on the security sector, suggesting building municipal capacity in Hezbollah-controlled areas to provide political alternatives. Conditional international assistance could target NGOs and government efforts to combat extremism through social services, education, and economic growth. Analysts argue that regardless of the focus of U.S. assistance, it is crucial to avoid abandoning populations historically sympathetic to the West. Some analysts argue that U.S. assistance in Lebanon should be tied to political reforms addressing instability and confessionalism. They suggest structural changes to unlock the sectarian system and promote a more democratic system, including a bicameral legislature and proportional representation elections. However, Lebanon's current political leaders oppose these reforms due to sectarian interests. Critics of current U.S. policy towards Lebanon advocate for a shift towards state institution building and implementing UN Security Council resolutions. Critics argue for increased U.S. assistance to Lebanese security forces with sophisticated equipment to enhance national defense against Hezbollah. The need for better equipment and training to improve cooperation with UNIFIL and border security is emphasized. However, questions arise regarding the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance in aligning with policy goals in Lebanon. U.S. security assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) aligns with U.S. policy goals in Lebanon. An incident in 2010 where the LAF fired on Israeli forces raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. assistance and the LAF's integrity. Critics call for increased support for Lebanese security forces to enhance national defense against Hezbollah and improve cooperation with UNIFIL. Most analysts believe that expanding U.S. security assistance to Lebanon is unlikely due to concerns about altering the military balance in the region and affecting Israel's Qualitative Military Edge. There are doubts about whether the Lebanese Armed Forces have the political will to confront Hezbollah, as they are seen as natural allies with a common threat perception. If the security situation deteriorates, Israel or the U.S. may consider disarming Hezbollah by force, a controversial option among policymakers and observers. Most analysts believe that a military strike to eliminate Hezbollah's militia would have significant political costs and could escalate into a broader regional war involving Syria and Iran. Some speculate that Israel may see any provocation as an opportunity to try to destroy Hezbollah's military capability entirely. Most analysts agree that a war between Hezbollah and Israel could escalate into a regional conflict and be costly in human and material terms. Israeli statements indicate they will hold the Lebanese government responsible for any attacks from Lebanese territory, including those by Hezbollah. Hezbollah's leadership has become more aggressive since 2006, with Hassan Nasrallah warning Israel in a recent speech. Hezbollah's rockets can target ships heading to Palestinian ports in the Mediterranean. Rebuilding Hezbollah's military capability post-war could be challenging, similar to Lebanon's post-civil war integration of militias into the Lebanese Armed Forces. Suggestions to integrate Hezbollah into Lebanon's National Dialogue face opposition from Hezbollah officials. Some analysts believe integrating Hezbollah into Lebanon's political process could be the best solution, but concerns exist about Hezbollah's influence on the state security apparatus."
