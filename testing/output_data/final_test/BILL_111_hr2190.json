    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury Pollution Reduction Act\". It includes findings related to mercury pollution. Congress finds that mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10% of women of childbearing age in the US have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. The main source of mercury exposure is contaminated fish. The long-term solution is to reduce global mercury use to lower contamination levels in the environment. Mercury pollution is a significant issue as it is a transboundary pollutant that affects bodies of water globally. Only a few plants in the US still use the outdated \"mercury cell\" chlor-alkali process, contributing to the problem. Less than 5% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US come from these plants. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges the contamination risk of mercury in products and its release. Cost-effective alternatives are used in 95% of chlorine and caustic soda production. Other countries like Japan have banned the mercury cell process. Despite known mercury use, neither the industry nor the EPA can fully track its disposal. The United States must work aggressively to minimize mercury supply, demand, and emissions both domestically and internationally. Congress declares that the United States should develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, decrease mercury releases from current reservoirs, and minimize exposures to mercury, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, a new section is added to the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The text defines a chlor-alkali facility as a facility used for manufacturing chlorine or caustic soda with a mercury cell process. It prohibits the use of mercury cells for manufacturing in the United States, requiring existing facilities to either switch to a non-mercury process or cease operations by June 30, 2012. The text prohibits the manufacturing of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells after June 30, 2013. Facilities can continue using mercury cells until a non-mercury replacement facility is complete or until June 30, 2015. An export ban on elemental mercury is also enforced. The text prohibits the manufacturing of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells after June 30, 2013. Facilities can continue using mercury cells until a non-mercury replacement facility is complete or until June 30, 2015. An export ban on elemental mercury is also enforced. Additionally, the owner or operator of a chlor-alkali facility is allowed to store elemental mercury in accordance with the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008. The text prohibits the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Section 15 of the Act is amended to include section 6A."
