It introduces a credit for the acquisition of manufacturing property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Manufacturing Economic Recovery Act of 2012 introduces a manufacturing recovery credit for acquiring manufacturing real and tangible personal property. The credit is based on the taxpayer's basis in the property placed in service during the taxable year, with different applicable percentages for property located on existing manufacturing property and former manufacturing property. The Manufacturing Economic Recovery Act of 2012 offers a manufacturing recovery credit for acquiring real and tangible personal property. Different applicable percentages apply based on the property's location on existing or former manufacturing property. \"If the aggregate manufacturing tangible personal property placed in service during the taxable year is located on existing, former, or future manufacturing property, the applicable percentage is determined.\" For taxable income:\n- Not over $250,000: 5%, 10%, 15%\n- Over $250,000 but not over $1,000,000: 7.5%, 12.5%, 17.5%\n- Over $1,000,000: 10%, 15%, 20% If manufacturing property is in an economically disadvantaged area, percentages under paragraphs (1) and (2) increase by 5 points. In extremely disadvantaged areas, the increase is 10 points. The term 'disadvantaged area' refers to an area with a single 5-digit postal zip code and includes a census tract where the median annual household income is below $40,000. An 'extremely economically disadvantaged area' is similar but with a threshold of $32,000. The household income for disadvantaged areas is determined using the 2010 census data, updated by the American Community Survey. In areas not within census tracts, county divisions are used to determine median annual household income. Manufacturing property refers to tangible property used in manufacturing businesses in the United States. Manufacturing property excludes residential real property and includes existing and former manufacturing facilities purchased within a specific timeframe. Manufacturing property is defined as existing or former manufacturing facilities, with future manufacturing property having no permanent vertical structures. Manufacturing real property refers to land or section 1250 property, while manufacturing tangible personal property is tangible property excluding real property. The credit is not allowable for certain relocations of manufacturing. The section excludes property acquired in a manufacturing facility relocation unless the new location is in a different state or more than 100 miles away. Special rules apply, such as no credit if a remediation deduction is claimed, and a basis adjustment for property with a credit allowed.
