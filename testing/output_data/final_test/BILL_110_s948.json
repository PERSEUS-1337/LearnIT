    "content": "The \"Children and Media Research Advancement Act\" or the \"CAMRA Act\" aims to enable research on the impact of electronic media on children's development and provide Congress with empirical evidence. This Act amends the Public Health Service Act to include research on the role of electronic media in children and adolescents' development. Research on the role and impact of electronic media in the development of children and adolescents is addressed in SEC. 452H. The Secretary will contract the National Academy of Sciences to review research on the impact of electronic media on youth in cognitive and physical development areas. The Secretary will award grants for research on the impact of electronic media on youth's cognitive, physical, and socio-behavioral development, including areas like physical coordination, diet, exercise, family activities, peer relationships, and consumption habits. Research funded by grants must focus on the impact of media factors on youth, such as content, format, exposure length, age, venue, and parental involvement. It should not duplicate other federal research activities. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Director to receive a grant for research on electronic media's effects, including TV, movies, DVDs, video games, digital music, the Internet, and cell phones. The Director requires grant applicants to submit an application with specified information and agree to use the grant funds for designated activities. Reports must be submitted to the Director and Congress within specific timeframes, including a synthesis of research results. The section authorizes appropriations of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2011, and $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2012 for research grants and outlines existing research gaps."
