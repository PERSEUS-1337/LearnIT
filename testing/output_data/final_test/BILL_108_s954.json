If the service obligation is transferred to another entity, the successor can use the transmission facilities or firm transmission rights associated with the obligation.

The section specifies that a transmitting utility reserving transmission capacity for service obligations or contractual obligations is not considered discriminatory. It does not apply to areas served by certain utilities and does not affect previously approved transmission rights allocations. SEC. 3. COST ALLOCATION.

The requestor of interconnection or transmission service is not entitled to transmission service credits from payments made under this subsection. SEC. 4. STANDARD MARKET DESIGN RULE. Section 206 of the Federal Power Act is amended to include a definition of a standard market design rule, which pertains to rules addressing transmission access and market design under the Act. The standard market design rule pertains to transmission access and market design under the Federal Power Act. It involves the transfer of ownership, operation, or control of transmission facilities to specific organizations and requires approval by Congress to be effective. State consent is also required for the rule to take effect in a region. The State Commission must provide written consent for the application of the standard market design rule in the State."
