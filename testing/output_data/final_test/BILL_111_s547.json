The \"Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009\" extends prescription drug discounts to Medicaid managed care organizations, ensuring that payment for outpatient drugs and capitation rates are based on actual cost experience related to rebates. The Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009 extends prescription drug discounts to Medicaid managed care organizations, allowing them to exclude or restrict coverage of outpatient drugs based on organization policies. The Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009 allows Medicaid managed care organizations to exclude or restrict coverage of outpatient drugs based on organization policies, subject to state oversight and approval authority over the formulary used. The Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009 allows Medicaid managed care organizations to establish formularies based on positive inclusion of drugs selected by a formulary committee, with state oversight and approval authority. The Drug Rebate Equalization Act of 2009 permits Medicaid managed care organizations to create formularies with drugs chosen by a committee, as long as excluded drugs are available through prior authorization. Covered outpatient drugs dispensed by certain organizations are exempt from specific requirements if they receive discounts under section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. Each State with a Medicaid managed care organization contract must report quarterly to the Secretary on rebates received from drug manufacturers for drugs provided to enrollees. The Secretary will review and make public the aggregate data. This section and its amendments take effect upon enactment and apply to rebate agreements entered into or renewed after that date."
