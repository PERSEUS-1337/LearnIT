    "content": "Providing federal assistance for nonfederal forest landowners has been a part of USDA's programs for over a century. The USDA Division of Forestry was established in 1881, later becoming the USDA Forest Service in 1905. The Forest Service's main missions include managing the National Forest System, conducting forestry research, and providing forestry assistance. Congress authorized forestry assistance programs in the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924. The Clarke-McNary Act of 1924 established forestry assistance programs, which were later revised in the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. These programs are periodically examined in omnibus legislation like farm bills. The 2008 farm bill set national funding priorities and standardized the process for states to assess forest resources. The 2014 farm bill repealed expired programs and modified assistance program requirements. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and modified statewide assessments and the Office of International Forestry. Agricultural programs, including forestry programs, are set to expire in FY2018 without extension or reauthorization. Forestry assistance programs are mainly administered by the FS but implemented by state partners, providing aid to private landowners. The 2008 farm bill expanded conservation practices to include forestry, allowing for federal financial assistance to private forest landowners. Federal financial assistance to private forest landowners is possible through conservation programs. States must prepare a State Forest Action Plan to be eligible for funding, which includes assessing forest conditions, identifying threats, and developing a long-term strategy. The State Forest Action Plans are reviewed and revised every 5 and 10 years, respectively, covering all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 8 territories. Each state must publish an annual funding report and have a State Forest Stewardship Coordination Committee chaired by the state forester. The committee, composed of federal, state, and local representatives, makes recommendations on statewide priorities and forestry programs. Technical and financial assistance may be provided to support these initiatives. The Forest Health Protection program provides financial and technical assistance for surveys, insect control, and disease management on state or private lands. Assistance is delivered through grants or cost-sharing with recipients. Most FS assistance programs are nationally available with authorized funding. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with an average annual appropriation of $362.7 million. The funding comes from the FS's State and Private Forestry account, with some programs funded from other accounts. Funding peaked at $420.5 million in FY2010 and decreased to $328.9 million in FY2017, increasing slightly to $355.1 million in FY2018. Funding for forestry assistance programs has declined over the past 15 years, with an average annual appropriation of $362.7 million. In FY2018, overall funding was 32% below FY2004 levels and 25% below FY2010 levels. The Administration requested $197.4 million in FY2019 and proposed to eliminate funding for seven programs while decreasing funding for others. Some programs have been repealed or unfunded by Congress, with activities potentially continuing through other authorizations. This report focuses on forestry assistance programs administered by FS, while other agencies like USDA Farm Services Agency and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service also administer programs with forest conservation benefits. The Department of the Interior administers a community assistance program to mitigate wildfire risk. The tabular presentation provides basic information on FS forestry and fire assistance programs, including program description, activities, eligibility requirements, funding details, statutory authority, and program website link. Information is sourced from agency budget documents and websites. More details can be found on the FS SPF website and cooperative forestry page."
