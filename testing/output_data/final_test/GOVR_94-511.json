They avoid SEC regulation by accepting funds only from accredited investors with assets of $1 million or more. Hedge funds also use exemptions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 to operate differently from public mutual funds. Mutual funds are subject to regulations to protect investors, including limits on borrowed money, record keeping rules, and shareholder approval requirements. Hedge funds, on the other hand, typically have fewer than 100 investors to avoid these regulations. The National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 allowed hedge funds to have an unlimited number of partners, as long as each is a \"qualified purchaser\" with at least $5 million in total invested assets. Hedge funds are often structured as limited partnerships with a few general partners. Hedge funds are structured as limited partnerships with a few general partners who also serve as investment managers. Managers are typically ex-employees of large securities firms seeking greater financial rewards. They take 15%-25% of profits earned by the fund plus an annual management fee of 1%-2% of total assets. Estimates of the hedge fund universe vary, with around 8,000-9,000 funds and $2 trillion in assets before the 2007 financial crisis. Many funds closed due to losses in 2008. Many hedge funds closed in 2008 due to severe losses, with estimates suggesting a 75% shrink in capital under management. Starting a hedge fund is relatively simple, attracting capital with good results, but risky investments lead to a high mortality rate. Studies show a 20% attrition rate per year, with an average lifespan of three years. Hedge funds have varying annual returns compared to benchmarks like the S&P 500, with some outperforming and others lagging. The short lifespan of many funds creates measurement difficulties due to survivorship bias. Hedge funds have high-risk/high-return operations, attracting investors seeking diversification and high returns. Despite high fees and risks, success stories drive their popularity. Losses are expected, but only sophisticated and wealthy investors are allowed to participate. An exception was Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a high-return hedge fund, faced turmoil in 1998 due to financial crises in Asia and Russia. Despite producing annual returns of over 40%, the fund lost almost $2 billion in August 1998, leading to a rescue package facilitated by the New York Fed. The Fed intervened in LTCM due to concerns about systemic risk in financial markets. LTCM had borrowed extensively and held complex derivatives, magnifying its exposure to $80-$100 billion. Liquidating assets in troubled conditions could have caused extreme price drops and volatility, impacting firms not directly involved with LTCM. In the aftermath of the Long-Term Capital Management episode, systemic risk became a major concern raised by hedge funds. These funds had the ability to raise large sums of money, leverage them through borrowing and derivatives, posing a threat to U.S. financial markets if they were to fail. Not all hedge funds engage in high-risk strategies, but many do. Systemic risk concerns arise from hedge funds' ability to amass large and complex positions, potentially leading to significant market disruptions and losses for lenders and counterparties. The lack of regulatory oversight over hedge fund activities further complicates the situation. Hedge funds' lack of transparency can heighten market panic, as seen in LTCM's collapse. Successes can also worry regulators, with hedge funds blamed for currency market instability. Speculators can manipulate currencies, leading to pressure for devaluation and drastic measures like interest rate hikes to defend the currency's value. Speculation in global markets, particularly by hedge funds, can lead to sharp increases in domestic interest rates, impacting the stock market and economic growth. While speculation's effect on price volatility is debated, regulators view hedge funds with suspicion. The LTCM case in 1999 prompted the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to issue a report on hedge funds. The SEC, CFTC, and Treasury issued a report on hedge funds, citing the LTCM case to highlight the risks of excessive leverage. The report recommended more disclosure of financial information by hedge funds, including annual disclosure statements and public companies disclosing their financial exposure to hedge funds. In 2003, the SEC staff recommended hedge funds to register as investment advisers for early fraud detection and uniform standards. The SEC adopted a rule on October 26, 2004, requiring hedge funds to register, despite opposition citing investor sophistication and risk awareness. The SEC adopted a rule in 2004 requiring hedge funds to register, despite opposition from critics who argued that hedge fund investors are sophisticated and know the risks. The regulation fell short of what some critics wanted, as the SEC decided against direct regulation of hedge fund trading. The rule took effect on February 1, 2006. The SEC adopted a rule in 2004 requiring hedge funds to register, which took effect on February 1, 2006. However, on June 23, 2006, an appeals court found the rule arbitrary and not compatible with the Investment Advisers Act, returning it to the SEC for reconsideration. SEC Chairman Cox instructed the staff to provide alternatives for consideration, including concerns about the \"retailization\" of hedge funds. The SEC is worried about unsophisticated households investing in hedge funds. The SEC proposed a regulation to raise the accredited investor threshold from $1 million to $2.5 million in assets, aiming to reduce the pool of potential hedge fund investors. This move is in response to concerns about unsophisticated households investing in hedge funds and the risk it poses to pension funds and institutional investors. The SEC is considering raising the accredited investor threshold to $2.5 million, which has received criticism from investors who may be excluded. The President's Working Group emphasizes market discipline and risk management to protect investors without calling for new regulatory powers. The Madoff Ponzi scheme raised concerns about market self-regulation and led to calls for stricter regulation of investment advisers, including hedge funds. The Obama Administration recommended that advisers to hedge funds register with the SEC if their assets exceed a certain threshold. In the 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to regulate hedge funds, including requiring registration for firms with more than $25 million in client funds and mandating disclosure of investments in hedge funds by defined benefit pension plans. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets was directed to study the growth, risks, leverage, and benefits of hedge funds. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to regulate hedge funds, including requiring registration for firms with more than $25 million in client funds and mandating disclosure of investments in hedge funds by defined benefit pension plans. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets was directed to study the hedge fund industry and report to Congress with recommendations on regulation. Various bills proposed changes to tax treatment, registration requirements, and data collection for hedge funds, private equity firms, and venture capital funds. Hedge funds are considered part of the \"shadow\" financial system, but not a principal cause of the 2007 financial crisis. In the 111th Congress, regulatory reform legislation required certain hedge funds to register with the SEC and disclose information about their positions and trading strategies. The House passed H.R. 4173, mandating registration for funds with over $150 million under management. Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Act included similar provisions for registration and reporting. Exemptions were provided for advisers to venture capital funds and small business investment corporations. The Senate version of the regulatory reform legislation, passed on March 22, 2010, includes provisions for registration and reporting of systemic risk data. It exempts venture capital funds, private equity funds, and SBICs, setting the SEC registration threshold for investment advisers at $100 million in assets under management. Advisers below this threshold would register with the states."
