    "content": "The \"Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2007\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that millions of children have been killed, disabled, or exploited in armed conflicts worldwide. The Child Soldier Phenomenon is a global issue affecting every continent except Antarctica and Australia. Many children in armed forces or paramilitaries are forcibly conscripted through kidnapping or coercion, while others join out of economic necessity or personal safety. Some child soldiers are forced to commit gruesome acts by military commanders. Female child soldiers often face rape, sexual abuse, and enslavement by militia commanders, leading to severe social stigma upon returning home. Military leaders target children for recruitment due to their psychological immaturity. Child soldiers are recruited due to their psychological immaturity and vulnerability to manipulation. They are often separated from their families to foster dependence on military leaders, leading to deep trauma. These children face hazardous conditions, risking physical injury, psychological trauma, diseases, and death. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets 18 as the minimum age for involvement in armed conflict. The Optional Protocol establishes 18 as the minimum age for conscription and prohibits children under 18 from direct participation in hostilities. The US Senate approved the ratification of the Optional Protocol in 2002, and more than 110 governments worldwide have ratified it. Additionally, the US ratified International Labour Convention 182 in 1999, which prohibits the use of children in combat. The Senate ratified the Protocol to Prevent Trafficking in Persons, including child soldiers, in 2005. It is in the national security interest to reduce encounters of US Armed Forces with children in combat. The Foreign Assistance Act directs the President to conduct international security. The Foreign Assistance Act directs the President to conduct international security assistance programs in a way that promotes human rights and avoids aligning the US with governments that violate human rights. SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIER DEFINED. In this Act, the term \"child soldier\" refers to any person under 18 who directly participates in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces, has been compulsorily recruited into such forces, voluntarily recruited under 16, or recruited/used in hostilities by non-state armed forces. It also includes those serving in support roles like cooks, porters, messengers, medics, guards, or sex slaves. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 4 of the Act. The Sense of Congress condemns the use of child soldiers and calls for support to establish international standards to end this abuse. The United States Government should provide services to rehabilitate and reintegrate recovered child soldiers back into their communities. The United States should work with the international community to bring rebel organizations to justice for kidnapping children as soldiers, including the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. This includes facilitating reconciliation with communities and providing educational and vocational assistance to recovered abductees. The United States should coordinate efforts with international partners to bring rebel groups like the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, FARC, and LTTE to justice for using child soldiers. This includes recovering abducted children and helping them reintegrate into society. Coordination between the Secretaries of State, Labor, and Defense is crucial in achieving these goals, especially in countries where the use of child soldiers is a concern. Diplomatic missions should have strategies in place to address this issue. The United States diplomatic missions in countries with child soldiers should develop strategies to end this abuse of human rights. They should prioritize programs and candidates that work towards ending the use of child soldiers when allocating funds or recommending grants. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION. None of the funds appropriated for international military education and training, foreign military financing, foreign military sales, direct commercial sales, or excess defense articles may be used by countries identified as using child soldiers. The Secretary of State must notify any government identified as using child soldiers. The President can waive the prohibition for a country if it is in the national interest, with each waiver published and justified to relevant committees. The President may reinstate assistance to a country prohibited under the Act if they comply with standards and policies regarding child soldiers. Assistance can also be provided for programs related to addressing the issue of child soldiers or military professionalization. The President can reinstate assistance for international military education and training to a country prohibited under the Act if they meet criteria for demobilizing child soldiers and supporting military professionalization. This exception is limited to 2 years. SEC. 6. REPORTS. The United States missions abroad will investigate reports of child soldiers. The Secretary of State will include information on the use of child soldiers in each foreign country in the Human Rights Reports, noting trends and government involvement. If a government violates the standards, it will be clearly indicated in the Annual Human Rights Report. The President must provide Congress with a list of countries violating human rights standards, any waivers granted, justifications for waivers, and details of assistance given under the Act annually for 10 years. The President must submit a report to Congress within 180 days outlining a strategy for achieving the policy objectives of the Act and coordinating US Government efforts. Additionally, there will be training provided for foreign service officers. Section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to include training on child soldiers for officers of the Service. The Act will take effect 180 days after enactment and apply to funds obligated after that date."
