    "content": "The Congress finds that increased parental involvement in education is crucial for children's long-term success. Providing seed money for education is a suitable role for the Federal Government. Children in the parents as teachers program in Missouri show improved cognitive, language, and social skills. Early childhood programs often start too late for remediation, and many children miss out on early health screenings before school entry. The Act aims to promote parent and early childhood education programs to increase parents' knowledge and confidence in child-rearing, strengthen partnerships between parents and schools, and enhance the developmental progress of children. The Act defines key terms such as \"developmental screening,\" \"eligible entity,\" \"eligible family,\" and \"lead agency\" to support parent and early childhood education programs. The Act defines terms related to parent education programs, including \"parent education\" and \"parent educator,\" to support the implementation of the parents as teachers program. The parent educator administers group meetings, home visits, and developmental screening for eligible families as part of the Parents As Teachers program. The Secretary is authorized to make grants for parents as teachers programs in a State, with funds to supplement non-Federal sources. Grant funds must not replace non-Federal funds. Program requirements include group meetings, home visits, and developmental screening for eligible families. Each State or eligible entity receiving a grant must conduct a parents as teachers program, which includes parent education programs, developmental screening of children, and hiring parent educators with experience in child care. The lead State agency must establish the number of group meetings and home visits required for each participating family, with a minimum of 2 group meetings and 10 home visits per year. The agency is also responsible for administering periodic screening of participating children. Grant funds awarded under this Act shall only be used for parents as teachers programs which serve families from birth to age 3, including educational and developmental screening of children and recruitment programs for hard-to-reach populations. SEC. 6. SPECIAL RULES. No person, including home school parents, public school parents, or private school parents, shall be required to participate in any program of parent education or developmental screening. No parents as teachers program assisted under this Act shall infringe on the right of parents to direct the education of their children. Section 438(c) of the General Education Provisions Act applies to States and eligible entities awarded grants under this Act. The Secretary will establish a Parents As Teachers National Center to support states and entities running parents as teachers programs. An evaluation of these programs' impact on at-risk children must be completed within 4 years. States or entities seeking grants must submit applications detailing the services they require. Payments and federal share will be determined accordingly. SEC. 10. PAYMENTS AND FEDERAL SHARE. The Secretary will pay the Federal share of approved applications for program activities. The Federal share decreases over five years, starting at 100% and decreasing to 25%. Non-Federal share can be in cash or in kind. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $20,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 1993, and necessary sums for fiscal years 1994-1997 for Act implementation."
