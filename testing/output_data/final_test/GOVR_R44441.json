The total funding exceeds $153 billion, including mandatory spending. The discretionary caps were set to avoid sequestration. The White House released its FY2017 budget request and an outline for FY2018 appropriations. The Agriculture appropriations act funds USDA and FDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service. The enacted Agriculture bill includes CFTC funding and covers both mandatory and discretionary spending. Major discretionary spending items include domestic nutrition, agricultural research, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance programs, food safety inspection, conservation, and animal and plant health. Mandatory spending items include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, child nutrition, crop insurance, and the Commodity Credit Corporation. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation is $20.877 billion, $623 million smaller than the previous year.

Agriculture appropriations have generally increased since FY2013, but returning to historical benchmarks depends on inflation adjustments and other factors. The discretionary spending authorized for each title in the 10 years since FY2007 is represented by stacked bars in Figure 3. The total budget authority in Titles I-VI exceeds the official \"302(b)\" discretionary spending limit due to offsets from negative amounts in Title VII General Provisions and other adjustments. General Provisions have negative impacts mostly from limits on mandatory programs, scored as savings. In FY2017, budget authority for primary agencies increased despite a decrease in official discretionary spending allocation, thanks to the use of CHIMPS and other tools to offset reductions. The use of CHIMPS and other tools offset discretionary appropriations to mitigate reductions in discretionary budget authority in FY2011 and succeeding years. In FY2016, the effect was less pronounced due to smaller offsets, with some areas seeing real increases while others declined since 2008. Agencies like FDA and CFTC had sustained real increases, while general agricultural programs and domestic nutrition programs saw real decreases in discretionary spending. In FY2016, there were real decreases in discretionary spending for general agricultural programs and domestic nutrition programs. Rural development and conservation also experienced a decrease, but FY2016 reversed the trend for rural development and FY2017 reversed it for conservation."
