    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality Reauthorization Act of 1993\". References in the Act are to the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality Act of 1986. The Congress acknowledges that infant mortality can be prevented with prenatal care, good nutrition, and preventive well baby care. Despite improvements in the US infant mortality rate, the country still lags behind other developed nations. Babies born at low birthweight are at higher risk of death and long-term disabilities, requiring costly medical interventions and services. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality developed a strategic plan to reduce infant mortality, emphasizing universal access to necessary services for pregnant women and infants. The Commission continues to advocate for actions based on these recommendations. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality recommends actions to improve the health of infants, children, and pregnant women by addressing barriers in service delivery, lack of information, and high infant mortality rates. The Commission emphasizes the need for universal access to care and making health a national priority. SEC. 4. COMPOSITION OF COMMISSION. The Act is amended to increase the number of members on the Commission and specify their responsibilities. SEC. 5. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION. Section 204 of the Act outlines the duties of the Commission to prevent infant mortality and improve the health of infants, children, and pregnant women. The Commission is tasked with developing strategic plans, informing Congress and others on actions to improve health, serving as an information clearinghouse for model programs, and cost-effective strategies for pregnant women and children. The Commission is responsible for implementing Federal and State legislation, delivering local services, raising public awareness, reporting demographic trends on the health of pregnant women, infants, and children, and establishing relationships with organizations to promote their well-being. The Commission has the power to accept private sector funds and interagency transfer funds to carry out its activities. It must report all grant activities to the Appropriations Committees annually. Additionally, the Commission can accept voluntary and uncompensated services. SEC. 7 amends Section 206 of the Act regarding Commission staff salaries. It updates the rate payable for positions at level IV of the Executive Schedule. SEC. 8 reauthorizes the Commission, with Sections 208 and 209 specifying the termination date and authorization of appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for the Commission: $480,000 in fiscal year 1995, $480,000 in fiscal year 1996, and $600,000 in fiscal year 1997. Sums remain available through December 31, 1997.
