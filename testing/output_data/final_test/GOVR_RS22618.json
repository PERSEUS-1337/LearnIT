    "content": "This case, Massachusetts v. EPA, involved a petition to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act due to their contribution to global warming. The D.C. Circuit rejected the challenge to EPA's denial in 2005, with judges disagreeing on the basis for the decision. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of petitioner states and environmental groups in Massachusetts v. EPA, allowing EPA to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles based on their global warming impacts. The decision emphasized the importance of economic incentives over regulatory mandates and affirmed the states' standing in federal court. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of petitioner states and environmental groups in Massachusetts v. EPA, allowing EPA to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles based on their global warming impacts. The decision emphasized economic incentives over regulatory mandates and affirmed the states' standing in federal court. The Court's ruling may make it difficult for EPA to avoid regulating greenhouse gases from new vehicles, as it must issue regulations once it determines that a pollutant might endanger public health or welfare. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA pressures the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources under the CAA. It may also influence Congress to act on global warming and impact GHG-related cases in the courts. Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp. is a case arising from a CAA enforcement action against Duke Energy for modifications to its coal-fired power plants. Duke Energy faced legal action for making modifications to its coal-fired power plants without obtaining required permits, leading to a dispute over emissions measurement to determine if changes increased emissions, triggering new source requirements. The United States argued that Duke's refurbishment would increase emissions, necessitating state-of-the-art pollution controls. The district court ruled that Duke Energy's modifications to its coal-fired power plants did not increase emissions per hour, thus not triggering new source requirements under EPA's PSD regulations. The Fourth Circuit affirmed this decision, interpreting the CAA's definition of \"modification\" to align with EPA's hourly emissions standard. Environmental Defense, not EPA, filed a petition for certiorari, which the United States opposed. The Supreme Court accepted a case solely at the request of an environmental group, ruling unanimously in favor of the \"environmental\" side. They concluded that EPA regulations do not have to be identical to the statutory definition of \"modification\" under PSD and NSPS. The Fourth Circuit's attempt to align the PSD rules with the NSPS rule was deemed misguided. The Supreme Court ruled that stretching the PSD rules to align with the NSPS rule was misguided. The Superfund Act imposes liability for cleanup costs on parties connected to contaminated sites, allowing for contribution actions in certain scenarios. The Superfund Act allows parties liable for cleanup costs to sue other liable parties for contribution. Two CERCLA provisions, section 113(f)(1) and section 107(a)(B), govern these actions, with lower courts generally favoring section 113(f)(1) for liable parties and section 107(a)(B) for innocent parties. The Supreme Court's decision in Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc. clarified the rules for contribution actions under CERCLA. In Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that contribution actions can only be brought after EPA files a civil action against the liable party. The question remains whether a liable party can sue under section 107(a)(B) if barred from using section 113(f)(1), which is crucial for the Superfund program. This decision is significant as contaminated sites often do not receive EPA attention, making owners more willing to clean up if they can seek reimbursement for costs. The Supreme Court ruled that a liable party, barred from seeking contribution under section 113(f)(1) of CERCLA, can still seek contribution from another liable party under section 107(a)(B). The Court affirmed that section 107(a)(B) actions are available to liable parties without qualifiers, and these actions complement section 113(f) rather than making it redundant. This case involves a conflict between the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) regarding permit requirements for point-source discharges into waters of the United States. The CWA section 402 imposes a permit requirement, while the ESA section 7(a)(2) requires consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The ESA consultation requirement may act as a tenth precondition for permit-program delegation under the Clean Water Act. This case questions whether state permitting programs are as effective in protecting endangered species as the EPA-administered program, as only EPA-issued permits are subject to ESA consultation. The Ninth Circuit held that ESA section 7(a)(2) set an independent criterion for permit-program delegation under the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that setting up ESA section 7(a)(2) as an independent criterion would imply a repeal of the mandatory language in the Clean Water Act, which is disfavored by courts. The Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries resolved the tension between two statutes through a regulation stating that ESA section 7(a)(2) applies to actions with discretionary Federal involvement. The Supreme Court ruled that EPA can approve state delegations of section 404 permitting authority without ESA consultation. This may lead to arguments in other cases that no ESA consultation is required for certain federal authorities. The Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority case addressed state and local restrictions on interstate flow of municipal solid waste, deemed incompatible with the dormant commerce clause. This clause, implicit in the Constitution's Commerce Clause, scrutinizes laws discriminating against interstate commerce. The courts have consistently invalidated such restrictions, including flow control measures, through strict scrutiny. The United Haulers case involves flow control ordinances that regulate waste management within a locality. It questions whether the public-private distinction in designated waste facilities affects dormant commerce clause analysis. The district court found county flow control laws unconstitutional under strict scrutiny, while the Second Circuit reversed this decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit's decision on flow control laws, stating that the public-private distinction is crucial. Chief Justice Roberts explained that flow control ordinances benefiting public facilities do not discriminate against interstate commerce and do not trigger strict scrutiny. The majority argued that treating public and private facilities differently makes sense due to their different objectives and motivations. The Supreme Court upheld flow control ordinances, stating that treating public and private facilities differently is justified. The Court found that strict scrutiny did not apply and used a balancing test for nondiscriminatory burdens on interstate commerce, ultimately ruling in favor of the ordinances."
