    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protection of United States Troops From Foreign Prosecution Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that a treaty, like the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, cannot force a nation to be subject to its terms if that nation has not agreed to be bound by its terms. The ICC Treaty claims unprecedented power to investigate and try citizens of any nation, even those not party to the treaty, based on events in a nation party to the treaty, which is unsupported in international law. The International Criminal Court (ICC) Treaty aims to establish a permanent Court with the power to judge and punish elected officials of sovereign nations. This represents a departure from US ideals of self-government and popular sovereignty, transferring authority to an unelected international bureaucracy. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is fundamentally inconsistent with core US political and legal values, denying defendants rights such as trial by jury, reasonable bail, speedy trial, and confronting witnesses. The ICC allows prosecutors to appeal acquittals, violating the US legal tradition and the Bill of Rights. The United States cannot participate in the International Criminal Court (ICC) because it does not provide the guarantees of the Bill of Rights. Joining the ICC Treaty could lead to US citizens being prosecuted without the rights granted by the US Constitution, similar to the offenses listed in the Declaration of Independence that led to separation from England. The International Criminal Court could prosecute any United States citizen, including the President, military officers, and ordinary citizens, for actions within its jurisdiction. The text prohibits any Federal department or agency from implementing the ICC Treaty, providing funding or support to the International Criminal Court, or transferring any person to its custody. Additionally, it prohibits foreign economic assistance for countries that ratify the ICC Treaty. The Congress believes ratifying the ICC Treaty will harm US relations and prohibits economic assistance for countries that do so. The ICC Treaty prohibits US economic assistance to countries that ratify it. The sense of Congress is that the President should veto any attempt by the United Nations Security Council to refer a matter to the International Criminal Court. Definitions in the Act include the ICC Treaty and the International Criminal Court."
