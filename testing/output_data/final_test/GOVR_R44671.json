    "content": "In January 2016, Senator Orrin Hatch proposed tax reform to explore corporate integration, aiming to eliminate or reduce additional taxes on corporate equity investment. This involves addressing the double taxation issue where corporations pay corporate tax on income, and individuals pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Corporate integration seeks to reduce distortions favoring noncorporate equity investment, debt finance, and retained earnings over dividends. The report on corporate tax integration provides an overview of the issues and recommendations for reducing taxes at the shareholder level while retaining taxes at the corporate level. Taxes on shareholders have been reduced over the years, with dividends and capital gains typically taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. The report discusses the reduction of taxes on shareholders over the years, with dividends and capital gains taxed at lower rates. Factors affecting tax proposals include the global economy, shareholder demographics, inflation, and the growth of tax-favored intangible assets in the corporate sector. The United States has a \"classical\" corporate tax system with a 35% rate for large corporations. Profits can be distributed as dividends or retained for investment, with favorable treatment of dividends and capital gains. Total tax on corporate investment can be 58%, compared to 35% on noncorporate investment, due to various tax exemptions and lower rates on dividends and capital gains. The tax treatment of stock at the shareholder level varies based on the type of shareholder, including U.S. individuals, tax-exempt entities, tax-deferred entities, and foreign shareholders. Shareholders are subject to different tax rates, with U.S. individuals paying an estimated tax rate of 13.7%, tax-exempt entities paying no tax, and foreign shareholders paying a 3.2% estimated U.S. tax rate. Shareholder distribution data does not include U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms. The tax treatment of pass-through businesses in the U.S. is a key issue in the business tax system. These businesses, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, and Subchapter S firms, are subject to individual tax rates. The overall statutory tax rate is estimated at 28%, with important tax preferences like accelerated depreciation affecting domestic investment burdens. The tax treatment of pass-through businesses in the U.S. is influenced by various preferences such as deductions for domestic production and intangible investments. Foreign source income is taxed at a lower rate, and interest on borrowed funds for investments is deductible. The effective tax rate on profits from debt finance is lower due to tax preferences and inflation. Interest income is subject to tax at lower rates than the corporate rate, with only a small fraction estimated to be taxed. The growth in foreign source income has changed corporate integration views. U.S. corporate tax is mainly imposed on a source basis, encouraging more equity investment in the U.S. Shareholder and creditor taxes are residence-based. Tax on foreign subsidiary earnings is deferred until repatriated. The U.S. corporate tax system allows for foreign source income to be taxed at a lower effective rate of 17.4%, with 14.1% paid in foreign taxes and 3.3% paid to the United States. Corporate tax integration aims to reduce distortions caused by the current tax treatment. The effective corporate tax rates in the U.S. are estimated at 19.7% at the firm level, with a total corporate tax rate of 22.4%. Different asset groups have varying tax rates, ranging from -63.3% for intangible investments to 30.8% for nonresidential structures. Foreign investment has a marginal tax rate of 13%. Additional shareholder taxes only add less than three percentage points. The total corporate tax rate is estimated at 22.4%, slightly higher than unincorporated businesses at 21.1%. Debt-financed investment in the corporate sector has negative effective tax rates, with shareholder taxes reducing it further. Unincorporated businesses have a negative tax rate on investment. A weighted average of debt and equity results in a firm-level tax of 5.7% for corporations and 11.8% for unincorporated businesses. Overall, there are small differences in tax burden between equity in corporate and noncorporate sectors, but significant variations across assets and between debt and equity. The tax rate on dividends and capital gains is low, with individuals subject to income tax paying an estimated rate of 17%. Foreign shareholders are taxed at an average of 5.9% on dividends, with no tax on capital gains. The difference between the two is 3.6%. Different approaches to tax integration are possible, including full integration, partial integration focusing on dividends, and proposals addressing interest treatment. Full integration in corporate tax reform would eliminate one level of taxation on dividends and retained earnings. Various approaches include taxing at the shareholder level, corporate level, or a combination of both. A modified partnership treatment would tax shareholders based on dividend receipts, with income taxed at ordinary rates and tax preferences passed through. Withholding tax collected by the corporation could be refundable for tax-exempt investors or nonrefundable for foreigners and taxable individuals. Mark to Market would repeal the corporate tax for publicly traded firms, tax dividends and capital gains at ordinary rates, and mark the value of stock to market. Privately traded firms would receive pass-through treatment. One issue with this approach is that shareholders would be taxed on income not received. An alternative is to impose the corporate level tax and eliminate taxes on tax-exempt shareholders. The proposal aims to simplify the tax system by eliminating corporate level tax and taxes on dividends and capital gains from corporate stock. However, a major concern is that this approach may not reduce the firm level tax that determines investment allocation for multinational firms. Another proposal suggests taxing dividends to shareholders with a corporate dividend deduction and eliminating capital gains tax on corporate stock. This would remove the double tax on corporate income only for dividends. One approach to tax reform is to allow a dividend deduction with a withholding tax, where shareholders pay tax on dividends plus the withholding tax. This would exclude dividends from shareholders' income, applying only the corporate tax. Integration proposals have also included debt, with a 1992 Treasury proposal suggesting disallowing interest deductions for both corporate. In 1992, a Treasury proposal suggested disallowing interest deductions for corporate firms and unincorporated businesses. Corporate integration policy involves revenue impacts, administrative concerns, and economic efficiency effects. Revenue impacts are crucial in tax reform proposals, with estimates showing the cost as a percentage of current corporate tax revenues. Refundable credits or mark to market may not be feasible for revenue neutrality. Offsetting revenue losses with restrictions on debt or other base-broadening provisions is possible. Mark to market could work if taxes are imposed directly on exempt entities. Most tax reform proposals, including mark to market, face administrative barriers and complications for shareholders. Mark to market could simplify taxes at the corporate level but may be difficult to implement. Efficiency gains are limited, except for reducing debt-equity distortion. Most proposals would not significantly impact international capital allocation or profit-shifting. Disallowing deductions for interest could eliminate some profit-shifting methods. Disallowing deductions for interest would eliminate some profit shifting methods and make inversions less attractive. Mark to market would create a residence-based tax, providing efficiency gains in capital allocation, repatriation, and inversions."
