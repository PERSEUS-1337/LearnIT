    "content": "Section 1 amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain pensions and annuities under public retirement systems. Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code excludes qualified governmental pensions from an individual's gross income, subject to limitations on the amount excluded based on social security benefits received. The individual must have performed the services giving rise to the pension to qualify for this exclusion. The term 'qualified governmental pension' refers to pensions or annuities from a public retirement system not attributable to certain types of service. The 'maximum excludable social security benefits' is the maximum amount of benefits that can be excluded from gross income. The term 'applicable maximum benefit amount' refers to the maximum individual social security benefit for different filing statuses, which can be excluded from gross income. The maximum individual social security benefit is the highest amount that can be paid as old-age insurance benefits to individuals who are 65 years old and have applied for benefits. The maximum individual social security benefit may be reduced for individuals receiving a qualified governmental pension for less than a full taxable year. The term 'public retirement system' refers to pension funds established by the government entities. The Code is amended to include section 137 before 911. Additionally, the table of sections is updated to designate section 138 for section 137 and add a new item after section 136. The amendments made by this Act regarding certain pensions and annuities under public retirement systems will apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment date of this Act."
