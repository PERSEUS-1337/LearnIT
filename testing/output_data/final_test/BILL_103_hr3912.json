    "content": "The Explosives Control Act of 1994, also known as the \"Explosives Control Act,\" prohibits the receipt of explosive materials without a federal permit. The Explosives Control Act of 1994 prohibits the transportation and receipt of explosive materials in interstate or foreign commerce, with exceptions for black powder or smokeless powder in amounts less than 50 pounds. Federal explosives licensees must conduct criminal background checks before transferring explosive materials to non-licensees. Beginning 90 days after enactment and ending 60 months after November 30, 1993, it is illegal for a licensee to transfer explosive materials to a non-licensee without receiving a statement and verifying the transferee's identity. Beginning 90 days after enactment, a licensee must provide notice to the chief law enforcement officer of the transferee's residence within 1 day of receiving a statement. Additionally, a copy of the statement must be transmitted to the chief law enforcement officer within the same timeframe. After 5 business days have passed since the notice was provided, the transfer can proceed. The transfer of explosive materials can proceed if the transferor has not received any information from the chief law enforcement officer indicating a violation of laws by the transferee, or if the transferee presents a permit issued within the last 5 years allowing possession of explosive materials. The transfer of explosive materials requires a permit issued within 5 years by the State, verified by an authorized official to ensure compliance with the law. Additionally, before transferring to a non-licensee, the State law mandates verification by an authorized official to prevent any violations. The Secretary may approve the transfer under the Internal Revenue Code or certify impracticability based on specific criteria such as officer ratio, remote business location, and lack of telecommunications facilities. The chief law enforcement officer must verify if the transfer of firearms would violate any laws within 5 business days. The transferee's identification details and criminal history must be provided in the statement. The statement must confirm that the individual: has not been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year, is not a fugitive from justice, is not an unlawful user of controlled substances, has not been adjudicated as mentally defective, is not an illegal alien, has not been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, and has not renounced US citizenship. The transferor of explosive materials must provide notice of the transfer date and the transferee's intention to obtain the materials. If the transferor receives a report indicating that the transferee's possession violates the law, they must promptly share all relevant transfer information with the chief law enforcement officers of their business location and the transferee's residence. The transferor of explosive materials must retain the transferee's statement and evidence of compliance with regulations. The chief law enforcement officer must destroy the statement if no violation of laws is found within 20 business days. The notice provided must be destroyed along with any records containing information from the statement. Information from the statement can only be shared with those who need to know for this purpose and cannot be used for any other reason. If an individual is deemed ineligible for explosive materials, the officer must provide written reasons within 20 business days upon request. The chief law enforcement officer is not liable for failure to prevent unlawful sale of explosive materials or for preventing lawful sale. The term 'chief law enforcement officer' refers to specific individuals. 'Explosive materials' exclude small amounts of black powder or smokeless powder. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations. The Secretary is required to publish and disseminate regulations to licensees and the public. Licensees are prohibited from transferring explosive materials to non-licensees without contacting the national instant criminal background check system for approval. The system verifies the identity of a person receiving explosive materials and assigns a unique identification number to the transfer if it does not violate regulations. All records except the identifying number and date assigned are then destroyed. The system verifies the identity of a person receiving explosive materials and assigns a unique identification number to the transfer. Records related to the transfer are retained, except for the identifying number and date assigned. The transfer of explosive materials between licensees and other individuals is exempt from certain regulations if the recipient presents a valid permit issued by the state within the last 5 years, and if possession of explosive materials by the recipient is not in violation of the law. The Secretary may approve a transfer of explosive materials if compliance is impracticable due to specific reasons such as remote business premises and lack of telecommunications facilities in the area. The Secretary may approve a transfer of explosive materials if compliance is impracticable due to reasons such as remote business premises and lack of telecommunications facilities in the area. If the national instant criminal background check system approves the transfer, the licensee must include the unique identification number in the record. Failure to comply with the background check requirements when transferring explosive materials is a violation of the law. The Secretary has the authority to suspend or revoke a license and impose fines on a licensee if the criminal background check system shows that transferring explosive materials would violate the law. Government employees providing information for background checks are not liable for preventing unlawful transfers. The amendment prohibits the sale or transfer of explosive materials to unauthorized individuals. Penalties for violating the law include fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. SEC. 4. USE OF NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requirements apply to explosive materials, with the system checking if receipt would violate the law. SEC. 5. REMEDY FOR ERRONEOUS DENIAL OF EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS. Section 845A of Chapter 40 of title 18, United States Code, allows individuals denied explosive materials due to erroneous information to take legal action against the responsible entity for correction. This remedy addresses situations where denial was based on inaccurate data provided by a State, political subdivision, or the national instant criminal background check system. Section 845A of Chapter 40 of title 18, United States Code allows legal action for correction of erroneous information regarding explosive materials denial. The court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. Technical amendment adds a new item after section 845 in the chapter analysis. \"HR 3912 IH----2 proposes a remedy for the erroneous denial of explosive materials, allowing legal action for correction of misinformation with the possibility of attorney's fees awarded to the prevailing party.\""
