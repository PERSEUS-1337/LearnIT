    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Domestic Violence Hotline Enhancement Act\" and includes findings related to domestic violence. Congress finds that there are over 2,000 domestic violence shelters in the US, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has received over 500,000 calls since 1996, and access to shelters is critical for victims. In Minnesota, 90% of victims receive needed services through a statewide online network of shelters. An online network of shelters would provide victims with more relocation options within and across States, reducing the number of calls needed to find a shelter. Only 43% of domestic violence shelters in the US have Internet access. The Act aims to establish a secure network of domestic violence shelters and services nationwide to connect victims efficiently. Grants are authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award a grant to a nonprofit organization to establish a secure Internet website linking domestic violence resources for victims. To be eligible for a grant, a nonprofit organization must demonstrate experience in managing a network of domestic violence shelters, a successful record in helping victims, and commit to implementing high-level security measures. The recipient of a grant award must implement a high-level security system, establish a Website linking entities, collaborate with relevant officials and organizations, and continuously update the Website. The recipient of a grant award must ensure the Website is continuously updated, provide information on domestic violence shelters, offer real-time bed space availability, train Hotline staff on Website usage, and provide Internet access to shelters. The grant awarded under this section lasts for 5 years and includes provisions for expanding funding sources for the Website project. The Secretary must conduct an annual evaluation of the grant program to gather information on its effectiveness. The Secretary must evaluate the grantee's progress in linking entities to the Network, the number of individuals served, decreases in phone calls for shelter space, and other relevant matters to ensure compliance with the Act. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary also oversees and ensures the security of the Website. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2004 through 2007. Up to 2 percent of the funds can be used for administrative costs, with 5 percent allocated to assist the National Domestic Violence Hotline in establishing a Website."
