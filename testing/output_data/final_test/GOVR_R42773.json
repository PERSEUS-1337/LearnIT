The shift in leadership can impact domestic and international security environments, highlighting the unique and uncertain nature of this political dynamic. During a presidential transition period, there are security implications due to potential changes in administration and policies, creating opportunities for those who wish to harm U.S. security interests. This period offers a defined timeframe for enemies to manipulate the electoral process or disrupt a peaceful transfer of power. State enemies have historically targeted government transitions to undertake significant acts of violence. Security experts warn that during presidential transition periods, there is a heightened risk of violence and disruption to the peaceful transfer of power, as enemies of the United States may exploit vulnerabilities. The 2008 report to the Department of Homeland Security highlighted the potential risks during transitions, emphasizing that both the U.S. and its enemies are aware of these vulnerabilities. While there is no direct link between attempts to influence elections and terrorist attacks, incidents like the 2012 Benghazi attack could have policy implications. During presidential transitions, there is a risk of violence and disruption as enemies may exploit vulnerabilities. The 2012 Benghazi attack highlighted potential policy implications. The incoming Administration must address risks to national security and be prepared to respond to any incidents affecting the electoral process. The new President will face various national security challenges, depending on how they plan and learn during the transition period. During presidential transitions, activities are undertaken to facilitate a smooth transfer of power, including consulting with experts, providing information to the President-elect, offering operational briefings on national security matters, preparing briefings books, and expediting security clearances for transition team members. During the presidential transition period, key actions to consider include public outreach on national risks, involving national security representatives of candidates, establishing joint advisory councils for risk management, DNI support for risk awareness, aligning budget with national security priorities, swift appropriations approval, assigning Congress members to security committees, holding hearings with experts on security policies and goals post-inauguration. During the presidential transition period, it is crucial to prioritize national security policies and goals. Enhanced cooperation and communication between the outgoing and incoming Administrations are essential for effective transitions, especially in a world where risks are increasing. The need for swift and seamless transitions is emphasized to address immediate threats and ensure national security. The collaboration between outgoing and incoming Presidents on national security issues is crucial in the contemporary world. Observers suggest that joint efforts during the transition period are vital for preparedness against disruptions to power transfer or policy changes. Congress may need to conduct hearings and request reports to evaluate the government's actions during the presidential election period. During the Presidential election period, reports are needed to assess the Administration's awareness of risks and efforts to inform security and election officials. Threats may arise domestically and internationally, potentially impacting election results or future policies. Enemies may exploit perceived vulnerabilities to influence the election or demonstrate their power. During the presidential election period, national security observers speculate on potential threats that could intimidate the voting public or impact election results. Enemies of the United States may prefer to take action just before the election date to influence future policies. Extremist groups and foreign powers may see this time as an opportunity to act against U.S. interests. Previous elections have shown that officials are aware of these risks and efforts are made to inform security and election officials. During previous presidential elections, officials in the federal government have considered developing options in case the election is delayed. DeForest Soaries, former Chair of the United States Election Assistance Commission, suggested collaborating with state and local governments on a plan for voting options in case of a terrorist attack. Security experts emphasize the need for federal, state, and local election-contingency planning and coordination. During the early phases of the election period, federal, state, and local election-contingency planning and coordination are crucial to prevent electoral chaos in case of a national security incident. Security experts recommend a collaborative approach between the outgoing Administration and presidential nominees to address potential risks during the presidential transition process. The 2008 Homeland Security Advisory Council report suggests issuing a joint statement to support a collaborative environment. The Advisory Council report recommends joint statements by nominees to address national security threats and incidents. A public awareness campaign may educate citizens on vigilance during the election period and increase confidence in government response to potential incidents. The DHS HSAC recommends public engagement and media interaction to increase awareness of national security threats during the presidential transition period. This will help prepare the nation for potential incidents of significance. During the presidential transition period, public education and media engagement are crucial to increase awareness of national security threats. The DHS should work with diverse messengers and the media to disseminate accurate information. Both the DHS and the Department of State have the responsibility to notify the public of security threats domestically and overseas. During the presidential transition period, communication mechanisms are utilized to inform U.S. citizens and organizations about security concerns. The DHS and Department of State issue public announcements, alerts, warnings, and post information on their respective websites. Presidential transition activities now extend beyond election day to the inauguration. Some presidential historians argue that starting transition efforts at least six months before the election is crucial. The presidential transition period consists of five phases: Campaigning, Selection of party nominees, Election day, Post-election day to prior to the inauguration, and Presidential inauguration to formation of the new Administration's national security team. Phase 5 of the presidential transition includes the inauguration of the new Administration, formation of the national security team, and issuance of policy directives. This phase follows the period from campaigning to the selection of party nominees, which can last several months to a year. Activities during this phase aim to benefit the incoming President and ensure continuity in U.S. national security matters. During the presidential transition, it is crucial for the Department of Homeland Security to ensure a seamless handover of leadership. Recommendations include clarifying threat levels, developing contingency plans, sharing lessons learned from past transitions, and providing briefings on national security matters to prospective nominees. The current Administration should consider initiating these actions. During the presidential transition, the current Administration should engage in information exchanges and collaborative efforts with the opposing party candidate and their staff. As the campaign progresses, a limited number of viable contenders for the nomination will emerge. It is important to involve these individuals and their senior national security staff in briefings on national security issues. Concerns exist about turnover in key federal government positions, with over 7,000 non-competitively filled by political appointees. During presidential transitions, the federal government may rely on career employees for continuity in national security-related activities. Appointing career civil servants to mid- to high-level positions has been suggested as a way to provide stability during transitions. Former DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Schneider advocates for converting national security leadership positions to career civil service roles to ensure continuity during presidential transitions. This move aims to provide in-house expertise and historical context for future agency directors. Schneider emphasizes the importance of promoting dedicated civil servants to prepare for potential terrorist attacks during transitions. This proposal has garnered support from national security observers. While the conversion of national security leadership positions to career civil service roles is supported by many, concerns arise over the selection process for federal agency deputy positions. Some worry that individuals chosen by the current Administration may maintain control over agencies and pursue policies counter to a new Administration's goals. The National Security Staff (NSS) and Homeland Security Council (HSC) play crucial roles in considering and coordinating national security and homeland security activities, respectively. The current Administration may establish a joint advisory council comprised of political and career staff from the NSS and HSC, outside experts, and members of a prospective president-elect's national security team to assist with transition issues and coordinate presidential transition policies for agencies with national security missions. This entity could ensure interagency coordination during the transition period and continue into the next Administration if desired by the President-elect. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) could establish a council to advise outgoing and incoming Presidents on national security policy implications during the presidential transition. The National Intelligence Council (NIC) could lead an effort to assess risks to U.S. interests during this period. During the presidential transition period, efforts are being made to issue a classified and unclassified National Intelligence Estimate on intelligence aspects. A Presidential Transition Mission Manager will lead federal intelligence and law enforcement analytic efforts. The National Counterterrorism Center will enhance its ability to assess threat information related to the election period. The DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis will receive timely threat information for sharing with various organizations. The Interagency Threat Assessment Coordination Group will coordinate federal and local threat information related to the transition. State fusion centers will receive specific indicators of suspicious activity. During the presidential transition, state fusion centers receive specific indicators of suspicious activity that may pose risks. The 2008 HSAC report outlined key issue areas for the transition, but some critics felt it lacked a comprehensive government-wide approach to addressing risks during the election period. Some national security observers criticized the narrow scope of options in the report on the presidential transition. They felt it focused too much on outgoing Administration efforts and not enough on preparing the incoming Administration for potential challenges. There was also a lack of emphasis on training incoming officials on current and projected homeland security issues. No discussion was provided on how state, local, tribal, and private sector leaders should prepare for the transition. Some national security observers believe that congressional involvement in presidential transitions is crucial for orderly transfers of power. They argue that Congress should oversee transition-related implementation efforts to address security risks effectively. Possible Congressional Activity during the presidential transition may include appropriating resources for national security collaboration, holding hearings with both incoming and outgoing Administrations, submitting questions to assess transition planning and risks, and requesting agency leaders responsible for security decisions. During the presidential transition period, national security briefings will cover risks, ongoing operations, and collaboration with new Administration officials. Congressional concern includes potential security vulnerabilities due to vacancies at DHS. Congress may also assess executive branch transition planning. During the presidential transition period, Congress may review national security responsibilities, leadership succession plans, and key individuals for action in case of incidents. Phase 2 of the transition, from party conventions to election day, raises concerns about heightened risks to national security. During the transition period leading up to election day, security interests may be affected. The current Administration may consider military or law enforcement actions to prevent disruptions or threats to national security. Some question the need for these actions, viewing them as politically motivated. National security leaders face challenges in protecting interests amidst political skepticism. The outgoing Administration may continue providing security updates as part of historical patterns. The Administration should continue the tradition of providing intelligence briefings to presidential nominees and their senior staff on matters of national security. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 allows major party candidates to request security clearances for transition team members before the general election. During the presidential transition, background investigations and security clearances for transition team members should be completed promptly after the general election. The prospective President and staff will engage in understanding national security policies and may meet with current Administration officials. Expedited security clearance reviews for relevant personnel would aid in these efforts. Congress may hold hearings and provide resources to support the transition and enhance security programs. During the presidential transition, efforts are made to deter incidents and support programs for incident response. Concerns exist about coordination between federal and state security entities affecting election results in case of a security incident. Resources may be needed for non-federal entities responsible for homeland security during the transition. During the presidential transition, local first responders will handle security concerns. Scholars suggest all levels of government should plan for security incidents before or on election day. Local homeland security may need to support federal election activities. Senior federal officials should address homeland risks on election day to encourage citizen involvement in the democratic process. The Administration can support voter confidence by providing threat information to security centers, securing polling places, and increasing security for potential targets. Timely resolution of the presidential election is crucial for the incoming Administration to prepare for national security challenges. Delayed election results limit the current Administration's ability to assist the new Administration. The current Administration must assist the new Administration to ensure a smooth transition of power. A lack of resolution could lead to delays in national security personnel appointments and create uncertainty about the country's leadership. Legislative oversight of transition activities is crucial for the incoming Administration's preparedness. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 grants discretion to the current Administration in providing support to the incoming Administration for an orderly transfer of power. The national interest requires smooth transitions in the Office of the President to ensure continuity in executing laws and conducting government affairs. Congress intends to authorize actions to minimize disruptions during the 11-week presidential transition period, including addressing national security concerns. During the transition period, there may be attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the outgoing Administration and create confusion in decision-making. Concerns arise as political appointees resign, potentially affecting the government's ability to respond to security incidents. Conflicting directions for acting civil servants in political positions could worsen the situation. During transitions, appointee positions may face conflicting directions from outgoing and incoming national security leaders. Cooperation levels between administrations can be influenced by the outgoing President's attitude towards the President-elect. Transitions within the same party tend to be smoother. The President's actions during the transition period, especially regarding national security, will impact the incoming Administration's efforts. Any actions undermining the new Administration's national security policies could hinder the transition process and foreign policy efforts. Outgoing Administrations are expected to facilitate a smooth transition for the incoming Administration to address national security issues effectively. During the transition period, the President's actions, especially in national security, can impact the incoming Administration. Activities like briefings, exercises, and forming a transition council can aid in a smooth transition. Allocating funds for the transition process has become standard practice since 1963. Since 1963, funds allocated for presidential transition activities have supported incoming and outgoing Administration changes. The General Services Administration (GSA) provides funds for travel expenses, consultants, and agency support. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963, amended in 2000, allows GSA to offer increased support to the President-elect and senior leaders. GSA coordinates briefings and provides assistance from the day after the general election to 30 days after the inauguration. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 allows the GSA to coordinate briefings for incoming Administration leaders, provide communication devices, and create a directory of useful materials. Efforts should be made to inform the incoming President and senior national security staff of current and near-term threats that may affect national security interests. This is in line with recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 mandates the outgoing Administration to prepare a detailed summary of operational threats, military operations, and pending military force decisions for the incoming President. A Presidential Transition National Security Coordination Council could be established to facilitate national security-related transition efforts. The Presidential Transition National Security Coordination Council aims to involve all members in decision-making activities, focusing on current national security risks and policy considerations. It oversees transition activities, provides training for incoming appointees, collaborates on security issues, and shares insights from past security operations. expedited security clearance is provided for transition team members and nominated officials. The IRPTA of 2004 allows the President-elect to submit names of candidates for security clearances for high-level national security positions soon after the general elections. The FBI conducts background investigations for designated individuals before the inauguration. During the transition period, the FBI conducts background investigations for key Administration officials to obtain security clearances. This phase is crucial for national security as both outgoing and incoming Administrations work to accomplish tasks before the inauguration ceremony. During the transition period, the President-elect collaborates with the current Administration to ensure a smooth transition of power. The 2008 HSAC report emphasizes the importance of a positive attitude, open-mindedness, and respect between incoming and outgoing Administrations for a successful transition. Senior career personnel play a crucial role in facilitating this process. During the transition period, the national security and intelligence communities play a crucial role in providing information and context to the incoming President and new national security team. The transition is no longer a honeymoon period and requires significant attention to manage effectively. The incoming Administration has three months to prepare for assuming the presidency, with activities such as announcing leaders of the transition team, interviewing personnel for new positions, and interacting with various stakeholders. During the transition period, the incoming Administration prepares for assuming the presidency by selecting cabinet members, appointing national security advisors, and interacting with various stakeholders. Senate confirmation is required for senior leaders in the national security community, while some political staff do not need confirmation. During the transition period, the incoming Administration prepares for assuming the presidency by selecting cabinet members, appointing national security advisors, and interacting with various stakeholders. Some political staff, including staff of the NSS and HSC, do not require Senate confirmation. Measures are in place to ensure mission continuity and collaboration with new members of the Administration, including allowing overlap in key positions and detailing career federal employees with national security expertise to the transition team. During the transition period, the incoming Administration prepares for assuming the presidency by selecting cabinet members, appointing national security advisors, and interacting with various stakeholders. Some security observers are concerned about a perceived leadership void that can occur during the transition period when the outgoing Administration has constitutional authority, but diminished influence, and the President-elect has much influence, but no authority. Actions can be taken by the outgoing President and President-elect to ameliorate any suspected appearance of presidential decision-making ambiguity. Issues of foreign policy were hotly debated during the presidential campaign of 1992. During the transition period, President-elect Clinton reassured that President Bush is the sole voice of US policy. The new Administration may discuss strategy and policy changes with Congress before the inauguration. Any new initiatives or changes to national security policy will require work before the budget is transmitted to Congress. After the inauguration, the new Administration must submit a revised budget proposal to Congress within two weeks. Congress has required agencies to develop transition and succession plans for management functions to guide the new Administration. Some security experts believe this requirement addresses past transition issues, but concerns exist about its implementation for strategic value. Some recommend career civil servants with agency experience draft the transition plan for strategic value. Congressional oversight during phase 4 transition is rare, but special session may be needed for national security coordination. During phase 4 transition, Congress may need to hold hearings to assess national security transition progress, including collaboration efforts, resource allocation, and policy goals of the incoming Administration. Phase 5 of the presidential transition involves the period from the inauguration to when the new Administration has its national security leaders confirmed and new policies implemented. This phase can last several months to the first year of the presidency, with unique national security considerations such as incidents intended to test the new leaders' actions and policies. During the presidential transition phase, there is a security significance due to vacant national security leadership positions and new personnel being confirmed. Entities may view this time as vulnerable for affecting U.S. national security interests. The outgoing Administration's actions prior to the inauguration will be part of the departing President's legacy. The President is granted expansive authority to protect the country's property and personnel. Some scholars argue that the President's duty to protect the country extends beyond their term, exposing the nation to risk if there is a failure to alert the incoming President of imminent dangers. The outgoing President should avoid actions that could hinder the new Administration's transition efforts, such as establishing new national security policies or organizations. The incoming President may issue executive orders and directives to establish new national security policies that differ from the outgoing President's, especially if they are from different parties. This allows for a quick implementation of campaign goals and sets a new policy direction early in the Administration. The new President may quickly establish national security policies and strategies, conveying priorities and allowing assessment of intentions. It is advised to proceed cautiously, review current policies, and listen to various officials before making significant changes. This supports a smooth transition and learning from past successes and failures. The incoming Administration's transition presents an opportunity for reforming national security organizational structures and processes. Congressional support and oversight during this period are crucial for effective governance. During the transition period, it is important for the new Administration to communicate its national security policies to Congress to avoid frustration and ensure support for governing. President Emeritus of the Institute of Public Administration warns that new appointees may struggle initially due to lack of familiarity with their roles. In overseeing the new Administration's national security objectives, Congress can prioritize hearings for nominated senior executive branch leaders with significant national security responsibilities to quickly confirm qualified appointees. This helps establish a foundation for addressing national security issues shortly after inauguration. The incoming President's national security leadership team aims to expedite confirmation hearings after taking office, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission Report to minimize disruptions in national security policymaking during transitions. The IRPTA of 2004 emphasizes the need for an expedited consideration of nominees for Senate confirmation. The IRPTA of 2004 emphasizes the need for an expedited consideration of nominees for Senate confirmation, nominated by the President-elect and confirmed by the Senate. Congress faces a tension between acting quickly and ensuring individuals with relevant national security background and experience are selected and confirmed. Highly qualified career Senior Executive Service personnel may temporarily fill Senate confirmed positions. During the Presidential election and transition period, Congress should collaborate with the new Administration to align national security priorities in the budget, swiftly appoint Members to relevant committees, hold hearings with experts to gather policy ideas, and discuss objectives and priorities after the Administration releases its security strategies. During the transition period after a change in Administration, proactive actions by the executive branch and Congress can help minimize national security risks. The new President will face various security challenges, and preparation and education activities prior to the inauguration are crucial for an effective response. Steps can be taken throughout the transition to lessen risks to the nation's security. During the transition period, proactive actions by the executive branch and Congress can help minimize national security risks, preparing the nation for possible risks during the presidential election period and mitigating the effects of acts causing confusion during the transfer of power. The transition-related actions of the outgoing and incoming Administration can impact a new President's ability to safeguard U.S. interests and affect the legacy of the outgoing President. This includes incidents of terrorism during transitions of heads of state. The criteria for inclusion in this chart was based on the aggressor's intent to influence an election or future policy during a presidential transition. There is little evidence that incidents of national security significance were planned for a specific date before an election. The optimal time for an attack may not align with the transition period, leading to potential risks at any phase of the transition. The effects of an incident vary based on location, proximity to the election date, and other factors. Many security experts believe that incidents before a national election could impact the outcome or policies. There are concerns that terrorist groups may view these incidents as successes and be encouraged to launch attacks before elections. However, some experts suggest that such actions could backfire on the terrorists' long-term goals. Congressional legislation addresses various aspects of national security. Congressional legislation addresses various aspects of national security during presidential transitions from 1963 to 2008."
