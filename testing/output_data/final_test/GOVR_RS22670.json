    "content": "In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled in Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp. that it was not patent infringement to manufacture components in the US and ship them abroad for assembly. Congress added subsection (f) to the Patent Act to close this loophole, making it an infringement to supply components for assembly outside the US that would infringe the patent if done within the US. In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that it was not patent infringement to manufacture components in the US and ship them abroad for assembly. Congress added subsection (f) to the Patent Act to close this loophole, making it an infringement to supply components for assembly outside the US that would infringe the patent if done within the US. The patent at issue in Microsoft v. AT&T concerned AT&T's patent on a speech codec, a software program converting spoken words into a compact code. AT&T sued Microsoft in 2001 for including the speech codec in their products. AT&T sued Microsoft in 2001 for patent infringement, claiming that the speech codec in Microsoft's Windows operating system violated its patent. Microsoft argued that the software code exported overseas was not a \"component\" under the Patent Act, and therefore, no infringement had occurred. The U.S. District Court rejected Microsoft's argument that software could not be a \"component\" of a patented invention under \u00c2\u00a7 271(f) and held that copies made abroad still fell within the scope of the statute. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that software code alone qualifies as an invention eligible for patenting under \u00c2\u00a7 271(f), allowing the exportation of golden master disks to be considered within the statute's scope. The Federal Circuit affirmed that software code alone can be patented under \u00c2\u00a7 271(f), allowing the exportation of golden master disks to be included in the statute's scope. The Supreme Court accepted Microsoft's petition to clarify if digital software code can be considered a \"component\" of a patented invention under Section 271(f)(1) and if copies made in a foreign country are considered \"supplied\" from the US. In a 7-1 decision in April 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that Microsoft was not liable for patent infringement under \u00c2\u00a7 271(f) when foreign-manufactured computers were loaded with Windows software copied abroad from a master disk or electronic transmission sent from the United States. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained the two ways to conceptualize software: abstract instructions detached from any medium or tangible copies encoded on a medium like a CD-ROM. The Supreme Court ruled that abstract software code does not qualify as a component for liability under \u00a7 271(f) as it lacks physical embodiment. Justice Ginsburg compared software in the abstract to a set of detailed instructions, stating that information sent abroad for building patented inventions does not fall under \u00a7 271(f). To be considered a \"component\" under \u00a7 271(f), Windows software must be encoded in a tangible medium like a CD-ROM. The Supreme Court ruled that abstract software code does not qualify as a component for liability under \u00a7 271(f) as it lacks physical embodiment. Justice Ginsburg emphasized that software must be encoded in a tangible medium like a CD-ROM to be considered a \"component\" under \u00a7 271(f). The Court also determined that copies of Windows used for installation on foreign computers were made abroad and not \"supplied\" from the United States, impacting liability under \u00a7 271(f). Justice Ginsburg argued that the traditional presumption against extraterritorial application of United States law, particularly in patent law, would help favor the Court construing \u00a7 271(f) in a manner that excludes intangible software code and copies of software made abroad. She suggested that if AT&T wants to prevent copying abroad, they should obtain and enforce foreign patents. Despite creating a loophole for software makers to avoid liability under \u00a7 271(f), the Court resisted adjusting patent law to account for the realities of software distribution. The majority opinion of the Court suggested adjusting patent law for software distribution but excluded a footnote regarding liability under \u00a7 271(f) for software shipped abroad. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Breyer, would have favored Microsoft's assessment of liability in this scenario. Justice Alito argued that for liability under \u00a7 271(f), a physical component originating in the United States must be present in the infringing device. Since no physical object from the U.S. was combined with the foreign-made computers in question, there was no violation of \u00a7 271(f). He emphasized that the Windows CD-ROM is not a component of the computer itself as it is removed after the installation process. Therefore, the origin of the software copy is irrelevant in this case. In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that abstract software code should be considered a \"component\" under \u00a7 271(f) as it is used solely for installation onto a computer's hard drive, making Microsoft liable for exporting it. He disagreed with the Court's comparison of software to blueprints, stating that software actually causes infringing conduct to occur. The Microsoft decision is similar to the Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp. opinion in 1972. In Deepsouth, the Supreme Court excluded from infringement liability the making of unpatented parts of a patented machine in the US and exporting them for assembly abroad. Congress then enacted \u00a7 271(f) in response to expand patent infringement activity. The Supreme Court in Microsoft has suggested that Congress consider revising patent infringement liability under \u00a7 271(f) to include exporting software with intent. The Supreme Court in Microsoft suggested revising patent infringement liability under \u00a7 271(f) to include exporting software with the intent for foreign use."
