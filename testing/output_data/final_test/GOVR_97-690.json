    "content": "The Kyrgyz Republic gained independence in 1991 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Askar Akayev was elected president but faced protests over government corruption and vote fraud, leading to his fleeing the country in 2005. Kurmanbek Bakiyev became the new president in 2005, and in 2007, he orchestrated a new constitution and legislative election to consolidate power. In July 2009, President Bakiyev was reelected with 76% of the vote, deemed problematic by the OSCE. In 2009-2010, the population faced power outages and price hikes blamed on corruption. Large-scale unrest in Bishkek and other cities led to the ousting of the Bakiyev administration in April 2010. Roza Otunbayeva was declared acting prime minister. Bakiyev fled to Belarus for refuge. In June 2010, deep-seated tensions between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan erupted, leading to violent clashes resulting in at least 470 deaths and nearly 2,000 injuries. Grievances included perceptions of economic control, political exclusion, and support for opposing factions. In June 2010, violent clashes in southern Kyrgyzstan led to at least 470 deaths and nearly 2,000 injuries. The violence caused over 400,000 refugees, destruction of homes and businesses, and a request for Russian troops, which was denied. Uzbekistan did not intervene militarily but allowed some ethnic Uzbeks to settle in temporary camps. In July 2010, an OSCE meeting endorsed sending a police advisory group to help facilitate peace in southern Kyrgyzstan. Resistance delayed deployment, leading to a change in mandate to a \"Community Security Initiative\" with mixed local and international police advisors. The United States contributed officers and funds to the program, planned to run until 2013. International donors pledged $1.1 billion in grants and loans to aid Kyrgyzstan's recovery from the June violence. In addition to foreign assistance, states pledged $48.6 million. Kyrgyzstan received $940 million of these pledges. A commission blamed ethnic Uzbek \"extremists\" for the 2010 violence. The report also criticized interim government officials for their handling of ethnic tensions. An international commission led by Kimmo Kiljunen was formed under the OSCE Parliamentary. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, under the leadership of Kimmo Kiljunen, released a report criticizing the Kyrgyz provisional government for failing to provide security and leadership during the June 2010 violence. General Ismail Isakov was criticized for not using his military force to prevent the violence in Osh city. The commission also raised concerns about security forces being complicit in the violence. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly criticized the Kyrgyz government for failing to ensure security and leadership during the June 2010 violence. The commission called for government condemnation of ultra-nationalism, promotion of gender equality, and impartial investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the violence. The Kyrgyz government rejected claims of security forces' complicity, blaming the former regime and Islamic extremists instead. The Kyrgyz government rejected criticism from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly for failing to ensure security and leadership during the June 2010 violence. They blamed the former regime and Islamic extremists for the unrest. Ethnic Uzbeks were also blamed for human rights abuses, leading to concerns about ethnic reconciliation and potential unrest. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) threatened actions against the Kyrgyz government for alleged abuses against ethnic Uzbeks. Despite the violence, the interim government proceeded with a referendum on the draft constitution, with a 72% turnout. The 2010 referendum on the draft constitution in Kyrgyzstan had a 72% turnout, with over 90% approving the constitution. Some ethnic Uzbeks felt it did not protect their interests, but voting in Uzbek areas was largely supportive. Otunbayeva became president under the new constitution, which established a hybrid system of power-sharing among the president, prime minister, and legislature. The president is limited to a single six-year term and can be impeached more easily. The new constitution in Kyrgyzstan limits the president to a single six-year term and allows for easier impeachment. The president retains powers such as appointing military and security heads, but the prime minister and government handle domestic and foreign policy. The president and prime minister share the power to negotiate and sign international treaties. The legislature size is increased to 120 members elected for five years, with limits on party seats and limited immunity for deputies. The new constitution in Kyrgyzstan limits the president to a single six-year term and allows for easier impeachment. The legislature size is increased to 120 members elected for five years, with limits on party seats and limited immunity for deputies. The majority party or coalition in the legislature has a complex system to approve a prime minister, with minority parties guaranteed chairmanships of key committees. The Venice Commission praised the constitution for introducing a parliamentary regime in Central Asia, balancing powers between the president, legislature, and executive branch. In the 2010 election, 29 political parties competed, with OSCE monitors noting progress towards democratic consolidation. In the 2010 election in Kyrgyzstan, the democratic process improved, but there were issues with poorly organized vote-counting and tabulation procedures. Five parties overcame vote hurdles to gain seats, with the Ata-Jurt Party receiving the largest percentage of votes. Over 60% of votes went to parties that did not pass the vote hurdles. In the 2010 Kyrgyzstan election, parties that did not pass vote hurdles received over 60% of votes. A ruling coalition was formed as no party gained a majority. President Obama and Secretary Clinton praised the election as a demonstration of democracy. Respublika, SDP, and Ata-Jurt Party formed a coalition with 77 seats out of 120, nominating Almazbek Atambayev as an official. In the 2010 Kyrgyzstan election, a ruling coalition was formed with Respublika, SDP, and Ata-Jurt Party controlling 77 out of 120 seats. Almazbek Atambayev was nominated as prime minister and approved by the legislature. The presidential election in October 2011 saw 23 candidates approved by the Central Electoral Commission, with some candidates withdrawing from the race, leaving 16 on the ballot. Atambayev temporarily stepped down as prime minister to run for president. Prime Minister Almazbek Atambayev temporarily stepped down to run for president, as President Otunbayeva was constitutionally banned from running. Ata-Jurt fielded Kamchybek Tashiyev as its candidate, while Atambayev was nominated by the SDP, his party, and supported by the Republic Party. Monitors from various international organizations noted \"shortcomings\" in the election, despite a wide choice of candidates and an open electoral campaign. Significant irregularities were reported during the counting and tabulation of votes in the election. Problems included media reluctance to evaluate candidates due to legal concerns, voter list issues, limited involvement of national minorities in campaign activities, and cases of ballot box stuffing, multiple voting, and vote buying. Observers positively assessed voting in 94% of polling stations, but noted negative aspects during the counting process, such as interference in the vote count and pre-signed voting tallies. The Central Election Commission announced final election results on November 12, 2011, declaring Atambayev as the winner with 62.52% of the votes. He was sworn in as president on December 1, 2011. A coalition was formed on December 15, comprising the SDP, Respublika, Ata-Meken, and Ar-Namys parties, holding 92 seats in the legislature. The Ata-Jurt Party became the opposition with 28 seats. The legislature elected Asilbek Jeenbekov as its speaker and approved Omurbek Babanov as prime minister. The new government's power distribution revived northern dominance, leading to regional tensions. Atambayev addressed corruption issues, citing $500 million in economic damage in 2010. He called for infrastructure upgrades, including the north-south Datka-Kemin power line and China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway. President Atambayev supported infrastructure projects like the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway and new irrigation canals for agriculture. He aimed to reduce government inspections to encourage business and investment. Additionally, he emphasized the use of the Kyrgyz language while protecting ethnic minority languages and cultures. In December 2011, he established an anti-corruption unit to combat high-level corruption in the government. The political situation remained fragile, highlighted by the reelection of a Kyrgyz nationalist as mayor of Osh and a prison escape by the former President's brother in March 2012. In June 2012, a Judicial Selection Council was established to appoint judges to a new Constitutional Chamber and local courts. By September 2012, 25 judges were selected for the Constitutional Chamber under the Supreme Court to uphold the constitution and citizens' rights. Allegations of lack of transparency and fraud in the judge selection process have been made by NGOs and observers. The judicial system in Kyrgyzstan has faced allegations of corruption and political influence. Prime Minister Babanov's government fell in August 2012 due to accusations of malfeasance and corruption. President Atambayev called for the Social Democratic Party to form a new coalition, which was formed with Ar-Namys and Ata-Meken. The new coalition compromised with opposition parties to pass legislation. In late August 2013, Respublika was negotiating to join the majority legislative coalition, leaving Ata-Jurt as the opposition. On October 3, 2012, Ata-Jurt Party leader Kamchybek Tashiyev and members Sadyr Japarov and Talant Mamytov incited protesters to storm the legislature demanding nationalization of the Kumtor gold mine. Police repulsed the protesters, and the legislators were arrested. The three legislators from the Ata-Jurt Party were arrested for attempting to overthrow the constitutional system. After protests in southern Kyrgyzstan, they were sentenced to prison but later acquitted due to violent reactions. The Supreme Court reinstated their sentences in August 2013. In August 2013, the Supreme Court re-instated the sentences of opposition deputies but ruled they would not be imprisoned. Organized crime leader Aziz Batukayev was released on health grounds in April 2013 after serving half of a 16-year sentence. The Kyrgyz legislature called for the dismissal of officials connected to his release in May 2013. Analyst Johan Engvall noted Kyrgyzstan's new semi-parliamentary system has replaced the one-family rule with a coalition-based corruption system. The new semi-parliamentary system in Kyrgyzstan has replaced one-family rule with a coalition-based corruption system, where major assets are divided among political parties. President Atambayev's attempts to gain more authority have caused tensions, as seen in recent protests calling for nationalization of the Kumtor gold mine and exoneration of legislators charged with a coup attempt. The system has yet to improve strained relations between the center and periphery. Freedom House classified Kyrgyzstan as \"partly free\" in 2012, citing flaws in democratic elections, treatment of ethnic minorities, judicial independence, and accountability for torture. The U.S. State Department reported ongoing ethnic tensions, lack of judicial impartiality, and law enforcement abuses in the country. Human rights organizations reported widespread abuse, including arbitrary arrests, mistreatment, torture, and extortion, with a focus on ethnic Uzbeks. Authorities in the south continued to detain Uzbeks for crimes from 2010 violence, with reports of disappearances and abductions. NGO Golos Svobody documented 87 cases of torture in detention centers, mainly targeting Uzbeks for bribes or confessions. Legislation was enacted in July 2012 to establish a national body to monitor and prevent torture, with staffing in progress by year-end. Various NGOs, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the OSCE continued to report complaints of arbitrary arrests due to lack of proper identification papers or false charges for bribes. Judges were believed to be open to bribes or outside pressure, with allegations of bribery to attain positions. Trials of ethnic Uzbeks for violence against ethnic Kyrgyz in 2010 did not meet legal requirements or international fairness standards, with reports of torture to obtain confessions. Numerous NGOs reported trials involving torture to obtain confessions, denial of counsel, threats, and violence against defendants. In one case, an ethnic Uzbek citizen was sentenced to life in prison for murder, amidst claims of police coercion and physical attacks on the defendant and legal representatives. Despite some progress in ensuring free expression, journalists still faced threats for covering sensitive topics. Many journalists self-censor reporting due to fear of targeting, with state security officers beating reporters covering protests. Government-owned newspapers resumed publishing in Uzbek language after 2010 violence, facing occasional threats. Journalists and media outlets are vulnerable to libel lawsuits, with legal provisions used to prosecute journalists for insulting officials. Freedom of association is generally respected, but occasional police harassment and threats against human rights activists exist. In early 2013, the Supreme Court remanded Birzurukov's case for retrial, where he and his lawyers were physically attacked in the courtroom. Makhamadsoli Ismailov, editor-in-chief of an Uzbek-language Osh newspaper, was arrested for abduction and murder during ethnic violence in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence in August 2013. The Kyrgyz constitution guarantees religious freedom, but some laws restrict it, including the 2008 religion law prohibiting proselytism. The 2008 law in Kyrgyzstan restricts religious freedom by prohibiting proselytism, requiring religious literature examination by the State Commission for Religious Affairs, and restricting public distribution of religious materials. All religious groups and foreign missionaries must undergo a difficult registration process, leading to denial of registration for non-traditional groups. Kyrgyzstan is also noted as a source and transit country for forced labor and sex trafficking. NGOs report that some schools in the south of Kyrgyzstan cancel classes in the fall to send children to pick cotton. The Kyrgyz government is making efforts to combat trafficking, providing support to NGOs and international organizations. However, there were fewer trafficking victims identified and cases investigated in 2012 compared to 2011. The State Department recommended increasing efforts to prosecute trafficking offenders, including complicit government officials. In 2012, Kyrgyzstan's GDP contracted by 0.9% due to reduced gold production, a poor harvest, and global economic issues. Despite a rise in inflation and a budget deficit of 10% of GDP, strong growth in other sectors and remittances helped cushion the drop. Foreign investment declined, linked to worker issues. In 2012, Kyrgyzstan's GDP contracted by 0.9% due to reduced gold production and global economic issues. Foreign investment declined due to worker strife. Remittances from migrant workers increased by 15% to $1.8 billion. The IMF predicts growth of 7.4% in 2013, with inflation around 7%. The Finance Ministry drafted a budget of $2.15 billion for 2014 with a deficit of $375 million, to be covered by foreign borrowing. Gold production is a significant source of GDP and export earnings, while agriculture employs half the workforce. Kyrgyzstan's economy relies heavily on agriculture, with major products including cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat. The country has faced challenges such as increased poverty rates after the 2008 global financial crisis and 2010 ethnic violence. Kyrgyzstan leads Central Asia in privatization efforts and has surplus hydroelectric energy, rare earth mineral reserves, and tourism potential for development. U.S. support helped Kyrgyzstan join the WTO in 1998, and President Atambayev has worked towards joining the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus customs union. In 2013, Kyrgyzstan was warned by Russia that migrant workers would need entry visas if the country did not join the Customs Union. The IMF provided financial assistance to Kyrgyzstan to manage the impact of the global economic downturn. President Atambayev launched a National Sustainable Development Strategy in 2012. Kyrgyzstan launched a 2013-2017 National Sustainable Development Strategy with a $16.3 billion investment goal, aiming for international support. The government faces challenges with a $3.2 billion foreign debt hindering domestic spending on healthcare and education, prompting calls for restructuring loans. In mid-2012, Kyrgyz legislature rejected nationalizing Kumtor gold mine, opting to revise agreements with operator Centerra Gold. A commission recommended rescinding tax breaks, increasing Kyrgyz representation on the board, and making management changes. Protests in mid-2013 demanded nationalization, leading to negotiations for Kyrgyzstan to possibly own 50% of shares by September 2013. In September 2013, negotiations are expected to conclude on Kyrgyzstan's potential ownership of 50% of shares in a new joint venture at the Kumtor gold mine. Prime Minister Satybaldiev launched an investigation into criminal extortion at the mine, linking it to local organized crime. Kyrgyzstan also signed a 25-year concessionary agreement with Russia's Gazprom for gas distribution, aiming to improve infrastructure and reduce reliance on Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. This move was seen as a possible repayment for Russian loans to Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan has good relations with neighboring countries like China, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, but faces disputes with Uzbekistan. China is a significant trade partner and investor in Kyrgyz industry. Kyrgyzstan is involved in various international organizations, including NATO's Partnership for Peace and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Kyrgyzstan has faced tensions with Uzbekistan due to various incidents, including accusations of harboring terrorists. Uzbekistan blamed Kyrgyzstan for lax border controls enabling terrorists to enter Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan's plans to build hydro-electric power plants on the Naryn River have been strongly opposed by Uzbekistan, citing concerns about water flow restrictions. The Kambarata-2 plant in Kyrgyzstan became operational in August 2010, but the larger Kambarata-1 plant remains unfinished. Uzbek President Islam Karimov emphasized the need for approval from downstream states for dams planned by Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan during a visit to Kazakhstan in 2012. In accordance with expert consensus and international conventions, President Karimov warned of possible water wars, sparking criticism in Kyrgyzstan. Despite warnings, Russia agreed to assist Kyrgyzstan in building the Kambarata-1 dam, leading to denouncement from Uzbekistan. Regional water issues were discussed in meetings hosted by Kazakhstan and Russia agreed to seek an international assessment of the dam's environmental impact. President Nazarbayev visited Uzbekistan to emphasize the need for resolving regional water issues. In Uzbekistan, President Karimov opposed the construction of dams due to earthquake risks and rejected the idea of trading water as a commodity. In January 2013, Kyrgyz border guards wounded Uzbeks in a border dispute, leading to hostilities and road closures. In July 2013, Kyrgyzstan began building a fence around the Sokh enclave and Kyrgyz guards allegedly killed two Uzbek guards along the Namangan-Jalalabad regional border. President Atambayev's first foreign visit was to Moscow in December 2011 to meet with then-President Medvedev and repair strained bilateral ties with Russia. Kyrgyzstan signed the CIS Collective Security Treaty in 1992 and 1999 for military support consultations. Kyrgyzstan signed the CIS Collective Security Treaty in 1992 and 1999, leading to mutual consultations on military support in case of outside aggression. Russian troops guarded the Chinese border until 1999, when control was handed over to Kyrgyzstan. Russia maintains military facilities under a 1997 accord, with a focus on the Kant airfield near Bishkek to combat regional terrorism and defend CIS borders, potentially countering U.S. and NATO influence. About 500 Russian troops were deployed at the Kant airbase in early 2013. In 2012, President Atambayev complained to Russia about overdue basing payments and questioned the benefits of the Kant airbase. In 2012, Putin and Atambayev signed a 15-year extension to Russia's lease on military facilities in Kyrgyzstan. The accord between Russia and Kyrgyzstan includes agreements on rent payment for military facilities, assistance in protecting sovereignty, debt cancellation and restructuring, and assistance in hydropower projects. Atambayev pledged to close the U.S. Manas Transit Center in 2014. President Atambayev reaffirmed his commitment to closing the U.S. Manas Transit Center in 2014, with Putin offering aid for its conversion to civilian use. Atambayev praised the military basing agreement with Russia for strengthening Kyrgyzstan's defense capability and security, emphasizing Russia as their main strategic partner. He highlighted the need for assistance in strengthening armed forces and border protection to prevent terrorist infiltration before the ISAF withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014. President Atambayev expressed hope for CSTO assistance in re-arming and strengthening border protection. He supported a Russian military base in southern Kyrgyzstan, opposed by former Russian Defense Minister Serdyukov. Kyrgyzstan's armed forces consist of 10,900 troops, including border guards, police, and National Guard. The defense budget is around $100 million. The air force has 33 aircraft and 10 helicopters based at Kant. Most troops are ethnic Kyrgyz conscripts, with officers trained in Russia and Russian language as the language of command. A new national security concept in Kyrgyzstan, signed into law in June 2012, prioritizes ties with the Collective Security Treaty Organization while also aiming to balance strategic interests with the United States, Russia, and China. The concept identifies threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking, water and energy tensions, border security, separatism, ethnic conflict, and governance issues. A new military doctrine approved in July 2013 emphasizes the need for a unified command structure to address civil and military emergencies effectively. Troops in southern Kyrgyzstan are implicated in security concerns according to the OSCE Commission of Inquiry. In June 2010, troops in southern Kyrgyzstan were involved in violence against ethnic Uzbeks. In March 2012, the defense budget was reduced by one-fifth to increase social spending. President Atambayev established an independent State Border Service in September 2012 due to border guards resigning over low pay. Russian military assistance of $1 billion was discussed during Putin's visit in September 2012, with military equipment deliveries starting in late 2012. U.S.-Kyrgyz talks on setting up a military training facility were ongoing. After Bakiyev's ouster, talks on assisting Kyrgyzstan with a military training facility were put on hold. Islamic extremists invaded Kyrgyzstan in 1999 and 2000, seeking to create an Islamic state in the south. Kyrgyz forces, with support from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, defeated the insurgents. The IMU did not invade the region before September 11, 2001. The IMU did not invade the region before September 11, 2001, as Osama bin Laden had secured its aid for a Taliban offensive against the Afghan Northern Alliance. In May 2006, a dozen alleged IMU members invaded from Tajikistan but were soon defeated. The Kyrgyz defense minister expressed concerns about the increasing threat posed by groups like IMU and HT. Kyrgyz security authorities reported activities of Jamaat Kyrgyzstan Jaish al-Mahdi, an ethnic Kyrgyz terrorist group, including bombings, robbery, and planned attacks on U.S. targets. Kyrgyz security forces took action against the group in early 2011. In January 2011, a dozen members of the Jaish al-Mahdi group, including its leader, were arrested. Some members received training from the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group and pledged solidarity with the Taliban. Additional arrests were made in September 2011 and August 2012. In July 2013, three members were sentenced to life in prison for various terrorist activities. The State Department reported no major terrorist incidents in Kyrgyzstan in 2012. In 2012, Kyrgyz security forces targeted individuals linked to terrorist organizations. President Obama praised Kyrgyzstan for a democratic election and pledged U.S. support for building upon democratic gains since the 2010 coup. U.S. Ambassador Pamela Spratlen emphasized commitment to cooperation in celebrating 20 years of bilateral relations. In 2012, U.S. Ambassador Pamela Spratlen expressed full commitment to cooperating with Kyrgyzstan on development needs and expanding trade ties. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake highlighted U.S. support for democratization efforts in Kyrgyzstan, including training electoral workers and promoting ethnic reconciliation. He also praised Kyrgyzstan's participation in the Northern Distribution Network for transit of U.S. and NATO supplies. Kyrgyzstan's participation in the Northern Distribution Network for transit of U.S. and NATO supplies, hosting the U.S. Manas Transit Center, and engagement in Annual Bilateral Consultations with the U.S. to bolster political, economic, and security cooperation were highlighted by Assistant Secretary Blake during meetings in 2011 and 2013. He praised Kyrgyzstan's democracy and urged progress in inter-ethnic relations. The United States has provided significant foreign aid to Kyrgyzstan, totaling $1.22 billion from FY1992 to FY2010. Additional assistance was given after a 2010 coup and ethnic violence, with $90 million in urgent humanitarian aid and $53.6 million in foreign assistance for FY2010. Foreign aid continued with $41.4 million in FY2011 and $47.399 million in FY2012. The United States has provided significant foreign aid to Kyrgyzstan, totaling $1.22 billion from FY1992 to FY2010.

Foreign aid continued with $41.4 million in FY2011 and $47.399 million in FY2012. In FY2013, country totals are not yet available. The State Department's Congressional Budget Justification for FY2014 highlights democratic, economic, and educational challenges in Kyrgyzstan. U.S. priorities in FY2014 include $14.2 million for strengthening the legislature, civil society, independent media, and political parties, $6 million for economic programs, and $6 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement programs.

Additionally, the Millennium Challenge Corporation provided $16 million over two years to combat corruption and bolster judicial reform in Kyrgyzstan. The Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan serves as a key hub for military operations in Afghanistan, with missions including personnel and cargo support, aerial refueling, airlift, and medical evacuation. In 2013, there were 1,500 U.S. troops and contractors at the center, transporting nearly 300,000 personnel annually. President Bakiyev announced plans to close the base in 2009, possibly influenced by a $300 million loan and $150 million grant from Russia. Russia agreed to write off most of a $180 million debt and the United States was given 180 days to vacate the Manas airbase in Kyrgyzstan. An agreement of \"mutual benefit\" was reached with the Kyrgyz government, increasing the yearly rent payment to $60 million. The US also pledged funds for infrastructure and air traffic control upgrades at the airport. The United States pledged $30 million for air traffic control system upgrades at the airport in Kyrgyzstan. Additionally, they committed $20 million for a U.S.-Kyrgyz Joint Development Fund, $21 million for counter-narcotics efforts, and $10 million for counter-terrorism efforts. The agreement included stricter host-country conditions on U.S. military personnel. Some officials initially suggested reevaluating the lease after the ouster of President Bakiyev in 2010, but it was later confirmed that the lease on the transit center would remain. In January 2011, Kyrgyz security forces targeted Jaishul Mahdi, an ethnic Kyrgyz terrorist group, for their alleged plans to bomb the Manas Transit Center. A \"Muslim Resistance Committee\" later called for violence against the Transit Center in 2012. Atambayev, during his presidential campaign, expressed his intention to end military operations at the transit center when the agreement ends in 2014. In late December 2011, President Atambayev expressed concerns about the U.S. Manas Transit Center being a potential target for Iranian missiles, questioning the need for the military facility in Kyrgyzstan. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited Bishkek in March 2012 and Kyrgyz officials indicated that the airbase would be closed in 2014. Atambayev reiterated his plan to close the base during a meeting with Russian President Putin in September 2012. In late September 2012, President Atambayev reiterated his plan to close the U.S. Manas Transit Center in 2014 and integrate its facilities into the international airport in Manas. The U.S. Embassy in Bishkek reported that in FY2012, the United States provided $142.1 million for various expenses related to the transit center, including lease payments, landing fees, contributions to Kyrgyz Aeronavigation, and airport improvements. In addition to the $142.1 million provided in FY2012 for expenses related to the U.S. Manas Transit Center, $1.89 million was allocated for humanitarian assistance, $2.0 million for local spending, and significant amounts were paid for jet fuel in FY2009 and FY2010. Kyrgyzstan Airlines collaborated with other air cargo operators to transport military cargoes through the Transit Center to Afghanistan, generating revenue. Kyrgyzstan serves as an alternative land route for shipments into and out of Afghanistan, and an agreement was signed in 2012 for ground transit of cargoes out of Afghanistan. In July 2013, Kyrgyzstan approved the closure of the Manas Transit Center upon the expiration of the U.S.-Kyrgyzstan Transit Center Agreement. U.S. Ambassador Pamela Spratlen met with the Kyrgyz foreign minister to discuss the implications of the legislation. Discussions were held on security issues such as counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and border security. Kyrgyzstan emphasized the need for the U.S. to remove military personnel and equipment from the Manas Transit Center before its closure in July 2014. There are discussions about potential future roles for Turkey at the Manas International Airport to facilitate continued U.S. use. The closure of the Manas Transit Center in Kyrgyzstan will lead to a shift towards heavy reliance on Russia for economic, political, and security support. Reports highlighted corruption in fuel contracts at the center, implicating former Kyrgyz Presidents and contributing to political tensions. The subcommittee's report revealed corruption in fuel contracts at the Manas Transit Center, implicating the Akayev family. President Otunbayeva called for transparency in fuel contracts during a speech at the U.N. General Assembly. DLA was unaware of ownership details of Red Star and Mina, leading to potential misappropriation of funds. The firms Red Star and Mina used false certifications to obtain fuel from Russia, which was brought to the attention of DLA. Red Star warned DLA about a scheme to circumvent Russian restrictions on fuel exports for military use, leading to contracts being awarded without competition. The subcommittee raised concerns about the strategic vulnerability of the U.S. military operations in Afghanistan due to the potential fuel cutoff by Russia. The Russian government knew that Gazprom was the source of jet fuel for the Manas Transit Center, but false certifications were still required to circumvent Russian restrictions on fuel exports for military use. After President Putin offered assistance to Kyrgyzstan in exchange for closing the U.S. airbase at Manas, Gazprom slowed down fuel shipments. Despite Kyrgyzstan's pledge to close the airbase, it was instead re-designated as the \"Manas Transit Center\" and allowed to continue operations. Russia imposed high export tariffs on fuel shipments to Kyrgyzstan and later cut off all fuel shipments through Mina and Red Star. The State Department and U.S. Embassy in Bishkek were criticized for ignoring the impact of fuel contracts on U.S.-Kyrgyz relations. Despite Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's involvement in the issue, the embassy claimed the fuel contract issues were not their concern. Recommendations were made to improve transparency and due diligence in fuel contracts for the Manas Transit Center, including analyzing the U.S. military's reliance on Mina and Red Star for jet fuel and the risks associated with increased Russian involvement. In November 2010, DLA awarded Mina a contract to supply up to 240 million gallons of fuel to the Manas Transit Center in 2011, with Russia as the main source. An amendment allowed for a second supplier for 20-50% of the fuel, and a U.S.-Kyrgyz agreement in February 2011 permitted non-competitive fuel acquisition from a Kyrgyz firm. Russia and Kyrgyzstan later formed a joint venture, Gazpromneft-Aero-Kyrgyzstan (GAK). In February 2011, Kyrgyz legislators proposed taxing jet fuel at the Manas air base, but the US and Kyrgyz authorities reminded them of the tax-free agreement in the lease. The DLA issued a notice for fuel competition in May 2011, with GAK being the first supplier in September 2011, initially providing 20% of the fuel needs and potentially increasing to 50% by the end of the year. The DLA awarded a one-year contract for fuel supply to the Manas Transit Center to World Fuel Services Europe (WFSE), a subsidiary of a U.S.-based firm. WFSE will work with GAK to meet the aviation fuel needs of the Transit Center, providing a minimum of 10% and up to 100% of the fuel requirements. GAK may supply up to 90% of the monthly aviation fuel based on its capabilities. The contract aims to ensure a stable and uninterrupted fuel supply to the Transit Center. The new contract for fuel supply to the Transit Center does not involve Mina Corporation. DLA provided $208.1 million to GAK for jet fuel in FY2012 and may have purchased fuel from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to diversify sources."
