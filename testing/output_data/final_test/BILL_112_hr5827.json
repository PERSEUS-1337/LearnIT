    "content": "The Act titled \"Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2012\" focuses on integrating energy and water research. The Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2012 mandates the Secretary of Energy to incorporate water considerations into energy research programs. This includes advancing energy technologies to minimize freshwater consumption, increase water use efficiency, utilize nontraditional water sources, and address climate impacts on water supplies for energy generation. The Act aims to improve understanding of the energy-water nexus. The Secretary of Energy must develop a strategic plan within 6 months of the Act's enactment, outlining research needs for energy programs. The plan should include technical milestones for achieving objectives, such as advanced cooling technologies, performance improvements, and water reuse innovations. The strategic plan developed by the Secretary of Energy must include research needs for energy programs, focusing on innovative water reuse, recovery, treatment technologies, carbon capture, efficient water use design, life-cycle cost-effective technologies, systems analysis, wastewater treatment, advanced materials for nontraditional water sources in energy generation and fuel production. The Secretary of Energy's strategic plan includes research on innovative technologies for biomass production, reducing water impacts from energy development, energy-efficient water systems, energy generation from water systems, and other areas of the energy-water nexus. Collaboration and avoiding duplication with other federal agencies and within the Department's programs are also key components of the plan. The Secretary of Energy's strategic plan involves collaborating with National Laboratories and considering recommendations from the National Water Availability and Use Assessment Program. Additionally, the plan includes consulting with experts from research institutions and industry on energy-water nexus technologies. The Secretary of Energy will submit a strategic plan to Congress within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The plan will be updated every 3 years with input from various sources and changes will be explained. Progress reports will be sent to Congress every 2 years. The Secretary will report progress to Congress on milestones in the strategic plan. Additional activities may be conducted to integrate water considerations into Department activities. $60,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017. SEC. 3. ENERGY-WATER ARCHITECTURE COUNCIL. The Energy-Water Architecture Council, established by the Secretary in coordination with other relevant Federal agencies, aims to improve energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation. It consists of representatives from Federal agencies and non-Federal members with expertise in the energy-water nexus. The Council's functions include making recommendations on data collection and communication standards to agencies and entities involved in collecting data for the energy-water nexus. The Energy-Water Architecture Council, established by the Secretary, aims to improve data collection for the energy-water nexus. It recommends ways to enhance Federal water use data, best practices for utilizing existing monitoring networks, and conducts annual technical workshops for information exchange. Reports are submitted to Congress annually. The Energy-Water Architecture Council, established by the Secretary, aims to improve data collection for the energy-water nexus. It recommends ways to enhance Federal water use data and conducts annual technical workshops for information exchange. $2,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2013 through 2017 for carrying out this section. SEC. 4. MANDATES.\n\nThis Act does not require State, tribal, or local governments to take actions that increase their financial burden by limiting water use.\n\nSEC. 5. COORDINATION AND NONDUPLICATION.\n\nThe Secretary will coordinate activities under this Act with other Department programs and Federal research programs to the fullest extent possible.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefinitions include the Energy-Water Architecture Council, Department of Energy, energy-water nexus, and Secretary of Energy."
