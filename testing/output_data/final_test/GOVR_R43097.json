    "content": "Some Members of Congress support comprehensive immigration reform (CIR) which includes border security, employment verification, visa revisions, and legalization for some unauthorized immigrants. Others prefer addressing these issues sequentially or disagree with certain provisions. Immigration is a legislative priority in the 113th Congress. The Senate focused on the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) in the 113th Congress. The bill was introduced by a bipartisan group known as the \"Gang of 8\" and passed the Senate after several days of hearings and debates in June 2013. The Senate passed S. 744 in June 2013 after debating and amending the bill. The major provisions focused on comprehensive immigration reform, including triggers, border security, interior enforcement, employment verification, legalization of unauthorized aliens, immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, and humanitarian provisions. Some Members of Congress have concerns about comprehensive immigration reform, specifically regarding the enforcement of tougher measures alongside legalization and visa reforms. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act's promises were not fully realized, leading to doubts about the effectiveness of similar reforms. To address these concerns, S. 744 includes pre-conditions for enforcement provisions before legalization and allocates funding for enforcement measures. Section 3 of S. 744 establishes triggers for legalization and status adjustment provisions, requiring DHS to implement border security strategies before processing RPI applications. Aliens could apply for RPI status within a year of the bill's enactment. DHS must meet four benchmarks before adjusting RPI status to LPR: border security strategy deployment, completion of border fencing strategy, implementation of employment verification system, and use of electronic exit system at ports of entry. The bill requires machine readable data at air and sea ports of entry. Exceptions to trigger provisions are outlined, allowing RPIs to apply for LPR status after 10 years under certain conditions. Triggers do not apply to certain groups like DREAMers or agricultural workers. The Hoeven-Corker-Leahy Amendment modified trigger provisions in the bill, exempting DREAMers and aliens with \"blue card\" status. It expanded requirements for DHS to adjust RPIs to LPR status, with adjustments not starting until certified by the DHS Secretary after consultation with other officials. The Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy, including elements from the Hoeven-Corker-Leahy Amendment, must be deployed and operational. \"Operational\" means necessary technology, infrastructure, and personnel are in use for effective control of the Southern border. The Southern Border Fencing Strategy requires at least 700 miles of pedestrian fencing in place. The Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy mandates 700 miles of pedestrian fencing along the Southern border, with secondary fencing where necessary. DHS has implemented an employment verification system and electronic exit system at ports. Over 38,000 Border Patrol agents are stationed along the border. S. 744 proposes a Comprehensive Immigration Reform Trust Fund. The Hoeven-Corker-Leahy Amendment increased the initial transfer into the Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR) Trust Fund to $46.3 billion, allowing for immediate expenditure on hiring additional Border Patrol agents and implementing security strategies along the Southern Border. Over a five-year period, DHS will receive funding for various security measures, including enacting recommendations of the Southern Border Security Commission, procuring and deploying fencing, infrastructure, and technology, expanding the employment eligibility verification system, and covering one-time and startup costs for implementation. The bill includes funding for implementing security measures over a five-year period, as well as initial costs for the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, and Justice. The CIR Trust Fund would receive additional funding from immigration-related fees and penalties, with a directive to ensure a minimum balance for authorizations in the following years. Immigration fees and penalties collected would be designated for deficit reduction and other purposes. The CIR Startup Account would receive additional funding for federal budget deficit reduction and border-crossing prosecutions in the Tucson Sector. Remaining funds would be used for personnel increases and border security operations as authorized in S. 744. Expenditure plans for the CIR Trust Fund and CIR Startup Account would be required, with revenue provisions in S. 744 raising procedural concerns. The House can \"blue slip\" legislation like S. 744 if it violates its prerogatives, which includes creating new fees. Alternatively, the House could ignore the bill or introduce a companion bill. S. 744 aims to strengthen border security with new strategies, personnel, equipment, and infrastructure. The bill S. 744 includes provisions for DHS waiver authority, federal lands access, immigration-related crimes, and border security oversight. It requires DHS to submit a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and establish a Southern Border Fencing Strategy within 180 days of enactment. The Comprehensive Security Strategy aims to achieve and maintain effective control of all sectors along the Southern border. The Hoeven-Corker-Leahy amendment to S. 744 mandates specific surveillance equipment requirements for each Border Patrol sector on the Southwest border as part of the Comprehensive Security Strategy. The Fencing Strategy identifies locations for fencing, infrastructure, and technology deployment along the Southern border, with a requirement for 700 miles of fencing. DHS must implement these strategies immediately after submission and report on them semiannually. The Comprehensive Security and Fencing Strategies in S. 744 would trigger RPI legalization and status adjustment provisions. Section 6 authorizes direct spending to support the strategies. The Hoeven-Corker-Leahy amendment establishes a Southern Border Security Commission within one year of enactment. The Commission includes governors of Southern border states, members appointed by Congress and the President. If effective control of all Southern border sectors is not achieved within five years, the Commission must issue recommendations. The bill would require issuing a report with recommendations for achieving and maintaining border security goals, authorizing direct spending to implement the recommendations. The Secretary of State, in coordination with DHS, would develop a strategy to address unauthorized immigration through Mexico to the US, including training border and law enforcement personnel and educating nationals on risks of illegal migration. The bill aims to educate nationals about risks of illegal migration to the US and authorizes funding for border enforcement programs. It requires an increase in trained CBP officers and Border Patrol agents, as well as additional Air and Marine personnel. The bill authorizes funding for border enforcement programs, including increasing CBP Air and Marine personnel by 160 and annual flight hours to 130,000. It also requires a program to recruit former armed forces members for CBP and ICE, using student loan repayment as an incentive. Additionally, it allows the National Guard to assist in border security efforts, including infrastructure construction and surveillance. Funding is also authorized for additional Border Patrol bases and distress beacons along the Northern and Southern borders. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of distress beacons along the Northern and Southern borders to address migrant deaths, a grant program for border infrastructure improvement, deployment of surveillance equipment for continuous border monitoring, funding for 9-1-1 service improvement in rural areas, and enhancing radio communication among border law enforcement agencies. Additionally, it directs DOD and DHS to identify equipment for CBP use at the border and mandates federal agencies to review project impacts on national and cultural resources before allocation. S. 744 grants the DHS Secretary authority to waive laws for expedited construction of barriers and infrastructure along the Southern border. The Secretary must justify each law waived, and the waiver ends when RPIs adjust to LPR status. The Southwest border has federal lands identified as \"high-risk areas\" for marijuana smuggling and illegal migration. DHS has agreements with USDA and DOI for CBP access to these lands. Some argue for more access for enforcement. S. 744 mandates immediate CBP access to federal lands within 100 miles of the southern Arizona border for security activities. The bill S. 744 mandates immediate CBP access to federal lands within 100 miles of the southern Arizona border for security activities. Activities conducted to protect natural and cultural resources would not be restricted or delayed by environmental impact statements. Certain aliens apprehended at the border may face immigration-related criminal charges under current law, with modifications proposed in Title III of the bill. S. 744 would amend INA Section 276 to increase penalties for unlawful reentry, create new felony offenses for smuggling people, and impose penalties for hindering alien apprehensions. It also includes provisions for delaying prosecutions for aliens seeking humanitarian relief and increasing civil penalties for operators who transport unauthorized aliens. Title III of S. 744 expands fraud-related offenses in the U.S. Criminal Code and increases penalties. The U.S. Sentencing Commission would review minimum sentencing guidelines for fraud. DHS must create rules to prevent fraud in immigration documents. New criminal penalties for drug cultivation on federal lands would be imposed. DHS and DOJ are working to charge more individuals apprehended at the border. Section 1104 of Title I provides funding for increased prosecutions in the Tucson sector. The Trust Fund would support increased prosecutions in the Tucson sector by appointing attorneys, staff, and federal judges. It would also reimburse detention costs for sub-federal and tribal jurisdictions and provide grants for border-area law enforcement agencies. Additionally, the Attorney General would reimburse sub-federal governments for costs related to declined criminal cases, with appropriations authorized for FY2014-FY2018. Section 1110 would modify and reauthorize State Criminal Alien Assistance through FY2015. Section 1110 of S. 744 would modify and reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) through FY2015, reimbursing state prisons and local jails for detaining certain criminal aliens. Other provisions in Title I of the bill focus on oversight of border security activities, including new rules for the use of force by DHS personnel, specialized training for border personnel on identifying fraudulent documents and respecting individual rights, and establishing standards for the humane treatment of children in CBP custody. A new Ombudsman for Immigration Related Concerns would monitor immigration enforcement policies and assist victims of crime committed by aliens along the border. DHS would establish procedures to ensure apprehended families remain united and deported aliens are repatriated during daylight hours. Section 1116 of the bill would restrict DHS authority to conduct warrantless searches near the border. The DHS has authority to conduct warrantless searches of vessels, conveyances, and private lands near the Northern border under certain conditions. New reports would be required to help Congress monitor border-related issues. Legislation since 1996 has required an automated entry-exit system to track alien arrivals and departures, but it has never been fully implemented. The system collects biographic and biometric data about aliens. The US entry-exit system collects biometric data from aliens entering the country since 2006. Exit tracking is limited to airports and seaports, with plans to expand to land ports. Legislation aims to create a more robust exit tracking system by 2015. The bill requires DHS to establish a biographic exit system by December 31, 2015, collecting passport and travel information for all aliens leaving air and sea ports. Carriers must collect and transmit passenger exit data securely, with $500 million allocated for reimbursement. DHS must also establish a biometric exit system at the top ten U.S. airports with international air travel within two years. The GAO will review the program. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) would review the program, and DHS must expand biometric exit data collection to 30 airports within six years. Exit data would be integrated with other immigration databases, and withholding information for biometric screening could lead to inadmissibility. The entry-exit system aims to limit visa overstays, with DHS required to share information about overstays and allocate resources to locate and remove overstayers identified by the system. The Senate modified S. 744 to include provisions for monitoring and limiting visa overstays. DHS would be required to initiate removal proceedings for nonimmigrants who have overstayed their visa by more than 180 days. Semiannual reports on visa overstay rates and enforcement outcomes would also be issued. Additionally, a pilot program would notify nonimmigrants when their visa is about to expire. The immigration rules under the INA are enforced to deter violations, which can lead to criminal penalties, civil fines, or removal from the country. Aliens may be ordered removed for grounds of inadmissibility or deportability through a civil administrative process before an immigration judge. Provisions in S. 744 aim to amend the interior enforcement provisions of the INA. Subtitle E of Title III in S. 744 enhances immigration courts with additional resources, creates new grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, broadens judges' discretion, promotes alternatives to detention, strengthens DHS detention standards, and establishes special procedures to protect children affected by immigration enforcement. Other provisions in Title III address various aspects of immigration enforcement in the United States. The bill S. 744 aims to address concerns about long wait times for non-detained aliens in removal proceedings, lack of guaranteed legal counsel, and inadequate representation. It proposes to increase the number of immigration judges and staff to ensure aliens have adequate opportunities to seek relief. S. 744 aims to increase immigration staff, provide statutory authority for the BIA, codify standards for immigration judge decisions, improve training programs, ensure resources during immigration proceedings, and enhance aliens' representation. Funding would come from the CIR Trust Fund for new personnel, training, and technology, as well as programs for aliens' representation. The AG would have discretion to provide counsel to aliens in removal proceedings. The AG would be required to provide counsel for vulnerable persons, maintain an Office of Legal Access Programs, and assume responsibility for providing access to legal representation for child trafficking victims. Funding and authority for these services would be transferred from HHS to DOJ. S. 744 would require DHS to provide aliens with relevant documents at the start of removal proceedings, with exceptions for privileged or sensitive documents. EOIR would need to report to Congress on removal proceedings, including hearing methods and outcomes. The bill would also amend grounds of inadmissibility and deportability in the INA, including adding provisions related to criminal street gangs. The bill S. 744 would expand grounds of inadmissibility and deportability in the INA, including provisions related to criminal street gangs, multiple DUI convictions, immigration-related fraud, domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, and violations of protection orders. Certain waivers would apply, but aliens with three or more DUI convictions would face more limited relief from removal. The bill S. 744 would expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportability in the INA, including provisions related to torture, extrajudicial killings, war crimes, and human rights violations. The President would have the authority to release the names of persons deemed inadmissible on these grounds. Additionally, the bill would clarify that sexual abuse of a minor is considered an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. S. 744 would increase discretion to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility, including removing \"extreme\" from the hardship waiver for aliens who have been illegally present in the U.S. It would also give immigration judges and DHS discretion to not order removal or deportation in certain cases, such as when it is against the public interest or creates a hardship for the alien's U.S. citizen or permanent resident immediate relatives. This waiver would not apply to individuals with certain criminal or national security issues. S. 744 would establish new statutory requirements for bond hearing procedures and the filing of notices to appear for aliens, providing broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting removal from the United States. S. 744 would require aliens to have a bond hearing before an immigration judge after DHS custody determination. Detention would only be required if the Secretary proves no conditions can ensure the alien's appearance and safety. Immigration judges must review custody determinations, with additional reviews every 90 days. For aliens not eligible for bail, DHS must establish a secure alternative program for supervision. S. 744 would require DHS to establish a secure alternative program for supervision, potentially available to all aliens except suspected terrorists and security threats. This program would include oversight mechanisms such as regular inspections to ensure compliance with national detention standards. The bill S. 744 proposes mechanisms for oversight of DHS detention facilities, including regular inspections, financial penalties for non-compliance, and annual reports to Congress. It also limits the use of solitary confinement for detained aliens and sets procedures for its use. Additionally, the bill requires DHS to maintain records on detained aliens, report to Congress on their detention, and ensure that parental rights are not terminated due to detention or removal. State child welfare agencies must provide protections and services to children in foster care who are separated from their parents. The bill S. 744 aims to protect children in foster care separated from parents due to immigration enforcement. It prohibits termination of parental rights without efforts to locate or reunite the child with deported parents. State child welfare agencies must offer services regardless of immigration status. The bill S. 744 aims to protect children in foster care separated from parents due to immigration enforcement by providing services such as case managers, native language interpreters, and ensuring parents have access to necessary documents. DHS must determine if apprehended individuals are parents or primary caregivers within two hours and provide them with opportunities to arrange for their child's care. S. 744 aims to protect children in foster care separated from parents due to immigration enforcement by ensuring their best interests are considered in detention decisions. The bill mandates detention facilities to provide mechanisms for detained parents to maintain contact with their children, participate in family court proceedings, and comply with custody orders. Additionally, the Secretary of DHS must develop training on the new requirements under the bill. S. 744 includes provisions on immigration enforcement, limiting officers' authority in sensitive locations and requiring DHS to report on enforcement actions. It also mandates in-person hearings for stipulated removals and gives the State Department discretion on visa issuance for countries refusing repatriation. S. 744 would make changes to immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, eliminate a provision allowing renunciation of citizenship during war, and expand investigatory authority. It also enforces laws prohibiting employers from hiring unauthorized aliens and requires verification of work eligibility. Section 3101 of S. 744 proposes changes to employment verification and worksite enforcement provisions, requiring all employers to use an electronic eligibility verification system similar to E-Verify. Civil and criminal penalties for hiring unauthorized workers would increase under the new law. The proposed law in S. 744 would double criminal penalties for hiring unauthorized workers and introduce enhanced penalties like compliance plans and property liens. It also includes provisions to protect employers and lawful workers, with a tougher standard of proof for liability. Additionally, $750 million would be allocated over six years for DHS. Section 6 of S. 744 allocates $750 million over six years for DHS to expand the EVS. Section 3301 establishes an Interior Enforcement Account with $1 billion to support enforcement actions. DHS is authorized to increase USCIS and ICE personnel to 5,000 within five years. A reimbursable agreement between DHS and SSA is required to cover SSA's EVS responsibilities. Regulations for Section 3101 must be issued within one year of the bill's enactment. The bill's enactment would require employers and new employees to verify identity and work authorization. \"Enhanced\" driver's licenses could be used as proof. USCIS would publish acceptable document pictures, and employers would use a new identity authentication mechanism developed by DHS. The bill aims to prevent identity fraud by allowing employers to verify workers' identity documents through photo comparison. It includes funding for a DHS grant program for states to provide access to driver's license information. Additionally, the bill addresses document integrity by requiring fraud-resistant Social Security cards and creating new penalties for fraudulent use of Social Security cards. DHS would also study the potential addition of biometric data to employment authorization documents. Section 3101 of S. 744 establishes a permanent electronic eligibility verification system (EVS) for employers to check workers' identity and work eligibility documents against federal records. The bill would require all employers to use the system within six years of enactment, with certain employers mandated to start immediately. Employers must register and comply with EVS procedures, verifying newly-hired workers within three days. Employers must use the EVS to verify newly-hired workers within three days of employment and re-verify workers with expiring documents. Failure to use the system could result in the presumption of knowingly hiring unauthorized workers. DHS may also require verification of current workers not previously confirmed. The EVS provides immediate work eligibility confirmation or a \"further action notice\" within three days. Workers have 10 days to contest the notice. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about changes to strengthen employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement. Business groups have pushed for uniform national laws to combat the employment of unauthorized workers. USCIS would require employers to terminate workers who fail to contest a notice or exhaust opportunities to appeal a finding of unauthorized work. Failure to do so would create a presumption of knowingly hiring unauthorized workers. USCIS would share information with ICE about nonconfirmed workers. To address concerns about unauthorized workers, business groups advocate for national standards for employment verification. S. 744 includes provisions to preempt state fines related to hiring unauthorized aliens. Section 3101 outlines conditions for mitigating penalties and expands employer defenses for good-faith compliance. DHS would be required to implement these measures. S. 744 requires DHS to facilitate access to the EVS for employers and employees. It also mandates reports on challenges in implementing the EVS in agriculture, adverse impacts on employers, and effects of new documentary requirements. Additionally, a new Office of the Small Business and Employee Advocate would be established to assist with compliance and penalties. The 1986 IRCA included provisions to prohibit employment discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status. The DOJ Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices was created to address concerns of discrimination. E-Verify was intended to combat discrimination, but its effects are unclear. Section 3101 of S. 744 would require the DHS Secretary to design the EVS for auditing to detect employment discrimination and allow workers to verify their eligibility. Section 3101 of S. 744 would require the DHS to develop procedures for notifying workers about their records being queried, conducting civil rights assessments of the EVS, and allowing for administrative and judicial review of final nonconfirmations. It also includes provisions to prevent discrimination during the verification process. The bill addresses labor disputes, providing rights and remedies to unauthorized aliens. It prohibits unfair immigration-related employment practices and increases penalties for violations of worker rights. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would refer allegations of unfair employment practices to the DOJ Special Counsel. The bill would double penalties for violations of worker rights and allocate $120 million to publicize these protections. It also establishes the Office of the Small Business and Employee Advocate to assist with employment verification. Additionally, it expands eligibility for the U visa to cover a wider class of alien crime victims and includes new covered violations such as workplace abuse and exploitation. The bill expands protections for workers by including new \"covered violations\" such as serious workplace abuse, exploitation, and retaliation. It also requires DHS to stay the removal of certain aliens arrested during worksite enforcement and to notify law enforcement agencies. Penalties collected from employers hiring unauthorized workers would fund education efforts. Enhanced sentencing guidelines for employment-related offenses would be established, and information provided by alien crime victims would be protected. The controversial issue of addressing the unauthorized alien population in the United States is a key aspect of comprehensive immigration reform. S. 744 proposes a general legalization program for unauthorized aliens, with special pathways for children and agricultural workers. S. 744 proposes a new multi-step process for unauthorized aliens to transition to lawful permanent residence through a provisional legal status called \"registered provisional immigrant (RPI)\" status. Regulations for legalization provisions must be implemented within one year of enactment. The bill proposes a new \"registered provisional immigrant (RPI)\" status for unauthorized aliens to transition to lawful permanent residence. Eligibility requirements include physical presence in the US before December 31, 2011, continuous physical presence until RPI status is granted, and payment of fees and penalties. Dependent spouses and children can also be classified as RPI dependents if they meet certain criteria. The bill proposes a new \"registered provisional immigrant (RPI)\" status for unauthorized aliens to transition to lawful permanent residence. Eligibility requirements include physical presence in the US before December 31, 2011, continuous physical presence until RPI status is granted, payment of fees and penalties, and meeting other RPI eligibility requirements. Certain criminal convictions, terrorist activity, inadmissibility under INA provisions, and specific immigration statuses would make a foreign national ineligible for RPI status under S. 744. Additionally, aliens must satisfy federal tax liability, submit biometric and biographic data, and pass national security and law enforcement background checks as part of the RPI application process. The RPI application period under S. 744 would last for one year, extendable by the Secretary for an additional 18 months. Applicants must pay a processing fee and a penalty, with fees covering processing costs and penalties going to the CIR Trust Fund. Aliens 21 and older not covered by the DREAM Act must pay a $1,000 penalty. Under S. 744, aliens apprehended before or during the RPI application period can apply for RPI status and cannot be removed until a final determination is made. Removal proceedings for eligible aliens can be suspended to allow them to apply for RPI status. Aliens who departed the US while under an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal after December 31, 2011, generally cannot apply for RPI status under S. 744, unless waived by the Secretary for certain family relationships. Under S. 744, aliens apprehended before or during the RPI application period can apply for RPI status and cannot be removed until a final determination is made. Waivers are available for certain family relationships, allowing the alien to be considered for RPI status. During the RPI application process, the alien may receive advance parole in urgent situations, cannot be detained or removed unless deemed ineligible, and can work with authorization. If granted RPI status, the alien is considered lawfully present in the US and can travel in and out of the country. Under S. 744, RPIs would receive a tamper-resistant identity document and Social Security numbers. They would be ineligible for federal benefits and not receive credit towards Social Security coverage earned between 2004 and 2013. No quarter of coverage could be credited if earned under an expired visa, unless authorized to work. These limitations do not apply to those issued a Social Security Number before 2004. S. 744 would allow individuals with a Social Security Number issued before January 1, 2004 to attest to work authorization, with penalties for false attestations. RPI status would initially be for six years, extendable for additional periods if eligibility and employment requirements are met, including continuous employment or education attendance. S. 744 Section 2102 would add a new section (245C) to the INA on RPI adjustment of status. RPIs would need to satisfy the employment requirement to eventually become LPRs. Adjustment to LPR status would require certification from the Secretary of State that immigrant visas are available for approved petitions filed before the enactment of S. 744. Waivers of inadmissibility for RPIs seeking LPR status would still apply. RPIs adjusting status under INA Section 245C must meet employment requirement, be physically present in the US, satisfy tax liability, and undergo security checks. They must also meet English language and civics requirements for naturalization, pay a $1,000 penalty in installments, and additional processing fees. RPIs who meet requirements under INA Section 245C can adjust to LPR status under the Merit-Based Track Two visa provisions starting in FY2024. Those who also qualify under the DREAM Act provisions may have the option to adjust status more quickly under a new INA Section 245D. S. 744 Section 2102 would amend current law to allow naturalization for certain LPRs. S. 744 would allow certain RPIs to apply for naturalization after three years in LPR status, instead of the usual five years. It introduces a new section (245D) for RPIs who entered the US as children and meet specific requirements, similar to the DREAM Act. The DHS Secretary could adjust an RPI's status to LPR if they have been an RPI for at least five years and were under 16 at the time of entry. The proposed legislation (S. 744) would allow certain RPIs to apply for naturalization after three years in LPR status, instead of the usual five years. It introduces a new section (245D) for RPIs who entered the US as children and meet specific requirements, similar to the DREAM Act. These aliens must have earned a high school diploma or equivalent, completed at least two years in a higher education program, or served in the military for at least four years. They would be subject to English language, civics, and security screenings. The proposed legislation (S. 744) would exempt certain RPIs who adjust to LPR status under INA Section 245D from numerical limits on permanent admissions. It would also repeal restrictions on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens. The bill S. 744 would establish a new \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, allowing them to receive federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. This status would be granted to those who meet specific work requirements. The bill S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, granting them federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Eligibility includes having worked 100 days in agricultural employment in the US by December 31, 2012, being physically present in the US before that date, and maintaining continuous presence until blue card status is granted. The application period lasts one year, extendable by the DHS Secretary. Final regulations must be issued within one year of enactment, and aliens cannot remain in blue card status after eight years from regulation publication. Applications are only accepted from aliens within the US. The bill S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, granting them federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Blue card applicants generally would be subject to similar eligibility restrictions and waivers of inadmissibility as RPIs, except that legal nonimmigrants in H-2A status would be eligible for blue cards. They would undergo national security and law enforcement background checks and receive work authorization, identity documents, and permission to travel in and out of the US. Processing and penalty fees for blue card applicants would be lower than for RPI applicants. The bill S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, granting them federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Blue card applicants would undergo background checks, receive work authorization, and permission to travel. Employers would need to provide annual employment records. The DHS Secretary could adjust blue card holders to RPI status if they can't meet agricultural work requirements. Regulations for status adjustment must be issued within a year of enactment. The bill S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, granting them federal student financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Blue card holders must meet specific agricultural work requirements to be eligible for status adjustment by the DHS Secretary. Adjustments must be made within a specified time frame and include satisfying federal tax liability and paying a processing fee. S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, requiring them to meet specific work requirements for status adjustment by the DHS Secretary. Blue card holders must satisfy federal tax liability, pay a processing fee, and a $400 penalty. False statements in applications for blue card status or LPR status adjustment carry criminal penalties. Spouses and children of blue card holders can apply for LPR status if eligible. S. 744 introduces a \"blue card\" status for agricultural workers, with specific work requirements for status adjustment. Blue card holders must meet tax obligations, pay a fee, and a penalty. False statements in applications carry criminal penalties. Spouses and children can apply for LPR status. The bill also includes provisions for adjustments of status from blue card to LPR status, exempting them from worldwide and per-country immigration limits. Permanent admissions to the US are subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, employment offers, and geographic diversity. S. 744 would revise numerical limits on legal permanent immigration, repeal the Diversity Visa Program, and create new \"merit-based\" categories to replace it. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are admitted outside of numerical limits. Millions of prospective LPRs with approved petitions are waiting in a backlog for numerically limited visas. S. 744 would make significant revisions to legal permanent immigration, including replacing the Diversity Visa Program with new \"merit-based\" categories. It would also adjust worldwide limits on family- and employment-based preference visas, eliminate per-country ceilings for employment-based preferences, and increase the per-country ceiling for family-based preferences. Additionally, the bill would modify rules for investor visas and include provisions for immigrant integration. S. 744 proposes significant changes to legal permanent immigration, including replacing the Diversity Visa Program with new \"merit-based\" categories. It would also adjust worldwide limits on family- and employment-based preference visas, eliminate per-country ceilings for employment-based preferences, and increase the per-country ceiling for family-based preferences. The bill includes provisions for immigrant integration and changes to certain country-specific and other special immigrant visas. The proposed Merit-Based Track One visa would admit 120,000 to 250,000 LPRs annually, with the annual flow based on demand and unemployment rates. Unused visas from past years would be recaptured. In FY2015 through FY2017, Track One visas would be available for third preference professional, skilled shortage, and unskilled shortage workers. In FY2018 and beyond, visas would be split 50% for Tier 1 (based on education, employment experience, high-demand occupation, etc.) and 50% for Tier 2 (based on high-demand occupations with little to medium preparation). Foreign nationals with pending LPR petitions or RPI status would not qualify for Track One visas. GAO would evaluate the implementation of this system. S. 744 would create a second Merit System (Track Two) with four components, including employment and family preference petitioners with pending petitions for at least five years. GAO would evaluate the system and report to Congress after seven years. The second Merit System (Track Two) under S. 744 includes four components for long-term workers and family preference petitioners with pending petitions for at least five years. Visas would be issued to reduce backlog and accommodate certain family petitioners after the implementation of reforms. The Track Two merit system in S. 744 allows RPIs to adjust to LPR status after 10 years, with a requirement of 20 years of lawful presence in an \"employment authorized status\" for adjustment. The bill waives the unlawful presence ground of inadmissibility for Track Two adjustments. Family-based LPRs must fall into specific categories, with an annual admission range of 226,000 to 480,000. S. 744 revises the family-based system by reclassifying spouses and minor unmarried children of LPRs as immediate relatives, exempting them from numerical limits. It also reallocates family preference visas in two stages for the first 18 months after enactment. S. 744 reallocates family preference visas, with caps for different categories of relatives and the elimination of the current family fourth preference category for adult siblings of U.S. citizens. Nonimmigrant V visas would be available to all persons with approved petitions pending within a family preference category. The U.S. visa system reallocates family preference visas, with caps for different categories of relatives. Nonimmigrant V visas would be available to all persons with approved petitions pending within a family preference category. U.S. citizens' unmarried sons and daughters, LPRs' unmarried sons and daughters, and U.S. citizens' married sons and daughters under age 31 could reside in the U.S. until their visa date becomes current, with work authorization. U.S. citizens' siblings and adult sons and daughters age 31 or older with pending family preference visas could reside in the U.S. for 60 days per year, but would not be authorized to work. The employment-based LPR visa system consists of five numerically limited preference categories for foreign nationals with specific qualifications. The INA allocates 140,000 admissions annually for employment-preference immigrants. S. 744 would exempt certain individuals from numerical limits on employment-based LPRs, including derivatives of LPRs, persons of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors, certain executives/managers, and those with specific educational qualifications. The bill aims to exempt certain individuals from numerical limits on employment-based LPRs, including foreign national physicians who have completed foreign residence requirements under INA Section 212(e). It would also make the first preference employment-based category exempt from numerical limits and include aliens with advanced degrees in STEM fields who have a U.S. job offer. S. 744 aims to exempt certain individuals, including foreign national physicians, from numerical limits on employment-based LPRs. It would also change procedures for admitting second preference employment-based immigrants, waive EB-2 labor certification requirements for certain alien physicians, and increase the third preference employment-based category to 40% of the worldwide level. The bill S. 744 aims to amend the INA by increasing visa allocation for certain employment-based immigrants and facilitating the admission of aliens working in federal national security facilities. It also includes changes to existing investor visas and the creation of new immigrant and nonimmigrant investor categories. The EB-5 visa category allows for up to 10,000 admissions annually with a minimum investment of $1 million, or $500,000 for investments in targeted programs. S. 744 would exempt spouses and children of EB-5 petitioners from numerical limits and redefine \"Target Employment Area\" to include high poverty areas. It would also designate communities affected by Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommendations as targeted employment areas. S. 744 proposes adjustments to the EB-5 visa program, including automatic investment amount adjustments, criteria for removing conditional LPR status, and delegation of authority. It also permanently authorizes the Regional Center Pilot program, establishes statutory requirements for regional center designation, and allows preapproval for affiliated commercial enterprises. The bill S. 744 proposes creating a new EB-6 immigrant visa category for up to 10,000 immigrant entrepreneurs annually. To qualify, the entrepreneur must have maintained valid nonimmigrant status, owned a business creating at least five jobs, and raised $500,000 from investors or generated $750,000 in annual revenue. Sanctions would be imposed on regional centers violating financial reporting requirements. The bill S. 744 proposes creating a new EB-6 immigrant visa category for qualified entrepreneurs with advanced STEM degrees seeking to become EB-6 LPRs. The DHS Secretary would be required to promulgate regulations within 16 months to ensure national security and economic growth. Minimum investments for EB-6 eligibility would be adjusted every five years based on the CPI-U. The bill also defines immigrant integration and renames the USCIS's Office of Citizenship as the Office of Citizenship and New Americans (OCNA), which would promote institutions and provide training on citizenship responsibilities. The bill S. 744 proposes creating a new EB-6 immigrant visa category for qualified entrepreneurs with advanced STEM degrees. The Office of Citizenship and New Americans (OCNA) would work with the Task Force on New Americans (TFNA) to coordinate federal program responses to integration issues. TFNA members would liaise with agencies to ensure participation in creating goals and collecting data. Recommendations would be provided to DHS and the Domestic Policy Council. The bill S. 744 proposes creating a new EB-6 immigrant visa category for qualified entrepreneurs with advanced STEM degrees. It also establishes the United States Citizenship Foundation to administer grant programs for aliens seeking legal status and naturalization. The grant programs would be authorized $100 million for the FY2014-FY2018 period. S. 744 aims to reduce barriers to naturalization by waiving certain requirements for individuals with disabilities or above certain ages. The bill S. 744 proposes waiving English and civics requirements for individuals above certain ages and years as LPRs. It also allows the use of paper-based application forms until October 1, 2020. An amendment eases requirements for international adoptions and naturalization of adoptees, increasing the age limit for adopted children and changing pre-adoption visit requirements. The bill S. 744 proposes waiving English and civics requirements for certain individuals as LPRs. The Senate approved a floor amendment to streamline military-service-based naturalization for individuals with awards for active engagement or participation in combat. Automatic naturalization under INA Section 320 would apply to adopted children regardless of when the adoption was finalized. The bill S. 744 proposes waiving English and civics requirements for certain individuals seeking naturalization. Nonimmigrants are admitted for specific purposes and temporary periods, with some having the option to adjust to LPR status if they qualify. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories and over 70 specific types. S. 744 proposes extensive revisions to nonimmigrant visa categories, including for professional specialty workers, intra-company transferees, and other skilled workers. It also reforms lower-skilled visa categories and introduces a new \"W\" temporary worker category. Additionally, the bill includes provisions to promote tourism and make changes to student and other nonimmigrant visas. The H-1B visa program allows for professional specialty workers in STEM fields to work in the U.S. for three years, renewable once, with the option to seek LPR status. Annual admissions are generally limited to 65,000, but exemptions exist for returning workers and those employed by universities and nonprofit research facilities. Employers must pay H-1B workers prevailing wages and provide suitable working conditions. The H-1B visa program allows professional specialty workers in STEM fields to work in the U.S. Employers must pay prevailing wages, provide suitable working conditions, and demonstrate no adverse effects on other workers. Prospective H-1B nonimmigrants must show the required education and work experience. Despite exemptions for annual limits, applications for new H-1B workers have consistently exceeded limits in recent years. S. 744 aims to address H-1B shortages by replacing the annual cap with a flexible range of 115,000 to 180,000 admissions. The bill includes exemptions for STEM graduates and allows spouses of H-1B workers to work, potentially increasing skilled foreign workers admitted. Renewal of H-1B and L visas would also be eased. The bill aims to address H-1B shortages by replacing the annual cap with a flexible range of 115,000 to 180,000 admissions. It includes exemptions for STEM graduates and allows spouses of H-1B workers to work. Renewal of H-1B and L visas would be eased, with a 60-day grace period for job loss. New fees would fund STEM grants and training. The bill proposes changes to H-1B visa regulations, including a $1,250-$2,500 fee for visas to fund the CIR Trust Fund. It aims to protect U.S. workers by modifying application requirements and wage structures for H-1B workers. New classes of H-1B employers would be established based on workforce composition. The bill proposes new rules for H-1B workers to prevent displacement of U.S. workers. Employers must make efforts to recruit U.S. workers before hiring H-1B workers. Certain H-1B dependent employers cannot outsource workers, and those eligible to outsource would pay a fee. Changes would also be made to H-1C visa requirements, reducing the number of visas available and allowing for visa portability. The bill proposes new rules for H-1B workers to prevent displacement of U.S. workers, including restrictions on advertising for H-1B positions and limits on the total number of H-1B and L workers certain employers can hire. The DOL would have increased authority to investigate fraud and employer violations, conduct compliance audits, and share information with USCIS. Employers who violate terms of their LCAs would face increased fines and liability for lost wages and benefits of employees. The bill proposes new rules for H-1B workers to prevent displacement of U.S. workers, including restrictions on advertising for H-1B positions and limits on the total number of H-1B and L workers certain employers can hire. Employers would be prohibited from failing to offer H-1Bs insurance, pension plans, and bonuses offered to U.S. workers, and from penalizing H-1B workers for terminating employment before a previously agreed date. Additionally, the bill would require DHS and DOS to provide H-1B and L workers with information regarding their rights and employer obligations. Certain H-1B dependent employers would be required to pay an additional $5,000 - $10,000 in filing fees beginning in FY2015. The L visa is for executives, managers, and employees with specialized knowledge, allowing multinational firms to transfer personnel to the US for up to five to seven years. Concerns have been raised about displacing US workers, especially in outsourcing and IT firms. The bill includes protections for L visa holders and extends certain H-1B protections. The bill includes additional protections for L visa holders, such as prohibitions on outsourcing and outplacement of L employees, special application requirements for opening a new office in the US, caps on the proportion of L and H-1B workers in certain employers' workforces, and additional fees for H-1B/L-dependent employers. DHS would have the authority to investigate and adjudicate alleged employer violations of L-visa program requirements. The bill includes provisions for investigating and penalizing employer violations of L-visa program requirements, annual compliance audits, civil monetary penalties, debarment from L-worker petitions, liability for lost wages, whistleblower protections, and reporting on the L-visa blanket petition process. Additionally, current law includes nonimmigrant visa categories like NAFTA TN visas for Canadian and Mexican temporary professional workers and E-3 treaty professional visas for Australians. Several employment-based nonimmigrant visas aim to attract outstanding individuals, entrepreneurs, professionals, and high-skilled workers. S. 744 proposes adding visa portability for O-1 visa holders and flexibility in requirements for achievement in motion picture or television production. Changes to E and J visa programs are also included, along with the establishment of a new X visa for entrepreneurs. Amendments to E visa requirements would allow issuance to citizens from countries with bilateral investment treaties or free trade agreements. S. 744 proposes amendments to the E-3 visa category for Irish nationals, allowing them to work in the U.S. without requiring a professional specialty. It also introduces a new E-4 visa category with a cap of 5,000 visas per year per country, and an E-5 visa category for South Korean workers in specialty occupations limited to 5,000 visas annually. Employers hiring E-4 or E-5 workers would need to file a labor attestation form with DOL. A new E-6 nonimmigrant visa category would be established for nationals of eligible sub-Saharan African countries or beneficiary countries of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act who are coming to the United States to work, with at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a relevant occupation. These visas would be limited to 10,500 per year. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) may enter the U.S. on J-1 visas for medical education and training, with a requirement to return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas or LPR status, unless granted a waiver. States can sponsor FMGs. The Conrad 30 Program allows states to sponsor up to 30 waivers per year for foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to work in medically underserved communities. S. 744 aims to make this program permanent, with provisions to regulate working conditions and add flexibility to the J visa program for physicians. It also includes changes to facilitate physicians holding J or H-1B visas seeking to remain in the United States. S. 744 proposes changes to immigration laws for medical graduates, including exemptions for alien physicians with Conrad waivers or completing home residency requirements, extension of H-1B status for medical trainees, and creation of new visas for entrepreneurs meeting investment or job creation criteria. The X visa would allow nonimmigrants to be admitted for three years, renewable for additional three-year periods if criteria are met. There would be a $1,000 fee for each nonimmigrant admitted under an X visa. H-2B visas are limited to 66,000 new visas per year for temporary, non-agricultural work. S. 744 proposes changes to H-2B visa regulations, increasing the number of eligible workers and imposing additional requirements on employers. It includes exemptions for returning H-2B workers from annual caps and allows certain ski instructors to be admitted as P-visa athletes. Employers would need to attest that U.S. workers are not displaced, cover transportation and immigration costs for H-2B workers, and pay a $500 labor certification fee deposited in the CIR Trust Fund. The Senate bill proposes changes to H-2B visa regulations, including increased eligibility for workers and additional requirements for employers. Employers must conduct robust recruitment efforts for forestry workers, submit labor certification applications, and pay a $500 fee deposited in the CIR Trust Fund. Prevailing wage levels for H-2B workers would be based on the actual wage paid by the employer or the prevailing wage level for the job classification in the area of employment. The Senate approved a floor amendment to S. 744 that would impose a $100 fee on designated program sponsors for each nonimmigrant entering on a J visa as part of a summer work/travel exchange. The J-1 visa is for individuals participating in work- and study-based exchange visitor programs and encompasses a variety of work-related programs. The Senate approved a $100 fee for designated program sponsors for J visa participants in summer work/travel exchange programs. The fee would go to the CIR Trust Fund and cannot be charged to the nonimmigrant. S. 744 would also allow J visa holders to work in seafood processing in Alaska and permit aliens with language proficiency in countries with low LPR admissions to qualify for a J visa. S. 744 proposes creating a new \"W\" nonimmigrant visa category for lower-skilled employment, allowing ongoing work in agricultural and non-agricultural positions. W visas would not be limited to temporary or seasonal work, valid for three years and renewable, and would allow workers to work for any registered employer. The proposed W visa program would allow W workers to work for any registered employer, with restrictions for contract agricultural workers. Unlike H-2 employers, W employers would not need labor certification. W visa holders could lose status if unemployed for over 60 days, with a waiver option. An electronic monitoring system would track W workers. New W-3 and W-4 visas for agricultural workers would be created, capped at 112,333 visas per year. The W-3 and W-4 visas would be capped at 112,333 per year for agricultural workers, with provisions for adjustments by the Secretary of Agriculture. These workers would not be allowed to bring their families. The H-2A program would be eliminated one year after W-3 and W-4 regulations go into effect, making them the only nonimmigrant agricultural visas available. Employers hiring W-3 or W-4 workers would need to pay a fee and register as designated agricultural employers. Designated agricultural employers would have to document their need for specified agricultural occupations, estimate the number and timing of workers needed, and register for a three-year period. They would have to advertise jobs on a DOL job registry, offer employment to equally or better qualified U.S. workers, and submit a petition to the DHS Secretary at least 45 days before the date of need for workers. The Secretary would process and approve or deny the petition within seven days. Under S. 744, W-3 and W-4 employers must offer workers benefits, wages, and guarantees. They must provide employment for at least three-quarters of the contract period, offer insurance if not covered by state workers' compensation, and provide housing or transportation expenses for certain workers. Wage rates are based on agricultural classifications, with U.S. workers entitled to the same or better benefits. S. 744 establishes W-1 and W-2 visas, with provisions for W-3 and W-4 workers to be covered by labor laws and whistleblower protections. A Bureau of Labor Market Research would be created to address disagreements on temporary worker visa programs. The W-1 visa program under S. 744 would be capped at 20,000 positions in the first year, increasing to 75,000 by the fourth year, with a total range of 20,000 to 200,000 positions per year. Additional positions could be created for shortage occupations and certain employers meeting recruitment requirements. Registered positions would be limited to lower-skilled occupations. The W-1 visa program would be limited to lower-skilled occupations in metropolitan areas with an unemployment rate of 8.5% or less. Aliens certified for a W-1 visa could work with a registered employer and enter with dual intent. W-1 visa holders must start working within 14 days of admission. Spouses and children could also work in the U.S. Employers hiring W-1 workers must pay a fee and register for three years. Employers in the W-1 visa program must pay a fee to cover program costs and register as W-1 employers for three years. They would be subject to fraud investigations and could be disqualified for program violations. Applications for registered employers must include the estimated number of W-1 workers to be employed, while job designations require descriptions of W-1 positions and wage attestations. Employers can only hire W-1 workers if no qualified U.S. worker is available, and must advertise positions for at least 30 days. Additional recruitment requirements must be met before a position can be designated as a registered W-1 position. The W-1 visa program requires employers to pay a fee, register for three years, and follow strict guidelines for hiring W-1 workers. Higher wage rates apply for special allocations, and there are provisions to protect W-1 workers' rights and investigate complaints against employers. S. 744 aims to regulate foreign labor contractors and combat human trafficking by requiring them to provide workers with written information about employment terms, visas, and other details in English and the worker's native language. This is in response to concerns about exploitation of migrant workers by contractors, smugglers, and traffickers. The proposed legislation aims to prevent discrimination against workers based on various factors and prohibit charging fees for contracting activities. Contractors would need to register with the Department of Labor every two years, provide annual reports, and post a bond. Enforcement measures include investigations, civil fines, and the ability for individuals to sue noncompliant contractors for damages. Employers must use registered contractors. The bill S. 744 aims to encourage tourism to the United States by establishing a premium processing service for visa appointments and setting goals for expedited nonimmigrant visa interviews. It also requires overseas visa processing posts to report on appointment availability to help applicants identify low-demand periods. Additionally, the Secretary of DOS must ensure timely visa interviews and explore expanding visa processing capacity in China. The bill S. 744 aims to expand visa processing capacity in China and Brazil to keep interview wait times under 15 work days. It also proposes to include individuals employed by international organizations in registered traveler programs, with specific security screening requirements. Additionally, it directs the Secretary of DOS to develop a pilot program for remote video-conferencing interviews for B visas.

It also proposes to include individuals employed by international organizations in registered traveler programs, with specific security screening requirements. Additionally, it directs the Secretary of DOS to develop a pilot program for remote video-conferencing interviews for B visas. The bill would require a $5 fee from each nonimmigrant admitted on a B visa to be deposited in the CIR Trust Fund. It would also authorize the admission of qualifying Canadian citizens over 55 years old on a B visa for up to 240 days, with restrictions on work and benefits. Additionally, a new Y visa would be created for foreign nationals over 55 years old. The bill S. 744 proposes a Y visa for foreign nationals over 55 years old, requiring a minimum investment in residential property, maintaining ownership, and residing in the US for over 180 days a year. Y visa holders must have health insurance, cannot work in the US except for managing their property, and cannot receive certain benefits. The visa is renewable every three years. The bill also authorizes the designation of Visa Waiver Program countries with low overstay and refusal rates. The bill S. 744 proposes changes to the Visa Waiver Program, including allowing the Secretary of DHS to waive refusal rate requirements under certain conditions. It also revises probationary periods and termination procedures for non-compliant countries. Additionally, the bill specifies that Hong Kong could be designated a VWP country if it meets program criteria. The bill also includes changes to nonimmigrant visas, such as waiving personal interviews for certain visa renewals and allowing work authorization for expired visa categories under certain conditions.

It also permits employees of multinational companies to enter the US for observation or training, with restrictions on compensation. Additionally, the bill expands eligibility for B visa nonimmigrants to enter the US for honoraria and participation in certain activities. S. 744 proposes new provisions for B-visa nonimmigrants to participate in disaster relief operations and perform maintenance for common carriers. It also allows foreign students on F visas to have dual intent and removes the 12-month limit for students attending public secondary schools. Additionally, the bill changes accreditation requirements for schools accepting F students and flight schools accepting foreign students, while imposing a $100 fee on nonimmigrants admitted on F-1 visas. The bill S. 744 proposes changes to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and requires real-time data transmission from SEVIS to CBP databases. It also mandates accrediting agencies to report accreditation status changes to DHS and imposes a $100 fee on nonimmigrants admitted on F-1 visas. The bill S. 744 proposes changes to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), requiring real-time data transmission from SEVIS to CBP databases. It mandates accrediting agencies to report accreditation status changes to DHS and increases penalties for fraud and misuse of visa documents by SEVP certified school officials. Additionally, the bill allows DHS to impose fines on institutions failing to comply with reporting requirements and to immediately withdraw SEVP certification if necessary. The bill S. 744 proposes changes to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), allowing DHS to withdraw SEVP certification if fraud is suspected. It also prohibits certain individuals from holding positions at institutions accepting F or M foreign students. The bill emphasizes the principle of not returning foreign nationals to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened, as outlined in the INA. Refugees and foreign nationals can seek asylum in the United States if they fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. S. 744 aims to increase flexibility in asylum and refugee provisions, potentially reversing some changes made by previous immigration laws. S. 744 aims to reverse some changes made by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. It would allow for reconsideration of asylum claims denied due to late filing, authorize family members of refugees to bring their own children, grant asylum to those with credible fear of persecution, and require work authorization for asylum applicants after 180 days. S. 744 would establish work authorization for asylum applicants after 180 days, create a new category for \"stateless persons\" to apply for lawful status, increase U visas to 18,000 annually, allow the president to designate high-need groups as refugees, and tighten refugee and asylum laws. S. 744 includes provisions tightening refugee and asylum laws for national security concerns. It would terminate status for aliens returning to their country unless for good cause, impose additional security checks, end preferential treatment for certain immigrants, and authorize 5,000 immigrant visas. S. 744 includes provisions for 5,000 immigrant visas for qualified displaced Tibetans in Nepal or India, special protections for child trafficking victims, work authorization for approved T or U status applicants, and new reporting requirements for human trafficking offenses. S. 744 includes provisions to address human trafficking, such as new reporting requirements for FBI's Uniform Crime Reports and funding calculations under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. It also focuses on protecting unaccompanied alien children from human trafficking by transferring responsibilities to DOJ, providing counsel and access to child advocates, and mandating training for personnel in contact with these children. The bill S. 744 aims to protect unaccompanied alien children by transferring them to HHS custody within 72 hours, hiring child welfare professionals for assistance, screening for trafficking victims, and ensuring appropriate care while in CBP custody. It also requires HHS to determine family relationships and consider adult relatives for community-based support alternatives to detention. The bill S. 744 aims to protect unaccompanied alien children by ensuring safe repatriation, considering the best interests of the child, and granting legal status to derivative spouses or children of nonimmigrants who were subjected to battery or extreme cruelty. The bill S. 744 aims to protect unaccompanied alien children and grant legal status to derivative spouses or children of nonimmigrants who were subjected to abuse. DHS may grant employment authorization and adjust status to LPR for abused derivative aliens meeting certain criteria. Eligibility for federal benefits depends on immigration status and duration of residence and work in the US. Eligibility for federal public benefits, including means-tested programs like SNAP, TANF, SSI, Medicaid, and CHIP, varies based on immigration status and duration of residence in the US. LPRs, asylees, refugees, and humanitarian migrants are generally eligible, with humanitarian migrants having access for 5-7 years post-entry. LPRs must have a work history, military connection, or meet additional requirements, including a 5-year residency rule, to qualify for these programs. Eligibility for federal public benefits, such as SNAP, TANF, SSI, Medicaid, and CHIP, is based on immigration status and residency duration. \"Mixed status\" families and \"quasi-legal\" aliens create ambiguities in benefit eligibility. S. 744 does not change federal benefit laws and prohibits certain aliens from receiving means-tested benefits. S. 744 prohibits aliens with RPI status, blue card status, and V nonimmigrant visa status from receiving federal means-tested benefits and limits their access to certain benefits under the ACA. They would be considered lawfully present for all purposes except for premium assistance tax credits and the individual mandate for health insurance. The Senate approved an amendment to S. 744 that excludes short-term visitors and foreign students from being considered lawfully residing for certain health programs. S. 744 directs the Secretary of HHS to amend the eligibility definition under the ACA to exclude these groups. The CBO projects a net increase of 9.6 million LPRs due to immigration changes from S. 744. The CBO projects a net increase of 9.6 million legal permanent residents resulting from S. 744, which would boost federal revenues and lead to a net savings of about $135 billion over the 2014-2023 period."
