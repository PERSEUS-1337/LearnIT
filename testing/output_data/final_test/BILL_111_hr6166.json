    "content": "The \"American Eagle Palladium Bullion Coin Act of 2010\" authorizes the minting and issuance of $25 palladium coins weighing 1 troy ounce with .9995 fine palladium content. The Secretary of the Treasury will determine the size and thickness of the coins, and quantities will be based on appropriate marketing studies. The Secretary may acquire palladium bullion from natural deposits in the US or its territories for the palladium coins. If unavailable or not feasible, palladium can be sourced from other available sources. The price paid for the bullion will not exceed the average world price. Each coin issued will be sold based on demand. The Secretary determines the sale price of coins based on market value of bullion and cost of designing/issuing. Coins minted are considered numismatic items. Coins can be issued in proof or uncirculated versions. The design of coins minted under this subsection must differ from previous years and bear likenesses of Adolph Alexander Weinman's work, including the 'Winged Liberty' design and the 1907 American Institute of Architects medal. The coins must also include inscriptions such as 'Liberty', 'In God We Trust', and 'United States of America'. The Secretary determines the denomination, weight, and fineness of the metal for coins minted under this subsection. Any US mint, except West Point, may strike these coins, except proof versions which can only be struck at West Point. A marketing study is required to ensure adequate demand for palladium bullion coins produced by the US Mint. The United States Mint produces bullion coins at no cost to taxpayers. The budgetary effects of this Act will be determined in compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
