The Girl Scouts of the United States of America is the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls, founded by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912. With the help of Sir Robert Baden-Powell, Low organized the first 2 Girl Scout Troops in Savannah, Georgia.

The Girl Scouts of the United States of America was chartered by the United States Congress in 1950. Today, there are over 3.7 million members in 236,000 troops across the US and territories. The organization is part of a global family of 10 million girls and adults in 145 countries. Over 50 million American women have enjoyed Girl Scouting during their childhood.
