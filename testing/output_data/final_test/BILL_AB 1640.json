    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans. Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution is required for administration. The article excludes certain entities and public employees from its application, protecting their existing retirement plans approved before specific dates. The article excludes certain public employees from its application if their interests are protected under a specific federal code section or if they participate in a multiemployer plan regulated by federal laws. The benefit plan required by this article applies to new public employee members. Individuals employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and who switch to a new public employer after that date, will be enrolled in the retirement plan available to employees hired by the new employer before December 31, 2012, if they have concurrent membership or reciprocity with certain provisions. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changes positions without a break in employment and moves to a different public retirement system will be subject to the defined benefit plan available to employees hired before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new plan after January 1, 2013, it must conform to certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the new plan. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they may continue to do so instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit pension plan or formula on or after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the existing defined contribution plan or a plan that meets the article's requirements. Employers can offer a defined contribution plan after January 1, 2013, even if they previously offered a different plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they can offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before, within 180 days of the joint powers authority being established. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the requirements of the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is not required to adopt certain benefit formulas or compensation limitations. On January 1, 2013, public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements. Individual eligibility for membership in a public retirement system is not granted by this article."
