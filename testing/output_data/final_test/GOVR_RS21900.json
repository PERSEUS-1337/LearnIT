    "content": "Prior to the New Deal, national security information classification was regulated by the military. In 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the protection of military and naval installation information through an executive order. Subsequent Presidents have set classification standards through executive orders, citing general statutory and constitutional authority. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed Congress's ability to limit the executive branch's power in this area, recognizing the President's role as Commander-in-Chief in classifying and controlling access to national security information. Access to national security information is primarily granted to the President by the Constitution, separate from congressional authorization. The Supreme Court has suggested that Congress could establish its own classification procedures. Congress has created a separate regime for protecting nuclear-related data and directed the President to establish procedures for accessing classified material, including background checks. Access to classified information is granted to the President by the Constitution, with Congress directing the establishment of procedures for access. These procedures include background checks and denial of access, with exceptions for national security concerns. Classification standards can change with each new administration, leading to significant differences in procedures. The rules for protecting classified information have changed dramatically over the years, with new executive orders issued by each political party in power. Congressional committees have sought to bring continuity to the classification system and limit the President's power to withhold information. In 1966, Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act to promote government transparency. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) created a presumption of government information openness, with exceptions for national security. The Public Interest Declassification Act of 2000 established a board to advise the President on declassification. The Reducing Over-Classification Act of 2010 requires agency inspectors general to assess implementation. Branch agencies' inspectors general assess implementation of classification policies. Congress can request declassification of specific materials for public interest. Intelligence committees can disclose classified information if deemed in the public interest, with notification to the President if the executive branch objects. Disclosure can proceed after five days unless the President formally objects. The President can object to disclosing classified information after five days if it threatens national interest. Congress has deferred to the executive branch on disclosing classified materials, even those prepared by Congress. An example is the 28 pages from the Joint Inquiry report on Intelligence Community Activities post-9/11, where only three parts were approved for public release. The intelligence committees awaited a declassification review by the intelligence community before releasing the material in redacted form, including records related to prisoners of war and missing personnel after the Vietnam War. Congress sought and obtained the declassification of government information, with exceptions to protect intelligence sources and methods. Congress directed the Department of Defense to create a library of POW/MIA documents, excluding exempt records. The Senate Committee considered declassifying documents but opted for an executive order from President George H. W. Bush, which was issued to declassify relevant records. Congress has directed the President or agency heads to review and release relevant documents, such as records related to specific matters like the murders of churchwomen in El Salvador and Project 112. In 2004, Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to review and revise classification policies to facilitate declassification of data useful for monitoring the health of Armed Forces exposed to environmental hazards during deployments. In 2007, Congress directed the CIA to release a declassified version of the executive summary of the CIA Inspector General report on accountability post-9/11 attacks. In 2014, Congress directed the DNI to conduct a declassification review of documents. The DNI is tasked with reviewing documents from the raid that killed Osama bin Laden for declassification, with a requirement for justification for any remaining classified materials. The current standards for classifying and declassifying information were last updated in 2009. The President, Vice President, agency heads, and designated officials can classify information that could damage national security. Information must be government-owned and relate to military plans, foreign government info, intelligence activities, foreign relations, or other specified areas. Information can be classified at three levels based on the danger its unauthorized disclosure could pose to national security. \"Top Secret\" is for information that could cause \"exceptionally grave damage,\" \"Secret\" for \"serious damage,\" and \"confidential\" for \"damage.\" The original classifying officer must specify the potential danger of the information for each level. The officer must identify the specific danger of information disclosure and classify it at the lowest level of protection if in doubt. Information is declassified based on sensitivity, with a deadline of 10 or 25 years. Declassification can be extended if national security is still at risk. Classified information must be declassified when it no longer meets classification standards. The original classifying agency can declassify information if public interest outweighs protection needs. Information classified for 25 years or more with \"permanent historical value\" will be automatically declassified annually. Agency heads can exempt sensitive information. Agencies must review classification determinations upon request, except for exempt materials or those under litigation. This does not apply to information reviewed for declassification in the past two years. Access to classified information is limited to those who demonstrate eligibility, sign a nondisclosure agreement, and have a need to know. Former Presidents and Vice Presidents may have the need-to-know requirement waived. Declassification reviews are required for all agencies with classified information, and the National Archivist must also conduct systematic reviews for information transferred to the National Archives. The need-to-know requirement for accessing classified information can be waived for former Presidents, Vice Presidents, historical researchers, and former policy-making officials. Information cannot be taken off agency premises without permission. Each agency must have systems in place to control the distribution of classified information. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) oversees compliance with classification standards and can order declassification of improperly classified information. The Interagency Security Classifications Appeals Panel (ISCAP) is also under the ISOO's authority. The Interagency Security Classifications Appeals Panel (ISCAP) is headed by the ISOO Director and includes representatives from various agencies. It reviews appeals of classification challenges and oversees automatic declassifications. Each agency is responsible for safeguarding classified information as per E.O. 13526. The ISOO develops standards for safeguarding classified information, including handling, storage, distribution, transmittal, and destruction. Agencies must obtain approval before transferring classified information received from elsewhere. Unauthorized disclosure requires notification to ISOO and corrective action. Violators, including officers, employees, contractors, and licensees, face sanctions. Contractors, licensees, etc. who violate regulations face sanctions ranging from reprimand to termination. Executive Order 12333 outlines Intelligence Community members' responsibilities for protecting intelligence information, sources, and methods. Violations of federal laws must be reported to the Attorney General in a manner that safeguards intelligence sources and methods. ISOO Directive No. 1 provides additional guidance for agencies safeguarding classified information, emphasizing the responsibility of authorized personnel to protect it from unauthorized access. The responsibility of protecting classified information includes securing it from unauthorized access, meeting safeguarding requirements, and ensuring it is not communicated in unsecured ways. Agency heads must establish control measures for limiting access to authorized persons and ensure proper transmission and reception methods to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. Documents classified as \"Top Secret\" must be securely transmitted outside of secure facilities with proper marking and double wrapping for concealment. They must be continuously protected by an authorized courier. Secret or Confidential documents can be mailed following prescribed procedures. Agency heads must establish procedures for receiving classified information to prevent unauthorized access, detect tampering, confirm contents, and ensure timely acknowledgment of receipt. Section 2001.48 outlines specific measures for handling classified information. Section 2001.48 outlines measures for reporting loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Immediate reporting to designated officials is required, followed by an inquiry to determine corrective actions and assess damage to national security. Other government agencies must be informed of any compromise affecting their interests. Agency heads must establish procedures for coordination with legal counsel in cases of formal disciplinary action for unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Criminal violations requiring prosecution should involve coordination with the Department of Justice and agency legal counsel. ISOO must be notified in cases involving congressional oversight, public attention, large amounts of classified information, or systemic security weaknesses. The most recent intelligence community directives related to safeguarding classified information are ICD 700, 701, and 703, effective from 2007 to 2013. Damage assessments for unauthorized disclosures are governed by ICD 732 from 2014. ICD 700 integrates counterintelligence and security functions to protect national intelligence and strengthen deterrence against insider threats. Under ICD 701, Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community (SOICs) must promptly report any unauthorized disclosure of classified information that could harm national security to the Director of National Intelligence and law enforcement. This includes disclosures to foreign entities, potential media leaks, and loss of resources or capabilities. Loss or compromise of classified information that poses a risk to human life, indicative of systemic compromise, storage media or equipment, discovery of surveillance devices, revealing intelligence operations or impairing foreign relations, disclosures affecting US national security, revealing intelligence sources or methods. SOICs must promptly report any unauthorized disclosure meeting these criteria. The SOIC is required to report any unauthorized disclosure meeting specific criteria to the DNI and other relevant authorities. The report must include details such as the scope of the disclosure, potential risks to national security, and corrective actions taken. Additionally, SOICs must identify factors contributing to the compromise of classified information and make recommendations to the DNI. The policy on handling unauthorized disclosures of classified information and serious security incidents is outlined in a document dated October 27, 2014. Detailed procedures for specific types of compromised information can be found in DOD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3, Enclosure 6, dated February 24, 2012. In the event of a known or suspected disclosure, DOD component heads must promptly investigate and determine the extent of damage to national security, taking appropriate corrective action. If the investigation reveals criminal or counterintelligence implications, coordination with relevant authorities is required. The policy outlines procedures for handling unauthorized disclosures of classified information and security incidents. Security inquiries must be completed within 10 duty days and aim to determine the details of the incident, including if classified information was compromised and the classification level of the information. In cases involving the public media, specific details of the compromised information must be identified. The policy outlines procedures for handling unauthorized disclosures of classified information and security incidents. In cases involving the public media, factors for determining whether to initiate an additional investigation include the accuracy of the information disclosed and the potential damage caused by the compromise. The policy outlines procedures for handling unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the public media. Factors for determining whether to initiate an additional investigation include the accuracy of the information disclosed, damage to national security, compromises regarding sensitive aspects of classified projects, and the extent of information circulation within and outside the Department of Defense. The responsible DOD component prepares a \"DOJ Media Leak Questionnaire\" for submission to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. The Chief, Internal Security Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice requires prompt and full addressing of eleven questions regarding unauthorized disclosures of classified information in the media. This includes identifying the source, specific classified statements, accuracy of information, origin of the information, circulation, prior official release, clearance sought, background data availability, and potential use in criminal prosecution. The State Department's information security is governed by specific regulations, with responsibilities divided between the Bureau of Administration and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Senior agency officials oversee the information security program, while supervisors and individual employees are responsible for safeguarding classified material. Employees with access to classified material must maintain its security and report security incidents to the appropriate officer. The incident is then evaluated and adjudicated by the Diplomatic Security (DS) department, with further actions taken if necessary. Investigations into classified information loss or unauthorized disclosure are handled by the Professional Responsibility Division of the Office of Investigations and Counterintelligence. If there is a \"media leak\" of classified information, the originating agency conducts an initial investigation. The manual outlines procedures for handling unauthorized disclosure of classified information, including initial investigations by the originating agency and potential prosecution by the DOJ. There are statutory provisions addressing protection of classified information, but no blanket prohibition on unauthorized disclosure. The Espionage Act prohibits transmission of national defense information with specific intent. The federal law imposes penalties for unauthorized disclosure of classified information, including fines and imprisonment. Penalties increase for transmitting information to foreign agents or revealing codes and intelligence. Unauthorized disclosure of classified information can result in imprisonment for up to 15 years, with penalties increasing for revealing covert agents' identities. Additionally, individuals engaging in activities to expose covert agents can face up to three years in prison. The executive branch also employs various measures to prevent unauthorized disclosures. The executive branch uses administrative measures like disciplinary action and security clearance revocation to deter unauthorized disclosures by government personnel. Violators may face monetary penalties and loss of retirement pay. Employees are required to sign non-disclosure agreements and submit materials for review before publishing. The Supreme Court upheld the government's imposition of a constructive trust on profits from a book published by a former CIA employee without agency review. The Espionage Act allows for forfeiture of property derived from offenses, and violators of the Atomic Energy Act may face civil penalties. Injunctions can be used to prevent information disclosures, as seen in a case where a court upheld an injunction against a former employee. The Supreme Court upheld the State Department's revocation of passports for persons planning to expose U.S. covert intelligence agents. E.O. 13526 outlines procedures for declassification of information, allowing its release to individuals without security clearance. Leaks involve releasing classified information to individuals without clearance, often to journalists. High-profile leaks in 2012 raised concerns about \"instant declassification\" and disclosure of classified information to journalists. The processes for declassification outlined in E.O. 13526 do not account for the informal \"instant declassification\" of information when there is an immediate need. Critics highlight a double standard in handling classified information within the Executive Branch, where legal action is taken against newspapers for publishing classified information while senior officials may authorize disclosures to journalists. The Government's legal system takes action against newspapers and individuals like Daniel Ellsberg for leaking classified information, while top Executive officials use \"instant declassification\" to strategically leak information. E.O. 13526 does not address informal procedures for releasing classified information. The E.O. 13526 does not address what happens in the event of an authorized disclosure of classified information. Classified information is designated based on potential damage to national security, suggesting that authorized disclosures may be allowed if no harm is expected. The order does not explicitly provide authority to release classified information outside of declassification, but discretionary authority may exist to release information without formal declassification. Part 4 of E.O. 13526 focuses on safeguarding classified information to prevent unauthorized access. Agency heads must establish controls to ensure protection of classified information, including oral dissemination. Leaks approved by agency heads could breach their responsibilities under the Order. Heads who approve leaks may breach their responsibilities under E.O. 13526. There is a provision for emergency disclosure of classified information in response to imminent threats, with strict guidelines to minimize disclosure and report promptly. This provision may impact the selected release of classified information to reporters. The Attorney General has prosecutorial discretion to choose which leaks to prosecute, but successful prosecution for disclosing classified information may be difficult due to the high scienter requirement. The Espionage Act of 1917, for example, necessitates proof of intent or reason to believe in the disclosure. The Espionage Act of 1917 requires proof of intent or reason to believe in the disclosure of classified information, with knowledge of the information being classified potentially enough to show damage to national security. However, if the disclosure was authorized by someone with the authority to make such determinations, it may serve as a defense against prosecution. The disclosure of classified information may serve as a defense against prosecution if authorized by someone with the authority to do so. Executive branch policy treats official disclosures as declassifying events, while non-attributed disclosures do not affect the classification status of the information. The Department of Defense instructs officials not to confirm or deny the accuracy of classified information in the media. If the disclosure was properly authorized, no further action may be necessary. The disclosure of classified information, if properly authorized, may not require further action. Documents containing such information may still be classified, and disclosure to the media must be reported to congressional intelligence committees as per the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2013 requires reporting to congressional intelligence committees on authorized disclosures of classified information to distinguish between authorized disclosures and unauthorized leaks. The provision was made permanent in the Intelligence Authorization Act for 2014, with reports apparently classified. President Obama also issued Executive Order 13587 in October 2011 for structural reforms to improve the security of classified networks. President Obama issued Executive Order 13587 in October 2011, establishing an interagency Insider Threat Task Force to develop a Government-wide program for deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats and safeguarding classified information. This program includes policies, objectives, and minimum standards for agencies to implement their own insider threat programs. The 112th Congress passed measures to address unauthorized disclosures of classified information, including requiring the Defense Department to establish a program for insider threat mitigation. This program utilizes technology-based solutions and a governance structure to enhance security measures. The Senate Intelligence Committee's bill, S. 3454 (112th Cong.), aimed to address the disclosure of classified information by federal employees, particularly to the media. Opposition led to the removal of several measures, including restrictions on media access to government officials. One eliminated measure was a prohibition on security-cleared individuals from providing analysis or commentary to the media on classified intelligence activities or national security. The Senate Intelligence Committee's bill aimed to address the disclosure of classified information by federal employees to the media. Measures were removed, including restrictions on media access to government officials. One eliminated measure was a prohibition on security-cleared individuals providing analysis or commentary to the media on classified intelligence activities or national security. Additionally, the bill revisited the insider threat issue in the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2016. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2016, passed as Division M of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, added a requirement for agencies to establish an \"enhanced personnel security program\" to include various data sources in security clearance reassessments. This program integrates information from government, commercial, and social media sources, with random automated record checks required at least twice within a five-year period for covered individuals. The deadline to implement the enhanced personnel security program is five years after enactment or when the backlog of overdue reinvestigations is cleared, as determined by DNI."
