It is shown that with certain activation function assumptions, the length process converges to a simple function of weight and bias variances and the activation function as the network width increases. The convergence of the length process in a fully connected deep network may fail for certain activation functions. The convergence of the length process in a fully connected deep network may fail for certain activation functions, contradicting claims made in previous studies. Section 5 presents simulation experiments verifying these findings and illustrating the dependence among hidden node values. The analysis considers a wider variety of parameters and uses weaker assumptions, extending previous research on the properties of hidden representations in neural networks. In a deep fully connected network with D layers and width-N, neural activity vectors and preactivations are computed using standard equations. Parameters are chosen randomly, and the limit is defined based on fixed input and function. In a deep fully connected network with D layers and width-N, neural activity vectors and preactivations are computed using standard equations. Parameters are chosen randomly, and the limit is defined based on fixed input and function. The length map of hidden nodes in a deep network is characterized for activation functions meeting specific assumptions. The activation function must be permissible, ensuring boundedness on finite intervals, exponential decay as |x| increases, and measurability. This allows for the computation of key integrals, leading to well-defined real numbers. Theorem 2 states that the length map of hidden nodes converges in probability. The proof utilizes the weak law of large numbers. Lemma 4 shows conditions for permissible \u03c6. Lemma 5 demonstrates small changes in \u03c3 lead to small changes in Gauss(0, \u03c3^2). Lemma 5 (see BID7) states that small changes in \u03c3 result in small changes in Gauss(0, \u03c3^2). The proof of Theorem 2 involves technical lemmas and induction, showing convergence of hidden node lengths. The proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths. The proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths. In the inductive step, outcomes of previous layers are conditioned on, and randomness is only considered in the current layer. Each hidden node is obtained by a dot-product operation and addition of an independent term. The hidden nodes are independent and have identical Gaussian distributions. The randomness in the current layer is determined by outcomes before it, making it a fixed, nonrandom quantity. The proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths. In the current layer, randomness is a fixed, nonrandom quantity. The key consequence is that for the inductive step, q needs to be close to its mean. The goal is to prove a similar result for r. By choosing appropriate parameters, we can bound r. Conditioning on an event of probability at least 1 - \u03ba only changes the distribution by a small amount. In this section, the proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths. The hidden variables are sometimes not Gaussian, and the proof refers to the Cauchy distribution. The proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths, which are sometimes not Gaussian and refer to the Cauchy distribution. The distribution over the reals is defined with a density function, and it is shown that certain variables are not independent. The proof involves induction and conditioning on random choices to show convergence of hidden node lengths, which are sometimes not Gaussian and refer to the Cauchy distribution. The components of x 1,: are independent due to the structure of the neural network, and the components of W 2,:,: and x 1,: are mutually independent. The Heaviside and ReLU functions are used to calculate the difference in the context of the proof. The proof involves showing convergence of hidden node lengths using induction and conditioning on random choices. The Heaviside and ReLU functions are used in the context of the proof. For the Heaviside function, the distribution of x 1,: is uniform. The recursive formula defining the length map breaks down for \u03c6 at the boundary of the second condition in the definition of permissibility. The Cauchy(0, \u221a N ) distribution fits the data well, showing that values in the second hidden layer are not independent. When some values in the first hidden layer are small, values in the second layer tend to be large, contrary to previous claims. This is consistent with Theorem 2 on convergence in probability for permissible \u03c6, although the \u03c6 used in this experiment is not permissible."
