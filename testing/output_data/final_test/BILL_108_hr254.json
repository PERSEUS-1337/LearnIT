SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT. The Secretary of the Treasury must annually submit a report to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations regarding the North American Development Bank.

The report to be submitted annually by the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the North American Development Bank should include details on certified but unfunded projects, the bank's capital and its uses, efforts to expand project types and improve effectiveness, and projects authorized under the Water Conservation Investment Fund. The report on the North American Development Bank should include details on certified but unfunded projects, the bank's capital and its uses, efforts to expand project types and improve effectiveness, and projects authorized under the Water Conservation Investment Fund. The Congress supports NADBank projects financing water conservation for Texas irrigators and agricultural producers in the Lower Rio Grande River Valley. The Congress finds that Texas irrigators are facing hardships due to Mexico's failure to abide by the 1944 Water Treaty, resulting in a significant water debt. Studies show that water savings can be achieved through irrigation system improvements. The North American Development Bank has created a Water Conservation Investment Fund as required by Minute 308 of the treaty. The Water Treaty signed by the US and Mexico in 2002 allocated $80 million for water conservation projects. Congress supports funding for water conservation projects through the North American Development Bank. Congress supports funding for water conservation projects in the lower Rio Grande River Valley to assist Texas irrigators and agricultural producers. Congress also supports United States backing for NADBank projects financing water conservation in Southern California. The Congress supports NADBank projects for water conservation in Southern California and other eligible areas in the US border States, including development of water conservation projects and new water supply research along the Mexico border. This includes desalination of ocean seawater and brackish groundwater, as well as managing resulting brines. The Congress supports NADBank projects for water conservation in the Southwest United States, including financing water conservation for irrigators and agricultural producers. The Congress finds that irrigators and agricultural producers in the southwest United States are facing significant hardships due to one of the worst droughts in history. Despite water conservation efforts, irrigated agriculture still uses over 60% of water. The Southwest has the most inadequate water supplies in the US, with 70% of water taken from streams not being returned. The North American Development Bank created a Water Conservation Investment Fund with $80,000,000 for water conservation projects in the US and Mexico. The North American Development Bank should support water conservation projects for irrigators and agricultural producers in border states, considering the needs of all states and striving to fund projects in each state. The Congress urges the North American Development Bank to finance projects addressing coastal and air pollution issues along the US-Mexico border."
