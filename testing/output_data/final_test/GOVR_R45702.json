Funding for CJS has increased since FY2014, with the Department of Commerce experiencing the most significant reduction in appropriations. Funding for DOJ and NASA also decreased, while NSF funding remained steady. Overall, CJS funding has increased since FY2014 due to more discretionary funding allowed under the BCA.

Additionally, there have been steady increases in funding for DOJ (+11.5%), NASA (+21.8%), and NSF (+12.6%) due to higher discretionary spending caps. Funding for NOAA also increased by 41.0%.
