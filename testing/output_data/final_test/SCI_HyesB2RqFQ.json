    "content": "The paper investigates the relationship between HMMs and RNNs, exploring architectural transformations and empirical hybridization to determine if HMMs are a special case of RNNs. Key design factors such as independence assumptions, softmax placement, and non-linearity are analyzed to understand their effects. A comprehensive empirical study is presented to shed light on the interplay between expressivity and interpretability in these models. Sequence modeling has been a core research problem in machine learning and AI, with Hidden Markov Models being a widely used approach. HMMs assume a sequence of latent variables to generate observed variables, allowing for interpretability through contextual clustering. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Networks offer a different approach to sequence modeling. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) both model hidden representations for sequential data. HMMs recover contextual clustering of output variables, while RNNs assume continuous latent representations. Despite differences, both models share key components like a state at time t, transition function, and emission function. The relationship between HMMs and RNNs is explored, questioning if HMMs could be a special case of RNNs. In this paper, the relationship between HMMs and RNNs is investigated through architectural transformations, theoretical derivations, and empirical hybridization. The forward marginal inference for an HMM can be reformulated as equations for computing an RNN cell. Three key design factors are explored to understand their empirical effects. Different transition and emission cells are indicated for each model. Our work investigates the relationship between HMMs and RNNs, focusing on architectural transformations and empirical hybridization. Key design factors such as using sigmoid linearity in the recurrent cell and unnormalized output distribution matrix in emission computation are found to improve HMM performance. The paper explores the relationship between HMMs and RNNs, highlighting architectural transformations and empirical hybridization. Key design factors, such as using sigmoid linearity in the recurrent cell and unnormalized output distribution matrix in emission computation, improve HMM performance. The rest of the paper delves into the derivation of HMM marginal inference as a special case of RNN computation, gradual transformation of HMMs into RNNs, and the reverse transformation of Elman RNNs back to HMMs. Empirical analysis is provided to examine the effects of varying design choices on the hybridization between HMMs and RNNs. Related work is discussed, and the paper concludes with a summary. The paper discusses the relationship between HMMs and RNNs, focusing on architectural transformations and empirical hybridization. It explores how the computation in HMMs can be viewed as updating a hidden state at each time step, similar to RNNs. The distribution of hidden states and emission distribution are defined, leading to the derivation of HMM marginal inference as a special case of RNN computation. The paper discusses the relationship between HMMs and RNNs, focusing on architectural transformations and empirical hybridization. Inference for HMMs is performed with the forward-backward algorithm, which is equivalent to differentiating the forward algorithm. The forward probabilities are defined recurrently, and the model is trained with end-to-end minibatched SGD training.

Inference for HMMs is performed with the forward-backward algorithm, which is equivalent to differentiating the forward algorithm. The forward probabilities are defined recurrently, and the model is trained with end-to-end minibatched SGD training. The equations in the current chunk show how to rewrite equations using vectorized computations and recurrent neural network steps. The emission step computes the output next word probability in Elman RNN with tied embeddings and a sigmoid non-linearity. By relaxing the independence assumption of the HMM transition probability distribution, the model can capture more complex interactions between the fed word and the hidden state. Tensor-based methods increase the number of parameters significantly, leading to a proposed additive version for gating-based feeding. The proposed model introduces a gating mechanism for interaction control and uses unnormalized embeddings in the feeding step. This approach enhances the expressiveness of Hidden Markov Models by delaying normalization and emission softmax computations, effectively replacing them with Recurrent Neural Network computations. The proposed model enhances Hidden Markov Models by using unnormalized embeddings and a gating mechanism for interaction control. It replaces normalization and emission softmax computations with Recurrent Neural Network computations, making it closer to an Elman RNN. The proposed model enhances Hidden Markov Models by using unnormalized embeddings and a gating mechanism for interaction control. Towards an HMM, Elman networks can be made more similar by incorporating HMM emissions and modifying the Elman cell for multiplicative integration. The curr_chunk discusses small architectural changes to HMMs and Elman cells, exploring the effects quantitatively through a language modeling benchmark. The focus is on normalization within recurrence and independence assumptions during emission, with a comparison between RNNs and HMMs using one-layer models and a budget of 10 million parameters. The HMM models perform worse than the Elman network in a language modeling benchmark, despite having more expressivity. The gated feeding model stands out by performing substantially better. The gated feeding model outperforms HMM models in a language modeling benchmark. Using a sigmoid non-linearity before the output of the HMM cell improves performance, and combining it with delaying the emission softmax gives a substantial improvement. Replacing the sigmoid non-linearity with the softmax function in Elman RNNs leads to a drop in performance, but still performs better than HMM variants. Normalizing the hidden state output before applying the emission function performs somewhat worse than using softmax non-linearity. The non-linearity in the emission function performs worse than softmax non-linearity. A neural bigram model outperforms these approaches. Replacing the RNN emission function with an HMM leads to even worse performance. Using multiplicative integration leads to a small drop in performance. Preliminary experiments suggest the second transformation matrix is crucial for performance. In experiments, the second transformation matrix is crucial for the Elman network's performance. An LSTM slightly outperforms the Elman network. HMM bottlenecks force interpretable hidden representations. Changes in model architecture may affect their ability to discover syntactic properties. Models' predicted tag distribution at each time step is analyzed to evaluate this. The HMMs errors preserve tag-tag patterns of the language, unlike RNNs. Accuracy is computed for predicting word tags in the sequence. Tag distributions are computed for words in the Penn Treebank training set, and tagging accuracy is evaluated. Viterbi decoding in HMM allows for computing tag probabilities. The Viterbi decoding in HMM allows for computing tag probabilities based on distributed models' representations. Different model types show varying performance based on the conditioning of hidden states. Recent research has introduced simpler variants of gated RNNs that compete with LSTMs and offer improved interpretability. In recent work, neural models have been proposed for learning interpretable structures, such as a mixture of softmax model and neural hidden Markov models. This study investigates the hybridization of HMMs and RNNs, exploring factors like independence assumptions and the placement of softmax in the models. The study explores the use of nonlinearity in HMMs, showing that using a sigmoid instead of softmax in the recurrent cell and an unnormalized output distribution matrix improves performance. HMM outperforms other RNN variants in a POS tag prediction task, highlighting the benefits of models with discrete bottlenecks for interpretability."
