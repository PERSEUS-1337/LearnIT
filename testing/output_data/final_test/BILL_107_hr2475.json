The Secretary pays half of revenues from the Fund to coastal States annually, based on their attributable interest. Boundaries between States are determined 200 miles offshore, following judicial decrees or international law principles. Before receiving funds under this subsection, each coastal State must enact legislation to provide permits for onshore facilities supporting offshore oil or gas development. Failure to do so will result in funds not being disbursed, and the Secretary will consider this before offering additional leases. Coastal counties within the State will receive half of the revenues from the Fund at the same time as the coastal States. The Secretary shall pay coastal counties half of the revenues and interest earned from the Fund, based on delineated lateral boundaries 200 miles seaward. Boundaries follow existing county boundaries and lease lines, prioritizing size consistency. The coastal county's share of funds is determined by a formula considering its coastline and population compared to the state's total. Before receiving funds, each coastal county must enact a statute or ordinance annually. Each coastal county must annually enact legislation to provide permits for onshore facilities supporting offshore oil or gas development. Failure to do so will result in funds not being disbursed, and the Secretary will consider this before offering additional leases. Coastal States must use funds for administrative costs, environmental projects, and natural resources as determined by the State. Each coastal county must allocate funds to local communities based on proximity to the coast, withholding funds from communities that fail to issue permits for onshore facilities supporting offshore oil or gas development. The Secretary, in consultation with coastal State Governors, designates coastal counties for the Act's purposes. Boundaries set under section 5 are only for this Act."
