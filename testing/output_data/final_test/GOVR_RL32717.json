    "content": "The United States Constitution mandates that each state appoint electors for President and Vice President as directed by its legislature. Congress has set Election Day as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November every fourth year. Since 1887, Congress has delegated the responsibility of resolving election disputes to the states. If a state reaches a final decision on election controversies at least six days before the electors meet, federal law requires that decision to be honored. The governor of each state must send a certificate of the appointment of electors to the Archivist of the United States by December 13, 2016, for the electors to vote on December 19, 2016. This is required by federal law and ensures a final determination before the electors meet. On December 19, 2016, the electors of each state meet to cast their votes for President and Vice President of the United States. They must make and sign six certificates of their votes, containing two distinct lists for each position. The certificates are sealed and certified by the electors as the official votes. The electors meet on December 19, 2016, to cast their votes for President and Vice President. They must make and sign six certificates of their votes, send one to the President of the Senate, two to the secretary of state of their state, and two to the Archivist of the United States. If no certificates are received by December 28, the President of the Senate is directed to request the state's secretary of state to forward the certificates. The process of counting electoral votes involves the Archivist of the United States transmitting certificates from governors to Congress, with the date set for January 6 unless changed by law. In case of a Sunday, the date can be adjusted, as seen in the example of January 6, 2013, being changed to January 4, 2013. The electoral votes are counted in a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives. The joint session for counting electoral votes convenes at 1:00 p.m. in the House chamber, with the President of the Senate presiding. Certificates of electoral votes from states and the District of Columbia are presented in alphabetical order, read by tellers, and transmitted to the President of the Senate and the Archivist of the United States. During the joint session, certificates of electoral votes are read by tellers appointed from the House and Senate. The tellers record and count the votes from each state and the District of Columbia. During the joint session, the votes of each state and the District of Columbia are read and counted by tellers. The presiding officer then announces if any candidates have received the required majority votes for President and Vice President. The process can be expedited if no controversy is expected, as seen in the 1997 joint meeting. During the joint session, the Vice President opens certificates showing the votes of electors in each state and the District of Columbia. The tellers then read, count, and announce the results. The process typically takes around 24 minutes, as seen in 2013. The winning candidate must receive a majority of the electoral votes counted by the tellers, as required by the 12th Amendment. In 1873, an exception occurred when President Ulysses S. Grant was announced as having received a majority of the electoral votes. President Ulysses S. Grant received a majority of the electoral votes, despite some votes not being counted from Arkansas and Louisiana. He won with 286 out of 352 electoral votes, or potentially 364 if the contested votes were included. In contrast, in 1865, only two out of three Nevada electors cast their votes. In a joint session, only two out of three Nevada electors cast their votes, which were not included in the \"whole number of electoral votes.\" This issue has occurred in the past, affecting the majority needed to elect a candidate. If electoral votes are not available for counting, the joint session may need to address how this impacts the majority of Electors appointed. Title 3 of the U.S. Code governs the conduct of the joint session. Section 16 of Title 3 governs the conduct of joint sessions, ensuring expeditious completion of business. It mandates the session to continue until the count is completed and limits recesses if the process becomes time-consuming. Section 18 prohibits debate and most questions, with the President of the Senate tasked to maintain order. During a joint session on January 6, 2001, Vice President Albert A. Gore, Jr. ruled on objections to electoral votes from Florida, stating that debate was not allowed without unanimous consent. He also required written endorsement for parliamentary motions and declined a point of order due to lack of endorsement from both chambers. The statute dictates that only House motions to withdraw can be put forth by the presiding officer. The statute allows for objections to electoral votes, requiring them to be in writing and signed by a Senator and a Representative. During a joint session on January 6, 2001, the presiding officer intervened to prevent speeches disguised as objections.

During a joint session on January 6, 2001, the presiding officer intervened to prevent speeches disguised as objections. When an objection is received, each house meets separately to debate and vote on it. The joint session is suspended while each house considers the objection and votes on whether to count the votes in question. Both houses must agree to the objection for it to be upheld. The 1887 law allows for objections to electoral votes, requiring them to be in writing and signed by a Senator and a Representative. In 1969, an objection was made when an elector from North Carolina voted differently than expected. Both chambers voted separately to reject the objection, and the challenged electoral vote was counted as cast. This procedure has been invoked twice since the law was enacted.

Both chambers voted separately to reject the objection, and the challenged electoral vote was counted as cast. This procedure has been invoked twice since the law was enacted. A \"faithless\" elector from a state that binds electors by law to vote for a specific candidate has not been addressed by Congress or the courts. In 2005, objections were raised regarding voting irregularities in Ohio, but the objections were ultimately rejected by both the House and Senate. In 1969 and 2005, objections to electoral votes were handled with a two-hour debate limit, where each Member could speak once for up to five minutes. The presiding officer was responsible for putting the main question without further debate. The Speaker in the House alternated recognition between supporters and opponents of the objection. Members could yield time to each other during debate, and unanimous consent requests to insert material in the Congressional Record were entertained. In 1969, the Senate agreed to control debate time by granting one hour each to majority and minority leaders, allowing them to yield five minutes to Senators. In 2005, objections to electoral votes were handled with a two-hour debate limit. The general grounds for objection to counting electoral votes include irregularity in the vote or certification of the elector. The process for rejecting electoral votes involves ensuring that votes are regularly given by lawfully certified electors, with the option for both houses to reject votes that do not meet these criteria. Congress may question the lawfulness of certification under state law, particularly regarding the objections of votes not being regularly given or electors not being lawfully certified. In 1969, a \"faithless elector\" was lawfully certified by the state, but the objection was that the vote was not regularly given. In a 2005 case, objections were based on electoral votes not being regularly given. The statute of 1887 addressed concerns about two lists of electors and votes from the same state. Three contingencies were provided for in the statute for two lists being presented. The 1887 statute addressed concerns about two lists of electors from the same state. Three contingencies were provided for in the statute for two lists being presented, determining which set of electors should be counted based on state authorities' determinations. The 1887 statute addressed concerns about two lists of electors from the same state, providing contingencies for determining which set of electors should be counted based on state authorities' determinations. The statute states that when the two chambers disagree, the votes of the electors certified by the governor of the state shall be counted, but it is unclear if this applies only in certain situations. The state's election contest law dictates that if only one slate of electors is determined in a timely manner, Congress must accept that determination as conclusive. Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives suggests that if a state resolves the matter six days before the electors' meeting, any controversy over elector appointments in that state shall not be a concern.

Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives suggests that any controversy over elector appointments in a state resolved six days before the electors' meeting \"shall not be a cause of question in the counting of the electoral vote by Congress.\" Precedent subsequent to the statute's original enactment in 1887 has been sparse, with only one example in 1961 involving Hawaii's certification of electors for Vice President Nixon and subsequent recount determining Senator Kennedy as the winner. In December, votes were cast for President and Vice President, with the recount completed on December 28. Vice President Nixon suggested accepting Senator Kennedy's certification to avoid delays in counting electoral votes. Congress established a timetable to prevent delays like the 1876 electoral vote controversy. If no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives decides the election. The election is decided by the House of Representatives for President and the Senate for Vice President if no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes. The process is detailed in CRS Report RL32695."
