Congress finds that alcohol is the most widely used and abused drug by young people in the US, despite being illegal for those under 21. High school and college students show high rates of alcohol consumption, with many engaging in binge drinking. The average age of alcohol initiation is 13, with a significant percentage starting at a young age. By age 13, around 30% of boys and 22% of girls consider themselves drinkers. A study from 1988 showed that a significant number of high school seniors had been drunk by eighth grade, with the percentage increasing each year. Research indicates that alcohol use before age 15 is a predictor of later heavy substance use. Many young people lack awareness of the risks of alcohol, with only 43% of high school seniors believing in the harm of binge drinking. According to research, a significant percentage of high school seniors do not perceive heavy drinking as risky, with a large number of students not seeing weekend binge drinking as a concern. The Department of Health and Human Services highlights the influence of alcohol sponsorships and promotions on college campuses in creating a pro-drinking environment. The costs of treating fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol-related birth defects in the US are estimated to be nearly a third of a billion dollars. According to research, fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a preventable birth defect with mental retardation as a consequence. The incidence of FAS is higher among children born to heavy-drinking women, with an estimated 25 per 1,000 live births. Other alcohol-related birth defects have an incidence three times greater than FAS. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that 18 million adults in the US have alcohol-related problems, with 4.5 million young people being dependent on alcohol or problem drinkers. Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives-- Nearly half of all deaths from motor vehicle crashes are alcohol-related, and alcohol is implicated in nearly half of all fatal intentional injuries. Victims are intoxicated in approximately one-third of all homicides, drownings, and boating deaths. An estimated 25% of all hospitalized persons have alcohol-related problems. Alcohol advertising, especially in broadcast media, is a significant source of alcohol education in the US. The Association Foundation for Traffic Safety highlights the impact of exposure to beer advertising on individuals' drinking behaviors. A 1981 study funded by the government found a significant link between youth exposure to alcohol ads and problematic drinking habits. A 1988 survey revealed that a majority of adults believe alcohol advertising influences underage drinking. The survey shows that the public believes young people in the US are most at risk from alcohol advertising. The alcoholic beverage industry spends $2 billion annually on advertising. Recommendations include balancing alcohol ads with health messages and including health warnings in all alcohol advertising. The National Commission on Drug-Free Schools recommends Congress take action towards a drug-free generation. The public supports health warnings on alcohol products and advertising, with a potential ban on alcohol promotion targeting youth. Surveys show strong favor for health messages in alcohol ads. Alcohol combined with other drugs is a major cause of emergency room visits for drug abuse. According to the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the average binge drinker is a 16-year-old male in the 10th grade who started drinking at 12 years old. A third of students do not understand the effects of alcohol, with over 2.6 million unaware of the potential fatal overdose risk. In 1989, chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, was the 9th leading cause of death in the US, with 46% of liver disease deaths linked to alcohol. Heavy alcohol use is a significant risk factor for chronic liver disease, with approximately 46 percent of liver disease deaths associated with alcohol. Alcohol consumption is also linked to hypertension, with 5 to 24 percent of cases being alcohol-related. Additionally, alcohol abuse increases the risk of certain cancers, such as liver, esophagus, nasopharynx, and larynx cancer. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. HEALTH WARNINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the information provided in the previous paragraph about the health risks associated with heavy alcohol use, including chronic liver disease, hypertension, and certain cancers.
