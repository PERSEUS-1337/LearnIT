The resolution sets spending levels for government health programs over 10 years and includes two health care-related reserve funds. The FY2013 House budget resolution includes instructions for reconciliation to six committees for deficit reduction. It suggests health care-related policy changes but separate legislation would be needed for actual modifications. The budget resolution provides a framework for other legislation but does not establish specific spending levels or become law. The CBO analyzed Chairman Ryan's budget proposal for its long-term budgetary impact, using additional details provided by the House Budget Committee. The analysis did not include an official cost estimate for potential legislation implementing the proposal, but suggested changes to Medicare and Medicaid structure. The report summarizes Chairman Ryan's FY2013 budget proposal, which includes changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs, repeal of ACA provisions, and changes to medical malpractice tort law. The analysis is based on the Concurrent Resolution, committee report, \"Path to Prosperity\" report, and CBO analysis. Medicare is a federal insurance program covering health services for individuals 65 and older or permanently disabled under 65. In FY2012, it will cover 50 million people at a cost of $576 billion, about 3.6% of GDP. CBO estimates federal Medicare spending at $492 billion. Medicare spending in FY2012 is estimated to be about $492 billion, accounting for 13.7% of total federal spending. It is an entitlement program that covers services for eligible individuals. The program has four parts, with Part A funded mainly by a 2.9% payroll tax. Medicare Part B covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. It is funded through beneficiary premiums and general revenues. Enrollment is voluntary, with over 90% of beneficiaries choosing this option. Medicare Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, is a private plan option that covers all Part A and B services except hospice. It is funded through both the HI and SMI trust funds. About 25% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Part C. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits, funded through the SMI trust fund with beneficiary premiums. High-income enrollees pay higher premiums, while low-income enrollees may receive assistance. Enrollment is voluntary, with about 60% of eligible beneficiaries enrolled. Parts C and D involve private insurers being paid a monthly amount to provide services. The Medicare program, established in 1965, has evolved over the years. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) made changes to Medicare, including modifying provider reimbursements and enhancing benefits. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects Medicare outlays to be around $6.6 trillion over the next 10 years. The House budget resolution suggests slightly lower outlays compared to CBO's baseline. The proposed budget suggests additional reductions in Medicare spending on top of existing scheduled reductions. It also includes a repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) created by the ACA, which is estimated to cost $3.1 billion over 10 years. No specific program changes were proposed to achieve the targeted Medicare spending reduction over the next decade. The repeal of IPAB in the proposed budget would cost $3.1 billion over 10 years. The budget also includes provisions to fix the Medicare physician payment formula for the next 10 years, reducing Medicare spending as a portion of GDP in 2023. Starting in 2023, the budget proposal would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare. The budget proposal aims to gradually increase the age of eligibility for Medicare to 67, starting in 2023. This would involve converting the current Medicare defined benefits program to a fixed federal contribution. The \"Path to Prosperity\" document and House report provide more details on suggested changes, but separate legislation would be needed for implementation. The Ryan budget proposal suggests that individuals who become eligible for Medicare starting in 2023 can choose between enrolling in a private insurance plan or a traditional fee-for-service option through a new Medicare exchange. These plans must offer standard benefits equivalent to traditional Medicare and accept all applicants regardless of age or health status. All plans, including fee-for-service, would go through an annual competitive bidding process to determine subsidy amounts. The Medicare subsidy amount would be determined through a competitive bidding process, with beneficiaries paying a higher premium if they choose a plan with a higher bid. Rebates would be given if the plan's bid is lower than the second lowest bid. Payments to plans would be adjusted based on geography and health status, with fees imposed on plans enrolling either low-risk or high-risk beneficiaries. In 2023, the Medicare proposal includes a $7,500 premium subsidy on average. High-income individuals will receive reduced premium support, while low-income beneficiaries will have a dedicated savings account for healthcare costs. Program cost growth will be controlled through competitive bidding, limiting annual premium support increases to nominal GDP growth plus 0.5%. If costs exceed this, beneficiaries will pay increased premiums, with Medicaid covering out-of-pocket expenses for dual-eligibles. Under the premium support model, Medicaid covers out-of-pocket expenses for dual-eligibles, with additional funding in savings accounts for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. By 2030, 39% of Medicare beneficiaries would be enrolled in this system, increasing to 91% by 2050. Average spending per beneficiary is expected to increase at a slower rate, with net federal Medicare spending as a share of GDP projected to grow from 3.25% in 2011 to 4.75% in 2050. Supporters of converting the current Medicare system to a premium support model argue that it would set a limit on federal spending, incentivize cost control, and add price incentives for consumers. However, opponents express concerns about increased out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly, potential benefit coverage erosion, and reduced access to healthcare services. They also argue that the proposal does not address the main reason for the growth in Medicare spending - excessive costs in the healthcare delivery system. The impact of proposed Medicare changes on the federal government, beneficiaries, and health care plans would depend on the design and implementation of a premium support system. Decisions would need to be made regarding financing parts of Medicare through premium subsidies, voluntary nature of Parts B and D, beneficiary premiums based on expected costs, and other administrative details. The costs of Part A are now premium free for most enrollees. Decisions need to be made about Medicare Advantage options after 2023, financial risk mitigation for private plans in exchanges, and designing an administrative structure for traditional Medicare and new exchange options. Medicaid is a means-tested program jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states, covering 67 million people in FY2012 with federal payments estimated at $275 billion. Each state administers its own Medicaid program under federal rules, leading to variability in eligibility, services, and delivery. The ACA brings changes to Medicaid, including mandatory provisions and optional expansions. The proposed budget aims to expand Medicaid eligibility for individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level, reducing federal outlays by $810 billion over 10 years. This would result in a 17.6% reduction in federal Medicaid spending from FY2013 to FY2022. Long-term analysis shows a 76% to 78% lower combined federal spending for Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies by FY2050. Chairman Ryan's proposal aims to significantly reduce federal spending on Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies, with Medicaid and CHIP spending projected to comprise 1.25% of GDP by 2023. The ACA's Medicaid provisions represent a major reform, including raising income eligibility levels, adding benefits, and increasing federal matching payments. The ACA includes major Medicaid reform provisions such as raising income eligibility levels and increasing federal matching payments. One policy option in the House Budget Committee report suggests repealing the Medicaid expansion and restructuring Medicaid into a block grant program with limited details available. The House Budget Committee report suggests restructuring Medicaid into a block grant program to make federal spending more predictable and give states more flexibility in program design. This could potentially reduce the cost burden on states by removing certain federal requirements. However, the implications would depend on how states respond to the change, with potential efficiency gains but also challenges in maintaining current Medicaid programs due to significant federal spending reductions. States may struggle to maintain current Medicaid programs due to potential federal spending reductions. This could lead to constraints on Medicaid expenditures, affecting provider reimbursement rates, benefit packages, and eligibility. These changes may impact access to and quality of medical care for Medicaid enrollees. The private health insurance market consists of three segments: large group, small group, and individual markets, each offering different insurance products and subject to varying regulatory standards. State regulators traditionally oversee private insurance, but federal requirements complicate regulation. ACA's provisions aim to expand federal standards, increase coverage access, and provide establishment grants for state-based programs. The ACA aims to increase access to health insurance coverage through various provisions, including subsidies for lower-income individuals, establishment of state-based exchanges, and funding for targeted groups like those with preexisting conditions. These costs are offset by reduced public spending and increased taxes. Other provisions focus on regulating private insurance, such as reviewing premium increases and mitigating risk. The House Budget Committee report includes a reserve fund for repealing ACA provisions, specifically targeting the exchange subsidies. The estimated savings from repealing these subsidies and other related funding is over $800 billion over 10 years. This would affect premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, and grants to states for establishing exchanges. The savings estimate includes grants to states for exchanges, high-risk pools, funding for non-profit health organizations, and payments for risk adjustment and reinsurance. Congressional attention has focused on medical malpractice during crisis periods in the mid-1970s, mid-1980s, and early 2000s due to insurance premium increases and difficulties in coverage availability. Public policy measures were implemented at state and federal levels to address market disruptions. The overall medical liability insurance market is currently stable, but issues with affordability and availability persist, especially for certain regions and specialties like obstetricians. Concerns about medical malpractice claims lead to defensive medicine practices, increasing healthcare costs. The malpractice system also faces challenges with equity and access, including criticism for compensating patients harmed by malpractice and deterring substandard care. The budget proposal assumes reforms to tort law governing medical malpractice, including a cap on awards for noneconomic damages and deterrents to frivolous lawsuits. It also includes changes such as allowing individuals to buy health insurance across state lines, expanding consumer-directed health plans, and providing employees with the option to use their employer's health coverage contribution toward other coverage options."
