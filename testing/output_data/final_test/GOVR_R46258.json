    "content": "The Latin American and Caribbean region has seen significant political and economic development over the past four decades, with most countries now being elected democracies. However, challenges remain, with some countries experiencing setbacks, notably Venezuela descending into dictatorship. Three countries in the region - Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela - are ruled by authoritarian governments. In 2019, several countries in Latin America held successful elections, but some faced controversy. Guatemala's elections were judged successful but marred by disqualifications. Bolivia's elections had severe irregularities, leading to protests and the resignation of President Evo Morales. Guyana's elections in March 2020 faced fraud allegations. Six Caribbean countries are scheduled to hold elections. Several Caribbean countries are set to hold elections in 2020. Despite improvements in political rights and civil liberties since the 1980s, challenges persist in delivering public services, ensuring accountability, and maintaining citizen safety. Past presidents have faced social turmoil, economic crises, and corruption scandals leading to resignations or removals. In recent years, the quality of democracy in Latin America has declined, with civilian governments turning to their militaries for support during crises. President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador used the military to pressure the legislature, sparking criticism for politicizing the military and undermining the separation of powers. The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2019 democracy index shows a regional decline in democratic practices since 2017, with Venezuela joining Cuba as an authoritarian regime in 2017. The quality of democracy in Latin America has declined in recent years, with authoritarian practices seen in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Guatemala, Haiti, and Guyana. Public satisfaction with democracy has also decreased, according to a 2018/2019 AmericasBarometer survey. The 2018/2019 AmericasBarometer survey revealed a 39.6% average satisfaction with democracy among 18 countries in the Americas, the lowest since 2004. Social protests erupted in various countries due to unique circumstances like fuel price increases in Ecuador, social inequities in Chile, and opposition to government policies in Colombia. Broad political and economic factors are driving the decline in democracy satisfaction in the region. The region's declining satisfaction with democracy is influenced by political factors such as authoritarian practices, weak institutions, corruption, and organized crime, as well as economic factors like stagnant growth, income inequality, and poverty. Global economic factors, including declining commodity prices and China's economic slowdown, have also impacted the region's economy. The IMF reported a 0.6% economic contraction in Latin America in 2016 due to recessions in Argentina and Brazil, and Venezuela's economic decline. Growth remained marginal, with a 0.2% rate in 2019. The region's 2020 outlook predicts 1.6% growth, driven by Brazil's recovery and growth in Chile, Colombia, and Peru. However, the COVID-19 outbreak may jeopardize this forecast. Argentina and Venezuela were already facing recession before the pandemic. The recession is forecasted to continue in Argentina and Venezuela, with contractions of 1.3% and 10% respectively. Social unrest could also constrain growth in some countries. Income inequality in Latin America has slowed since 2015, making it the most unequal region in the world. Poverty levels have increased over the past five years, with 30.8% of the population living in poverty in 2019. U.S. interests in the region include economic, political, security, and humanitarian concerns due to strong economic linkages. The United States has strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, being a major trading partner and source of foreign investment. Free-trade agreements have enhanced economic relations with 11 countries in the region. Immigration from the Western Hemisphere to the U.S. is influenced by geographic proximity and economic and security conditions. Curbing illicit drug flow from the region has been a key focus for the U.S. for over four decades, with drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine posing risks to public health and safety. Colombia has been a recipient of U.S. support since 2000. Since 2000, Colombia has received U.S. counternarcotics support through Plan Colombia and its successor programs. The United States has also worked with other countries to combat drug trafficking and violence through initiatives like the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. U.S. policy has focused on promoting democratic governance and the rule of law in the region. The Trump Administration has diverged from past policies in Latin America by adopting a confrontational approach, especially on immigration. The State Department's framework for engagement in the region focuses on economic growth, security, and democratic governance, but actions sometimes contradict this stance. The Trump Administration's approach in Latin America has been marked by antagonistic statements on immigration, trade, and foreign aid. Negative views of U.S. leadership in the region have increased during this administration. Proposed foreign aid budgets were cut significantly, but Congress provided more assistance in appropriations. In 2019, aid to Central America was withheld to reduce migrant flows. President Trump also ordered U.S. withdrawal from proposed trade agreements in 2017. In 2017, President Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) FTA and criticized NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. Renegotiations led to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018, including updates on digital trade and industries. Relations with Mexico have been strained by anti-immigrant rhetoric. Migration issues have strained relations with Mexico due to anti-immigrant rhetoric, changes in border and asylum policies, and the end of the DACA program. Mexico agreed to accept non-Mexican migrants under the Migrant Protection Protocols, and President Trump threatened tariffs on Mexican motor vehicles. In response to migration issues, Mexico agreed to increase enforcement actions and allow more U.S.-bound asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. Despite tensions, U.S.-Mexico relations remain friendly with strong energy and economic ties, including the USMCA, and close security cooperation on drug interdiction. The Administration's actions on immigration, such as terminating Temporary Protected Status designations, have caused concern in the region. Unauthorized migration from Central America's Northern Triangle countries continues to be a challenge. The Trump Administration implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy towards illegal border crossings and restricted access to asylum at the U.S. border to deter migration from Central America's Northern Triangle countries. Aid cuts and threats of tariffs were used to compel these countries to curb unauthorized migration. Safe third country agreements were negotiated in 2019. In November 2018, John Bolton warned about \"the destructive forces of oppression, socialism, and totalitarianism\" in Latin America, referring to Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela as the \"troika of tyranny.\" The Trump Administration imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela, including sanctions against the state oil company. In January 2019, the Trump Administration recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president of Venezuela and invoked the Rio Treaty with other countries to address the crisis. The administration is providing humanitarian aid to Venezuelans in Colombia and inside Venezuela. Additionally, economic sanctions have been imposed on Cuba for its human rights violations and support for the Maduro government. The Trump Administration recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president of Venezuela in January 2019 and invoked the Rio Treaty to address the crisis. Economic sanctions have been imposed on Cuba for human rights violations and support for the Maduro government. The State Department cut U.S. Embassy staff in Havana in 2017 due to unexplained injuries. Targeted sanctions have been employed against individuals in Nicaragua linked to human rights abuses or corruption. Congress plays an active role in policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean. The 116th Congress completed action on foreign aid appropriations for FY2019 and FY2020, exceeding the Administration's requests by almost $600 million. They also enacted legislation for the USMCA in January 2020, retaining many NAFTA provisions and adding new provisions for the auto and dairy industries. Congress is now considering the Administration's FY2021 foreign aid request. The USMCA trade agreement, which was amended before final congressional approval in January 2020, addressed concerns related to labor, the environment, dispute settlement procedures, and intellectual property rights. Congress also supported sanctions against the Maduro government in Venezuela and provided humanitarian assistance to Venezuelan migrants. The VERDAD Act of 2019 was enacted in December 2019 to address the situation in Venezuela. In legislative actions related to Venezuela, the House passed bills authorizing humanitarian assistance, restricting exports, and countering Russian influence. Additionally, provisions in the FY2020 NDAA prohibit the DOD from contracting with businesses linked to the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Section 1265 of the FY2020 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to contract with an independent institute to assess resources for U.S. commands in the Western Hemisphere. The assessment includes identifying investments by China, Iran, Russia, or other adversarial groups that threaten national security. A report is due to Congress within one year. Section 1266 requires a report on the human rights climate in Brazil and U.S.-Brazilian security cooperation. Section 1267 mandates certification before transferring vehicles to Guatemala. Section 1268 necessitates an analysis of human rights in Honduras. Section 5522 calls for an assessment of drug trafficking in Central America and Mexico. The House and Senate approved bills promoting economic partnership with Mexico and foreign assistance to Central America to address migration root causes. The Senate approved resolutions supporting democratic principles in Bolivia and commemorating the 1994 bombing in Argentina. Congressional committees have held oversight hearings on various issues in the region. The United States provides foreign assistance to Latin American and Caribbean nations to support development and strategic interests, including combating illicit narcotics. The Trump Administration has refocused assistance efforts to address domestic concerns like irregular migration and transnational crime, leading to cuts in aid to the region. In 2019, the Trump Administration redirected $405 million in foreign aid meant for Central America to other priorities. The proposed FY2020 budget requested $1.2 billion for the region, a $503 million (30%) decrease from the previous year. This would have cut funding for various types of assistance and reduced aid for most Latin American and Caribbean countries. The Inter-American Foundation would have been eliminated under the Administration's budget proposal. The Trump Administration redirected $405 million in foreign aid from Central America in 2019. The FY2020 budget proposed a $503 million (30%) decrease for the region, cutting funding for various assistance types. The budget also aimed to eliminate the Inter-American Foundation. For FY2021, the Administration requested $1.4 billion for the region, 18% less than Congress appropriated for FY2019. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 included $1.69 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean, surpassing the Trump Administration's request by nearly $600 million. The FY2020 foreign aid appropriations bill was not enacted before the start of FY2020, leading to two continuing resolutions funding programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provided significant funding for key U.S. initiatives in Central America, Colombia, and Mexico. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provides funding for U.S. initiatives in Central America, Colombia, and Mexico. It includes $519.9 million for Central America, $448.3 million for Colombia, $157.9 million for Mexico, and $37.5 million for the Inter-American Foundation. Resolutions have been introduced to commend the Inter-American Foundation. The Inter-American Foundation is being commended in resolutions for its 50th anniversary and contributions to development. Latin America and the Caribbean play a significant role in U.S. counternarcotics policy due to drug trafficking. Mexico's opium poppy cultivation and heroin production are of concern in addressing the opioid epidemic in the United States. An increase in opium poppy cultivation and heroin production, along with the inclusion of fentanyl, is a major concern for U.S. policymakers. The majority of heroin seized in the U.S. comes from Mexico, which has seen a rise in cocaine usage as well. While countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Peru work closely with the U.S. to combat drug production, Venezuela's government does not cooperate, leading to easier smuggling of illicit drugs. Illicit drug trafficking in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Central America, contributes to high levels of violence and homicide. Weak criminal justice systems, overwhelmed law enforcement agencies, and government corruption hinder efforts to combat the drug trade. There is a widespread perception that U.S. demand for illicit drugs is a major factor in the region's crime and violence problems. Criminal gangs like MS-13 and \"18th Street\" gang from southern California are causing high levels of violence in Central America, particularly in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Gangs are involved in various criminal activities such as extortion, money laundering, and weapons smuggling, fueling unauthorized migration to the United States. U.S. policy has focused on countering drug trafficking in the region for over 40 years, with programs like Plan Colombia providing support. The largest support program in Latin America and the Caribbean, Plan Colombia, provided over $10 billion to help Colombia combat drug trafficking and rebel groups. After signing a peace accord with FARC, the US supported Colombia in implementing the agreement, including restarting aerial fumigation of coca crops. US assistance in combating drug trafficking and reducing crime also involved partnerships with other countries in the region through initiatives like the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative, CARSI, and CBSI. The Trump Administration has shifted focus in Latin America and the Caribbean towards combating drug trafficking and criminal groups, reducing funding for security assistance programs. Concerns about unauthorized migration have led to withheld or reduced assistance to Central America. President Trump has welcomed Mexico's help with migration enforcement. President Trump has prioritized combating gangs like MS-13 and has welcomed Mexico's assistance on migration enforcement. The Administration warned that without further progress, Mexico could face cuts in U.S. foreign assistance. U.S. agencies, with support from vetted units in Central America, have brought charges against thousands of MS-13 members. Congressional hearings have been held on these issues. The 116th Congress has focused on opioids, corruption in the Americas, and U.S. assistance to Central America. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided increased resources for Colombia and Mexico, slightly less funding for CARSI, and stable funding for the CBSI. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provides more security and rule of law funding for Colombia and Mexico, less funding for CARSI, and slightly more funding for the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission. The FY2020 NDAA requires an assessment of drug trafficking activities in Mexico and the Northern Triangle. It also establishes a Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking to report on the scale of opioids coming from Mexico. The Latin American and Caribbean region is a significant trading partner for the United States, with strong economic relations despite challenges like threats to withdraw from NAFTA and high violence levels in some countries. The US accounts for a large portion of the region's merchandise imports and exports, with Mexico being a key trading partner. In 2019, the United States had strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean, with most trade conducted with Mexico. The total U.S. merchandise exports to the region were valued at $418.9 billion, while imports were valued at $467.0 billion. The U.S. has six FTAs in force with 11 Latin American countries, starting with NAFTA in 1994. The United States has established FTAs with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region, influencing future trade agreements on various issues. Additionally, the US has extended unilateral trade preferences to some countries in the region through trade preference programs, such as the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act and preference programs for Haiti. The United States has trade agreements with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Trade preference programs like the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) provide duty-free tariff treatment to eligible countries. Talks for a trade agreement between the US and Brazil are underway, signaling a shift in South American economies' stance on comprehensive FTAs with the US. The United States has trade agreements with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region, including the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Talks for a trade agreement between the US and Brazil are underway, indicating a shift in South American economies' approach to comprehensive FTAs with the US. President Trump prioritized NAFTA renegotiation and modernization, viewing FTAs as harmful to U.S. workers and industries. The US, Canada, and Mexico renegotiated NAFTA, leading to the conclusion of negotiations for USMCA. Mexico ratified the USMCA agreement in June 2019 and approved the amended version in December 2019. The agreement addressed concerns on labor, environment, IPR, and dispute settlement provisions. Congress approved the agreement on January 16, 2020, with Canada expected to ratify it soon. The USMCA retains NAFTA's market opening provisions and introduces changes in labor, environment, market access for autos and agriculture, and new provisions on digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and currency misalignment. All parties must ratify the agreement and implement laws to meet their USMCA commitments. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from certain countries, adding challenges to U.S. trade relations with the region. Mexico retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products. Argentina and Brazil were exempt from steel tariffs temporarily, but faced threats of tariffs again in December 2019. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, leading to retaliatory tariffs from Mexico on 71 U.S. products worth $3.7 billion. By May 2019, Mexico was exempt from the tariffs, and the TPP-11 agreement was signed by several countries, excluding the U.S. Colombia plans to join the agreement in the future. The 116th Congress approved USMCA implementing legislation, H.R. 5430, with strong bipartisan support. Lawmakers ensured that the Administration followed U.S. trade negotiating objectives and procedures as required by Trade Promotion Authority. Some Members of Congress discussed issues related to the USMCA, including labor and environment provisions, access to medicine, economic effects, and impacts on U.S. industries such as the auto industry. Legislation was introduced to extend CBTPA benefits, and concerns were raised about the impact of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. Energy reform in Mexico and its implications for U.S. trade and investment were also topics of interest. Trade and investment in energy remain of interest to Congress, with policymakers considering the perception of U.S. trade policy in the region and its impact on multilateral trade issues. Concerns also arise regarding U.S. market share in Latin America and the Caribbean, as liberalization efforts by countries in the region may lead to increased intra-trade with China and other Asian countries, potentially affecting U.S. exports. Latin America's status as a leading source of both legal and unauthorized migration to the United States significantly affects U.S. immigration policies and relations with countries in the region. U.S. immigration policy changes, including ending TPS designations, have concerned Latin American countries. The Trump Administration has taken various actions affecting immigration policies in Latin America, including ending TPS designations, rescinding DACA, and restricting asylum access. They implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) to return migrants to Mexico for immigration proceedings, facing legal challenges. \"Metering\" requires migrants to wait in Mexico for processing at ports of entry. Asylum cooperative agreements were signed with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras for transferring migrants seeking asylum to apply in those countries. Migrants arriving at the U.S. border seek asylum due to various factors like poverty, instability, and violence in Latin America. Venezuela has become a top origin country for asylum seekers. Migrant apprehensions at the southwest border had been declining but began to rise in mid-2017, with 977,509 apprehended in FY2019, an increase from FY2018. In FY2019, there were 977,509 migrants apprehended at the U.S. border, with a significant increase from FY2018. Unaccompanied children and families from the Northern Triangle seeking asylum made up the majority of apprehensions. The Trump Administration's policies strained relations with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, leading to agreements on sheltering migrants and increased immigration enforcement efforts. DHS is considering sending Mexican asylum seekers to Guatemala, despite Mexico's opposition. In FY2019, amidst U.S. foreign aid cuts and tariff threats, the Northern Triangle countries signed \"safe third country\" agreements despite concerns. DHS began implementing the agreement with Guatemala, but not yet with Honduras and El Salvador. Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries worry about overwhelming capacity to receive migrants. Central American countries fear increased removals of criminals could worsen security issues. The 116th Congress provided foreign assistance to address migration factors from Central America and support Mexico's migration management efforts in FY2019. In FY2019, the 116th Congress provided foreign assistance to address migration factors from Central America and support Mexico's migration management efforts. The House passed bills affecting individuals from Latin America and the Caribbean, including the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 and the Venezuela TPS Act of 2019. In December 2019, the House passed H.R. 5038, creating a new temporary immigration status for agricultural workers. This legislation would allow certain unauthorized agricultural workers to become Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs). For more information on related topics, refer to CRS reports on Central American migration, Mexico's immigration control efforts, and the Trump Administration's immigration enforcement policies. The Caribbean region consists of 16 independent countries and 18 overseas territories, including both wealthy and impoverished nations. It includes 13 island nations from the Bahamas to Trinidad and Tobago, Belize in Central America, and Guyana and Suriname in South America. The United States-Caribbean Strategic Enhancement Act of 2016 led to the submission of a multiyear strategy by the State Department. The State Department submitted a multiyear strategy for the Caribbean in 2017, focusing on six priority areas: security, diplomacy, prosperity, energy, education, and health. The State Department's multiyear strategy for the Caribbean, issued in July 2019, highlighted efforts to combat infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS. Limited budgets and resources have hindered deeper relations, but funding for the security pillar has led to significant engagement and results. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was launched in 2009 to address drug trafficking and violent crime in the region. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) is a program aimed at reducing drug trafficking and enhancing public safety in the region. Congress allocated nearly $677 million for the CBSI from FY2010 to FY2020, benefiting 13 Caribbean countries. The program focuses on five key areas: maritime and aerial security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border/port security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. Additionally, the United States launched the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) in 2014 to promote a cleaner and more sustainable energy future in the Caribbean. The Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) aims to promote a cleaner and more sustainable energy future in the Caribbean by attracting investment in energy technologies, improving governance, increasing access to finance, and enhancing coordination among energy stakeholders. Many Caribbean countries are vulnerable to extreme weather events like hurricanes, which can have a significant impact on their economies and infrastructure. Hurricane Dorian in September 2019 caused widespread damage in the Bahamas, with the United States providing nearly $34 million in humanitarian assistance, including $25 million from USAID. The State Department launched the U.S.-Caribbean Resilience Partnership to increase disaster response capacity. USAID provided $10 million for local disaster resilience in the Caribbean. The 116th Congress has allocated funds for Caribbean regional programs, surpassing Trump Administration's requests. Congress appropriated $58 million for the CBSI in FY2019 and not less than $60 million in FY2020. The Administration is requesting a $32 million budget for the CBSI in FY2021, a 47% cut from FY2020. Congress has allocated $2 million for the CESI in FY2019 and $3 million in FY2020. Bilateral economic assistance is directed towards strengthening resilience to emergencies and disasters in the Caribbean. Political and economic developments in Cuba have been a concern for Congress since the Cuban revolution in 1959. Current President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro in 2018, with Castro expected to lead the Communist Party until 2021. In February 2019, almost 87% of Cubans approved a new constitution in a national referendum, which includes the addition of an appointed prime minister and limits on the president's tenure. The new Cuban constitution includes the appointment of a prime minister, limits on the president's tenure and age, and market-oriented economic reforms. Despite minimal economic growth, the economy is projected to contract in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions and Venezuela's economic crisis. The economic crisis in Venezuela has impacted support to Cuba, leading to a decline in tourism and hurting Cuba's private sector. US policy towards Cuba has involved economic sanctions, with a shift towards engagement under the Obama Administration in 2014. President Trump unveiled a new policy towards Cuba in 2017. President Trump changed US policy towards Cuba in 2017, imposing new sanctions and reversing Obama's efforts to normalize relations. By 2019, the Trump Administration increased economic sanctions to pressure Cuba on human rights and support for the Maduro regime in Venezuela. This included allowing lawsuits for confiscated property, tightening travel restrictions, and ending cruise ship travel and flights to Cuban cities. The 116th Congress continued funding for democracy assistance for Cuban activists. The 116th Congress has continued to fund democracy assistance for Cuban human rights activists and U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba. For FY2019, $20 million was appropriated for democracy programs and $29.1 million for Cuba broadcasting. In FY2020, $20 million was allocated for democracy programs and $20.973 million for Cuba broadcasting. The Administration's FY2021 request includes $10 million for Cuba democracy programs and $12.973 million for Cuba broadcasting, representing significant declines from the previous year. Congress has debated U.S. sanctions on Cuba, with some bills introduced to ease or lift them. Several bills introduced in the 116th Congress aim to ease or lift U.S. sanctions on Cuba, including legislation related to baseball, trade, financing for U.S. agricultural exports, the overall embargo, and travel. Additionally, there are resolutions expressing concerns about Cuba's foreign medical missions, U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba, religious and political freedom in Cuba, and the release of human rights activists. The House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security, and Trade held a hearing on the human rights situation in Cuba in September 2019. During President Jovenel Mo\u00efse's administration in Haiti, there has been political and social unrest, high inflation, and gang violence. Investigations are ongoing regarding Mo\u00efse's potential involvement in money laundering and embezzlement. Ending oil subsidies in 2018 led to widespread protests, and allegations of embezzlement have further destabilized the government since May 2019. Mass demonstrations in Haiti continue, demanding an end to corruption, government services, and President Mo\u00efse's resignation. Despite calls for dialogue with the opposition, Mo\u00efse refuses to step down. Political instability is worsened by the failure to form a government, with multiple prime ministers resigning or not being confirmed by the legislature. President Mo\u00efse is ruling by decree in Haiti as parliamentary elections have been postponed indefinitely. The terms of the legislature expired in January 2020, leaving no functioning government. Mo\u00efse appointed a new prime minister by decree in March 2020, amidst ongoing dialogue facilitated by international organizations. The Vatican and international organizations are working to establish a functioning government in Haiti amid political impasse. The Trump Administration supports the efforts but emphasizes the importance of not delaying elections. Haiti has received significant U.S. aid, especially after the 2010 earthquake, but assistance has been declining. The country is facing challenges such as drought, hurricanes, and a cholera epidemic. The U.N. has been present in Haiti since 2004, transitioning from peacekeeping to a political office in 2019. The Integrated Office in Haiti aims to promote human rights and advise the government on political stability. The Haitian National Police has improved with international support, but still falls short of international standards. The Haitian National Police (HNP) has 14,000-15,000 officers, below international standards for the country's population, and is underfunded. The U.N. has reported human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. The Trump Administration's FY2020 aid request for Haiti was $145.5 million, a 25% reduction from FY2019. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 includes provisions for aid to Haiti, with conditions on assistance to the Haitian central government. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provides funding for various initiatives in Haiti, including strengthening the rule of law, combating corruption, and resolving commercial disputes. It allocates $51 million for Development Assistance, with $8.5 million for reforestation and $10 million for prison assistance. The act also prohibits funding for Haiti's armed forces and Congress is considering a 34% cut in foreign aid for Haiti in FY2021. Mexico and the United States have a strong border relationship with economic and security ties. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, leader of the MORENA party, became Mexico's president in December 2018 with a focus on anti-corruption efforts. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico's president from the MORENA party, was elected on an anti-corruption platform. He aims to combat corruption, build infrastructure in southern Mexico, revive the state oil company, and address citizen security through social programs. Despite fiscal constraints, his goals are questioned for attainability. L\u00f3pez Obrador enjoys high approval ratings, despite challenges like record homicides and economic stagnation in 2019. His support for new social programs, minimum wage increases, and efforts to tackle issues like oil theft have been praised. Critics have raised concerns about L\u00f3pez Obrador centralizing power, weakening institutions, and dismissing dissenting voices. Despite this, U.S.-Mexico relations have remained friendly, with tensions over trade disputes, immigration, border security, and Mexico's neutrality on Venezuela. The Mexican government has condemned anti-immigrant actions in the U.S., including the El Paso mass shooting. The Mexican government has accommodated most of the Trump Administration's border and asylum policy changes, including efforts to address drug trafficking. L\u00f3pez Obrador's administration achieved U.S. congressional approval for the USMCA trade agreement. The 116th Congress recommended modifications to the proposed USMCA, leading to an amendment signed by the three countries on December 10, 2019. The House and Senate approved implementing legislation for the USMCA in December 2019 and January 2020 respectively. Both houses also took action on H.R. 133, the United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act, focusing on enhancing economic cooperation and exchanges with Mexico. The FY2020 NDAA requires a classified assessment of trafficking in Mexico, and in FY2019, Congress provided foreign aid. In FY2019, Congress provided $162 million for Mexico in foreign aid, with a focus on the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative to address U.S.-bound opioids. For FY2020, Congress allocated $150 million for the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative, $73 million above the Administration's request. The Administration's FY2021 request for Mexico is $63.8 million, a 61% decrease from FY2019. Congressional concerns about U.S.-Mexican security cooperation have risen following recent massacres in Mexico.

The Southwest border has seen a surge in unauthorized migrants from Central America, many seeking asylum due to insecurity, poverty, and unemployment in the region. The Obama Administration initiated efforts to improve security, governance, and prosperity in Central America. The U.S. provided over $2 billion in aid to Central America between FY2016 and FY2018, with a focus on El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Aid was withheld until the Northern Triangle governments addressed border security, corruption, and human rights issues. The Trump Administration suspended most aid in March 2019 due to continued migration flow, leading to project closures and canceled activities. The Trump Administration reprogrammed $405 million of aid for the Northern Triangle to other priorities in 2019. They negotiated \"safe third country\" agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, sending individuals to apply for protection in those countries. Previously suspended assistance has been released. The Trump Administration has released previously suspended assistance for programs to counter transnational crime and improve border security in Central America. For FY2021, they are requesting almost $377 million for the region if countries take action to stem unauthorized migration. The 116th Congress has shown support for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America but has reduced funding for the initiative. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provides $519.9 million for the Central America strategy, $75 million more than requested by the Trump Administration. Congress has maintained conditions on U.S. assistance to the Northern Triangle governments and sought to improve the strategy's effectiveness through oversight hearings and the United States-Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 allocated $519.9 million for the Central America strategy, with additional funding for the Northern Triangle. Congress introduced various measures to combat corruption and improve security in the region, including the Central America Reform and Enforcement Act and the Northern Triangle and Border Stabilization Act. P.L. 116-94 provides $45 million to combat corruption in Central America. Congress allocated $3.5 million to the OAS-backed Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH). Honduran President allowed the MACCIH's mandate to expire in January 2020. P.L. 116-94 also includes $20 million for combating sexual and gender-based violence in the region, as well as funding for human rights offices in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

It also requires an independent analysis of human rights in Honduras. Other measures in the 116th Congress address corruption and human rights in Central America. President Daniel Ortega, aged 74 in early 2020, has been suppressing popular unrest in Nicaragua in a manner reminiscent of Anastasio Somoza, the dictator he helped overthrow in 1979 as a leader of the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Ortega served as president from 1985 to 1990, during which time the United States backed right-wing insurgents known as contras in an attempt to overthrow the Sandinista government. In the early 1990s, Nicaragua transitioned to democratic governance, but democratic space has since narrowed under the control of the FSLN and President Ortega. Ortega, who reclaimed the presidency in 2007, has faced growing opposition due to his authoritarian actions, triggering protests in 2018. The Nicaraguan government's repressive response to widespread protests resulted in hundreds of extrajudicial killings, torture, and political imprisonment. The crisis also caused economic contraction, with the economy shrinking by 5.1% in 2019. International efforts have been made to hold the government accountable for human rights abuses and restore democracy in Nicaragua. The Trump Administration has imposed sanctions on high-level officials in Nicaragua for human rights abuses. Dialogue between the government and the opposition collapsed in 2019. The 116th Congress remains concerned about democracy and human rights abuses in Nicaragua, allocating $10 million for foreign assistance programs. The House approved $10 million for democracy and civil society programs in Nicaragua to support the people's peaceful efforts for democracy and human rights. The resolution aims to increase political and financial pressure on the Ortega government. In October 2019, the center-left Peronist Frente de Todos (FdT) ticket won the presidential election in Argentina, defeating the incumbent President Mauricio Macri. The election also brought back former leftist Peronist President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner as vice president. Macri's economic policies and Argentina's economic decline were major factors in his electoral defeat. In 2018, Argentina faced economic pressure from a severe drought and budget deficits, leading to IMF support with a $57 billion program. Despite President Macri's reforms, the economy continued to decline, prompting the government to reimpose currency controls. President Fern\u00e1ndez now grapples with a recession, high poverty, and unsustainable public debt, aiming to restructure by March 2020. Measures like a food program and price controls target inflation and poverty. U.S. relations with Argentina were strong under Macri, with increased engagement. Relations with Argentina were strong under the Macri government, focusing on bilateral, regional, and global issues. The United States expressed interest in working with the Fern\u00e1ndez administration for regional security and prosperity. One point of contention could be Argentina's stance on Venezuela, with Macri being critical of Maduro's regime while Fern\u00e1ndez does not recognize Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's interim president. Maduro's actions in January 2020 prevented Guaid\u00f3 from being elected for a second term as head of the legislature. Congress has appropriated $2.5 million in aid for Argentina for FY2018-FY2020 to support counterterrorism and law enforcement capabilities. Concerns have been raised about bringing those responsible for the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires to justice, with Iran and Hezbollah allegedly linked to the attack. The 25th anniversary of the AMIA bombing was commemorated in July 2019, with resolutions passed by the House and Senate expressing condemnation of the attack and support for accountability.

Interim President A\u00c3\u00b1ez announced her intention to run in the upcoming presidential election. Senator Jeanine A\u00f1ez declared her intention to run in the May presidential election, abandoning her earlier pledge to preside over a caretaker government focused on credible elections. Critics had accused A\u00f1ez of overstepping her mandate by reversing MAS foreign policy positions and charging Morales and other officials with sedition. The Trump Administration supported A\u00f1ez's government, praising its actions against Cuban and Venezuelan officials. In January 2020, President Trump waived restrictions on U.S. assistance to Bolivia, with a team assessing election support. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the situation. Members of the 116th Congress have expressed concerns about the situation in Bolivia, focusing on ensuring a democratic transition. In April 2019, S.Res. 35 expressed concern over Morales's attempts to circumvent term limits and called for fair elections. In January 2020, the Senate passed S.Res. 447, urging the Bolivian government to protect human rights, convene new elections, and ensure electoral integrity with the help of the U.S. State Department and the OAS. Brazil, the fifth-largest and fifth-most populous country in the world, has struggled with economic and political challenges despite its potential as a world power. The economy fell into a record recession in 2014, with slow recovery since 2017. Political instability has also been a concern due to a corruption investigation implicating politicians. Since 2014, Brazil has faced a corruption investigation implicating politicians, leading to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. President Bolsonaro, who took office in 2019, has focused on socially conservative and security policies, as well as economic reforms. However, his confrontational governance style has hindered policy enactment, raising concerns among Brazilians and international observers about his environmental policies. Bolsonaro's environmental policies are causing increased deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and his attacks on the press and NGOs are weakening democracy. His foreign policy focuses on closer ties with the United States, supporting Trump on various issues. Brazil has shifted from its traditional autonomy in foreign affairs, adopting a pragmatic approach on commercial ties with China. In 2019, Brazil was designated as a major non-NATO ally by President Trump. President Trump designated Brazil as a major non-NATO ally, granting privileged access to the U.S. defense industry. Agreements were signed to strengthen bilateral commercial ties, despite concerns over import restrictions on Brazilian beef and threats of tariffs on steel. The 116th Congress continues to support environmental conservation efforts in Brazil, with a focus on the Amazon rainforest. The 116th Congress is focusing on preserving the Amazon rainforest amidst fires and deforestation. Legislative proposals include a Senate resolution expressing concern and calling for stronger environmental enforcement in Brazil, as well as the Act for the Amazon Act which proposes bans on certain imports and military engagements. Congress allocated $15 million for foreign assistance programs in the Brazilian Amazon, including funds to address fires. In the Brazilian Amazon, Congress allocated $5 million to address fires, an increase from previous appropriations. Concerns have been raised about democracy, human rights, and security cooperation with Brazil. Calls have been made for changes to U.S. policy, including rescinding Brazil's designation as a major non-NATO ally and suspending assistance. The United States is considering rescinding Brazil's major non-NATO ally status and suspending assistance to Brazilian security forces. Colombia is a key U.S. ally in Latin America, with a strong partnership focused on counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts. Plan Colombia laid the foundation for this security cooperation over the past two decades. Juan Manuel Santos focused on concluding a peace accord with the FARC, Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla organization. The peace accord was ratified by Congress in November 2016, leading to the demobilization of approximately 13,200 FARC members in 2017. Iv\u00e1n Duque, a critic of the peace accord, won the 2018 presidential election and faced protests over his administration's approach to peace accord implementation. Colombia continues to grapple with peace and security challenges. Colombia faces challenges in implementing the peace accord, including coca cultivation, attacks on activists, and difficulties enacting commitments. President Duque struggles to build a coalition for reforms, while a FARC splinter faction has returned to arms. Venezuela may be sheltering FARC dissidents and ELN guerrilla fighters. The ELN, Colombia's largest insurgency, is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Some former FARC fighters have returned to armed struggle, with potential cooperation with the ELN. Despite risks, most demobilized FARC members support the peace process. Coca cultivation remains a challenge, with record levels in 2017. Drug yields slightly decreased in 2018, but estimates vary. President Duque and Secretary of State Pompeo reaffirmed a commitment to combat drug production in 2019. In 2019, the U.S. and Colombian governments reaffirmed their commitment to reduce coca crop expansion and cocaine production by 50% by 2023. President Duque plans to restart forced aerial eradication using glyphosate, a controversial strategy in U.S.-Colombian counterdrug cooperation. Some analysts argue that voluntary eradication and alternative development programs are more effective in combating drug production in Colombia. Colombia's economy grew by 2.6% in 2018 and is estimated to have grown by 3.1% in 2019, with projections of continued growth above 3% in the coming years. The country remains one of the strongest major economies in the region.

Congress appropriated over $10 billion for Plan Colombia and its follow-on programs between FY2000 and FY2016, with about 20% funded through DOD. Additional assistance of $1.2 billion annually was provided for Colombia from FY2017 through FY2019, including DOD funding. For FY2020, $448 million was allocated for State Department and USAID-funded programs in Colombia. The Administration has requested $412.9 million for Colombia in FY2021, a slight decrease from FY2019. Venezuela is in a deep crisis under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's authoritarian rule. Juan Guaid\u00f3, recognized as interim president by the US and 57 other countries, has been unable to remove Maduro from power. Guaid\u00f3 seeks to form a transition government until internationally observed elections can be held. Maduro remains in power despite efforts to remove him. National Assembly elections may offer a way out of the stalemate. Venezuela's economy has collapsed, leading to hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and electricity blackouts. Economic mismanagement and corruption are key factors in the crisis. Many observers blame economic mismanagement, corruption, and sanctions for Venezuela's economic crisis. U.N. agencies report 4.8 million Venezuelans have fled the country. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Venezuelan officials and the Maduro government, supporting interim president Guaid\u00f3. Other countries, including the EU, Canada, and 11 Western Hemisphere countries, have also imposed sanctions. The EU, Canada, and 11 Western Hemisphere countries have imposed targeted sanctions on Maduro officials, opposing military intervention in Venezuela. The Trump Administration supports a political solution leading to free and fair elections in 2020, but international efforts have not been successful. The focus is on convening elections overseen by a negotiated transitional government, a requirement that Maduro may not accept. The Trump Administration has provided significant humanitarian and development assistance to Venezuela, including $472 million since FY2017. This includes $56 million for humanitarian relief activities in Venezuela and support for countries hosting Venezuelan refugees. The U.S. military has deployed a naval hospital ship to the region twice. In October 2019, an agreement was signed with the Guaid\u00f3 government for $100 million in development assistance.

Trade issues include extending tariff preference programs for Caribbean countries and developing nations worldwide. The region also grapples with Venezuela's political crisis and upcoming elections in Bolivia following President Morales's resignation due to electoral fraud protests. Morales resigned due to electoral fraud protests in October 2019, sparking social unrest in Latin America. The challenges and U.S. policy responses to ongoing political situations in Haiti, Nicaragua, drug trafficking from South America, migrant flow from Central America, and Cuba policy remain oversight issues for Congress in 2020."
