    "content": "Hurricane Katrina, Rita, and Wilma struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, causing widespread devastation and loss of life. The storms resulted in federal disaster declarations for affected areas. Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 led to federal disaster declarations. Research shows that substance abuse and mental health issues often worsen post-disaster, with effects lasting for years. Challenges included extensive victim relocation, loss of medical records, and healthcare worker shortages. New Orleans now has fewer psychiatric beds post-Katrina, despite a greater need. In 1974, Congress enacted the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which includes Section 416 providing federal assistance for mental health needs after disasters. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) was established to help victims, with programs like Project Heartland in Oklahoma after the 1995 bombing. New York also established a CCP program after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. Following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, New York established Project Liberty, a CCP program to assist victims in the greater NYC area. CCP programs were also established in 29 states in response to Hurricane Katrina. One year later, 17 states requested program extensions to help victims with mental illness. The objective of CCP is to help disaster victims understand normal behavioral responses, identify when intervention is needed, and locate follow-up services. The CCP program, established in response to disasters like Hurricane Wilma, aims to refer victims needing medical treatment to existing service systems. Concerns persist about the unmet mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of disaster victims, despite federal assistance programs. Calls for investigations were prompted by questions raised about the effectiveness of Project H.O.P.E in targeting victims and addressing their mental health needs. The report discusses CCP and other programs by SAMHSA to provide federal assistance for mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of disaster victims. Issues with CCP's services and effectiveness are analyzed, along with the implementation of other SAMHSA disaster mental health programs. Relevant policy issues in ensuring provision of mental health and substance abuse treatment are also discussed. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is the lead federal agency providing assistance for mental health and substance abuse treatment following disasters. SAMHSA has authority to provide emergency assistance through the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants (SERG), and supplemental appropriations. Funding was received for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma for CCP programs and SERG grants, but not through supplemental appropriations. The report discusses relevant policy issues in ensuring the provision of mental health and substance abuse treatment services post-disaster. The Stafford Act authorizes the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) to provide mental health counseling in presidentially declared disasters. CCP does not offer treatment or substance abuse services and has only been amended once since its inception in 1974. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) was first enacted in 1974 and has been administered by FEMA since 1988. Eligible awardees are designated by the governor of the affected state, and eligible services are reimbursed. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) is administered by FEMA and provides funds to states for immediate and regular services after a disaster. States apply for funds through a needs assessment, with no matching requirement. CCP consists of two programs: the Immediate Services Program (ISP) and the Regular Services Program. The Regular Services Program (RSP) provides funds for up to nine months following a disaster declaration, with extensions possible in certain cases. RSP funds are provided to states through SAMHSA and reimbursed by FEMA. CCP services can be provided to victims of presidentially declared disasters even if they have relocated. In response to Hurricane Katrina, 29 states were awarded CCP funding totaling $132 million. In October 2006, 29 states received CCP funding for Hurricane Katrina, totaling $132 million. Additional funding was awarded to Louisiana, Texas, and Florida following other hurricanes. Congress authorized SAMHSA to provide non-competitive grants for emergency substance abuse or mental health needs through SERG. SERG can be awarded without a Stafford Act declaration, based on the HHS Secretary's determination of a crisis. It can fund services not covered by CCP. SERG grants are used to fund substance abuse and mental health treatment services not covered by CCP. Grants were awarded after the 2002 DC sniper incidents, 2003 Rhode Island nightclub fire, and Hurricane Katrina. Funds can be used for services like psychotropic medication, methadone treatment, suicide prevention programs, and administrative expenses for mental health. If Congress provides supplemental funds for disaster response, SAMHSA can use them to address unmet needs in mental health and substance abuse treatment. SAMHSA did not receive funding from Congress for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita response. Most of the funds went to replenishing the DRF, with smaller amounts given to other federal departments. SAMHSA provided various services like coordination, suicide prevention, mental health, and substance abuse services after the hurricanes. Coordination of agencies was done through a national summit. SAMHSA convened a national summit in May 2006 to discuss lessons learned from the 2005 hurricanes. Key services were provided by various agencies including HRSA, NIMH, and CDC. SAMHSA established the SERC for on-the-ground coordination of mental health services. SAMHSA coordinated mental health services by managing deployments of providers and organizing daily calls with HHS agencies. SAMHSA also administered grants for suicide prevention and awarded funds for youth suicide prevention activities in Louisiana and Mississippi. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network provided resources for immediate crisis responses and long-term recovery for children. SAMHSA provided mental health services for first responders and launched a public awareness campaign to encourage hurricane survivors to seek mental health treatment. The campaign included national print and billboard ads targeting those experiencing psychological distress. SAMHSA issued guidance for emergency substance abuse treatment services in hurricane-affected states, including methadone and buprenorphine treatment for heroin-addicted populations. Policy issues discussed include federal leadership in coordinating mental health and substance abuse services post-disaster, CCP services scope and duration, SERG grant funding availability, and assessment of resources for mental health and substance abuse services. Federal leadership for responding to mental health consequences of disasters can be enhanced by clear delegations of authority. In 2004, DHS published the National Response Plan (NRP) as mandated by Congress. The NRP establishes a framework for coordinating federal resources in response to disasters. Leadership for federal coordination of mental health services post-disaster appears split in the current version of the NRP, with Emergency Support Function 6 (ESF-6) under FEMA and the American Red Cross for mass care coordination. Federal leadership for disaster mental health in the National Response Plan (NRP) is delegated to FEMA and HHS, with coordination of public health and medical response under ESF-8. The Department of Justice may also be involved in cases of terrorism or violence. Communication and coordination between federal agencies and states are crucial for timely service delivery post-disaster. Recent news report questioned FEMA's sharing of information with Florida about Hurricane Katrina evacuee locations for CCP program efficiency. FEMA stated it has authority to disclose information to aid disaster relief programs. Coordination issues highlighted by mental health professionals. Mental health professionals emphasize the importance of coordinated services for disaster survivors. Engaging in joint disaster planning efforts with state and local governments and the private sector is recommended. Coordination of mental health services through a public health approach is beneficial for survivors' long-term mental health. Tailored responses are seen as most useful. The authors emphasize the importance of tailored responses for disaster survivors' mental health. Accountability for problems with the program may not always be clear due to the division of responsibilities between FEMA, SAMHSA, and the state. FEMA lacks expertise in mental health and substance abuse services, which is primarily held by HHS and SAMHSA. Establishing authority for crisis counseling services in the Stafford Act administered by FEMA allows for quick funding through the DRF, ensuring services can be provided without constraints from annual appropriations. The division of responsibilities between FEMA, SAMHSA, and the state raises questions about accountability for disaster mental health programs. Recent reports question the effectiveness of CCP programs in Florida after Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, particularly regarding the appropriateness of activities like puppet shows and yoga. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring appropriate services lies with the state of Florida. The accountability for disaster mental health programs is questioned, with concerns raised about the effectiveness of CCP services in Florida after Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. FEMA Director R. David Paulison responded to reports of irresponsible use of taxpayers' funds, stating that FEMA had supported outreach programs requested by the state. GAO reviewed financial accounting for CCP services provided under Project Liberty in May 2005. GAO reported that FEMA and SAMHSA lacked oversight in budget management for CCP services provided under Project Liberty after the 9/11 attack. Recommendations were made for improved budgetary oversight and measuring program effectiveness. SAMHSA disputed some of GAO's findings, citing challenges in federal fiscal management of awards to state and local governments. Appendices list CCP awards for ISP and RSP programs in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The FEMA and SAMHSA lacked oversight in budget management for CCP services provided under Project Liberty after the 9/11 attack. Recommendations were made for improved budgetary oversight and measuring program effectiveness. However, the actual effect of the program on health outcomes has not been demonstrated, and evaluations for Project Heartland, Project Liberty, or any other CCP programs have not been published. The effectiveness of Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) in providing mental health support to disaster victims is being questioned. There is ongoing debate about the scope and duration of CCP services, but research in this area is limited due to technical challenges in mental health research. Limited standardized measurement tools and baseline prevalence data hinder mental health research. Disasters' episodic nature and varying impacts make comparisons challenging. Different types of disasters may affect mental health differently. SAMHSA plans to evaluate CCP services post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita with NCPTSD. The NCPTSD supports a national network for PTSD research, collaborating with federal departments, academia, and the private sector for outcomes research on CCP effectiveness. The evaluation may focus on mental health and substance abuse issues post-disaster, beyond what CCP offers. Ambiguity exists in defining \"professional counseling services\" and \"individual and group treatment procedures\" in FEMA regulations. SAMHSA clarifies that Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) does not provide mental health treatment, which involves diagnosis and interventions by state-licensed providers. Treatment includes evaluation, diagnosis, interventions, and maintaining records by licensed mental health professionals. The Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) funded by SAMHSA focuses on individual and group counseling, education, and referral services, but does not provide medications, diagnostic services, or long-term mental health treatment. SAMHSA's Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) offers limited mental health services, focusing on individual and group counseling. Other programs like Medicare and U.S. Courts include outpatient and inpatient care, medication, and treatment for mental health issues. The Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) offers mental health services, including screening and counseling for disaster victims. Expanding CCP services to include enhanced screening methods and various counseling approaches was seen as beneficial for individuals experiencing trauma symptoms. In 2006, the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act was reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which includes a provision to expand the Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) to cover substance abuse services. The potential long-term mental health effects of disasters, such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety, may require extended treatment beyond CCP's short-term intervention. Residents in affected areas are expected to develop high rates of mental health disorders, with chronic PTSD typically diagnosed and treated starting at three months post-disaster. The Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) provides mental health services for individuals affected by disasters for up to nine months, with a possible 90-day extension. Louisiana mental health providers estimate that up to one-third of Hurricane Katrina survivors may have PTSD, but many have not received treatment. CCP is meant to supplement existing mental health resources and is governed by FEMA regulations. FEMA allows extensions of CCP Regular Services programs beyond the nine-month-plus-90-day limit in limited circumstances, such as catastrophic disasters, upon state request and FEMA approval. This extension has fiscal implications for FEMA and the DRF. Previous experiences with Projects Heartland and Liberty have seen CCP services extended beyond the time limit. Project Heartland, a response to a terrorism event in the United States, developed new approaches for psychological trauma services. FEMA extended funding for Project Heartland three times, making it the longest Regular Services project funded by FEMA until Project Liberty in 2001. The extensions for Projects Heartland and Liberty, as well as for CCP programs in response to Hurricane Katrina, reflect uncertainty about the appropriate duration of CCP services until more knowledge is gained on the long-term mental health effects. SAMHSA's guidance recommends referring individuals with substance abuse disorders to specialized providers, as CCP funding does not support substance abuse treatment services. Congress directed SAMHSA to report on prevention and treatment services for individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders. Coordination of routine services in states could improve post-disaster CCP programs, but as of 2005, only 14 states and the District of Columbia had implemented this. As of 2005, only 14 states and the District of Columbia had received SAMHSA grants to address co-occurring disorders in post-disaster CCP programs. Recommendations include training CCP outreach workers in substance abuse treatment to provide both services simultaneously. However, receiving substance abuse treatment from non-specialist CCP workers may not be optimal and could delay individuals from receiving specialist services. Senate bill S. 3721 aims to expand the scope of CCP to include substance abuse services. Congress authorized SAMHSA to reallocate up to 2.5% of its discretionary appropriations for emergency mental health and substance abuse (SERG) grants in 2000. Due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in FY2005, SAMHSA had limited funds available for SERG grants. Congress may consider giving SAMHSA more fiscal flexibility by allowing advance funding up to the 2.5% ceiling based on the total appropriation for the current fiscal year. SAMHSA could potentially finance emergency response grants through the Public Health Emergency Fund, which currently lacks funding. Immediate needs assessments were conducted after the 2005 hurricanes, but no longer-term assessments have been mandated. An assessment of resources and needs in disaster response can improve cost-effective prioritization, program planning, and management. Reassessing mental health needs post-disaster can help understand resources required for long-term support. Transitioning from immediate to long-term mental health services can be complex, requiring matching intensity of help with survivors' needs. The responsibility for conducting initial and follow-up needs assessments in disaster response lies with state governors or their designees, as required by FEMA regulations and SAMHSA guidance. These assessments are crucial for determining the intensity of help needed by survivors and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively. After Hurricane Katrina, SAMHSA streamlined needs assessments for states applying for CCP funding, using preliminary data. SAMHSA estimated 500,000 residents may have needed mental health assistance, while CDC found 83% of returning New Orleans residents needed help. No long-term needs assessments have been conducted or required by law. A follow-up needs assessment could inform the development of a strategy to address chronic mental health needs of survivors after Hurricane Katrina. States are not required to submit follow-up needs assessments, but they must report on how CCP funds were used. FEMA regulations allow for extension of RSP in documented extraordinary circumstances without explicitly requiring a follow-up needs assessment. In 2006, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs proposed a bill that would require SAMHSA and other federal agencies to address post-disaster mental health needs. The Senate proposed a bill in 2006 to address mental health and substance abuse service needs after disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. The bill would require assessments and strategies by SAMHSA and other agencies. The field of disaster mental health continues to evolve with lessons learned from past hurricanes. The federal government offers assistance for mental health and substance abuse problems in disaster victims. Programs established after past disasters provide opportunities for improvement in future responses. FEMA has been involved in providing aid since 2005. Since 2005, FEMA has reported on allocations from the Disaster Relief Fund for Crisis Counseling Program (CCP) activities in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The reports detail budget lines for \"Crisis Counseling - NIMH\" and \"Crisis Counseling - SCC,\" with NIMH being the National Institute of Mental Health. NIMH staff clarified that they no longer administer CCP and have not received funds from FEMA. FEMA stated that SCC amounts align with SAMHSA's Immediate Services Program awards, while NIMH amounts correspond with SAMHSA's Regular Services Program awards. The Regular Services Program (RSP) awards from FEMA to SAMHSA reflect approved amounts, while FEMA allocations show current state fund usage with reporting delays due to program extensions. The table compares CCP spending for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma reported by SAMHSA and FEMA. Mental health treatment post-Katrina focused on psychological services rather than pharmacotherapy. The services provided after Hurricane Katrina were primarily psychological, including education, prevention, emergency response, case management, and rehabilitative support services for individuals with mental health needs. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an intensive, non-residential rehabilitative mental health service provided by multidisciplinary staff. Treatment venues may include outpatient, day treatment, residential treatment, and partial hospitalization programs. These services focus on psychiatric stability, social competencies, adjustment, and independent living skills. Partial hospitalization is a structured program in outpatient hospital facilities or Community Mental Health Centers to stabilize acute mental illness episodes. Acute care hospital inpatient services offer short-term medical, nursing, and psychosocial care. Regional treatment center inpatient services provide comprehensive 24-hour medical, nursing, or psychosocial care. Specialty mental health services focus on mental health issues related to specific cultures or languages, including the deaf and hearing impaired."
