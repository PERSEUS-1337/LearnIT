    "content": "Medicare Advantage (MA) is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits through private health plans. These plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare covered benefits (except hospice) to enrollees. Different types of private plans, like HMOs and PFFS plans, may have varying restrictions on medical care and provider networks. As of January 2009, 23% of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in an MA plan. Medicare Advantage plans offer additional benefits and reduced cost sharing compared to original Medicare, with varying levels of coverage depending on plan type and location. Some beneficiaries find MA plans to be a more affordable alternative to private supplemental insurance policies. The 111th Congress may review the payment disparities between MA plans and original Medicare. The payment formula for Medicare Advantage plans encourages plan participation, but some argue against plans being paid more than original Medicare costs. The Comparative Cost Adjustment Program will test competition between MA and original Medicare. Recent studies show that MA plans had higher profits due to underestimates in medical spending. The Congressional Budget Office projected Medicare payments under Part C to increase from $112.8 billion in 2009 to $221.2 billion in 2018. Medicare has a history of offering health insurance coverage through private plans since the 1970s. In 1982, Congress passed TEFRA, creating the first Medicare risk contracting program where health plans are paid a fixed monthly payment per enrollee to provide Medicare-covered services. Payments to private health plans were set at 95% of the cost of FFS Medicare benefits. By 1997, Medicare private plans covered over 5 million beneficiaries. The Medicare risk contract program was criticized for payment fluctuations and wide variations across the country. In 1997, Congress replaced it with the Medicare+Choice program to reduce spending, expand managed care options, and standardize payment rates. The new program set payment rates based on a blended rate, minimum payment rate, or a national rate for each county. The Medicare+Choice program replaced the Medicare risk contract program in 1997 to standardize payment rates. The new program set payment rates based on a blended per capita rate, a minimum payment rate, or a national rate for each county. The goal was to increase access to private plans, but the program did not work as well as intended due to budget neutrality provisions. Private plans were cautious due to uncertainty about the future of the Medicare+Choice program and payment stability. Between 1999 and 2003, plans left or reduced service areas, impacting enrollees. Despite initial enrollment surge, participation dropped from 17% in 1999 to 12% in 2003. Provisions were inserted in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 to address decreased plan participation. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established Medicare Advantage (MA) to replace the Medicare+Choice program, introducing a new payment methodology based on competitive bidding. This Act also increased payments to plans, introduced regional Preferred Provider Organizations, and created a new benefit package for Medicare enrollees starting in 2006. Beginning in 2006, Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan whether they are in original Medicare or Medicare Advantage. Beneficiaries can choose from different types of private plans, including coordinated care plans like HMOs and PPOs, as well as plans like PFFS and MSAs. Since the passage of the MMA, enrollment in private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans has been steadily increasing, with approximately 10.4 million beneficiaries enrolled in 2009. Despite this success, reforming the payment methodology for private plans remains a key issue, as Medicare is expected to pay private plans an average of 14% more per beneficiary compared to those enrolled in original Medicare. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans receive higher payments than original Medicare due to the 1997 BBA legislation, which created payment floors to attract private plans. These payments, which are 13% higher on average, allow MA plans to offer extra benefits to enrollees, but the value of these benefits varies by plan type and location. The 1997 BBA legislation created payment floors for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, resulting in higher payments compared to original Medicare. These payments attract private plans to underserved areas, offering beneficiaries more plan options. The Secretary determines MA payment rates by comparing plan bids to a benchmark, with plans submitting bids by the first week of June each year. Bids include estimated revenue requirements for providing Medicare services, including healthcare costs, administrative costs, and return on investment. The Secretary can negotiate bid amounts, similar to the Director of the Office of. The Secretary has the authority to negotiate bid amounts for Medicare Advantage plans, comparing each plan's bid to a benchmark. If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, the payment equals the bid plus a rebate of 75% of the difference, with the rebate used for additional benefits or reducing costs for enrollees. The remaining 25% is retained by the federal government. The federal government retains 25% of the difference in bid amounts for Medicare Advantage plans. Plans with bids equal to or above the benchmark pay the benchmark amount, with enrollees in those plans paying an additional premium for any excess bid amount. MA plans offering Part D coverage receive reimbursement for premiums and cost-sharing reductions for low-income enrollees. The MMA increased payments to regional plans through a stabilization fund to incentivize serving entire regions and staying in regions they might otherwise leave. The MMA established a fund for years 2007 through 2013, with money from savings in the regional plan bidding process. Legislation later reduced the fund from $10 billion to one dollar. Money from the bidding process continues to flow into the fund for distribution in 2014. The MMA allows increased payments to certain hospitals for inpatient services to MA regional plan enrollees. Medicare shared risk with MA plans in 2006 and 2007, with plans assuming only a portion of the risk for high costs. MA benchmarks are updated annually with a minimum increase over the previous year's rate. The Medicare Advantage benchmarks are updated annually with a minimum increase over the previous year's rate, set at 2% or the National MA Growth Percentage. In rebasing years, plan payments are updated by the greater of the minimum increase or 100% of fee-for-service costs, with adjustments required by statute. The Secretary rebases FFS costs every three years but has rebased more frequently. Benchmarks are set at or above spending in original Medicare, with benchmarks on average 18% greater than expected spending. The National MA Growth Percentage rate is 5.7% in 2008 and 4.2% in 2009. Local MA plans have a different benchmark calculation than regional MA plans. The local benchmark for MA plans is based on defined increases, while the regional benchmark includes plan bids. The Secretary adjusts payments based on enrollees' health status using risk adjustment, which replaced demographic factors in 1999. In 1999, Congress implemented a clinically based risk adjustment methodology for MA plans to supplement demographic factors. The methodology aimed to prevent payment reductions to plans enrolling healthier beneficiaries and raise payments to plans with sicker beneficiaries. A budget neutrality adjustment was applied to ensure overall payments to managed care plans remained constant. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 mandated the phaseout of this adjustment by 2011, leading to a 3.5% MA benchmark update in 2008. The MA benchmark update for 2008 was 3.5%, and for 2009 it was 3.6% for areas without a rebased amount. MA plans offering prescription drug coverage receive a separate benchmark payment for Part D benefits, competitively determined based on plan bids. The number of Medicare risk plans fluctuated over time, decreasing in the early 1990s and then increasing significantly in the late 1990s. The number of MA contracts fluctuated over time, dropping from 346 in 1998 to 146 in March 2003, then more than doubling between 2005 and 2006. By 2008, there were 600 MA coordinated care and PFFS contracts, increasing to 623 in 2009. Organizations cited reasons such as inadequate payments and regulatory burden for withdrawing from the program between 1998 and 2004. Other factors like low enrollment and market competition also contributed to withdrawals. Enrollment in Medicare private plans fluctuated between 1999 and 2003, with beneficiaries having to change plans or leave the program due to withdrawals and service area reductions. Some beneficiaries had to switch plans multiple times, and between 7% and 24% lost access to any M+C plan each year. Enrollment in the M+C program increased through 1999 but declined to a low of 11% in 2003 and 2004, before increasing again to a high of 23% in 2009. Enrollment in Medicare private plans fluctuated between 1999 and 2003, with beneficiaries having to change plans or leave the program due to withdrawals and service area reductions. Enrollment has increased each year since 2004, reaching a recent high of 23% in 2009. The 2008 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees projects further enrollment increases, with about 27% of all beneficiaries expected to be covered by 2017, totaling about 15 million enrollees. National enrollment in Medicare Advantage is mainly concentrated in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) with 67% and private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans with 21%, while other plan types make up 13% of enrollment. Characteristics of different plan types and enrollment specifics are discussed. Coordinated care plans (CCPs) in Medicare Advantage (MA) include Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), and Provider Sponsored Organizations (PSOs). HMOs offer services within a designated network, while PPOs have a network of providers but allow for out-of-network care at a higher cost. In 2008, 67% of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in an MA HMO. Provider Organization (PPO) in Medicare Advantage offers a network of providers with the flexibility for enrollees to seek care outside the network, albeit at higher cost sharing. There are two types of PPO plans: local PPO plans with a chosen service area and regional PPO plans serving designated regions. Regional PPO plans have additional requirements like unified deductibles and out-of-pocket limits. In 2008, 5% of MA enrollees were in local PPO plans and 3% in regional PPO plans. Provider Sponsored Organizations (PSOs) also provide coordinated care in MA. In 2008, 1% of MA enrollees were in a Provider Sponsored Organization (PSO) plan, and 1.1 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Specialized Plans for Special Needs Individuals (SNPs). Special needs individuals are those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid or have a severe chronic condition. In 2008, 1.1 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Specialized Plans for Special Needs Individuals (SNPs), with 70% eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, 17% with chronic conditions, and 13% institutionalized. Additionally, 21% of MA participants were in Private Fee for Service plans (PFFS), totaling approximately 1.9 million enrollees. PFFS contracts and enrollment have shown a significant increase in recent years. Enrollment in Private Fee for Service (PFFS) plans has significantly increased in recent years. The first PFFS contract was offered in 2000, with a steeper growth seen between 2004 and 2008. Factors contributing to this growth include the flexibility for enrollees to choose any provider, the lack of required provider networks before 2011, and higher payments to PFFS plans. PFFS plans are popular due to beneficiary appeal, higher payments, and fewer statutory requirements. Employer and union groups favor PFFS plans for retiree coverage. Reasonable Cost Plans are paid based on actual costs and are not \"at risk\" for care expenses. In 2008, 266,000 beneficiaries were enrolled in Cost plans, representing 3% of total MA enrollment. In 2008, slightly over 1,000 individuals were enrolled in a Medical Savings Account (MSA) under Medicare Advantage (MA), representing less than 0.01% of MA enrollees. The maximum deductible for the MSA in 2008 was $10,050. Additionally, 1% of MA enrollees were in a Health Care Prepayment Plan (HCPP) in 2008, which covers only physician services and is open to eligible beneficiaries living in the plan's service area. In 2009, an MA plan is available to every beneficiary in the United States, marking a recent increase in availability. Initially, in the early years of the M+C program, a Medicare private plan was not widely accessible. By 2000, the first PFFS plan focused on rural and suburban areas, expanding access to private plans. Between 2001 and 2003, approximately half of counties had access to a PFFS plan, with over 40% of counties having PFFS as the only private option. Managed care availability decreased during this period. Access to private plans through Medicare has increased substantially since 2004, with nearly all counties now served by at least one type of private plan. However, PFFS is the only plan type available for half of all counties as of 2008. Medicare beneficiaries are not evenly distributed across counties, with more urban areas having a higher concentration of population and plans. In 2007, half of all counties were served by only PFFS plan options. In 2007, half of all counties were served by only PFFS plan options, representing 17% of all Medicare beneficiaries. Availability of MA plans set up by employers for retirees has increased, providing additional options for Medicare beneficiaries. In 2007, 96% of all beneficiaries had access to both a coordinated care plan and a private fee for service plan. In 2003, most Medicare Part C enrollees lived in central urban areas, decreasing to 51% in 2007. Urban/rural enrollment patterns varied over time, with different geographic definitions for areas like central urban, other urban, urban/rural fringe, and other rural. In 2007, 39% of all Medicare beneficiaries resided in central urban areas, with a higher proportion enrolling in private plans compared to other geographic areas. Urban/rural enrollment patterns showed variations over time, with a trend of decreasing enrollment in non-central urban areas. The high enrollment trend in central urban areas for Medicare Advantage plans is decreasing due to factors like historic patterns of managed care enrollment and plan availability. More beneficiaries in suburban and rural areas are now enrolling in MA plans, leading to a decrease in urban concentration. Enrollment patterns also vary regionally, with higher MA enrollment in western and southwestern states. For example, Arizona has 36% of beneficiaries in MA plans, while Rhode Island has 35% enrollment. In 2003, the top four states with the highest Medicare Part C enrollment were California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and New York, accounting for over half of all enrollment. By 2007, enrollment in these states decreased to 41% of all MA enrollment. Overall, 34 states have enrollment below the national average of 21%, with MA enrollees more geographically concentrated than Medicare beneficiaries as a whole. The MA program has specific rules for eligibility, including being entitled to Medicare Part A and enrolled in Part B. Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have exceptions for enrollment in MA plans. Individuals with ESRD have exceptions for enrolling in MA plans, including being able to enroll in another MA plan after involuntary termination. Employer Group Health Plan members can also choose their employer's MA plan if it meets certain access requirements. MA eligible individuals must enroll in a plan serving their geographic area, with exceptions for reasonable access to benefits and payment area changes by local MA organizations. Local HMOs can offer continued enrollment in their plan within their chosen service area, which can include multiple counties. Medicare eligible individuals have four enrollment periods to choose an MA plan: initial coverage election, annual election, open enrollment, and special election periods. During the annual coordinated election period, beneficiaries can make changes to their MA plan or switch between original Medicare and MA. During the open enrollment period, individuals can switch from original Medicare to MA or vice versa. Changes can be made within the first three months of the year. Beneficiaries in original Medicare can enroll in an MA plan, while those in an MA plan can switch to a different MA plan or return to original Medicare. However, drug coverage cannot be changed during this period. Institutionalized beneficiaries have the flexibility to change their election at any time during the year. Institutionalized beneficiaries can change their enrollment status at any time during the year through Special Election Periods (SEPs) created by the Secretary. These SEPs are available when the organization terminates its contract, the resident moves to a new service area, the plan violates its contract terms, or in other exceptional circumstances. Most plans offer additional benefits beyond original Medicare, funded through rebates or directly by the enrollee. The Government Accountability Office found that most Medicare Advantage plans fund supplemental benefits through rebates or supplemental premiums. Analysis showed that rebates covered 77% of benefits, while premiums covered 23%. Most plans offered vision care, hearing coverage, and routine physicals to enrollees in 2005. The Medicare Advantage plans offer supplemental benefits such as vision care, hearing coverage, and routine physicals to enrollees. Prescription drug coverage is also available through the Medicare Part D program. Enrollees may be required to pay Part B premiums and additional out-of-pocket fees depending on the plan they choose. Between 1999 and 2003, the availability of zero premium coordinated care plans for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries declined nationally, dropping from over 60% to just under 30%. However, between 2003 and 2006, access to zero premium plans doubled, reaching 61%. The percentage of beneficiaries enrolled in these plans has fluctuated, making comparisons over time difficult. In 2006, over half of MA coordinated care plan enrollees were in zero premium plans. In 2006, just over half of MA coordinated care plan enrollees were in a plan with a zero combined premium for Part C and Part D benefits. The MMA added the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, making some type of drug coverage available to all beneficiaries. Every MA organization is required to offer at least one Medicare Advantage-Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plan, one that offers qualified Part D prescription drug coverage. PFFS plans are not required to offer a plan with qualified prescription drug benefits. MA-PD plans receive subsidies for prescription drug coverage, including a direct subsidy based on the plan's bid amount, reinsurance payment for costs exceeding out-of-pocket threshold, and reimbursement for premium cost-sharing reductions for low-income enrollees. Beneficiaries in MA plans offering Part D must pay the standard premium, but MA-PD plans may use rebates to offset drug premiums. The MA program has requirements to limit costs. The MA program includes beneficiary protections such as access to Medicare benefits, liability standards, quality standards, disclosure requirements, and a grievance process. MA organizations cannot deny enrollment based on health status but may do so if at capacity or for non-payment of premiums. Organizations may terminate an enrollee's election for failure to pay premiums, disruptive behavior, or plan termination. Coordinated care plans like HMOs and PPOs must have provider networks to meet Medicare access requirements. Providers in the network have written contracts to furnish services to enrollees. Care may not be covered if received from a non-network provider. PFFS plans are not required to establish networks but must allow services from any Medicare participating provider. PFFS plans must meet access requirements by establishing payment rates or having contracts with providers. Employer-sponsored plans need contracted networks, while non-employer plans must establish networks in certain areas. Enrollees in PFFS plans have flexibility in choosing providers. Enrollees in PFFS plans have the flexibility to choose any Medicare eligible provider who accepts the plan's terms. Providers are not required to treat plan enrollees without a written agreement. Access requirements include timely care, coverage policies, beneficiary input, 24/7 services, and access to ambulance and emergency services. CMS reviews and approves MA plan benefit offerings 24/7 to ensure coverage of Part A and B services, without discrimination or discouragement of enrollment. Mandatory supplemental benefits are also reviewed to comply with CMS guidelines. Enrollees in MA-coordinated care plans have lower out-of-pocket costs for covered services. The cost sharing in an MA plan must be equal to original Medicare, but specific services can have different amounts. Balance billing in Medicare refers to providers billing in excess of Medicare's recognized payment amount. Original Medicare prohibits balance billing by participating physicians but allows non-participating physicians to balance bill up to 115% of the fee-schedule amount. Providers in coordinated care MA plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs for covered services. Providers in PFFS plans can balance bill enrollees up to 115% of the plan's fee schedule. Beneficiaries are responsible for any balance billing charges if allowed by the plan. PFFS plans must inform beneficiaries of these charges, and hospitals must provide advanced notice. MA organizations are required to have a quality improvement program that includes collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on health outcomes. They must design chronic care improvement programs, conduct quality improvement projects, and encourage provider participation in CMS and HHS initiatives. Plans must assess the effectiveness of their programs annually and address any systemic issues. CMS mandates the collection and reporting of performance measures from NCQA's HEDIS, CAHPS, and HOS to enrollees. Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) requires MA organizations to provide enrollees with detailed information on service area, benefits, provider network, coverage, grievance procedures, and financial performance. Enrollees have rights to request utilization control procedures, grievance statistics, physician compensation practices, and plan termination notices. When an MA organization terminates its contract with CMS, it must provide advance written notice to enrollees with alternative benefit options. Marketing materials must be approved by CMS to ensure accuracy and must include plan details, grievance process, and contract termination information. CMS has developed standards for regulating the marketing conduct of MA organizations, including prohibitions against door-to-door soliciting, providing cash incentives for enrollment, and conducting misleading activities. MIPPA established new prohibitions on marketing activities, such as prohibiting plans from soliciting beneficiaries door-to-door or on the phone unless initiated by the beneficiary. The marketing conduct of MA organizations is regulated by CMS, with prohibitions on door-to-door soliciting, cash incentives, and misleading activities. MIPPA introduced new restrictions on marketing activities, including prohibiting solicitation of beneficiaries door-to-door or on the phone unless initiated by the beneficiary. Additional limitations were established on plan marketing activities, such as cross-selling non-health products and using unlicensed sales agents. MA plans must provide states with information on agent terminations and performance, and include the plan type in all plan names after January 1, 2010. The CMS proposed rule includes provisions for MA plans to provide oversight of marketing activities, develop a memorandum of understanding with states, and have procedures for resolving grievances and organization determinations. Beneficiaries have 60 days to file a grievance and must receive a timely resolution within 30 days. Beneficiaries can request an appeal or reconsideration of an organization determination, including an expedited determination within 72 hours. MA organizations must provide written information on these processes and how to initiate quality of care complaints to the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO). Complaints to the QIO are separate from the MA organization's grievance procedure, and beneficiaries can file complaints with both simultaneously. All quality-of-care complaints and adverse determinations must be responded to in writing. MA program requires private health plans to meet minimum standards and contracting requirements. The MA program requires private health plans to meet minimum enrollment standards, organizational and financial requirements specified by states, provider protections, and prompt payment requirements. The Secretary conducts audits of at least one-third of MA participating organizations annually, with the authority to terminate contracts or impose sanctions for violations. Contracts are made for at least one year and automatically renewable unless terminated. MA organizations must enroll a minimum number of individuals, which can be waived during the first three years if the organization demonstrates the ability to manage an MA contract. The MA organization must be licensed as a risk-bearing entity to offer MA plans, assume full risk for Medicare benefits, and establish physician participation procedures. PFFS organizations cannot put providers at risk. The MA organization, licensed as a risk-bearing entity, must establish physician participation procedures that include notice of rules, written notice of decisions, and an appeals process. Consultation with contracting physicians on medical policies is required, and discrimination against providers acting within their scope is prohibited. Gag clauses and physician financial incentive plans are also limited. The Secretary conducts annual audits of MA participating organizations' financial records, inspects services provided to enrollees, and has the right to audit records for up to 10 years. CMS can inspect MA organizations for potential fraud at any time. MA PFFS plans must pay 95% of clean claims within 30 days. MA organizations are required to pay 95% of \"clean claims\" within 30 days, including claims from non-contracted providers. Interest must be paid on late clean claims. Contracts with providers must include prompt payment provisions. Failure to comply may result in contract termination by the Secretary. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) can terminate contracts with Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations for various reasons, including failure to comply with regulations, implementing quality assessment programs, marketing requirements, and committing fraud. MA organizations have the right to appeal terminations and can also terminate their contract with CMS if terms are not met. The Secretary can impose sanctions, including civil monetary penalties, for specific violations such as not providing necessary services or charging excess premiums. The Secretary can impose sanctions, including civil monetary penalties, for specific violations such as denying enrollment based on medical condition, misrepresenting information, and contracting with excluded providers. Penalties range from $10,000 to $100,000, and may include suspension of enrollment, payment stoppage, and marketing restrictions. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPac) reports that Medicare pays private plans an average of 14% more per beneficiary in 2009 than for original Medicare. The current payment mechanism does not incentivize plans to be more efficient than original Medicare, as they are paid at least as much as the cost of Medicare, and on average, more. In 2008, Medicare was willing to pay Medicare Advantage (MA) plans 18% higher than the estimated cost of providing benefits. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans receive higher payments than the cost of original Medicare, with health maintenance organizations being more cost-effective. These higher payments attract private plans to underserved areas, offering extra benefits to enrollees. However, they also allow inefficient plans to participate, contribute to long-term financial instability, and increase Part B premium costs for all beneficiaries. The financial instability of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may lead to increased Part B premium costs for all beneficiaries. MedPac will address MA payments and quality measures in upcoming reports to Congress, including studying performance and patient experience measures for MA and original Medicare. Congress may reconsider MA payments and whether funds above the cost of original Medicare should be redirected to other priorities. Reducing payments in the MA program could lead to reduced supplemental benefits or access to plans. One proposed provision in the House-passed CHAMP Act aimed to decrease MA benchmarks to match original Medicare spending, potentially saving billions. This provision was not adopted by the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office estimated significant savings by aligning benchmarks with original Medicare spending. Reducing payments in the MA program to match original Medicare spending could save $55 billion over 5 years and $157 billion over 10 years. This could result in decreased access to MA plans in some areas, leading to geographic disparities. Some argue that benchmarks should consider the costs faced by private plans, such as administrative costs and payments to health care providers. The CBO estimated that basing benchmarks on plan bids could be a viable option. Basing benchmarks on plan bids could save $35 billion over 5 years and $158 billion over 10 years. This option may not create a level playing field between MA and original Medicare but could still achieve some savings without severely impacting access to plans. Another option is an across-the-board percentage cut in benchmarks, potentially keeping benchmarks above original Medicare spending in many rural and some urban areas. The disadvantages of using Medicare benchmarks based on plan bids include not creating a level playing field between MA and original Medicare, not incorporating plan information for cost assessment, and potential higher profit margins for MA plans due to lower spending on medical services than estimated. Congressional attention has focused on the profits earned by MA plans, with findings showing over $1 billion in additional profits each year for 2005 and 2006. The 111th Congress may consider limiting MA plan profits to reduce Medicare spending or enhance benefits for enrollees. The House-passed CHAMP Act of 2007 aimed to disclose plan spending on clinical services through the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) and penalize plans with low MLRs. However, these provisions were not adopted by the Senate. Starting in 2010, a program for comparative cost adjustment (CCA) will be implemented until 2015. The six-year program starting in 2010 will test competition among local MA plans and with fee-for-service Medicare in limited qualifying areas. The benchmark for MA local plans in a CCA area will be calculated based on FFS spending and plan bids. Part B premiums in CCA areas will be adjusted based on the benchmark compared to FFS amounts. In non-CCA areas, Part B premiums for FFS beneficiaries will be reduced if the FFS amount is less than the benchmark, with adjustments capped at 5%. Beneficiaries with low incomes below 150% of poverty and qualifying for low-income subsidies will not see their Part B premium increased. Legislation to repeal the CCA demonstration was passed by the House in the 110th Congress but not taken up by the Senate. The Secretary has not disclosed the locations of the CCA demonstrations. Opposition to cost-saving programs has led to delays or cancellations historically. Members typically do not support programs that could negatively impact companies or beneficiaries in their districts. Questionable marketing practices by MA plans, agents, or brokers have attracted congressional attention during the 110th Congress. Hearings identified deceptive sales practices like door-to-door solicitations and misleading beneficiaries about plan coverage. CMS issued a proposed rule to regulate marketing policies following these hearings. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) codified provisions to regulate marketing practices for MA and Part D plans, including prohibiting door-to-door solicitations, limiting sales activities to common areas, and requiring the use of state-licensed marketing representatives. MIPPA also directed the establishment of guidelines on agent commissions to ensure beneficiaries are enrolled in plans that meet their healthcare needs. The revised interim final rule established compensation levels for agents and brokers based on historical compensation levels in the same market, adjusted for whether it was the beneficiary's first year enrolling in a particular plan type. Compensation would be decreased if the beneficiary disenrolled within the first year. It is uncertain if marketing issues for Medicare private plans will receive congressional attention in the 111th congress, as legislation has addressed many issues but concerns remain about potential circumvention of the law. Major legislation enacted into law since 1997 has modified Medicare Part C, with provisions highlighting significant budget impacts. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA, P.L. 105-33) established Medicare+Choice (M+C), a new part C of Medicare that expanded private plan options for beneficiaries to enroll in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other private health care organizations starting in 1999. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA, P.L. 105-33) introduced Medicare+Choice (M+C), allowing private health care organizations to contract with Medicare. Payment for private plans changed to a formula based on a blended rate, minimum payment rate, or a rate reflecting a minimum increase from the previous year. This formula ensured budget neutrality in payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced Medicare+Choice, which allowed private health care organizations to contract with Medicare. The blended per capita rate aimed to shift payment amounts towards a national average rate, with provisions like the floor rate and minimum increase percentage to protect counties. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 contained provisions to facilitate the implementation of Medicare+Choice. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, known as BBRA, made changes to the Medicare+Choice program. It adjusted the phase-in of the new risk adjustment payment methodology, introduced entry bonuses for organizations offering plans in certain areas, reduced the exclusion period for reentering organizations, allowed for premium and benefit variations within payment areas, and changed the deadline for submitting adjusted community rates. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvements and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA, P.L. 106-554) established multiple floor rates based on population and location, applied a 3% minimum update in 2001, increased M+C payment rates for enrollees with ESRD, extended the current risk adjustment methodology until 2003, and phased in a new risk adjustment methodology starting in 2004. The BIPA of 2000 introduced a new risk adjustment methodology for M+C plans, allowing them to offer reduced Medicare Part B premiums. It also extended the entry bonus for M+C plans and required payment adjustments for increased costs. Additionally, the Secretary was restricted from implementing new regulatory requirements outside the beginning of a calendar year. BIPA mandated quick approval of marketing material by the Secretary for M+C organizations. BIPA expanded M+C quality assurance programs to focus on racial and ethnic minorities. It granted the Secretary authority to waive requirements hindering certain M+C plans' design, offering, or enrollment. BIPA also extended Medigap enrollment for certain M+C enrollees affected by coverage termination. BIPA expanded M+C quality assurance programs to focus on racial and ethnic minorities. It allowed individuals to enroll in an M+C plan after the 10th day of the month and receive coverage starting the next month. ESRD beneficiaries could switch to another M+C plan if their current plan terminated or reduced its service area. BIPA mandated review of ACR submissions by the HCFA Chief Actuary. P.L. 107-188 changed the deadline for M+C payment rates announcement and plan information submission temporarily. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173) made significant changes to Medicare's private plan option, including modifying payment rates for plans in 2004. Plans were paid based on the highest of the floor, minimum percentage increase, the blend, or a new amount equal to 100% per capita fee-for-service for a beneficiary. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173) introduced changes to Medicare's private plan payment rates in 2004. The new payment methodology established under MMA involved a blend payment type without budget neutrality provision. Starting in 2005, the floor and blend payment types were eliminated, with only a minimum percentage increase amount being used to update payments. In 2006, a new payment system was implemented for private plans, where Medicare pays plans a fixed monthly amount per enrollee based on competitive bidding. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 introduced changes to Medicare's private plan payment rates in 2004. The new payment methodology involved a blend payment type without budget neutrality provision. Plans bid below the benchmark receive payment equal to the bid amount plus 75% of the difference. Plans bid above the benchmark receive the benchmark payment, with enrollees paying an additional premium. MA regional plans were allowed to participate in the program starting in 2006. MA regional plans, part of the Medicare Advantage program, cover in- and out-of-network services in designated regions. Each plan must offer a maximum out-of-pocket limit and a unified deductible. Payments are based on a competitive system, with incentives for plans to participate. Initially, a $10 billion stabilization fund was provided, with additional funds added when plans bid below the benchmark. The Medicare Advantage program includes regional plans that cover in- and out-of-network services with set limits. Plans bid competitively, with incentives for bidding below the benchmark. In 2006, Medicare shared risk with regional plans based on cost fluctuations. Special provisions allowed for increased payments to certain hospitals contracting with regional plans. A Medicare Part D prescription drug plan became available to all beneficiaries, with MA enrollees required to get Part D benefits through their plan. The Medicare Special Needs Plan (SNP) option was introduced to enhance care coordination for specific beneficiary groups. The Medicare Advantage program includes regional plans with set limits for in- and out-of-network services. Plans bid competitively below the benchmark. Special provisions allowed increased payments to certain hospitals. The Medicare Special Needs Plan (SNP) option enhances care coordination for specific beneficiary groups. Starting in 2010, the MMA requires a program for comparative cost adjustment in limited areas. The DRA in 2007 changed how MA benchmarks are calculated. The DRA changed MA benchmarks in 2007 by excluding certain adjustments and increasing rates based on MA growth percentage. Congress urged a clinically based risk adjustment methodology without reducing plan payments. Administration studies show differences in reported health status between MA enrollees and original Medicare beneficiaries. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 created a special enrollment period for beneficiaries in original Medicare to join certain MA plans. It also delayed the availability of funds from the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund and reduced the amount of funds available. P.L. 110-48 eliminated the special enrollment period and reduced the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extensions Act of 2007 extended certain provisions. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extensions Act of 2007 (MMSEA, P.L. 110-173) extended the authority of Specialized Medicare Advantage Plans for Special Needs Individuals (SNPs) to restrict enrollment to special needs beneficiaries until January 1, 2010. It also imposed a moratorium on new SNP plans until January 1, 2010 and eliminated $1.6 billion from the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund for 2012. Additionally, it provided extra funding for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs and Aging and Disabled Resource Centers. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) requires the phase-out of indirect medical education (IME) costs from all benchmarks starting in 2010. The phase-out amount each year is based on a ratio relative to the proportion of per capita costs in original Medicare. This provision does not apply to Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE plans). Starting in 2011, PFFS plans sponsored by employers or unions must establish provider networks to meet access requirements. Non-employer MA PFFS plans in areas with at least two network-based plans must also have contracted networks. PFFS and MSA plans are required to have a quality improvement program similar to other MA plans starting in January 1, 2010. Data collection and reporting requirements for PFFS and MSA plans are limited to not exceed local PPO plans starting in 2011. In 2010, requirements for PFFS and MSA plans are limited to administrative data from both in-network and out-of-network providers. MIPPA extends restrictions on enrollment for Special Needs Plans (SNPs) and designating new SNPs until January 1, 2011. New enrollees in a SNP starting January 1, 2010, must meet the definition of a special needs individual. Institutional SNPs have eligibility criteria based on state assessment tools for individuals needing institutional level of care. Medicaid SNPs must have a contract with the state to provide benefits and comply with care management requirements. Chronic Care SNPs need to meet a revised definition and provide descriptions of benefits to prospective enrollees. MIPPA mandates compliance with certain care management requirements and convening a panel to determine severe chronic conditions. Medicaid Special Needs Plans (SNPs) must meet care management requirements and report data by January 1, 2010. Dual eligible SNPs cannot charge excessive cost-sharing. The MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund is reduced to $1.00, with savings from the bidding process available for 2014 expenditures. MIPPA extends reasonable cost plans' operation until January 1, 2010. MIPPA establishes new prohibitions on marketing activities of MA plans and PDPs, including door-to-door and phone solicitation, cross-selling non-health products, providing meals to potential enrollees, and marketing in healthcare delivery locations. Plans must report to Congress on reasons why cost-based plans may not transition to MA plans. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established bonus payments for Medicare Advantage HMO-affiliated professionals and hospitals who were meaningful users of electronic health records. The Act also prohibited certain marketing activities of MA plans and PDPs, such as door-to-door and phone solicitation, cross-selling non-health products, and marketing in healthcare delivery locations."
