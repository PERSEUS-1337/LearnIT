    "content": "The \"Partnership for Children and Families Act\" includes provisions for expanded eligibility for adoption assistance and foster care, child welfare reinvestment funding, and effective dates for the Act. Amendments or repeals in the Act are considered to be made to the Social Security Act. TITLE I--EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY FOR ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AND FOSTER CARE. Section 473(a) (42 U.S.C. 673(a)) is amended to specify the requirements for a child to be eligible for adoption assistance, including being removed from their home under certain circumstances. A child eligible for adoption assistance must meet certain criteria, including being in foster care with a minor parent and being determined to have special needs by the state. Additionally, a child previously eligible for adoption assistance whose adoption was dissolved or adoptive parents have died is still considered eligible for assistance. SEC. 102 of the bill eliminates the income eligibility requirement for foster care maintenance payments. It also includes a conforming amendment to Section 470. Additionally, TITLE II introduces the Child Welfare Reinvestment Funding under SEC. 201. Section 474 (42 U.S.C. 674) is amended to include a Child Welfare Reinvestment Fund, allowing states to apply for foster care maintenance payment savings by reducing the total days children spend in foster care. The savings can be used for family preservation, support, reunification, and adoption services. The Child Welfare Reinvestment Fund allows states to apply for savings by reducing foster care days. States must train staff on effective practices and provide detailed estimates in their application. The Child Welfare Reinvestment Fund requires states to submit a detailed plan on how funds will be used, including assurances and consistency with corrective action plans. Additional information may be requested by the Secretary. Beginning October 1, 2008, the Secretary may approve a State's application for the Child Welfare Reinvestment Fund if the State's estimate of placement days aligns with the agreement and does not violate any assurances or impair benefits for qualified children or families. The State plan approved under this part allows for additional payments to states based on foster care maintenance payment savings achieved by the State for the fiscal year. The State is entitled to receive an amount equal to the lesser of the savings or the Federal medical assistance percentage of the total amounts expended by the State during the fiscal year. The State plan allows for additional payments based on foster care maintenance payment savings achieved by the State for the fiscal year. The savings are determined by multiplying the foster care maintenance unit cost by any savings achieved. The State plan allows for additional payments based on foster care maintenance payment savings achieved by the State for the fiscal year, which is determined by the difference between estimated and experienced placement days. The State plan allows for additional payments based on foster care maintenance payment savings achieved by the State for the fiscal year, calculated by dividing the total payments to the State under subsection (a)(1) by the total number of placement days experienced by the State in the preceding fiscal year. The State retains legal responsibility for a child placed in foster care, child care institution, or with a relative, regardless of foster care maintenance payments. The State has legal responsibility for the placement and care of the child. The Secretary makes payments to the State at the end of the fiscal year. States can only use the funds according to their approved application and cannot use them for staff salaries. The State receives funds from the Secretary for child placement and care, with restrictions on fund usage. Funds must be spent within 5 years and a report on services provided must be submitted annually. Effective dates for amendments related to adoption assistance, foster care maintenance payments, and child welfare reinvestment funding are set for October 1, 2008. Adoption assistance agreements executed on or after that date will be affected, as well as children placed into foster care and child welfare reinvestment funding."
