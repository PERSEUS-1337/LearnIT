    "content": "The Act titled \"Mixed-Blood Ute Indian Tax Status Act\" is amended to address taxes on distributions according to Section 17 of the Act of August 27, 1954. The Act \"Mixed-Blood Ute Indian Tax Status Act\" exempts distributions of rents, royalties, and mineral interests from federal and state income tax for Ute tribe members. Cash distributions from interest earned on Treasury funds are not exempt from individual income tax. Real property distributed to mixed-blood members of the Ute tribe is exempt from property taxes for 7 years starting from August 27, 1954, but this exemption does not apply if the property is transferred. Real property and income distributed to mixed-blood members of the Ute tribe, their heirs, and legatees under the Act will be subject to taxes after 7 years from August 27, 1961. The Ute Distribution Corporation is exempt from Federal and State corporate income taxes. The Ute Distribution Corporation, organized by mixed-blood members of the tribe, manages claims against the US and distributes income from oil, gas, and mineral rights to tribe members. Real property distributed under this Act will be taxed based on fair market value. The fair market value of real property transferred by the United States under this Act will determine the tax. Unliquidated claims against the US include taxes paid on income from oil, gas, and mineral rights by mixed-blood tribe members and their heirs after August 27, 1961. Cash distributions of interest earned on funds deposited in the Treasury of the United States are not considered unliquidated claims. Claims by mixed-blood tribe members or Ute Indians for tax refunds must be filed under the Internal Revenue Code. Limitations on claims or suits for refund may be waived under certain circumstances. The waiver of refund amounts, interest, and penalties for income tax paid after August 27, 1961, is allowed under certain circumstances. Refunds will include interest calculated from the date of payment to the Federal Government at the prevailing interest rate for federal income tax refunds."
