Congress finds that Langston Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, and East Potomac Golf Course are owned by the United States and under the National Park Service's jurisdiction. These golf courses have a long history of serving the public in the Nation's capital. East Potomac Golf Course, opened in 1920, offers three courses for players of all levels. Golf courses require significant investment not feasible for concessionaires. Langston Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, and East Potomac Golf Course are historic golf courses in Washington, D.C. Langston Golf Course, named after John Mercer Langston, the first African-American Congressman from Virginia, opened in 1939 for African-American players. Rock Creek Golf Course, located in Rock Creek Park, opened in 1923 as a 9-hole course and expanded to an 18-hole tournament-level course in 1925. Each course has significant historical value that needs to be preserved. Langston Golf Course, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is believed to be the first regulation course built in the United States on a refuse landfill. John Shippen, the first American-born golf professional of African-American ancestry, placed fifth in the 1896 United States Open at 16 years old and helped found the Capitol City Golf Club in 1925. The Capitol City Open tournament has been held at Langston Golf Course for the past 40 years, historically promoting a safe golf facility for African-Americans in Washington, DC. The Langston, Rock Creek, and East Potomac golf courses in Washington, DC, provide important recreational outlets, instructional forums, and a safe haven center for inner city youth and residents. They also host the Nation's minority youth First Tee golf program, contributing to the quality of life for residents and visitors in the region. The Langston and Rock Creek golf courses in Washington, DC have the potential to be upgraded to meet their athletic and historical promise. The management of these courses is defined, with Rock Creek located at 16th and Rittenhouse NW and Langston at 26th and Benning Road NE. The East Potomac area in Washington DC is defined as the federally owned golf course and facilities located at 972 Ohio Drive SW. The boundaries of the area are Ohio Drive to the East, South, and West, and Buckeye Drive SW to the North. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service. The Secretary will ensure that the lease for East Potomac will expire at the same time as Langston and Rock Creek. A new lease for the three golf courses will be entered into, requiring them to be operated in a way that preserves their historic nature. The Secretary will solicit proposals for a long-term ground lease on the three golf courses, ensuring affordable fees and allowing for cross-subsidization. The competitive process aims to involve disadvantaged participants. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 does not apply to proposals, leases, and agreements under this section, aiming to involve disadvantaged business enterprises among equity partners."
