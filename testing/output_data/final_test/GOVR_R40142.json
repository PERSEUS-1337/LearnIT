In 2012, 61% of private employers offered health insurance to full-time employees, extending benefits to their families. A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that 59.5% of insured Americans had employer-based insurance in 2012. COBRA requires employers to continue coverage for employees under certain circumstances, aiming to prevent loss of health insurance due to job changes. The law known as COBRA requires employers to continue health insurance coverage for individuals who become uninsured due to changes in employment or family status. This law impacts private sector employer group health plans by allowing them to charge 102% of the group plan premium, which can be more affordable than individual insurance market options. Additionally, COBRA continuation coverage is required for employees of state and local governments, federal employees, and employees of the Washington, DC district government. Before COBRA, termination of employment would result in the immediate loss of insurance coverage. In 1985, 10 states had laws requiring insurance policies to include a continuation of coverage option for laid-off workers. However, self-insured employers were not regulated by these state laws; self-insured plans were regulated at the federal level under ERISA. Health insurance coverage for affected workers and their families was not consistently available. \"COBRA\" refers to Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, which is regulated by the Department of Labor (DOL). The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) regulations are written by the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Employers must offer continued health insurance coverage at group rates to qualified employees and their families facing loss of coverage due to certain events. Coverage generally lasts 18 months but can be longer depending on circumstances. COBRA requirements also apply to self-insured firms. Compliance is necessary even if the employer does not contribute to the health plan. COBRA covers all employers except small employers with fewer than 20 employees, church plans, and federal, state, and local governments. Federal employees have temporary continuation of coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. State and local employees have continuation coverage mandated under the Public Health Service Act similar to COBRA's protections. A qualified beneficiary under COBRA is an employee, retiree, spouse, dependent child, or newly adopted child of a covered employee who loses health insurance coverage due to specific qualifying events. These events must result in the individual no longer being covered under the same terms and conditions as before. Qualifying events for COBRA continuation coverage include termination or reduction in hours for employees, leading to loss of health insurance benefits. Spouses and dependent children can also experience qualifying events such as death of the covered employee, divorce, or the end of a child's dependency under a parent's health insurance policy. Retiring employees must be offered access to COBRA or a retiree plan if no retiree health plan is available. If a covered employer offers no retiree health plan, the retiring employee must be offered COBRA coverage. If the employer offers a retiree health plan different from the coverage before retirement, COBRA coverage must also be offered. If the retiree plan meets COBRA requirements, the employer is not obligated to offer COBRA. If the plan is terminated early, COBRA coverage must be provided for the remaining period. If a retiree's health plan is terminated early, COBRA coverage must be offered for the remaining period. Retirees may also access COBRA coverage if their former employer terminates the retiree health plan under Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. This option is available to retirees receiving health insurance and can continue until their death. Spouses and dependent children can purchase COBRA coverage for 36 months after the retiree's death. The coverage must be identical to that provided to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries, ensuring equal access to health plan options. The duration of COBRA coverage varies depending on the qualifying event. For example, when a covered employee experiences a termination or reduction in hours, coverage for the employee, spouse, and dependent children may continue for 18 months. Retirees who lose retiree health insurance benefits due to their former employer's bankruptcy can elect COBRA coverage that lasts until their death. Spouses and dependent children can continue coverage for an additional 36 months after the retiree's death for other qualifying events like death of the employee or divorce. The duration of COBRA coverage varies depending on the qualifying event. For events like death of employee, divorce, or Medicare eligibility, coverage for qualified beneficiaries can be continued for 36 months. Disabled individuals may be eligible for an additional 11 months of coverage if onset of disability occurred within the first 60 days of COBRA coverage. This provision helps bridge the gap until Medicare coverage begins. For individuals with disabilities, there are waiting periods for Social Security disability cash benefits and Medicare benefits. COBRA coverage can end early under certain conditions, such as failure to make timely premium payments, employer no longer maintaining a group health plan, or becoming covered under another employer's plan. COBRA coverage may end early for various reasons, including failure to pay premiums, employer no longer offering a group health plan, or becoming covered under another employer's plan. If a COBRA beneficiary moves to a new area, the employer must provide coverage if possible under existing plans, even if it means offering alternative coverage available to other employee groups. If a COBRA beneficiary moves to a new area, the employer must provide coverage if possible under existing plans. COBRA coverage varies for Medicare beneficiaries depending on eligibility timing. Working Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to the same coverage as other employees, including family coverage. Qualifying events like retirement or job termination make beneficiaries eligible for 18 months of COBRA coverage, with family members eligible for up to 36 months. If a COBRA beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare, their coverage can last up to 36 months from the original qualifying event. However, if the individual is already receiving COBRA benefits and becomes eligible for Medicare within the 18-month period, their coverage can be terminated early. Family members can continue COBRA coverage for up to 36 months from the original qualifying event. Employers, employees, and health plan administrators must meet notification requirements. The employer, employees, and health plan administrators must meet notification requirements for COBRA. The plan administrator must notify employees and spouses of COBRA rights at the start of health plan coverage. If a qualifying event occurs, the employer must notify the plan administrator within 30 days. The plan administrator must then notify covered individuals of their right to elect continued coverage within 14 days. Employees must notify the employer or plan administrator within 60 days of certain events. COBRA beneficiaries must notify the plan administrator of disability within 60 days to be eligible for extended coverage. They have 60 days to elect COBRA coverage after receiving notice of their rights. Coverage is retroactive to the qualifying event date, and beneficiaries can waive and later revoke COBRA coverage. The Trade Act of 2002 provided a temporary extension of the COBRA election period for individuals eligible for the Health Coverage Tax Credit. Employers can charge 100% of the premium plus a 2% administrative fee for COBRA coverage. The employer may charge 150% of the premium for an additional 11 months of COBRA coverage for disabled individuals. The plan must allow monthly installment payments for coverage. Some states require insurers to offer the option of converting group coverage to individual coverage without medical screening. Moving from group to individual insurance market guarantees access to coverage under federal requirements or state mechanisms after exhausting all COBRA coverage. The conversion option to individual health insurance after exhausting COBRA coverage may have higher premiums but can be attractive for those with major illnesses or disabilities. Private group health plans face IRS excise tax penalties for COBRA violations, while ERISA imposes civil penalties for failure to provide COBRA notifications. State and local plans under the Public Health Service Act do not face the same financial penalties but employees have the right to seek equitable relief. Local employees have the right to take legal action if they are not provided with continuation health insurance coverage as required by COBRA. The law aims to provide access to group health insurance for those who lose employer-sponsored coverage, but it has limitations and can be costly for both employees and employers. Many COBRA beneficiaries are concerned about the high premiums, with average annual premiums in 2012 being $5,615 for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage. Under COBRA, former employees may have to pay up to 102% of the premium, which can be a financial burden. Employers are also worried about costs, as average claim costs for COBRA beneficiaries are 53% higher than for active employees. The average annual health insurance cost per active employee is $7,190, while COBRA costs $10,988, indicating a sicker population on COBRA. The 2% administrative fee allowed by law may not be enough to cover the difference in actual claims costs. The monthly expense of COBRA benefits leads to \"adverse selection\" among beneficiaries, with healthier individuals opting out and sicker individuals opting in. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not eliminate COBRA but introduced health insurance reforms in 2014. The impact of ACA provisions on demand for COBRA coverage may vary by individual. The impact of ACA provisions on demand for COBRA coverage may vary by individual. Some young and healthy individuals may find COBRA coverage more affordable than coverage in the exchange, while older workers may experience the opposite. Access to premium credits for individuals with income up to 400% of the federal poverty level may improve coverage affordability. Employers, health care policy groups, and benefit advisors foresee a continued role for COBRA, especially for those expecting to be re-employed with new health benefits. People with pre-existing conditions and a network of health care providers may prefer their COBRA coverage. The Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide \"Summaries of Benefits and Coverage\" to facilitate health benefits comparison for employees. The status of COBRA exchanges and the quality/cost of products are unknown. Statistical data on COBRA beneficiaries are sparse, with estimates from surveys showing a decline in the number of eligible individuals electing COBRA benefits. The average length of COBRA coverage has decreased over the years, with beneficiaries keeping coverage for shorter periods. Many workers are excluded from COBRA benefits, such as those who declined employer-sponsored benefits or work for small employers with fewer than 20 employees. COBRA coverage is not extended to individuals who work for an employer that does not offer group health insurance. Family members are not covered unless an employer offers a family option. If an employer declares bankruptcy or discontinues operation, COBRA is not an option. In 2009, The Commonwealth Fund estimated that about 66% of working Americans would qualify for COBRA benefits if unemployed. Currently, COBRA provides an exception for employers with fewer than 20 employees. About 18% of employees are not covered by COBRA due to working for small employers. In 2007, 5% of insured adults aged 19 to 64 were ineligible for COBRA due to employer size. Some states have \"mini-COBRA\" laws for smaller firms. Almost all Americans over 65 qualify for Medicare. In 2012, nearly 60% of Social Security beneficiaries retired before 65. Security beneficiaries who retired before age 65 often lose their health insurance from former employers. The number of employers offering retiree health benefits has been decreasing, with only 28% of large firms offering such benefits in 2010. Small firms are even less likely to provide retiree health coverage. COBRA coverage is important for retirees under 65 and near-elderly individuals aged 55 to 65. It provides a bridge to Medicare for those close to 65, but when benefits run out, finding health insurance can be challenging. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to extend COBRA coverage to additional people, but no major action was taken. The unemployment rate in the US peaked at 10% in October 2009, leading to concerns about underemployment for those who lost their jobs. The 111th Congress addressed the issue of many unemployed individuals not electing COBRA coverage by creating a temporary subsidy under the ARRA. The subsidy covered 65% of the COBRA premium for 15 months, with individuals paying the remaining balance. This provision, available to those who met income requirements and were involuntarily terminated between September 2008 and June 2010, has since expired."
