    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Industry-Based Education Support Act\" and amends the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act to include a grant program for curriculum and professional development. The Congress recognizes the importance of integrating academic and vocational education to improve student achievement and prepare them for the workforce. There is a need for new curricula and instructional materials at both secondary and postsecondary levels to provide students with the skills required for success in a global economy. The integration of academic and vocational education is crucial for preparing students for the global economy. Curricula and instructional materials should align with the needs of business and industry. Organizing education around career majors or industry clusters can reform high schools effectively. Professional development and technical assistance programs support collaboration among teachers to innovate in preparing students for the workforce. The purpose of this program is to assist educational agencies and schools in implementing industry-based learning, strengthening State School-to-Work transition systems, and integrating academic and vocational education. The program authorizes grants for improving curriculum, developing instructional materials, and providing professional development. To be eligible for a grant under this program, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information. Applications for curriculum and instructional materials development must integrate academic and vocational instruction, align with career pathways, and meet challenging State or local content standards. The grant program requires curriculum and materials to align with challenging State or local standards, reflect current skill standards, facilitate transition to post-secondary education or employment, meet admission requirements, and address the needs of all students. Special consideration is given to applications focusing on curriculum or materials development. Grants are available for curriculum and material development that align with professional development programs, encourage applied teaching methods, promote collaboration between educators, show potential for use in other educational agencies, and consider work-based learning opportunities for students. The development program supports innovative instructional methodologies integrating academic and vocational teaching, trains teachers to implement upgraded curricula, coordinates with professional development activities funded through other Federal programs, and aligns with challenging State content standards and student performance standards. The professional development program supports teachers in implementing upgraded curricula aligned with challenging State student performance standards. Funds can be used for professional development activities and planning time for teachers and school staff. The curr_chunk focuses on professional development activities for teachers, including programs to familiarize them with the local work environment, train teams of teachers, and prepare school personnel for work-based learning. The curr_chunk highlights the importance of professional development networks for teachers, training in educational technology, teacher evaluation techniques, and preparing staff for career guidance and counseling. State educational agencies can reserve up to 10% of funds to provide technical assistance to local educational agencies for curriculum development and implementation. Assistance can be given directly or through educational service agencies, higher education institutions, or consortia. This is in line with the requirements in section 394. Entities seeking grants under this part can submit a consolidated application with other relevant applications. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1996, with additional funding for fiscal years 1997 through 2000."
