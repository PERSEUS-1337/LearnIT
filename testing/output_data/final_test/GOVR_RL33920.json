    "content": "The report summarizes major legislative provisions in bills related to the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration during the 110th Congress. Despite extensive consideration, only short-term extensions were enacted, delaying reauthorization to the 111th Congress. The report discusses key provisions and policy issues debated during the legislative process. The report outlines key legislative provisions related to FAA reauthorization during the 110th Congress, organized into six major program areas. It focuses on communicating legislative provisions without delving into specific policy issues, with separate reports available for in-depth policy discussions. The FAA reauthorization debate in the 110th Congress focused on funding authorization for aviation programs and the existing tax and fee structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund. The House passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 2881) during the first session. The Senate has not yet debated on H.R. 2881, S. 1300, and S. 2345. Revenue collections for the FAA have continued through appropriations legislation. The program was extended until June 30, 2008, by the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2008. The Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2008 further extended tax authorization and expenditure authority. The Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-330) extended Trust Fund tax authorization and Airport Improvement Program expenditure authority through FY2008. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2009 provided funding for FAA programs until March 6, 2009, with increased funding for operations and a requirement to spend $1,099 million on aviation safety activities. The FAA began the legislative process to reauthorize funding in FY2008 with proposals for a new financing system, including user fees and excise taxes primarily for commercial system users. Bills were introduced in the House (H.R. 1356) and Senate (S. 1076) based on the FAA's proposal. The FAA proposal includes charges for commercial system users and excise taxes for general aviation system users. It also suggests modifications to airport revenues, such as increasing passenger facility charges and simplifying grant apportionment. Additionally, the proposal recommends management reforms like establishing an air transportation system advisory board and creating a commission for realignment and consolidation of FAA facilities. Proposed statutory language aims to integrate the work of the Joint Planning and Development Office. The FAA proposal aims to integrate the work of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) on the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) into ongoing planning and acquisition activities. It includes language to increase flexibility in delivering air traffic services, allowing airports and private entities to play a more direct role. The proposal also seeks statutory authority to control congestion at certain airports through market-based mechanisms like slot auctions and peak-period pricing. The Department of Transportation would study the appropriateness of a market-based system at New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA). The FAA proposal includes measures to address congestion at airports through market-based mechanisms and funding for research on technology to reduce environmental impacts of aviation. It also recommends establishing a consortium for innovation in developing cleaner aircraft. The FAA proposal aims to introduce quieter and more efficient aircraft, limit the Air Tour Management Program to parks with identified concerns, and modify the Essential Air Service Program. Senator Rockefeller introduced the Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2007, which was favorably reported with amendments by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The reported bill S. 1300 proposes a four-year reauthorization with modest increases to FAA's spending levels. It offers an alternative user fee structure by creating the Air Traffic Modernization Fund financed through $25 surcharges on certain flights. Airlines and high-performance business jet operators would primarily pay the surcharge, exempting piston-engine powered aircraft. Over $400 million for FAA's Facility and Equipment account is to be derived from these surcharges. The bill S. 1300 proposes a four-year reauthorization with modest increases to FAA's spending levels. It creates the Air Traffic Modernization Fund financed through $25 surcharges on certain flights. Over $400 million for FAA's Facility and Equipment account is to be derived from these surcharges each year from FY2009 through FY2011. The FAA is given specific authority to collect these surcharges and impose sanctions on non-payers. Additionally, the Department of Transportation is authorized to issue up to $5 billion in obligations, repaid through revenues from the surcharges. S. 1300 proposes organizational reform for the FAA, creating a smaller oversight board with authority over planning, budgeting, and modernization. It includes $100 million annual increases to the Airport Improvement Program through FY2011. The bill S. 1300 proposes a pilot program at six airports to collect Passenger Facility Charges directly from passengers without a statutory ceiling on the amount charged. It also includes provisions for customer service improvements for passenger airlines, ensuring adequate food, water, and restroom facilities during substantial flight delays. Airlines would be required to provide consumer rights information and customer service policies on their websites. S. 1300 would expand DOT's consumer complaint investigations and require airlines to publish customer service and flight delay history information. It would also mandate agencies involved in the NGATS initiative to establish implementation offices and budget commitments. The bill extends $50 million annually to JPDO through FY2011 but does not establish a commission for FAA facility consolidation. S. 1300 does not establish a commission for FAA facility consolidation but instead creates the Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board to review realignment recommendations. It includes provisions for involving the Federal Services Impasses Panel in cases of bargaining disputes and outlines a process for binding arbitration. The bill also addresses system capacity and safety improvements, such as runway safety and expedited rulemaking. S. 1300 includes provisions to improve runway safety, enhance airliner fuel tank safety, address pilot fatigue and rest requirements, implement NTSB recommendations for helicopter emergency medical service operations, regulate unmanned flight operations, and enhance wake turbulence prediction. It also aims to expand flights at Washington Reagan National Airport and address environment and energy issues through research and mitigation grants, as well as establishing a program to develop synthetic jet fuel from clean coal sources. The bill S. 1300 aims to improve runway safety, fuel tank safety, pilot fatigue regulations, and other aviation safety measures. It also includes provisions for expanding flights at Washington Reagan National Airport and addressing environmental issues through research and grants. Additionally, the bill proposes the development of synthetic jet fuel from clean coal sources and changes to the Air Tour Management Program and Essential Air Service Program. The bill S. 1300 includes provisions for improving aviation safety measures, expanding flights at Washington Reagan National Airport, addressing environmental issues, developing synthetic jet fuel, and making changes to the Air Tour Management Program and Essential Air Service Program. Additionally, the bill proposes financial incentives for improvements to EAS service and aid for the conversion of former EAS airports to general aviation status. The Senate Committee on Finance reported S. 2345, which incorporates recommendations for the revenue title of the Senate FAA reauthorization bill, including changes to the tax and fee structure. The Senate Finance bill proposes changes to the existing tax and fee structure for aviation, including increasing the general aviation jet fuel tax and international departure/arrival tax. It also introduces a new tax system for fractionally owned aircraft. Representative Oberstar introduced the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 2881) with amendments made by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The amended bill and committee report are not yet publicly available. The Federal Aviation Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 2698) was introduced by Representative Udall, covering FAA research programs. The bill was favorably reported with amendments by the House Committee on Science and Technology. Funding authorization levels and provisions from H.R. 2698 were included in H.R. 2881. Additionally, provisions from H.R. 3539 on Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes were adopted into H.R. 2881. H.R. 2881, passed by the House, includes a boost in F&E spending for NGATS initiatives and increased funding for FAA RE&D activities. Title X of the bill, adopted from H.R. 3539, focuses on Airport and Airway Trust Fund financing. The House-passed H.R. 2881 bill includes raising jet fuel taxes to 35.9 cents per gallon and aviation gasoline taxes to 24.1 cents per gallon. It also maintains funding levels for the AIP program and allows for increased PFC collections. H.R. 2881 would allow for an increase in Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) up to $7 per passenger, with a cap of $28 on round trip tickets. The bill also includes a study on proposing different PFC rates for connecting passengers versus origin and destination passengers. Additionally, the bill sets state apportionments for Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding at 10% of total amounts, with a minimum of $300 million as long as total AIP funding remains above $3 billion. Nonprimary airports would continue to receive $150,000 or one fifth of estimated five year development costs in apportionments. The bill also raises the required air carrier approval for airport privatization from 65% to 75%. H.R. 2881 raises air carrier approval for airport privatization from 65% to 75% and excludes airports in the privatization pilot program from AIP funds. The bill also includes provisions for passenger airline service, such as adjusting denied boarding compensation regulations every two years and requiring carrier reporting on diverted and cancelled flights. Additionally, contingency plans for passenger care during ground delays must be submitted to DOT. The bill H.R. 2881 includes provisions for passenger airline service, requiring airlines to submit plans for ground delays to DOT, share facilities, and inform passengers of insecticides used on board. It also establishes a consumer complaints hotline, an advisory committee for passenger protection, and mandates audits on flight delays. Additionally, it aligns with FAA proposals for modernization initiatives. H.R. 2881 mandates agencies to designate senior officials for NGATS oversight, develop integrated work plans, tie plans to budgets, and allocate funds for airspace redesign. It also requires GAO to monitor progress, establishes an FAA working group on facility consolidation, and authorizes additional appropriations for aviation system capacity enhancements. The FAA working group, established by H.R. 2881, includes representation for regional office employees and oversees FAA regional office consolidation. The bill also creates a public-private partnership for NGATS technologies testing and establishes a NextGen Research and Development Center of Excellence for educational and technical assistance. The FAA is required to involve affected employees in the process. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure adopted an amendment requiring binding arbitration to resolve impasses in contract negotiations for FAA personnel management. H.R. 2881 would invalidate FAA contract actions taken after July 10, 2005, potentially undoing the FAA contract with air traffic controllers. The provision allows affected employees to receive \"back pay\" of any additional salary increase included in the negotiated settlement, with $20 million authorized for this purpose. H.R. 2881 authorizes $20 million for negotiated settlements and includes studies on FAA technical training, inspector staffing levels, and air traffic controller staffing. It also calls for increased funding for inspectors, safety technicians, and operational support staffing, as well as a study on front line manager staffing requirements. Additionally, the bill seeks to establish a university center of excellence for aviation employment and create a task force to assess FAA air traffic control facilities. H.R. 2881 addresses slot issues at Washington Reagan National Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and other congested airports. It allows for voluntary schedule reductions among air carriers and authorizes the FAA to take action if needed. An amendment requires GAO to assess the situation. H.R. 2881 includes provisions for reducing airspace congestion, improving runway safety, and addressing fuel tank flammability on large transport aircraft. It also mandates studies on pilot fatigue and directs the FAA to implement necessary measures. The bill H.R. 2881 mandates studies on pilot fatigue and requires the FAA to implement recommendations for flight attendant fatigue. It also includes provisions for rewriting flight and duty time regulations for pilots, establishing safety standards for flight attendants, and restricting non-certified maintenance providers. Flight attendants and gate agents must receive specific training in serving alcohol and handling disruptive passengers. The bill H.R. 2881 requires FAA-certified repair stations for airline maintenance, restricts non-certificated maintenance providers to non-routine work, extends drug and alcohol testing to foreign repair stations, and mandates a plan for integrating commercial unmanned aircraft into national airspace by FY2012. H.R. 2881 authorizes funding for wake vortex mitigation technologies and requires the FAA to study the feasibility of creating a searchable database for wind turbine installations near aviation sites. It also mandates updates to aircraft rescue and firefighting standards at commercial airports. H.R. 2881 includes provisions for developing CLEEN engine technology, addressing aircraft greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative jet fuels, and establishing environmental standards for NextGen technologies. It also criticizes the EU's emissions trading scheme and calls for cooperation through ICAO. H.R. 2881 includes provisions for funding environmental mitigation grants, a pilot program for aircraft departure queue management, and integrating engine noise and emissions standards development between the FAA and EPA. It also prohibits non-Stage 3 compliant jets under 75,000 pounds after 2012 and calls for noise compatibility planning studies at various airports. The bill H.R. 2881 includes provisions for funding airport environmental issues, studying lead-free fuels for aircraft, and addressing aircraft noise in national parks. It also allocates funds for the Essential Air Service program and encourages financial incentives for EAS. The bill H.R. 2881 includes provisions for funding airport environmental issues, studying lead-free fuels for aircraft, addressing aircraft noise in national parks, and creating an Office of Rural Aviation within DOT. It allows state and local governments to restore an airport's EAS eligibility status by offering proposals to reduce subsidies, clarifies definitions related to U.S. airlines owned by foreign entities, and limits express carrier employees covered under the Railway Labor Act to certain aviation-related functions. The Railway Labor Act (RLA) covers certain aviation-related functions, while express carrier employees like delivery truck drivers fall under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The FAA's funding authorization levels are split among four principal accounts, but a restructuring is proposed starting in FY2008. FedEx opposes the measure supported by labor unions and UPS, as their employees are primarily covered under the NLRA. The FAA is proposing a restructuring of its accounts to separate operational activities from regulatory functions. S. 1300 aims to reauthorize the existing FAA accounts, making funding comparisons difficult. The FAA also suggests new user-fee funding mechanisms, shifting revenue determination to the FAA Administrator. This complicates funding comparisons among the bills. Funding mechanisms and levels are described, with more details on the proposed revenue system in the section \"Proposed Tax and Fee Structure.\" The FAA is proposing a restructuring of its accounts to separate operational activities from regulatory functions. The proposed new accounts include the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) account and the Safety and Operations account, replacing the current O&M and F&E accounts. There is not a one-to-one relationship between the current accounts and the proposed accounts, with some functions mapping into the Safety and Operations account and others into the Air Traffic Organization account. The FAA is proposing a new accounting structure to separate operational functions from regulatory responsibilities. The Safety and Operations and Air Traffic Organization accounts would be funded through user fees, while RE&D would be funded through a combination of Airport and Airway Trust Fund and General Fund contributions. Table 1 shows proposed funding authorizations from the Airport and Airways Trust Fund and caps on General Fund contributions over a three-year period. The FAA proposal includes larger contributions from the AATF in FY2008 during the transition to a user fee-based system. User fees would cover a large part of FAA's costs for ATO and Safety and Operations accounts in FY2009 and FY2010. The AIP program account and RE&D account would still rely on AATF for revenue, with additional funding from the General Fund. Maximum General Fund contributions would remain flat at around $2.5 billion, which is lower than recent years and concerning to critics. The FAA proposal suggests shifting costs to user fees due to rising expenses, with the FAA administrator gaining fee-setting authority. The bill does not specify revenue projections from fee collections. The O&M account would see a 7.7% increase in authorized levels for FY2008 under S. 1300, with modest increases in subsequent years. Labor cost increases in FY2007 led to O&M appropriations exceeding authorized amounts. Under S. 1300, the FAA's O&M account would see a 7.7% increase in authorized levels for FY2008, with subsequent modest increases. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) would continue to receive $100 million annual increases through FY2011. The Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account would see a notable increase, with a 3.7% increase in FY2008, followed by a 13% increase in FY2009, and more modest increases in the following years. S. 1300 proposes significant funding increases for FAA Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) starting in FY2009, with a 36% increase compared to FY2008 levels. This would be followed by flat funding of about $190 million annually through FY2011 to support progress on NextGen development. H.R. 2881 proposes increased funding for FAA's research and development, with higher levels for the F&E account compared to S. 1300. It suggests a 25% increase in FY2008 authorizations for F&E spending and substantial increases for RE&D activities, tripling the funding in FY2008 and further increasing by 44% in FY2009. Authorized funding levels for FAA's research and development (RE&D) would increase to $515 million in FY2011, a significant rise from the current appropriated levels of $131 million. There is ongoing debate about the sustainability of the existing trust fund-based financing system for FAA, with some advocating for a new funding system tied to aviation industry activity. Congress will need to consider these differing viewpoints during reauthorization. The Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing Reform Act of 2007 proposes significant changes to FAA aviation finance, transitioning to a system based on new direct fees, excise taxes, and general fund monies over a three-year authorization period. The trust fund's role in funding the agency would be reduced, with a mix of direct fees, excise taxes, and general funds used to pay for the FAA's operations. The FAA's ATO activities would be funded by a mix of direct fees, excise taxes, and general funds. Safety activities would primarily be funded from general funds, with the option for user fees related to registration and certification. Excise taxes would support the aviation trust fund, AIP, RE&D, and EAS programs. The proposal does not set new user fee rates but establishes a framework for fee setting, with the Administrator having the final decision. A new financial structure would align with the new funding regime. The FAA is proposing a new financial structure to fund its ATO activities through user fees, with support from excise taxes and general funds for safety activities. The proposal includes creating new Treasury accounts for user fees, establishing a reserve fund, and issuing bonds for equipment acquisition. The controversial proposal has received support from the Air Transport Association but faced opposition from other aviation interest groups. Congressional hearings have been held on the proposal embodied in H.R. 1356 / S. 1076. The FAA is proposing a new financial structure to fund its ATO activities through user fees, with support from excise taxes and general funds for safety activities. The proposal does not recommend a specific user fee structure but lists criteria for setting fee levels. Specific ATO user fees can be set for enroute, oceanic, and terminal area flight activity, based on distance traveled or other methods consistent with international agreements. The Administrator must consult with affected parties before establishing a fee structure. The FAA is proposing a new financial structure to fund its ATO activities through user fees, with support from excise taxes and general funds for safety activities. Overflight fees would be eliminated, and flights would be subject to enroute and oceanic fee system. Terminal area fees could be differentiated based on various factors like aircraft takeoffs/landings, weight, operations at large hub airports, and time of day. User fees would be imposed on all commercial users of ATO services. The FAA proposes a new financial structure for funding ATO activities through user fees and excise taxes. GA aircraft would be subject to terminal-related fees at congested large hub airports, with fees set in relation to costs incurred for providing ATO services. Incentives could be offered for equipment that enhances aircraft operation, and a reserve fund would be established for system revenue shortfalls. Funding would also come from excise taxes, including a proposed 70-cent-per-gallon fuel tax on all GA aircraft. The FAA proposes a 70-cent-per-gallon fuel tax on all GA users, with 56.4 cents for ATO activities and 13.6 cents for the aviation trust fund. The tax would be indexed to inflation and can be adjusted by the Administrator. Differentiation between turbine and piston aircraft users would no longer be necessary due to higher fuel use rates of turbine aircraft. Safety and non-ATO operations would be funded by Treasury general funds, with additional registration fees for specified services. The legislation proposes various fees for FAA certification activities, with costs set by the Administrator to correspond to the services provided. The trust fund's main revenue sources would be a 13.6-cent-per-gallon tax on all aircraft and an international arrivals/departure fee of $6.39 per event, both adjustable for inflation and FAA cost allocation. The FAA proposal includes a 13-member Board to advise the Administrator on user fees and other issues. Board members represent various stakeholders in the aviation industry and are appointed by the Secretary of Transportation. The FAA proposal includes a 13-member Board to advise the Administrator on user fees and other issues. The Board's principal duty is to help with the creation of the new user fee system. The Administrator can consult with the Board on fee recommendations, but ultimately has the authority to set fees. The Board does not have automatic power to exercise its advisory role. The legislation proposes giving the Board advisory power without automatic authority in public forums. The Board may not have access to certain information unless provided by the Administrator. The FAA would undergo reorganization with user fees deposited into new Treasury accounts. The trust fund would remain intact, and a new collection system would be needed for the new user fees. The Administrator would be responsible for overseeing this process. The FAA proposal includes creating a new collection system for user fees, with the Administrator overseeing the process. The proposal may remove FAA spending from the discretionary budget, potentially conflicting with pay-as-you-go rules. The impact on congressional budget and appropriations processes remains uncertain. The FAA proposal could result in changes to congressional finance committees' jurisdiction over FAA tax and fee setting. The Administrator would have fee-setting powers, with oversight from the Secretary of Transportation to issue Treasury bonds for the NGATS program. The FAA proposal allows for up to $5 billion in Treasury bonds to be issued to finance the NGATS program. User fees could be increased to repay the bonds with interest, and the additional revenues would go directly to the Treasury for full repayment by the end of FY2017. This bonding concept would provide a dedicated revenue stream to the ATO account, allowing the FAA to better plan technology and equipment upgrades over an extended period. The FAA proposal includes authorization levels for technology upgrades and equipment over FY2008-FY2010, totaling nearly $28 billion. However, comparisons to previous legislation are challenging due to excluded funding for user-fee funded ATO activities. S. 1300 maintains current FAA funding structure with some modifications. The Commerce Committee's bill, S. 1300, maintains the FAA's funding structure with modifications. It does not include tax and fee provisions, unlike the Senate Committee on Finance's proposal. The Finance Committee rejects a user fee system for aviation finance. The differing views of the committees are expected to be reconciled before S. 1300 is considered on the Senate floor. The contentious element of S. 1300 is a $25 surcharge on flights in the national airspace system to fund FAA costs for the NGATS modernization program. Revenues will go to a new Treasury air traffic modernization fund, overseen by the Senate Commerce committee. The bill exempts certain aircraft from the surcharge. The $25 surcharge on flights in the national airspace system to fund FAA costs for the NGATS modernization program exempts certain aircraft, including piston powered aircraft, turboprop and turbojet aircraft operating outside of controlled airspace, certain intrastate flights in Alaska and Hawaii, military and public aircraft, air ambulance aircraft, agricultural aircraft, and Canada-to-Canada flights. The surcharge is payable to the Administrator of the FAA, who is responsible for implementing the collection process with limited guidance provided in the bill. Penalties are included for non-payment of the surcharge, with a portion of the annual F&E budget beginning in FY2009 allocated for this purpose. The provision in the bill allocates funding for the annual F&E budget starting at $412 million in FY2009, increasing to $423 million and $436 million in the following years. Aircraft filing flight plans with the FAA must indicate if the flight is for commercial purposes. The GA community opposes the surcharge, considering it a user fee that places additional demands on the ATC system. The airline industry supports the surcharge proposal to have all system users, including corporate aviation, pay for their fair share of ATC system costs. The Senate Commerce Committee was split on the surcharge proposal, with Senator Ted Stevens changing his vote to move it for future consideration. There are questions about the adequacy of a $25 surcharge to cover the necessary funding. The $25 surcharge may not be enough to fund modernization as authorized in S. 1300. Additional revenue sources like fuel tax increases are being considered by the Senate Committee on Finance. S. 1300 provides up to $5 billion in bonding authority for NGATS projects, with funds available from FY2009 through FY2025. S. 1300 provides up to $5 billion in bonding authority for NGATS projects from FY2025. Bonds would be used to pay for projects listed in the FAA's Capital Improvement Program, with repayment from surcharges in the modernization fund. The bill creates a powerful seven-member Oversight Board appointed by the President. The Oversight Board, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, consists of key members including the Administrator of the FAA, a DOD representative, a public interest representative, airport and airline CEOs, a labor organization representative, and a GA industry representative. The Board has advisory and approval authority over FAA actions, including reviewing and advising on modernization, budget, and cost accounting activities, the FAA strategic plan, ATC efficiency, and approving capital expenditures over $100 million for ATC system modernization and the FAA's F&E budget. The Oversight Board, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, has advisory and approval authority over FAA actions, including modernization, budget, and cost accounting activities. They approve capital expenditures over $100 million for ATC system modernization, the FAA's F&E budget, and key personnel appointments. Members must have expertise in aviation and organizational subject areas, with no financial interests or ties to aviation lobbying groups. The Board can choose its own leadership, with a simple majority quorum for decision-making. The proposed Oversight Board for the NGATS implementation process raises questions about executive branch authority, particularly regarding the equal status given to the FAA Administrator and the representative of FAA's labor unions. The structure allows the Board to choose its own Chairman, potentially giving the labor representative powers normally associated with the executive branch, especially in budget issues. The proposed Oversight Board for the NGATS implementation process includes a requirement for Administrator approval before submitting the FAA budget to OMB, potentially slowing down the approval process. Questions arise about the qualifications of Board members, such as potential conflicts of interest. The bill also mandates a member representing the public interest to have a fiduciary responsibility, but lacks details on this role. The proposed legislation allows the Administrator to withhold certain information from the Oversight Board if it reveals proprietary or commercial information. This exclusion of information, especially regarding capital improvement projects, raises concerns. The Senate Committee on Finance reported an original bill, S. 2345, the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, on November 13, 2007. The Senate Committee on Finance reported a bill, the American Infrastructure Investment and Improvement Act of 2007, which proposes changes to the tax and fee structure for the aviation industry. The bill increases the general aviation jet fuel tax, international departure/arrival tax, and introduces a new tax system for fractionally owned aircraft. This new system treats fractionally owned aircraft as part of the general aviation industry for fuel tax purposes and imposes a flat fee departure tax on the aircraft. The Finance Committee bill proposes changes to the tax and fee structure for the aviation industry, including a flat fee departure tax on aircraft. Additional revenues collected would be reserved for NGATS related activities. There is a difference of opinion between the Finance Committee and the Commerce Committee on the need for a surcharge, which needs to be resolved before the FAA reauthorization bill is completed in the Senate. The Senate is considering competing proposals for additional financing of the FAA, with the Commerce Committee favoring a surcharge approach while the Finance Committee opposes user fees. The fate of the surcharge proposal will be decided by the full Senate. The House bill also rejects the Bush Administration's financing proposal and increases general aviation gasoline and jet fuel taxes. The bill proposes an increase in fuel taxes for funding NGATS-related programs and adjusts overflight fees to cover air traffic services costs. Altitude is excluded as a factor in fee adjustments. Additionally, fees for aircraft registration and other FAA documentation will remain at current levels. The House bill, H.R. 2881, does not follow the Administration's proposal to impose new fees for FAA's large aircraft certification programs and other activities. It suggests modest increases in fuel taxes instead of major tax and fee changes, indicating a belief that the existing tax system only needs minor adjustments to support increased FAA spending. This view is shared by the general aviation industry. The GA industry largely supports robust FAA spending in the future, unlike airlines and airports. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport development, focusing on capital improvements for aircraft operations. AIP funds cannot be used for operational expenses or bond repayments, and are distributed as formula or discretionary grants. Small airports rely more on AIP grants compared to larger airports, which can generate revenue from user fees and access the bond market easily. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) program provides non-federal funds for airport projects, complementing AIP spending. PFC is a local tax on boarding passengers, used for a wider range of projects than AIP grants, including bond repayments. The FAA proposal (H.R. 1356/S. 1076) aims to make significant changes to both AIP and PFC programs. The proposal aims to make major changes in both the AIP and PFC programs, reducing the size of AIP while increasing the role of PFCs in airport finance. It would broaden allowable costs under both programs and change the distribution of AIP grants. S. 1300 retains the basic AIP program size and funding distribution, with an increase in authorization level. H.R. 2881 also maintains the basic AIP program structure. H.R. 2881 would increase the program's authorization level by $100 million annually for four years and raise the PFC cap to $7, emphasizing the role of PFC in airport finance. Both S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 make changes to AIP and PFC programs without restructuring them significantly. Funding levels for AIP are reduced under the FAA proposal, with $2.75 billion recommended for FY2008. The proposal recommends increasing AIP funding to $2.75 billion for FY2008, $2.9 billion for FY2009, and $3.05 billion for FY2010. The FAA's analysis suggests that raising the PFC ceiling and eliminating AIP entitlements for large and medium airports reduces the need for AIP funding. Despite the Bush Administration's proposals to reduce AIP spending, Congress consistently restores it to near authorized levels. Some in the transportation community believe cutting AIP helps keep overall FAA reauthorization totals down. The Administration's financing proposal for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund would support AIP spending directly through aviation fuel taxes. The Administration's proposal for AIP funding suggests a smaller increase in aviation fuel tax due to lower spending on AIP. The link between AIP spending and fuel tax could hinder funding increases. S. 1300 recommends increasing AIP authorization to $3.8 billion for FY2008, $3.9 billion for FY2009, $4.0 billion for FY2010, and $4.1 billion for FY2011. The $100 million per year growth in the program extends funding growth in Vision 100, providing an aggregate additional authorization of $1 billion for AIP over four years. H.R. 2881 and S. 1300 would provide the same amounts, with changes in the distribution of AIP funds based on entitlements. The FAA proposal would eliminate the current formula apportionments for AIP entitlements. The FAA proposal eliminates the lower entitlement level in favor of higher distribution levels and minimums. It also removes the $3.2 billion trigger designed to encourage funding above that level. S. 1300 does not include a provision to eliminate the trigger, potentially cutting airport funding in half. The FAA proposal in H.R. 2881 recommends authorization levels above the trigger, allowing for possible AIP reductions without triggering entitlement distribution. The bill phases out formula funding for large and medium hub airports by FY2010, with a transition period at 50% funding levels for FY2008 and FY2009. This reduction is offset by an increase in the PFC ceiling. The FAA proposal in H.R. 2881 recommends phasing out formula funding for large and medium hub airports by FY2010, with a transition period at 50% funding levels for FY2008 and FY2009. Large and medium airports charging PFCs above $4.50 would have their entitlement funding reduced by 100% of projected PFC revenues, but not more than 100% of the amount that would be apportioned. The special rule enacted after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks allowed some airports to continue receiving their annual primary airport entitlements, even if their passenger boardings fell below the required minimum levels. The FY2006 Transportation/Treasury Appropriations Act extended this eligibility but at a reduced entitlement of $500,000, with the intent that FY2006 be the last year for these entitlements. This reduces the funding available for discretionary spending after all entitlement requirements are met. The FAA proposal aims to repeal the special rule allowing airports to retain primary airport status despite low passenger boardings. S. 1300 would extend the virtual primary category for FY2008-FY2011, with modifications based on passenger boarding averages. Additionally, the bill includes provisions to potentially designate new virtual primary airports by amending existing regulations. S. 1300 aims to modify the criteria for airports to retain primary status, allowing for Essential Air Service airports with passenger boardings below 9,700, commercial service airports counting nonscheduled service, or single carrier airports with a 4% decline in scheduled flights due to severe weather. The bill also includes a provision for DOT to use the last year an airport exceeded 10,000 boardings to determine primary status for FY2009-FY2011. The bill S. 1300 aims to modify criteria for airports to retain primary status, including provisions for Essential Air Service airports, commercial service airports, and single carrier airports. It also addresses entitlement funding differences and minimum entitlements for Puerto Rico. H.R. 2881 does not include provisions for virtual primary airports. The FAA proposal would change the funding sources for general aviation entitlements, separating State Apportionment and General Aviation apportionment. It would allocate 10% of AIP funds for State Apportionment distribution only. The FAA proposal would change the funding sources for general aviation entitlements, separating State Apportionment and General Aviation apportionment. It would allocate 10% of AIP funds for State Apportionment distribution only. State apportionment distribution would be determined based on a state-based population and area formula, with a $300 million minimum apportionment. Nonprimary airports would receive funding based on the number of registered aircraft at the airport, with three tiers of entitlement funding distribution. The FAA proposal would allocate 10% of AIP funds for State Apportionment distribution only, with a $300 million minimum apportionment. Nonprimary airports with 10 to 49 based aircraft could qualify for state apportionment funds and discretionary grants with a 95% federal share. The below-trigger language is eliminated, and GA entitlements would remain essentially the same as under current law. The FAA proposal would allocate 10% of AIP funds for State Apportionment distribution with a $300 million minimum. Nonprimary airport entitlements would be prorated if funds fall below $300 million, and cargo service airports would continue to receive 3.5% of AIP funding. The FAA proposal would allocate 10% of AIP funds for State Apportionment distribution with a $300 million minimum. Cargo Service Airports apportionment would increase to 4% of AIP funding. H.R. 2881 makes no changes in the Cargo Service Airport apportionment. S. 1300 requires FAA to establish a pilot program allowing local airport operators to use their AIP formula funds for planning and site preparation for property redevelopment. The House bill includes a provision for a pilot program allowing up to four airports to receive AIP grants for joint planning, engineering design, and environmental permitting for property redevelopment. This aims to encourage compatible land uses with the airport and generate economic benefits. The discretionary fund includes AIP funding not distributed under entitlements and forgone PFC revenues. The FAA proposal, S. 1300, and H.R. 2881 aim to set the minimum amount for discretionary grants at $520 million per year, dropping the letter of intent language. This provision is not currently a factor in AIP funding due to historically high funding levels since FY2001. The FAA proposes to replace the 35% noise set-aside with an 8% environmental set-aside for AIP apportioned funds. Eligible projects include water quality mitigation and environmental research. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 both suggest a $300 million annual discretionary set-aside for AIP noise program costs, with water quality projects also eligible. The FAA proposal would eliminate the small airport fund, funded by forgone entitlement funding from medium and large hub airports for permission to impose PFCs. The FAA is proposing to phase out the Small Airport Fund, which is currently funded by forgone entitlement funding from medium and large hub airports in exchange for permission to impose PFCs. The proposal includes setting aside 20% of discretionary funds for small hub, nonhub, nonprimary commercial service, reliever, or general aviation airports to compensate for the loss of the Small Airport Fund. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 do not include similar provisions, and both set-asides would be eliminated. Additionally, S. 1300 does not include a proposal similar to the FAA's regarding AIP eligibilities for MAP. The FAA proposal under H.R. 2881 retains the MAP program and reliever set asides. It expands AIP eligibility to include various aeronautical support facilities at nonprimary airports, such as fuel farms and hangar buildings. Mobile refueler parking within a fuel farm would be eligible if it meets EPA requirements. Up to $10 million in AIP grants could be used for commercial space infrastructure development. The FAA proposal includes eligibility for AIP funding for airport-owned facilities relocation due to design standards, reducing passenger aircraft size requirements for purchasing firefighting equipment, defining \"general aviation airport,\" and allowing AIP funding for environmental review costs. H.R. 2881 mirrors the FAA proposal on AIP project eligibility, including provisions for revenue-producing aeronautical support facilities and lowering passenger aircraft size requirements for firefighting equipment. It also redefines terminal development to include passenger terminal buildings and gates. H.R. 2881 redefines terminal development to include airport passenger terminal buildings, access roads, and walkways exclusively for airport traffic. It clarifies repayment for terminal development under certain circumstances and includes projects for energy-efficient practices like providing air conditioning and heating to parked aircraft. Airport planning now includes developing an environmental management system. The FAA proposal includes changes to AIP grant assurances, allowing funds to replace or move facilities due to uncontrollable causes. It also addresses the disposition of profits from land sales originally acquired for noise compatibility, now allowing reinvestment in other projects. The proposed change in AIP grant assurances would allow proceeds from land sales to be reinvested in other projects at the airport, prioritizing noise compatibility and environmentally related projects. Current federal funding shares for AIP projects vary based on airport size and participation in state block grant programs. The FAA proposal aims to modify federal-local matching share requirements for airports, allowing for more efficient use of AIP funds. This change could potentially lead to concerns among small airport advocates regarding discretionary grants being offered at less than the maximum federal share. The FAA proposal aims to modify federal-local matching share requirements for airports, potentially lowering the maximum federal share for certain projects at large and medium hub airports. Additionally, small airports may see a decrease in federal share for AIP grants, while general aviation airports with fewer than 10 based aircraft could receive up to a 95% federal share on their grants. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 propose changes to federal share requirements for airports, with a focus on maintaining a 95% federal share for smaller airports and economically depressed communities. The bills also include special rules for airports transitioning between hub classifications to retain higher federal shares for a limited period. The proposed rule for \"Economically Depressed Communities\" would maintain a 95% federal share for airport projects meeting specific criteria outlined in 42 U.S.C. 3161(a) as determined by the Secretary of Commerce. The criteria include per capita income, unemployment rate, and special economic needs. The FAA proposes changes to airport funding eligibility criteria, including maintaining a 95% federal share for EAS airports under H.R. 2881. Non-EAS airports would revert to a 90% federal share. The proposal expands eligible capital costs and allows PFC funding for ground access projects, easing current limitations on PFC use. The FAA proposes changes to airport funding eligibility criteria, including allowing airports to impose PFCs above $3 for surface transportation projects with adequate financing. Airlines may object to this broadening of PFC eligibility. The proposal also includes a change in language for the use of revenues, allowing for use on facilities related to air transportation but not owned or operated by the airport. S. 1300 does not include the FAA's broadening of PFC project eligibility. The FAA proposed changes to airport funding eligibility criteria, including allowing PFC funding for intermodal ground access projects. S. 1300 does not include this broadening of PFC project eligibility but does make changes to section 40117 (d) to restrict limitations on approving applications for intermodal ground access projects. This would free up PFC applications for other types of projects and eliminate certain limitations for all PFC applications. The Secretary of DOT must find that PFC projects will enhance capacity, safety, or security of the national air transportation system, reduce airport noise, or promote competition among air carriers. The bill eliminates the requirement for airports to prove adequate financing for airside needs to impose fees above $3. H.R. 2881 includes new PFC eligibility provisions, such as funding for secure bicycle storage facilities at airports. The FAA proposal in H.R. 2881 includes provisions for airports to install bicycle parking, make noise mitigation for schools in Los Angeles eligible for PFC funding, and establish a pilot program for PFC funds for intermodal ground access projects at 5 airports. The maximum PFC charge would increase to $6 per passenger boarding, with charges over $4.50 requiring medium and large hub airports to forego AIP entitlement funding. The bill in the pilot program allows for PFCs above the existing $4.50 cap at $5, $6, and $7 levels. Large hub airports imposing a PFC above $4.50 would forego AIP entitlements. H.R. 2881 includes a provision for a study on the impacts of accommodating connecting passengers with different PFC levels. The proposal includes a pilot program at up to six airports allowing them to collect a PFC with no fee ceiling, to be collected directly from passengers. The FAA suggests eliminating the requirement for large or medium hub airports to submit a competition plan to receive AIP or PFC grants. The bill extends the competition plan requirement for airports, streamlining the PFC review and approval process. Airports would submit an annual PFC status report for existing projects, while new projects would require a notice and comment period for carriers and public notice. Once the status report is submitted, no further action is needed for implementation. The bill proposes a streamlined process for airports to collect Passenger Facility Charges (PFC). It includes a notice and comment period for carriers and a public notice period before filing the PFC status report. The airport can start collecting the new PFC once the report is filed, but objections can be filed, potentially leading to the termination of the airport's authority to collect PFC revenues. The proposal also allows for investigations into excessive charges or revenue diversion. The bill aligns closely with the FAA bill and includes revenue diversion language. It does not include provisions from the FAA proposal or S. 1300, which would expand the Airport Privatization Pilot Program. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program, established in 1996, currently limits participation to one large airport (Chicago Midway). The FAA's proposal aims to remove restrictions by airport category, allowing more airports to privatize. The current program gives airlines veto power over privatization transactions, requiring approval from 65% of air carriers. The FAA's proposal would eliminate this requirement, only mandating consultation with air carriers for primary airports. The FAA's proposal aims to expand the Airport Privatization Pilot Program by allowing more airports to privatize without airline approval. The proposal would raise the required air carrier approval percentages from 65% to 75% for airports participating in the program. Additionally, the private operator could set fees to recover all costs except for the sale or lease price, which would still require air carrier approval. The bill does not include a similar provision and eliminates the airline approval requirement for fee increases exceeding inflation. The FAA's proposal aims to expand the Airport Privatization Pilot Program by raising air carrier approval percentages from 65% to 75%. The program allows for the purchase of a privately owned public use airport's development rights to keep it operational. FAA suggests finding a public sponsor to purchase the airport instead of just the development rights. Some general aviation supporters still back the pilot program, which does not have a sunset provision. The FAA-proposed program would allow AIP funds to be used for airport development. The FAA proposes using AIP funds for airport purchase of ADS-B equipment to enhance air traffic modernization. Project sponsorship limited to states, MPOs, or airport consortiums with a maximum of 10 airports. This initiative aims to provide ADS-B coverage to areas not reached by FAA's direct procurement. The bill includes language identical to the FAA proposal regarding air traffic control capital costs. Recent incidents of passengers being held on aircraft for long periods and deteriorating on-time arrival performance have increased interest in airline passenger consumer issues. Passenger rights are mainly outlined in the airlines' \"contract of carriage,\" which is the legal agreement between the airline and the ticket holder. Passengers can take legal action in federal courts based on these contracts. The Department of Transportation has historically played a role in consumer protection. The Department of Transportation's role in consumer protection is limited historically, but it can take action against air carriers for deceptive trade practices. S. 1300 includes provisions for airline customer service, such as contingency services and consumer rights posting. Staffing issues have been a concern for the DOT's Office for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, which also handles passenger discrimination issues. The bill S. 1300 includes provisions for airline customer service, requiring air carriers to provide food, water, and restroom facilities during substantial flight delays. Passengers must be given a clear time-frame for deplaning, with options to deplane safely after 3 hours if no plan is in place. Exceptions are allowed for pilot decisions regarding safety or security concerns. The Department of Transportation will enforce these regulations within 60 days. Air carriers must publish customer service policies and consumer rights on their websites. They must also disclose on-time performance and cancellation rates for chronically delayed or canceled flights before ticket booking. DOT will define \"chronically delayed\" and \"chronically canceled\" flights. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will investigate consumer complaints regarding flight cancellations, overbooking, baggage issues, ticket refunds, fare information, and more. Airlines must report diverted and canceled flights monthly. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will investigate consumer complaints regarding flight cancellations, overbooking, baggage issues, ticket refunds, fare information, and more. Airlines must report diverted and canceled flights monthly. The Inspector General (IG) is ordered to update its 2000 report on air carrier flight delays and cancellations, assessing various factors such as chronically delayed flights, air carrier scheduling practices, FAA's airport capacity benchmarks, and the impact on passengers. Airlines and operators of large or medium hub airports must submit emergency contingency plans to DOT within 90 days of enactment, detailing provisions for passengers on delayed aircraft. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish an advisory committee for aviation consumer protection to improve passenger services. Within one year, the DOT will issue a final regulation to adjust denied-boarding compensation. This regulation will be evaluated every two years thereafter. The Secretary of DOT will investigate consumer complaints regarding flight cancellations, overbooking of seats, baggage issues, refunds, fare information, frequent flier rights, and deceptive advertising. DOT will provide resources needed to investigate claims and establish a consumer complaints hotline for airline passengers. The legislation prohibits selling tickets for flights using insecticide without informing passengers. Disagreement over the use of airport trust fund revenues led to legislative mechanisms ensuring full funding for airport projects. The current mechanism, established in 2000, includes two spending guarantees. The legislation includes two spending guarantees for airport projects, with one guarantee set to lapse at the end of FY2007 if not extended. S. 1300 proposes to extend the guarantees through FY2011, while H.R. 2881 would amend the guarantees to ensure 95% of estimated receipts plus interest are available for FY2008-FY2011. The FAA proposal does not address these spending guarantees. The bill proposes changes to spending guarantees for airport projects, extending them through FY2011. It would ensure 95% of estimated receipts plus interest are available for FY2008-FY2011, potentially reducing demands on trust fund revenues and preventing overspending based on optimistic revenue projections. The FAA proposal and S. 1300 focus on management and organizational reform, including better integration of NGATS planning, possible realignment of FAA facilities, and increased flexibility in NGATS design and implementation by involving airports and private entities. The current FAA reauthorization debate focuses on the adequacy of management processes for developing the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) by 2025. The Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) has been criticized for the slow pace of drafting the NGATS concept. Some concerns have been raised about the JPDO concept for the NGATS, including its slow pace and scope. Issues with organizational and management structure, as well as lack of influence over budgets, have also been noted. Various options are being considered to address these concerns. Various options have been identified to address concerns about the NGATS, including establishing a lead systems integration entity and implementing specific reporting requirements. The FAA proposal aims to give the JPDO greater input into FAA systems development and operational decision making. The FAA proposal aims to integrate JPDO's plans for NGATS with FAA's modernization initiatives. It includes an annual OEP plan and details on how JPDO agencies' budgets support NGATS. S. 1300 proposes establishing implementation offices within federal agencies involved in NGATS development. The Department of Transportation has requested other federal agencies to establish implementation offices for overseeing NGATS development activities. These offices will serve as liaisons between agencies, manage NGATS programs, budgets, and staff resources. Each agency must enter into a memorandum of understanding with JPDO and other involved departments outlining responsibilities and commitments for the NGATS project. The Department of Transportation has requested federal agencies to establish implementation offices for overseeing NGATS development activities. A memorandum of understanding is required to outline responsibilities and commitments for the project. Legislation like S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 aim to prioritize investment in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) through funding and regulatory requirements. The bill H.R. 2881 aims to improve the management and implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) by establishing the JPDO director as a voting member of the FAA's Joint Resources Council. The JPDO director would oversee the development of the integrated NGATS plan, ensure sufficient funding requests from federal agencies, and keep the project on schedule. H.R. 2881 aims to enhance NGATS management by requiring agencies to designate senior officials for NGATS activities, develop a multiagency work plan, and align projects with the program. The bill H.R. 2881 aims to enhance NGATS management by requiring agencies to designate senior officials, develop a multiagency work plan, and align projects with the program. It also includes details on accomplishments, activities, funding requirements, and annual reports to Congressional oversight committees. The NGATS Senior Policy Committee would be required to meet twice a year and prepare operational evolution partnerships. H.R. 2881 mandates the NGATS Senior Policy Committee to meet twice yearly and submit an annual report detailing progress on the integrated NGATS work plan. It also requires GAO to review the transformation of the national airspace system to NGATS and ongoing air traffic modernization projects. Additionally, the National Research Council will review the enterprise architecture for NGATS. The NGATS bill mandates the examination of technical activities, program risks, and opportunities to mitigate risks. It also requires the FAA to initiate a research program on certifying new technologies for the national airspace system. Additional appropriations of $56.8 million are authorized for airspace redesign initiatives. The bill also proposes the establishment of a commission for realignment and consolidation of FAA facilities and services. The FAA proposal suggests the establishment of a commission to realign and consolidate FAA facilities and services. The commission would consist of five members appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, with one serving as the chairperson. They would have the authority to hire experts and consultants, subject to DOT approval, to evaluate and implement recommended consolidation activities. The goal is to reduce costs without compromising system safety, following a process similar to the military BRAC process. The FAA proposal includes details of a systemwide review and implementation of realignment and consolidation of FAA facilities and services. A commission would be established to make recommendations, with a timeline for publishing final criteria, reviewing recommendations, and submitting independent recommendations to the President for approval and transmission to Congress. The FAA proposal involves a commission making recommendations for realignment and consolidation of FAA facilities. If the President approves, the plan is forwarded to Congress for review and implementation by the FAA. Congress has 60 days to disapprove through a joint resolution. The FAA proposal involves a commission recommending realignment and consolidation of FAA facilities. The plan must be implemented within six years. The process mirrors the military BRAC process but may face opposition during reauthorization debates, especially in regions that could lose FAA facilities and jobs. Labor organizations representing FAA employees may also oppose the process, although current statute allows for organizational consolidation and realignment. S. 1300 proposes an alternative process for realigning FAA services and facilities, without establishing a BRAC-like commission. The Administrator would establish criteria for realignment within nine months of enactment, with public input. The FAA would then identify recommended realignment actions, including justifications and anticipated costs and savings. The Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board would review these recommendations. The Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board would review the FAA's recommendations for realignment, provide an opportunity for public comment, and make independent recommendations to the President and Congress. The Board must justify any differing recommendations. S. 1300 does not specify further actions after the Board's recommendations are submitted. S. 1300 does not require the FAA to implement any specific recommendations for realignment or consolidation. The bill establishes the Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board, which would provide advisory recommendations to the President and Congress. Planned TRACON facility consolidations in Southern California, Houston, TX, and Memphis, TN, would be paused until the Board completes its recommendations. H.R. 2881 proposes to establish an FAA working group to develop criteria and recommendations for realignment of services and facilities. The nine-member group includes the FAA Administrator, airline, airport, general aviation, and labor organization representatives. An amendment requires the working group to oversee FAA regional office consolidation. Labor union representatives may be selected from unions representing employees at field facilities or regional offices. The FAA would form a working group within nine months of enactment, consisting of various representatives including labor unions. The group would have six months to develop criteria and recommendations for realignment of facilities and services, with justifications for each recommendation. The report would be published in the Federal Register for public comments and objections. The FAA Administrator would then submit a second report to congressional oversight committees. The FAA Administrator would submit a second report to congressional oversight committees detailing recommendations for consolidation and realignment of facilities and services. Private sector investment in communications, navigation, and surveillance services within the national airspace system is being considered. This could involve telecommunications providers deploying technologies to enhance air traffic surveillance and provide flight-related information to aircraft. The FAA is considering allowing private sector investment in communications, navigation, and surveillance services in the national airspace system. This could involve non-government entities providing services to improve safety, efficiency, and reduce regulatory burdens on system users. The FAA is considering private sector investment in communication, navigation, and surveillance services in the national airspace system. A proposed bill includes a pilot program for up to ten airports to take ownership of navigation equipment for operation and maintenance. Airports must adhere to FAA standards, allow inspections, and upgrade equipment when necessary. They can recoup costs through Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) and impose a PFC of up to $7 under the pilot program. The FAA proposes a pilot program for airports to acquire and install ADS-B ground equipment using AIP grant money. ADS-B technology allows aircraft to transmit their position, flight direction, and speed for air traffic surveillance. It is seen as a potential radar replacement and safety system for pilot awareness. S. 1300 includes provisions for improving air traffic situation awareness and mitigating midair collision risks, expanding FAA's options for next-generation equipment deployment. Operational and liability issues may arise regarding ownership, control, and performance of networked facilities integrated into NGATS. The bill also includes language on airport takeover of navigation facilities, ADS-B Support Pilot Program, and non-government providers offering services to airspace users. S. 1300 requires the FAA to report progress on implementing ADS-B ground stations and disseminating operational procedures. It also mandates guidelines for ADS-B avionics equipage, including installation schedules, costs, and benefits for operators. Additionally, the bill accelerates FAA's certification of improved instrument approach capabilities. The bill mandates the FAA to enhance instrument approach capabilities using satellite-based navigation technologies. It sets targets for adding 200 precision approach procedures annually, with 25% meeting criteria for low visibility conditions. Third parties can design and implement procedures, and a public-private partnership will test NGATS technologies at airports. The provision in H.R. 2881 establishes an airport-based testing site for NGATS technologies serving commercial and general aviation traffic. It also creates a NextGen Research and Development Center of Excellence to enhance NGATS technology development in academia and industry, providing assistance to FAA, NASA, and DoD. H.R. 2881 mandates FAA involvement of certain employees impacted by NGATS development in ATC modernization projects. These employees, like air traffic controllers and system specialists, would provide advisory input and receive compensation and travel expenses. Additionally, the bill requires the FAA to report on the program and schedule for NGATS. H.R. 2881 mandates FAA involvement of certain employees impacted by NGATS development in ATC modernization projects. The bill also requires a report on the program and schedule for integrating ADS-B into the national airspace system, including protections and contingencies in FAA contracts for uninterrupted ADS-B services. Contingencies in contracts include FAA Administrator approval of contract assignments, designation of ADS-B assets as critical infrastructure, continuation of services after contract termination, and federal government acquisition rights. H.R. 2881 mandates FAA oversight of third party development of flight procedures, including a review by DOT OIG on FAA's reliance on third parties and internal resources for safety assessments. In 1995, Congress authorized the FAA Administrator to develop a new personnel management system for the agency's workforce, providing greater flexibility in hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel. Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, relating to labor-management relations, was initially not applicable but was later amended to apply. Congress also considered additional requirements for the FAA in October 1996. In October 1996, Congress added new requirements for the FAA personnel management system, involving consultation and negotiation with employee representatives. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40122(a) mandates negotiation with certified bargaining representatives and consultation with other employees when making changes to the system. If no agreement is reached, mediation services will be utilized. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will be used to reach an agreement on proposed changes to the FAA personnel management system. If no agreement is reached, the changes will not take effect until 60 days after being transmitted to Congress along with objections and reasons. The Senate Committee emphasized the need for cost savings and increased productivity in negotiations with exclusive bargaining representatives. The House version of the act did not include a provision on consultation, negotiation, and mediation. The Senate provisions were incorporated into the final version of the legislation during conference. In 2005, a federal district court considered the impact of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40122 on labor-management relations at the FAA. NATCA and PASS sought assistance from FSIP to resolve bargaining impasses with the FAA, but FSIP declined to provide assistance in 2004. The district court concluded that complaints related to an agency's participation in FSIP's impasse resolution procedures could be deemed an unfair labor practice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed this decision, stating that FSIP did not have a clear statutory mandate. The court decision found that FSIP lacked a clear statutory mandate to assert jurisdiction over bargaining impasses. The FAA's refusal to participate could lead to an unfair labor practice charge. The FAA imposed a new labor contract on NATCA, citing cost-saving measures like a lower pay scale for new employees. The FAA Proposal does not include provisions to alter the agency's personnel management system. Section 313 addresses events involving NATCA and PASS in 2006, allowing FSIP to assist if agreement is not reached. FSIP can order binding arbitration by a private board of three arbitrators selected from a list provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service director. The arbitration board, selected through a striking process, would provide a fair hearing for parties to present evidence and make their case. A decision must be made within 90 days, with costs shared equally. Section 601 of H.R. 2281 allows for FSIP involvement and binding arbitration to resolve impasses, with enforcement actions possible in various U.S. district courts. Section 601(b) of H.R. 2281 invalidates changes made by the FAA Administrator without agreement from the bargaining representative. It would revert parties to their last mutual agreement until a new contract is adopted, potentially undoing a new contract imposed in 2006. Concerns exist about the FAA's ability to maintain technical skills and knowledge due to an aging workforce and increasing retirements. The FAA proposal lacks direct language addressing technical training and staffing issues. S. 1300 addresses FAA technical training and staffing issues by directing GAO to study technical specialists and requiring the National Academy of Sciences to assess workload and staffing needs for air traffic controllers and system specialists. The bill also mandates the FAA to develop a staffing model for aviation safety inspectors within 18 months. The FAA is directed to develop a staffing model for aviation safety inspectors within 18 months, following concerns about retirements impacting the workforce. The National Research Council has outlined staffing standards for aviation safety inspectors in response to a congressional mandate. The FAA is directed to develop a staffing model for aviation safety inspectors to address concerns about retirements impacting the workforce. H.R. 2881 also calls for an increase in safety inspector staffing levels and sets specific funding amounts for this purpose. The bill H.R. 2881 mandates the FAA to develop a staffing model for aviation safety inspectors to address workforce concerns. It also requires FAA inspectors to inspect foreign repair stations servicing air carrier aircraft at least twice a year and calls for a GAO report on FAA designee programs. Additionally, the bill tasks the National Academy of Sciences with studying FAA's methods for estimating air traffic controller staffing needs. H.R. 2881 mandates the FAA to develop staffing standards for air traffic controllers, assess training programs, and study alternatives for training new controllers. The bill also requires consultation with FAA labor groups, the FAA administrator, and CAMI, considering human factors, traffic activity, and available technology. H.R. 2881 mandates the FAA to develop staffing standards for air traffic controllers, including a study on front line manager staffing requirements in ATC facilities. It also calls for establishing a center of excellence in aviation employment for research and training on human performance and aviation personnel. The proposed FAA reauthorization focuses on system capacity and safety issues, with a key provision seeking authority for market-based congestion control at high-density airports like LaGuardia. The proposal includes slot auctions and peak-period pricing to address congestion. The FAA proposal aims to establish a pilot program for market-based congestion control at high-density airports. S. 1300 focuses on increasing flights at Washington Reagan National Airport through a slot system. It also addresses various aviation safety and capacity issues. Slot controls at LaGuardia Airport expired in 2007, and similar controls at other airports had also expired. The FAA proposal aims to establish a pilot program for market-based congestion control at high-density airports like LaGuardia and O'Hare. The proposal includes language authorizing the DOT to determine if a market-based mechanism, such as slot auctions or congestion pricing, would be suitable for allocating takeoffs and landings at LaGuardia. New Jersey plans to implement a market-based approach for controlling flights at LaGuardia Airport, but there are concerns about the FAA delegating air traffic rationing authority to the airport operator. Legislation like S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 do not address congestion or market-based mechanisms for managing capacity issues at LaGuardia. Market-based approaches are seen as effective for controlling congestion, but critics worry about the operational costs. The FAA proposal seeks to implement market-based congestion controls at LaGuardia Airport and evaluate similar mechanisms at 15 other airports. Concerns remain about the potential negative impact on service to smaller communities due to increased operating costs. Additionally, temporary restrictions have been imposed at O'Hare Airport to address congestion and maintain operational safety. No special accommodations are made for service to small communities in the FAA proposal. The FAA proposal does not include special accommodations for service to small communities in market-based congestion controls. H.R. 2881 allows the FAA to hold meetings among air carriers to negotiate schedule reductions at capacity-constrained airports. The FAA proposal authorizes the FAA administrator to reduce arrivals and departures at capacity-constrained airports if air carriers do not agree to schedule reductions voluntarily. A House amendment requires GAO to assess market-based strategies for reducing airspace congestion, such as peak-period pricing and slots, and compare them to airspace redesign initiatives. Federal statute sets the total number of flights allowed at Washington Reagan National Airport, with slots being referred to as landings and takeoffs. Congressional action has modified the number of available slots since 2000. Since 2000, congressional action has modified the number of available slots at Washington Reagan National Airport. Flights at Reagan National are restricted by perimeter rules, which have been adjusted over time. Flights within 1,250 miles are within the perimeter, but beyond perimeter slots have been created to accommodate flights to destinations outside the perimeter. Many Members of Congress and their constituents have pushed for more flexibility in flying to distant locations from Reagan National. In 2000 and 2003, Congress allowed beyond perimeter slots at Reagan National Airport, increasing the number of daily flights. Opposition from local residents and some Members of Congress focused on noise impacts and other reasons. A 2007 study by the Government Accountability Office suggested that the airport could handle additional flights. The Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority agreed that additional capacity could be added at Reagan National Airport, but did not support extra slots. Proposed legislation did not include changes to slot rules. S. 1300 proposed 20 new slots daily, 12 for beyond perimeter operations and 8 for within perimeter operations. An amendment to strike additional slots failed during Senate Commerce mark-up. H.R. 2881 suggested 10 beyond perimeter slots by reducing existing slot allocations. Runway incursions remain a safety concern, with the FAA implementing technology initiatives to address them. The FAA's technology initiatives to mitigate runway incursions include ASDE-X and AMASS systems at busy airports. However, ASDE-X has been scaled back and delayed, and the utility of AMASS has been questioned by the NTSB. The NTSB recommends developing systems that provide direct warnings to pilots. The FAA approved electronic flight bags for pilot use with moving maps to improve situation awareness while taxiing. The FAA is testing runway status lights (RWSLs) and final approach runway occupancy signal (FAROS) lights to prevent runway incursions. However, the results are still being evaluated, and no decision has been made on their deployment. S. 1300 would require the FAA to develop a schedule for installation and deployment of these systems. The FAA is testing runway status lights and final approach runway occupancy signal lights to prevent runway incursions. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 both require the FAA to develop a schedule for installing systems to alert controllers and flight crews of potential runway incursions by December 31, 2008. H.R. 2881 also authorizes funding for runway incursion reduction programs and runway status lights. The bill requires the FAA to develop a strategic plan for runway safety, addressing expected increases in air traffic, goals to improve runway safety, actions to reduce runway incursions, resources needed, and monitoring progress. Fuel tank safety on transport category aircraft has been a concern for over ten years, with recent technology advances in fuel inerting systems. Recent technology advances in fuel inerting systems have led to the development of small, light-weight pumps that extract oxygen from fuel tanks, reducing flammability. The FAA announced a prototype system in 2002, which is now being retrofitted into airplanes by Boeing. The FAA has proposed a rule to reduce fuel tank flammability in aircraft fleets over the next eight years. The FAA proposed a rule in 2005 to reduce fuel tank flammability in large transport category airplanes used in passenger airline service. The rule requires operators to take steps such as installing fuel inerting systems, setting a flammability exposure criterion for center fuel tanks, and phasing in retrofitting of the fleet between 2009 and 2014. All-cargo aircraft would be exempt from the rule, and it does not address fuel tank safety legislatively. The FAA proposed a rule in 2005 to reduce fuel tank flammability in large transport category airplanes used in passenger airline service. The rule requires operators to take steps to reduce fuel tank flammability, with a deadline of December 31, 2007. H.R. 2881 includes a provision for aircraft fuel tank safety, and the NTSB has prioritized reducing accidents caused by fatigue in transportation operators. The regulations for flight time and rest requirements for flight crews vary depending on the type of commercial flight operation. Pilot organizations have negotiated longer rest periods than the minimum required by FAA regulations, but concerns remain about inadequate rest periods accounting for travel time and circadian disruption. Other commercial operators have less stringent regulations and often do not address fatigue issues in pilot contracts. The FAA proposal and legislative bills like S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 address pilot fatigue issues by tasking the National Academy of Sciences with studying pilot fatigue. The FAA would need to consider the study's findings for potential rulemaking on flight time limitations and crew rest requirements. The provision also requires the FAA to implement recommendations from the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute regarding flight attendant fatigue. H.R. 2881 includes provisions for studying pilot and flight attendant fatigue, rewriting flight and duty time regulations for pilots, and addressing safety concerns in helicopter emergency medical service operations. The bill authorizes necessary funds for these measures. The NTSB recommends stricter regulations for helicopter air ambulance operators, including mandatory use of formal flight dispatch procedures and terrain warning systems. They suggest that air ambulance flights should operate under more stringent commercial rules whenever medical personnel are on board, regardless of whether a patient is present. The FAA proposal does not address the safety of HEMS operations, but S. 1300 would require compliance with Part 135 regulations for all HEMS operations within 18 months. The bill S. 1300 proposes stricter regulations for helicopter air ambulance operators, including the use of standardized risk evaluation checklists, flight dispatch procedures, and terrain awareness systems. It also mandates the study of cockpit voice and data recorders on HEMS aircraft. H.R. 2881 does not address HEMS safety but focuses on the Age-60 Rule for pilots, which mandates retirement at age 60 due to safety concerns related to mental faculties and incapacitation with age. The European Joint Aviation Authority has prompted action to modify this rule. The European Joint Aviation Authority prompted action to modify the Age-60 Rule for pilots, allowing airline pilots to fly until age 65 if one pilot is younger than 60. The International Civil Aviation Organization adopted this rule as a standard in 2006, but the United States still maintains the Age-60 rule for safety reasons. The FAA is reviewing the Age-60 rule in light of international standards changes. In September 2006, the FAA formed a working group to consider adopting the new international standard of allowing airline pilots to fly until age 65. Despite not reaching a consensus, the FAA Administrator announced the intention to move forward with rulemaking based on the committee's work. In December 2007, Congress passed legislation raising the maximum age for airline pilots to 65, replacing the Age-60 rule. Since then, pilots have been allowed to fly up to age 65 to align with international standards. The law requires one pilot under 60 in the cockpit on international flights and mandates line checks every six months for pilots over 60. It does not allow pilots over 60 to return to their former airline jobs but does not prevent them from being hired as air carrier pilots without regaining seniority or benefits. The GAO will monitor the law's impact on airline safety two years after enactment. The legislation aims to increase the maximum age of air carrier pilots to 65, rendering previous provisions in S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 irrelevant. The FAA plans to adjust regulations through the regulatory process without legislative input. S. 1300 proposes allowing pilots to fly multi-crew aircraft up to age 65, with one pilot under 60 on each flight. Pilots over 60 before the enactment date cannot claim seniority based on this change. The provision in S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 would allow pilots to fly up to age 65 in airline operations, with one pilot under 60 on each flight. Pilots over 60 before the enactment date cannot claim seniority based on this change. GAO would study the impact on aviation safety after implementation, with a report due within two years of the change. H.R. 2881, like S. 1300, allows pilots to fly in airline operations up to age 65 with one pilot under 60 on each flight. It includes mechanisms for monitoring pilots over 60 and specifies that medical standards for pilots over 60 will not change unless deemed necessary by the Secretary of Transportation. First class medical certificates for pilots over 60 will expire after six months. The provision in H.R. 2881 requires first class medical certificates for pilots over 60 to expire after six months. Airlines must focus on maintaining pilot skill and judgment through training and qualification programs. Pilots over 60 need to undergo line checks every six months, with an option for simulator evaluation for second-in-command pilots. GAO will study the effects on aviation safety of this modification to pilot age standards. The FAA is facing complex issues related to integrating unmanned aircraft into the National Airspace System, including technologies for detecting other aircraft, spectrum needs, safety procedures, and operator training requirements. Civilian-use UAVs are expected to rapidly transition to operational status in the next five to ten years, with users seeking permission to fly in all airspace and weather conditions. The FAA issued a notice of policy on unmanned aircraft operations in the national airspace system, requiring specific authority to operate. Military and government-operated drones need a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, while non-governmental entities must obtain a special airworthiness certificate from the FAA. Over 50 authorizations have been issued in the past two years, mainly to the Department of Defense, Customs and Border Protection, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The FAA issues experimental airworthiness certificates for unmanned aircraft, restricting them to sparsely populated areas and away from manned aircraft routes. As of February 2007, five certificates were issued for research, development, marketing, and training. Concerns arise over civilian users operating commercial UAVs under outdated guidelines meant for hobbyists, instructing to maintain altitudes below 400 feet, avoid populated areas, give way to full-scale aircraft, and notify airports when operating within three miles. The FAA issues airworthiness certificates for unmanned aircraft, with restrictions on their operation near airports. Commercial operators must obtain a special airworthiness certificate for UAV flight operations. The FAA is considering allowing small, slow-moving unmanned aircraft to operate under general guidelines without a special certificate. Integration of unmanned aircraft into the National Airspace System is not addressed in the current proposal. The FAA is proposed to engage in research to improve unmanned and manned aircraft, focusing on safety. This includes human factors simulations, large-scale models for integration into the NAS, and assessments by the National Academy of Sciences on various aspects of unmanned aircraft systems. S. 1300 proposes addressing safety and security, privacy issues, flight control and propulsion technologies, operator qualifications, and system maintenance for unmanned aerial systems. It also requires the FAA to conduct three pilot projects in low density airspace to collect data for safe integration into the National Airspace System. Consortia with public and private partners are encouraged to participate, with necessary funding authorized for the projects. S. 1300 tasks the FAA with developing a roadmap for unmanned aerial systems, updating policies, issuing rulemaking for airworthiness certification, and reporting to Congress on certification standards. The bill sets a deadline for FAA to initiate rulemaking for integrating unmanned aerial systems into the National Airspace System by April 30, 2010. The FAA is directed to consider a report from the National Academy of Sciences and conduct three pilot projects in low density airspace. H.R. 2881 requires the FAA to develop a plan to integrate commercial unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) into the national airspace system by September 30, 2012. The bill also mandates the Secretary of Transportation to determine the safety of certain UASs for operation in the airspace system and establish safety requirements for their operation. The bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to issue guidance for public unmanned aircraft within nine months of enactment. This guidance aims to expedite certification, collaborate with public agencies for UAS operations, and facilitate the development of test ranges. Additionally, the FAA is directed to develop methods for assessing risk, understanding human factors, and creating simulation models for integrating unmanned aircraft systems. The bill mandates guidance for public unmanned aircraft to expedite certification, collaborate with public agencies, and develop test ranges. It also directs the FAA to develop simulation models for integrating unmanned aircraft systems and assessing risk. Additionally, the bill allocates funding for unmanned aircraft system research and addresses safety and capacity issues related to wake turbulence in the airport environment. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 address safety and capacity issues related to wake turbulence, volcanic ash risks, in-flight icing, deicing techniques, oceanic weather risks, and enroute turbulence prediction. H.R. 2881 authorizes funding for wake vortex mitigation technologies and systems. The bill allocates funding for wake turbulence research, with concerns raised about air carrier maintenance practices, including outsourcing to third-party repair stations and FAA oversight of non-certificated maintenance providers. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 focus on safety issues related to wake turbulence, volcanic ash risks, in-flight icing, deicing techniques, oceanic weather risks, and enroute turbulence prediction. H.R. 2881 restricts non-certified maintenance providers for airlines to only carry out non-routine tasks. It also extends drug and alcohol testing requirements to safety-critical positions at foreign repair stations working on air carrier aircraft. The House agreed to extend drug and alcohol testing requirements to safety-critical positions at foreign repair stations servicing air carrier aircraft in the United States. Implementation may be complicated by privacy laws in foreign countries. The FAA has asserted its responsibility for regulating occupational safety and health of aircraft crewmembers. The FAA and OSHA established a joint Aviation Safety and Health Team to identify occupational hazards in the airline industry. They aimed to comply with OSHA requirements to mitigate these hazards, but the implementation of voluntary Aviation Safety and Health Partnership programs with air carriers has not been completed. The FAA proposal does not address occupational safety and health standards for cabin crew. The provision in S. 1300 requires the FAA to establish milestones for completing work on occupational safety and health standards for cabin crew. It also mandates the development of a policy statement on when OSHA requirements may apply to crewmembers. The FAA must clearly identify circumstances requiring airlines to address safety hazards and outline compliance measures. The original version of H.R. 2881 had a similar provision, but the House-passed version dropped the requirement for finalizing work with OSHA within two years. The House-passed version of H.R. 2881 includes new statutory requirements for occupational safety and health standards for flight attendants onboard aircraft. The FAA, in consultation with OSHA, must issue and enforce standards within three years to ensure a hazard-free environment in the cabin. This includes regulations on record-keeping, blood-borne pathogens, noise, sanitation, hazard communication, anti-discrimination, access to medical records, and setting a standard for cabin temperature. Qualified Cabin Occupational Safety and Health Inspectors will oversee regulatory compliance among air carriers. The FAA proposal and bills under consideration in the Senate and the House include provisions to address environmental impacts in aviation and airport operations. This includes funding for research into technology to reduce noise, air emissions, water quality impacts, and energy use, as well as grants for programs to mitigate regulated environmental impacts. Additionally, there are provisions to assist airports in complying with environmental requirements and establish requirements to reduce noise. H.R. 2881 includes two unique provisions related to occupational safety and health standards for flight attendants. H.R. 2881 includes provisions to reduce noise in air traffic control facilities through sustainable practices and modify the Air Tour Management Program to regulate commercial air tours over national park units. Additionally, it specifies the Sense of the Congress regarding the EU's emission trading proposal for international civil aviation. The bill addresses extending the EU's emission trading proposal to international civil aviation, highlighting concerns about inconsistency with international agreements and the need for international cooperation. It also includes provisions to increase funding for the Airport Cooperative Research Program for research on reducing noise, air emissions, and water quality issues in the airport environment, as well as promoting research on aircraft technologies for lower energy consumption and emissions. The FAA proposal aims to create a consortium with PARTNER to develop CLEEN engine and airframe technology, with performance objectives including increased fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, noise reduction, and feasibility of alternative fuels. Funding would be authorized under the NextGen program. The FAA proposal includes funding for the Next Generation Air Transportation System program to develop new engine technologies. The bill also proposes creating a research consortium for reducing noise, emissions, and energy consumption from civilian aircraft, with funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. NASA and relevant industries would conduct research through the Consortium for Aviation Noise, Emissions, and Energy Technology Research. The performance objectives of the consortium align with the FAA proposal, with a focus on clean coal fuel technology. Section 603 of S. 1300 mandates the development of synthetic jet fuel from clean coal, funded by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Additionally, H.R. 2881 authorizes funding for environmental and energy projects, including $125 million for research and development and $20 million for ACRP projects. H.R. 2881 authorizes funding for environmental and energy projects, including a provision for the creation of a consortium to develop CLEEN engine and airframe technology. The bill specifies funding limits and environmental responsibilities for the Next Generation Air Transportation System Joint Planning and Development Office. H.R. 2881 includes environmental goals for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, such as noise pollution reduction and research initiatives on aviation's impact on climate and space weather. The bill H.R. 2881 includes provisions for research programs on the impacts of space weather on aviation, studying technologies for unleaded gasoline in piston-engine aircraft, and contracting with the National Research Council for research program assessments. Funding is authorized for these programs for FYs 2008 through 2011. The bill H.R. 2881 includes provisions for research programs on the impacts of space weather on aviation, alternative jet fuel technology for civil aircraft, and environmental mitigation demonstration pilot projects funded from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Eligible projects would aim to reduce aviation impacts on noise, air quality, or water quality near airports. The FAA proposal and provisions in S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 include grants for environmental mitigation pilot programs, amending the state block grant program, addressing NEPA requirements, and consulting with states during approval processes. The FAA proposal includes provisions for consulting with states during approval processes and expediting NEPA requirements for airport development projects. It also allows FAA to accept funds for hiring additional staff to conduct special environmental studies related to federally funded airport projects. Section 605 of S. 1300 proposes amending noise compatibility program requirements to assist airport operators with meeting environmental review requirements for implementing flight procedures. Additionally, the bill includes a provision for a pilot program in up to three states for airport development projects. Section 1300 proposes a pilot program for states not in the block grant program, similar to sections 211 and 212 of the FAA proposal. H.R. 2881 includes provisions similar to S. 1300 for expediting NEPA requirements, with a unique requirement for an aircraft departure queue management pilot program at five airports. H.R. 2881 aims to improve the flow of aircraft on the ground, reduce emissions, and increase fuel savings. It includes a directive to review regulatory responsibilities of the FAA and EPA regarding engine noise and emission standards. Congress mandated the phase out of non-Stage 3 aircraft over 75,000 pounds by 1999, allowing smaller aircraft to continue operating. The Massachusetts Port Authority reported that non-Stage 3 aircraft at L.G. Hanscom Field accounted for 23% of noise energy despite being less than 1% of traffic. Some airports receive 50-80% of noise complaints due to non-Stage 3 aircraft. Efforts to restrict these aircraft have been blocked by the FAA. Section 711 of S. 1300 would ban non-Stage 3 aircraft under 75,000 pounds, with exceptions, to address noise concerns. The bill proposes a prohibition on non-Stage 3 aircraft under 75,000 pounds, with exceptions, to address noise concerns. It also includes a program for the redevelopment of property purchased with noise mitigation funds or passenger facility charge funds to encourage airport-compatible land uses. Additionally, it expands passenger facility fee eligibility for noise compatibility projects at Los Angeles International Airport. H.R. 2881 proposes a prohibition on non-Stage 3 aircraft under 75,000 pounds to address noise concerns. It also calls for a study on airport noise impact on surrounding neighborhoods and regulates commercial air tours over National Park System units. The Air Tour Act final rule requires air tour operators to apply for authority to fly over national park and adjacent tribal lands. The FAA received applications for commercial air tours over 106 of the 391 park units, and has granted interim operating authority to all applicants. An application triggers development of an Air Tour Management Plan (ATMP) by the FAA and NPS for each unit where there is no existing plan. Development of an ATMP requires an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a74321-4370f). The FAA and NPS currently are developing their first ATMPs for five park units. The delay in implementing the Air Tour Act has limited tour operators' ability to make business decisions. The FAA proposal aims to expedite agency actions by allowing voluntary agreements with commercial air tour operators in lieu of Air Tour Management Plans (ATMPs) for park units. The FAA proposal aims to expedite agency actions by allowing voluntary agreements with commercial air tour operators in lieu of Air Tour Management Plans for park units. These agreements would address protection of park resources, visitor use, and aviation safety, with the ability to be rescinded if necessary. Park units with 50 or fewer annual air tour flights would be exempt from certain requirements, but exemptions could be disallowed if needed to protect park resources and visitor enjoyment. The FAA proposal includes provisions for voluntary agreements and exemptions that may reduce public participation and environmental analysis in agency decisions. It also allows for more interim operating authority and new entrant air tour operators under certain conditions. These decisions could be made without further environmental process, raising objections about reduced environmental analysis. Additionally, a reporting requirement for commercial air tour operators is proposed. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation amended S. 1300 to include a section on commercial air tours over national parks, seeking changes affecting commercial air tours over park units. S. 1300 contains provisions on voluntary agreements, exemptions, operating authority, and reporting requirements, with additional sections on fees and safety guidance. It would allow the Secretary of the Interior to waive requirements for park units with 100 or fewer annual air tour flights without further administrative or environmental process. The Secretary can waive requirements for air tour flights over national parks without further process if an ATMP is not needed to protect park resources. A voluntary agreement between an air tour operator and a park unit could also be established to manage air tours, with approval needed from the Secretary and the Administrator. Operating authority provisions allow for modifications under certain conditions without additional environmental processes. S. 1300 would allow transfer of operating authority for commercial air tours within 180 days of enactment. The FAA is to issue regulations to permit transfers of authority. The bill also includes an annual reporting requirement for air tour operators, detailing tour numbers, routes, and altitudes. The bill S. 1300 allows for the transfer of operating authority for commercial air tours within 180 days of enactment. It includes an annual reporting requirement for air tour operators, detailing tour numbers, routes, altitudes, and other requested information. The Secretary can assess fees on operators, with the Administrator revoking authority for non-payment. Fees have been charged at some park units, and expanding them could generate additional revenue for the Park Service, pending legislative evaluation. The FAA has issued a final rule to standardize safety provisions for commercial air tours nationally. S. 1300 and H.R. 2881 propose changes to the authority overseeing air tour operations, with potential impacts on tour operators. The bills seek to identify the Secretary as the authority working with the FAA on overflights of national park units, authorizing funds for the development of ATMPs. Various aviation industry issues are under consideration in the FAA reauthorization context. The FAA is considering modifications to the Essential Air Service program and foreign ownership issues in the context of FAA reauthorization. H.R. 2881 also addresses union issues among express carriers. The FAA is proposing changes to the Essential Air Service Program, which subsidizes air carrier service to small communities. The program, established in 1978, ensures a minimum level of air service to smaller communities. The proposed modifications include setting stricter eligibility criteria and limiting program expansion. The Bush Administration has recommended limiting EAS funding to $50 million and requiring local cost-sharing. The FAA is proposing changes to the Essential Air Service Program, suggesting limiting funding to $50 million and requiring local cost-sharing. Despite Congress providing additional funding, communities have not sought to participate in incentive regimes to move out of the standard EAS program. Vision 100 included a trial program for cost-sharing, but annual appropriations bills have prevented its implementation. The FAA's proposed changes to the Essential Air Service Program aim to limit funding to $50 million and require local cost-sharing. The program would only include airports currently receiving EAS subsidies and eliminate airports within 70 highway miles of a large or medium hub airport. Additionally, airports less than 210 miles from a medium or large hub with a per-passenger subsidy exceeding $200 would be excluded. The proposal also aims to simplify the program participation process. The FAA's proposal to modify the Essential Air Service Program includes language to simplify the termination process for air carrier service to EAS-eligible communities. The program's high per-passenger subsidies and difficulty in filling seats on many routes raise questions about its justification. While restrictions on program expansion may be controversial, alternative options for flexibility and service enhancements could be considered during congressional debate. S. 1300 primarily makes marginal modifications to the EAS program. S. 1300 makes marginal modifications to the Essential Air Service Program, increasing annual funding and making additional fee collections available. It also includes provisions for code sharing, mileage adjustment eligibility, financial incentives for EAS service improvement, and aid for former EAS eligible airports. H.R. 2881, similar to S. 1300, allocates $50 million in overflight fees for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program and increases annual appropriations to $83 million. It also promotes the use of financial incentives and long-term contracts in the EAS program. The bill splits eligibility between EAS and the Small Community Air Service Program, and addresses limitations on non-U.S. ownership of U.S. certificated airlines, which some view as restrictive towards foreign investment in the domestic airline industry. The Bush Administration's initiative to lift ownership and control restrictions in the aviation industry was opposed by Congress and abandoned. The \"Open Skies\" agreement with the EU may reopen discussions on airline ownership. H.R. 2881 addresses this issue by defining \"actual control\" in Title 49, U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(15). The Railway Labor Act governs labor relations in the rail and air industries. The National Mediation Board administers the Railway Labor Act, which applies to some employees of express carriers. In a specific case involving Federal Express Corp, the NMB determined that ground service employees were subject to the RLA rather than the NLRA. The RLA applies to air pilots and employees of common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. The National Mediation Board determined that ground service employees of Federal Express Corp are subject to the Railway Labor Act, which applies to air pilots and employees of carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. The RLA requires employees to organize by craft or class on a company-wide basis, unlike the NLRA which allows for various types of bargaining units. The FAA proposal does not impact the collective bargaining rights of express carrier employees. Section 806 of H.R. 2881 would amend the Railway Labor Act (RLA) to subject certain employees of express carriers to the RLA and others to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Employees eligible for certification under specific regulations would fall under the RLA, while all other express carrier employees would be covered by the NLRA. The definition of an \"express carrier\" would be clarified as a person or group primarily engaged in express freight shipment. Labor unions and United Parcel Service (UPS) support this measure. The proposed amendment to the Railway Labor Act (RLA) in H.R. 2881 would subject certain express carrier employees to the RLA and others to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This change is supported by labor unions and United Parcel Service (UPS) but opposed by FedEx."
