    "content": "The FY2015 homeland security appropriations reflected major actions taken, with the Administration requesting $38.332 billion for DHS, a decrease from the previous year. The overall estimated DHS budget for FY2015 increased slightly compared to FY2014. The House Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2015 DHS Appropriations bill in June 2014. The House Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2015 DHS Appropriations bill in June 2014, providing a net discretionary appropriation of $39,220 million for DHS for FY2015. This amount was $888 million (2.3%) above the Administration's request and $50 million (0.1%) below the amount provided under Division F of P.L. 113-76. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also reported its version of the FY2015 DHS Appropriations bill in June 2014. The Senate-reported S. 2534 bill provided a net discretionary appropriation of $39,000 million for DHS for FY2015, excluding funds for disaster relief and Coast Guard overseas operations. The bill was $668 million (1.7%) above the Administration's request and $270 million (0.7%) below the amount provided in P.L. 113-76. H.J.Res. 124, a Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015, was introduced to fund the federal government until full-year appropriations were passed. The government was funded through a joint resolution until December 11, 2014, or until full-year appropriations were passed. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, was signed into law on December 16, 2014, but did not include full annual funding for DHS due to disagreements over immigration-related executive actions. Division L of H.R. 83 was a key component in this funding issue. Division L of H.R. 83 extended FY2015 funding for DHS through February 27, 2015. H.R. 240, a bill providing $39.7 billion for DHS, was introduced but not reported out of committee. Five amendments were made under a structured rule, including \"Sense of Congress\" amendments on immigration policy. Three amendments were proposed to restrict the use of federal funds for the Administration's immigration policies, including prohibiting funds for implementing certain directives and granting federal benefits to aliens. The House passed a bill on January 14, 2015, with five amendments restricting federal funds for DACA applications and prioritizing deportation for aliens convicted of specific offenses. The Senate adopted a similar amendment on February 27, 2015, and passed the bill by a vote of 68-31. On February 27, 2015, a three-week extension of the continuing resolution funding DHS (H.J.Res. 35) did not pass the House by a vote of 203-224. The Senate then amended a House bill (H.R. 33) to extend the resolution through March 6, 2015, which was later signed into law as P.L. 114-3. On March 3, 2015, the House approved the Senate version of H.R. 240 by a vote of 257-167, and it was signed into law as P.L. 114-4 on March 4, 2015. The data used in this report for FY2014 amounts are taken from various sources including the President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 113-91, S.Rept. 113-77, Division F of P.L. 113-76, and explanatory statements. Information on the FY2015 request is from the President's Budget Documents, congressional budget justifications, and budget summaries. Funding levels for FY2015 are drawn from H.Rept. 113-481 unless otherwise noted. Enacted levels for FY2015 are derived from P.L. 114-4 and the explanatory statement that accompanied H.R. 240. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, including funding for various offices and agencies within the department. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes appropriations for Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III includes appropriations for National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Science and Technology Directorate, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Title V contains general provisions providing congressional direction to the department. Comparing funding levels across the first decade of departmental appropriations is complicated due to reorganizations and restructurings. The House and Senate produce symmetrically structured bills for DHS appropriations, with additional titles sometimes added for special issues. For example, the FY2012 House bill included a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund. The FY2015 House and Senate versions were generally symmetrical, providing resources to every departmental component. Table 2 summarizes funding in the FY2014 DHS appropriations bill, the Administration's FY2015 request, and the House- and Senate-reported FY2015 bills. The House and Senate produce symmetrically structured bills for DHS appropriations, with additional titles sometimes added for special issues. The Administration proposed a 1.0% pay increase for all civilian federal employees in its budget request. The House Appropriations Committee did not include money for the pay raise in its report. Neither House nor Senate bills included a restriction on a pay raise being given from within appropriated amounts. P.L. 114-4 placed no such restriction either. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not provide transparency into where DHS's appropriated resources are going. The discretionary budget authority for DHS in FY2015 is broken down by departmental component in Table 3 and Figure 1. The total appropriations do not include resources provided through adjustments under the Budget Control Act, which are accounted for separately. The table and figure only reflect new discretionary budget authority, not appropriated mandatory spending or rescissions of prior-year budget authority. The first column in Figure 1 shows budget authority provided in P.L. 113-76, while the second column shows resources available under adjustments to discretionary spending limits. The FY2015 budget for DHS is detailed in Table 3 and Figure 1, showing discretionary budget authority by departmental component. The table includes adjustments under the Budget Control Act but does not account for all DHS resources, as some components rely on fee income. Less than 4% of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' budget comes from direct appropriations. Figure 2 illustrates that a significant portion of the DHS budget is not funded through discretionary appropriations. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of the Administration's FY2015 budget request for DHS, focusing on discretionary appropriations and adjustments under the Budget Control Act. It highlights the effects of supplemental appropriations and disaster relief on planned investments in homeland security. The data presented is derived from the Administration's budget request documents. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of supplemental appropriations and disaster relief on planned investments in homeland security. The data is illustrated through historical DHS appropriations, showing the split between annual and supplemental appropriations, as well as FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The highest level of appropriations for the DHS budget was in FY2010. In FY2013, DHS funding levels were approximately $38.9 billion, the lowest since FY2009 in constant dollars. The timing of DHS appropriations bills has shifted from stand-alone to consolidated legislation, with FY2015 being the latest enactment of a stand-alone Homeland Security appropriations act. Title I of the bill funds department management activities, the Analysis and Operations account, and the Office of the Inspector General. The Administration requested $1,172 million for departmental management activities, Analysis and Operations (A&O) account, and the Office of the Inspector General in FY2015. The House-reported bill proposed $967 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $1,033 million. The enacted amount under Title I of P.L. 114-4 was $1,035 million. The departmental management accounts under Title I for FY2015 cover general administrative expenses of DHS, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The Administration usually requests funding for headquarters consolidation. The Administration requested $675 million for departmental management in FY2015, with $129 million for OSEM, $129 million for USM, $95 million for OCFO, and $256 million for OCIO. H.R. 4903 included $572 million for departmental management. The House Committee on Appropriations reduced the departmental management budget to $572 million in FY2015, $103 million less than requested by the Administration. The reductions were justified due to unrealized funding proposals and the department's failure to comply with statutory requirements. Additional cuts were made to offset increased appropriations for CBP and ICE efforts to address the surge in unaccompanied alien children on the southwest border. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $619 million for departmental management in FY2015. In FY2015, the departmental management budget was reduced to $572 million by the House Committee on Appropriations, $103 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $619 million for departmental management. The total funding provided by P.L. 114-4 for Departmental Management in Title I was $660 million, a decrease from the President's request of $748 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended constraints on funding for the Department of Homeland Security, including no funding for the Office of Legislative Affairs and reduced appropriations for the Office of Policy and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. They also required quarterly reports on travel costs for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. The House Appropriations Committee recommended constraints on funding for the Department of Homeland Security, including reduced appropriations for the Office of Policy and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. They also required quarterly reports on travel costs for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. The committee recommended an appropriation of $22 million for oversight of Secure Communities and the 287(g) program, and more than $37 million for the Office of Policy, with a focus on strategic guidance related to investments. The committee denied the department's request to restore prior year funding reductions in OSEM offices to prioritize critical operational missions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to reduce costs by 10% in FY2015 for international activities. They also requested a briefing on efforts to reduce overlap and redundancies. The CIS Ombudsman requested $1 million and 3 FTEs for Employment-based Case Inquiries. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended reductions in funding for this office, but did not address this specific request. P.L. 114-4 included a $45,000 limit on OSEM appropriations. In FY2014, P.L. 114-4 imposed a $45,000 limit on OSEM appropriations for official reception and representation expenses. The Secretary must submit a plan for implementing the biometric entry and exit data system within 30 days of the act's enactment. Funding has been realigned to support the Unity of Effort initiative, with the Administration requesting $195 million for the USM and 854 FTEs. The House bill allocated $175 million for the USM, while the Senate bill allocated $193 million. The Senate-reported bill allocated $193 million for the USM, $2 million less than requested, and $188 million for OSEM, $8 million less than requested. The Administration's request proposed several program changes, including reductions in contractor support and expenses for the Chief Readiness Support Officer and Chief Human Capital Officer. Additionally, there were increases in funding for HRIT and reductions in funding and FTEs for the Acquisition Professional Career Program under the Chief Procurement Officer. The House committee recommended funding of almost $3 million for the Immediate Office of the Under Secretary and $63 million for the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer within the Acquisition Professional Career Program. It directed the USM to adopt a zero-based budgeting approach for the budget request and justification. The committee also recommended denying the request for just over $1 million to fund the Enterprise-wide Talent Management System. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) faced a $10 million cut in funding to offset increased appropriations for CBP and ICE efforts to address the rise in unaccompanied alien children at the southwest border. This included eliminating funding for the Human Resources Information Technology program. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to report on a strategy to expedite hiring processes and provide quarterly reports on time to hire statistics. The USM was also directed to submit a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report containing all major acquisition programs and special interest projects, with funding amounts displayed by appropriation and PPA. The report must be posted on the department's website within 180 days. Additional directives include GAO reviewing major acquisition projects, DHS reporting on hiring strategy within 60 days, and the Administration requesting $95 million for the OCFO and 212 FTEs. The FY2015 budget request for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) and 212 full-time equivalents (FTEs) was $95 million. In comparison to FY2014, the request represented a $19 million increase, or 25%. The House-reported bill allocated $69 million for the OCFO, $26 million below the request, while the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $98 million, $2 million above the request. P.L. 114-4 provided $86 million for the OCFO, $9 million less than requested. The OCFO received $86 million in funding for FY2015, which was $9 million less than requested. Program changes included $16 million for Component Financial Systems Modernization and an increase of $1 million for capabilities and requirements analysis. Both House and Senate bills required the Secretary to submit the Future Years Homeland Security Program (FYHSP) alongside the President's budget, with detailed funding information accessible to the public. The House Appropriations Committee justified reductions to the OCFO request due to budget request flaws and non-compliance with reporting requirements. They specifically reduced Component Financial Systems Modernization by almost $10 million to offset increased appropriations for CBP and ICE efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding below the President's request due to program delays. They expect the OCFO to monitor funding realignments by TSA and NPPD. P.L. 114-4 directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit the Future Years Homeland Security Program to Congress. The CFO was instructed to maintain communication on Financial Systems Modernization and submit a detailed expenditure plan within 45 days. The Administration requested $256 million for the OCIO and 290 FTEs in FY2015, representing a $41 million decrease from FY2014 funding levels due to the conclusion of the data center consolidation initiative. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill included $257 million for the OCIO, slightly more than requested, while the Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill included $254 million, slightly less than requested. P.L. 114-4 provided $288 million for the OCIO. The OCIO was allocated $254 million, $2 million less than requested. The funding included a $7 million increase for the Homeland Secure Data Network and reductions in other areas. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $93 million for salaries and expenses and almost $164 million for development and acquisition activities. Specifically, $41 million was allocated for information technology activities, $53 million for infrastructure and security activities, and $70 million for other purposes. The Senate-reported bill allocated $95 million for salaries and expenses and almost $159 million for development and acquisition activities within the OCIO account. Specifically, $39 million was recommended for information technology activities, $52 million for infrastructure and security activities, including measures to protect classified information, and $68 million for the Homeland Secure Data Network. Additionally, the CIO was required to submit a multiyear investment plan for 2015 through 2018. Within the OCIO account, $99 million was allocated for salaries and expenses, with $189 million remaining available for IT development and acquisition until September 30, 2016. An additional $1 million funds the DHS Data Framework initiative and $500,000 funds cyber remediation tools. $33 million and 25 FTE were realigned to the OCIO for the Homeland Security Information Network Program and the Common Operating Picture in support of the Unity of Effort initiative. The CIO was directed to brief Congress on the strategy to protect national security information held by DHS. The Homeland Secure Data Network, Identity Credential Access Management programs, and other large projects were to be briefed within 90 days of the act's enactment. Funding levels for existing management accounts were outlined in Table 5. Recent hearings discussed issues related to departmental management, including the Senior Executive Service, AUO usage, conference spending, workforce initiatives, and delays in mandated reports. A Senate Committee hearing on the FY2015 budget request for DHS also addressed these issues. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs discussed the Senior Executive Service (SES) at DHS, with Senator Claire McCaskill asking about executive mobility within the department. As of September 2014, there were 598 SES members at DHS, with most at Headquarters and Customs and Border Protection. The department ranked second in SES employees among Cabinet Agencies. The average hiring time at DHS was noted to be 198 days. The Committee on Appropriations directed DHS to report on improving the 198-day average hiring time for senior executives. Secretary Johnson announced 12 presidential appointments to senior positions, with 90% of SES positions filled. Another hearing addressed the improper use of AUO by Customs and Border Patrol employees. In a letter to President Barack Obama, Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner expressed concerns about the abuse of AUO overtime payments by DHS employees. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum directing the suspension of AUO for certain employees, with a comprehensive review underway. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations may be interested in the findings and recommendations from this review. The Special Counsel estimated that abuse of AUO at the department costs approximately $8.7 million annually. The House Committee on Appropriations directed DHS to submit the results of the OIG's review and the Office of Special Counsel's investigations within 15 days. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expects regular updates on DHS's efforts to improve AUO administration. The House Committee on Appropriations directed DHS to improve AUO administration due to excessive use of AUO overtime by NPPD. The budget request for Infrastructure Security Compliance was reduced, and NPPD was directed to brief the Appropriations Committees on new overtime policies by May 1, 2015. Executive branch agencies must report annually to OMB on agency-sponsored conferences exceeding $100,000. DHS annual reports on conference expenditures for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014 are available on the department's website. A provision in the DHS Appropriations Act since FY2013 limits the use of funds for DHS employee participation at international conferences unless in the national interest. The DHS congressional justification proposed deleting a provision that restricted the Department's ability to manage resources and administrative functions. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations continued this prohibition for FY2015 and directed the OIG to report on the department's expenditures on events. The report must assess DHS' compliance with laws and regulations and include details on the total cost of events, number of conferences held, funds obligated, and expenses by funding source. The DHS strategic plan for FY2012 through FY2016 aimed to enhance the workforce by developing career paths, providing rotational assignments, increasing diversity, and improving recruitment efforts. The House Committee on Appropriations focused on workforce issues such as employee morale, innovation, and awards. The House Committee on Appropriations directed DHS to address low morale and weak innovation within the Department, requesting a plan with clear metrics for improvement. They also asked for estimated amounts for bonuses and performance awards in the President's budget request for FY2016. Compliance with reporting requirements has been an ongoing issue, leading to potential funding withholdings in the past. In FY2014, funds were not withheld from management accounts to give the new leadership a chance to comply with the law. However, during a hearing on the FY2015 budget proposal, it was noted that the Department of Homeland Security had delayed submitting mandated reports. Chairman Carter and Chairman Rogers expressed concerns about the department's non-compliance with the law, as it had failed to submit essential reports and expenditure plans required by law. The House and Senate committees require the Department of Homeland Security to comply with all statutory requirements before reconsidering funding reductions or restorations. Concerns were raised about delays in submitting mandated reports and the increased use of the \"For Official Use Only\" designation. The committee directed the Department of Homeland Security to include names, titles, and reasons for designations on classified responses. Agencies must post required reports on public websites after 30 days or 45 days for national interest, security, or proprietary information concerns. The Department of Homeland Security must provide specific reasons for classifying documents as FOUO, based on DHS Management Directive 11042.1. The department's headquarters occupies over 9 million square feet in 50 locations in the Washington, DC area, a result of merging 22 federal agencies. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and increased costs. The Department of Homeland Security approved a $3.4 billion master plan with the General Services Administration to create a new DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia. The project is the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters, has been completed. The Administration seeks funding to consolidate other offices in the DC area to save on lease costs. The Administration requested $323 million for consolidating DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths, with $250 million through GSA and $73 million through DHS. $57.7 million is for completing work on the center building, and $15.3 million for operational costs. House-reported H.R. 4903 had no funding for the consolidation. The Senate-reported S. 2534 also had no funding for the project. The DHS Chief Readiness support officer was directed to provide updates on prior-year appropriations and alternatives analysis for consolidation. The Senate-reported S. 2534 did not include funding for the consolidation of DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Title I, but provided $49 million for operating support costs and completion of the center building. The enacted P.L. 114-4 included almost $49 million for the headquarters consolidation project. The total appropriated for the project through FY2015 is over $1.75 billion, with $543 million for DHS and $1,207 million for GSA. DHS released an updated construction schedule in 2013, pushing the completion date to 2026 with a projected cost of $4.5 billion. DHS is working on rebaselining requirements for the St. Elizabeths construction project, with a projected cost increase to $4.5 billion by 2026. GAO criticized DHS and GSA for not following best practices in cost and schedule estimates. DHS agreed to provide an enhanced project plan in response to GAO's concerns. Congress may review the plan for the facility's use. The DHS is reevaluating the cost of the St. Elizabeths construction project, which is expected to increase to $4.5 billion by 2026. Congress may explore alternative financing options for the project, separate from the DHS appropriations bill. Funds from the Analysis and Operations account support the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS), which are responsible for managing intelligence and coordinating departmental operations. OPS manages the National Operations Center, coordinating domestic incident management and situational awareness. The FY2015 budget request was $302.3 million, with funding for 850 FTE. The House-reported H.R. 4903 included $274 million for OPS, citing a lack of clarity in mission alignment. The committee reviewed OPS's mission alignment and personnel structure, offsetting flaws in DHS's request for frontline operations. They denied a decrease to the Border Intelligence Fusion Section and required DHS to submit an inventory of all operations centers. Senate-reported S. 2534 allocated $295 million for the Analysis and Operations Account, $7 million below the request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations mandated a briefing on the expenditure plan for FY2015 by DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer within 60 days of appropriations enactment. The committee directed DHS to submit a plan for fiscal year 2015 expenditures and staffing, including funded positions and key milestones. They also requested actions to address GAO recommendations. Title I of P.L. 114-4 provided $255.8 million for Analysis and Operations, $46.5 million below the request. The committee provided $255.8 million for Analysis and Operations, which was below the requested amount. Issues have plagued I&A, including concerns about its mission clarity, intelligence product usefulness, employee morale, and fusion center effectiveness. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducts audits to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducts audits to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department's programs and operations. The OIG reports to Congress and the Secretary of DHS, ensuring information technology security and making recommendations on legislation and regulations. The Administration requested a $121 million appropriation for the OIG, with an additional $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund for oversight of disaster relief activities. The House-reported bill, Senate-reported bill, and P.L. 114-4 all included a $119 million appropriation for the DHS Office of the Inspector General, with slight variations in the amounts requested and appropriated. Additionally, all three bills included a transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund for oversight of disaster relief activities. The DHS Office of the Inspector General received a $119 million appropriation in P.L. 114-4, which included a transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund for oversight activities. The OIG faces challenges with fulfilling specific mandates from Congress without additional resources. The DHS Office of the Inspector General received a $119 million appropriation in FY2014, with 30 mandates from Congress and one from an Executive Order. They are required to publish 19 individual reports, audits, or reviews, produce seven reviews and reports, and provide briefings on two topics. The OIG was directed to provide a spending plan, work on corruption at the U.S. border, report on event-related spending and conferences, and give semi-annual briefings on waste and fraud prevention efforts. The OIG, in collaboration with the Deputy Secretary, updated on their work with CBP and ICE to address corruption cases of DHS employees. Questions arose about the objectivity of oversight by the DHS Inspector General. John Roth became the DHS IG in 2014 after a period without a Senate-confirmed IG. Charles Edwards, the Acting IG, faced scrutiny for alleged misconduct. The Integrity Committee oversees independent oversight bodies. The Reform Act of 2008 is investigating allegations of misconduct by DHS employees. The Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight launched its own investigation in 2013. Charles Edwards, the Acting IG, was placed on administrative leave pending a review of his employment. The Government Accountability Office reviewed the OIG's organizational structure for compliance with independence standards. The report released on September 26, 2014, highlighted areas for improvement in the OIG's organizational structure and independence documentation. Congress may need to ensure effective implementation of remediation efforts. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested funding for these accounts in FY2015 was $29,828 million, with the House-reported bill providing $31,090 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $30,731 million. P.L. 114-4 included $31,536 million, with an additional $213 million in overseas contingency operations funding for the Coast Guard. This funding does not add to the total adjusted net discretionary budget authority in P.L. 114-4. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, preventing terrorists and facilitating trade. Officers enforce laws to prevent illegal entries. CBP's major programs include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. The Administration requested $12,585 million in gross budget authority for CBP in FY2015, with program changes including an increase of $6.8 million for training new and incumbent CBP Officers. An increase of $6.8 million for training new and incumbent CBP Officers, Agriculture Specialists, Import Specialists, and Entry Specialists. An increase of $11.7 million for refreshment and refurbishment of Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology equipment. A one-time investment of $10.7 million for a \"cross-Component Fuel Sharing Initiative\" for DHS vehicles along the Southwest border. An increase of $11 million for the development of a National Border Geo-Intelligence strategy to enhance Border Patrol's tracking activities. The funding for CBP includes increases for mobile program capabilities, enhancements to ADIS and RVSS, maintenance of border patrol facilities, and additional CBP Officers. There are also decreases in funding for ATS and Import Safety Initiative personnel. The House-reported budget for CBP is $12,755 million, $170 million above the Administration's request. The House-reported budget for CBP is $12,755 million, $170 million above the Administration's request. The committee noted the lack of funding in the Administration's budget proposal to address the unaccompanied alien children crisis. They directed CBP to submit estimates of UAC costs for FY2015 and include them in future budget requests. The House-reported bill included an increase of $22 million for Inspections, Trade, and Travel Facilitation at Ports of Entry, but did not adopt the request for funding additional CBP Officers. The House-reported bill included $788 million for CBP's Office of Air and Marine, an increase of $79 million over the Administration's request. The Senate-reported bill included $12,567 million for CBP, $17 million below the Administration's request. The Senate-reported bill also included $77 million above the Administration's request for CBP to meet the needs of unaccompanied alien children in FY2015. The committee partially adopted the Administration's request to fund additional CBP Officers, recommending hiring 1,000 officers through FY2016 at air and sea ports of entry paid for by an increase in the Immigration User Fee. The Senate-reported bill increased the IUF by $2.00 for arriving commercial air and sea passengers. P.L. 114-4 provided $12,582 million for CBP, $3 million below the Administration's request, addressing the impact of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally on CBP's operations and resources. The number of unaccompanied alien children apprehended by Border Patrol for illegally crossing the Southwest border has increased in recent years. In FY2014, over 68,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended. The President's FY2015 budget did not initially request funding increases to address the strain on agencies' resources, but an amended budget request included an additional $166 million for CBP overtime, care services for minors, and transportation costs. P.L. 114-4 provided $3,431 million for ICE enforcement and removal operations, including transport of unaccompanied minors for CBP. The Homeland Appropriations Act of 2015 requires DHS to submit a proposal estimating the number of unaccompanied minors to be apprehended and related costs. Funds can be reprogrammed for care and transportation of unaccompanied minors. State Homeland Security Program grants can be used for costs along the southwest border. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States through Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). HSI targets criminal organizations involved in activities like terrorist financing, money laundering, human trafficking, and drug trafficking. ERO is responsible for locating, detaining, and removing foreign nationals. ICE is the agency responsible for locating, detaining, and removing foreign nationals who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally. The FY2015 budget request included increases for various programs such as the Criminal Alien Program and modernizing the TECS System, as well as reductions in detention bed funding and transportation removal program. In FY2015, Congress reduced funding for ICE by $48 million in transportation removal and $28 million for domestic investigations. The House bill had a 9.4% increase in net budget authority over the President's request. The Senate bill provided 3% more in net budget authority and 2.8% more in gross budget authority than the President's request. In P.L. 114-4, Congress allocated $5,959 million in net budget authority for ICE, an 18.8% increase over the President's request. ICE's budget authority was 17.6% higher than the President's request. The focus is on allocating resources for Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to address the increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied alien children and family units in FY2014. ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Congressional attention has focused on the number of foreign nationals detained by ICE, with Congress setting a mandate for ICE to maintain a certain number of detention beds. P.L. 113-76 specified that ICE must maintain 34,000 beds through FY2014, although ICE stated it needs around 27,000 beds for mandatory detainees. The Administration requested 30,539 beds for FY2015, a decrease of 3,461 beds from FY2014. H.R. 4903 directed ICE to maintain no less than 34,000 detention beds, while S. 2534 required at least 31,039 detention beds. The budget for the Transportation and Removal Program was reduced to $229 million. The House and Senate committee reports recommended increased funding for the Transportation and Removal Program, allocating funds for 34,000 detention beds. P.L. 114-4 provided $90 million more than the President's budget request for the program, totaling $319 million, to support the surge in unaccompanied children and families apprehended at the border in FY2015. Interest has been shown in developing alternatives to detention for certain types of aliens with final removal orders. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring for aliens awaiting hearings or appeals, using tools like electronic monitoring devices and home visits. The Administration requested $94 million for the program, with P.L. 114-4 providing almost $110 million, including extra funds for family unit supervision at the Southwest border. ICE is responsible for transporting undocumented and unaccompanied alien children arriving in the US and representing the government in removal proceedings. In FY2015, there was no funding increase request to address the strain on agency resources for the unaccompanied child population. The Administration projected a need for an additional $166 million for CBP overtime, contract services, and transportation costs. The H.Rept. 113-481 and S.Rept. 113-198 recommended a $67 million increase for transportation and removal costs of unaccompanied minors. P.L. 114-4 included funding increases for international investigations to address the UAC situation, allocating $2 million to increase specialized law enforcement units in Central America and $3 million to expand international human smuggling investigations. The Transportation and Removal Program funding was increased to support the rise in UAC apprehensions. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to DHS in 2002. TSA's duties include safeguarding the aviation system against terrorist threats and deploying security technologies. The TSA is responsible for protecting marine and land transportation systems from terrorist attacks, issuing security regulations, and enforcing them. They also serve as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA budget is complex, with various resources available beyond direct appropriations. Fees offset aviation security costs, with $250 million dedicated to screening technology investments. The TSA budget includes fees to offset aviation security costs, with additional resources requested from non-appropriated sources. The President's FY2015 request for TSA was $7,305 million, $60 million less than FY2014. The request proposed realigning the Federal Air Marshals Service under the TSA budget. Aviation Security and FAMS together totaled $5,683 million. The FY2015 request for Aviation Security and FAMS totaled $5,683 million, $29 million less than FY2014. The request included reductions in FAMS and Screener Personnel Compensation, offset by increases in explosives detection equipment and airport management funding. Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing funding increased by roughly $70 million, with proposed realignment of Intelligence and Secure Flight funding. Surface funding saw a proposed increase of roughly $19 million. The FY2015 request for Aviation Security and FAMS totaled $5,683 million, with reductions in FAMS and Screener Personnel Compensation offset by increases in explosives detection equipment and airport management funding. Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing funding increased by roughly $70 million, with a proposed realignment of Intelligence and Secure Flight funding. The request included a proposed increase of roughly $19 million for Surface Transportation Security, largely reflecting deployment of additional security inspectors and the realignment of Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) under it. Requested Transportation Security Support funding was roughly $30 million less than the FY2014 enacted level, largely due to the proposed move of Intelligence to TTAC, partially offset by a proposed increase for information technology. The House-reported bill specified a gross total of $7,038 million for TSA, $267 million less than requested. The House-reported bill specified reduced funding for security inspectors, headquarters administration, information technology, and human capital services. It also allocated $160 million for private screening operations at airports without TSA screeners under the Screening Partnership Program. The Senate-reported bill specified a total of $7,234 million, $71 million less than requested, with $790 million designated for the Federal Air Marshal Service. The Senate-reported bill proposed lower amounts than requested for various TSA programs, including screener personnel, checkpoint support, explosives detection equipment, aviation regulation, Secure Flight passenger vetting, and information technology. The bill provided $7,229 million for TSA, $136 million less than the FY2014 enacted amount, with the largest reduction for screener personnel due to cost savings from risk-based security measures like the Pre-Check program. The Federal Air Marshal Service was integrated into Aviation Security, with a reduced FY2015 appropriation of $29 million compared to FY2014. The SPP received $167 million, $12 million more than requested, for airport screening contracts. The FFDO program got $22 million, $2 million more than requested but $3 million less than FY2014. Secure Flight received $100 million, $13 million less than requested due to delays in watchlist checks for general aviation. TSA appropriations included fee collections and financing for security activities. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 restructured passenger security fees to a flat fee of $5.60 per one-way trip, with limitations set at $11.20 per round trip. This law mandated $1,190 million in fees to be applied for deficit reduction in FY2015. Additionally, the law integrated the Federal Air Marshal Service into Aviation Security and allocated funding for airport screening contracts, the FFDO program, and Secure Flight. The Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee (ASIF) was repealed by P. L. 113-67, with a proposed increase in the passenger fee to $6.00 per one-way trip in FY2015. The Administration estimated the fee increase would generate $195 million in additional revenue, with the reinstated ASIF expected to net $420 million as offsetting collections against TSA spending. TSA projected total offsetting collections of $2,819 million with the proposed changes, compared to $2,204 million without the increases. The House and Senate appropriations committees did not include the Administration's fee proposal in their bills, citing lack of jurisdiction. The House report advised against constructing future budget requests with similar assumptions regarding revenue increases. The Senate bill included a provision prohibiting the use of FY2015 funds for expenses related to unauthorized user fee proposals. This provision was included in P. L. 114-4. The provision in P.L. 114-4 applies unless spending reductions are identified if fees are not enacted before Congress debates the FY2016 DHS appropriations act. The explanatory statement anticipated $2,065 million from aviation security fees, $138 million less than the administration's projection. It did not include $195 million in additional revenue from a proposed fee increase or reinstatement of ASIF fees. The first $250 million in fee collections fund the Aviation Security Capital Fund for airport security improvements, especially for explosives screening of checked baggage. TSA is urged to consider funding high-speed explosives screening systems for airports more than 12 months from construction. Pre-Check security lanes offer expedited screening to passengers who pass background checks or are deemed low risk. Random measures are used to prevent terrorist exploitation. TSA implements risk-based screening methods to prevent terrorists or criminals from exploiting expedited screening procedures, benefiting both travelers and TSA by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. This allows TSA to focus resources on passengers of unknown or elevated risk, leading to the elimination of screener positions and cost savings of about $100 million in FY2015. Additionally, TSA plans to reduce Security Playbook operations at selected airports through random and unpredictable measures incorporated into risk-based screening. The TSA plans to reduce Security Playbook operations at selected airports to increase unpredictability and deter terrorist attacks. This reduction is estimated to save $20 million in FY2015 through staffing cuts. The House committee recommended $26 million less than requested for TSA screeners, with a stipulation to withhold $76 million for personnel, compensation, and benefits until technical corrections are provided. The bill withholds funds from TSA until technical corrections are made to the budget justification, including details on cost savings from security measures. It also requires evidence of the effectiveness of behavior detection officers and reports on screening technologies and workforce deployment. The bill requires TSA to submit reports on strategies to increase expedited screening eligibility for air passengers, including performance metrics and impact on resources. It also mandates briefings on the Pre-Check program's strategic communications campaign. The bill does not include a cap on TSA screeners but notes a decrease in personnel to stay below the FY2014 cap. TSA must submit a semiannual report by April 15, 2015. P. L. 114-4 requires TSA to submit a semiannual report by April 15, 2015, detailing strategies to increase expedited screening eligibility for airline passengers. The act prohibits exemptions for members of Congress and senior federal officials from passenger and baggage screening. It also reflects cost reductions in screening through risk-based approaches and maintains a cap of 45,000 full-time equivalent screeners. Additionally, $25 million in Transportation Security Support funding is withheld until TSA provides evidence on using behavior indicators to identify potential security threats and addresses concerns raised by GAO on advanced imaging technology deployment. The TSA has implemented actions to improve response to security incidents at airport screening checkpoints, including active shooter training, evacuation plans, and increased law enforcement presence in terminal areas. Law enforcement agencies at around 320 out of 450 airports with TSA screening checkpoints receive reimbursement for positioning officers. The TSA reimburses law enforcement agencies for positioning officers at airports with screening checkpoints, ensuring mandatory response times to security incidents. Funding for this program was a topic of interest during appropriations debate, with a specified $71 million for airport law enforcement. TSA did not request a funding increase for FY2015, relying on program efficiencies and reviews of expenditures to maximize available funds. The FY2015 funding for airport law enforcement support has been specified at $71 million, with a directive for TSA to fully reimburse participating airports. H.R. 4903 also prohibits the use of funds to require airport operators to monitor checkpoint exit lanes. The Senate report emphasizes increasing law enforcement presence at high traffic locations like checkpoints and ticket counters. The Senate provided $71 million for airport law enforcement and assessments in FY2015. TSA was encouraged to evaluate exit lane monitoring costs and develop a long-term strategy using low-cost technological solutions. The act included a provision prohibiting the use of funds to require airport operators to provide staffing for exit lane monitoring where TSA already does so. The House-passed bill specified $600 million for FAMS, $200 million less than the requested amount. The House-passed bill specified $600 million for FAMS, $200 million less than requested. Air marshals have been reassigned to management positions and other agencies. The House committee agreed to align FAMS under Aviation Security for better management. The report suggested leveraging other federal assets like armed pilots and law enforcement officers on commercial flights. The Senate bill recommended $790 million for FAMS, $10 million less than requested. The Senate bill recommended $790 million for FAMS, $10 million less than requested. The funding amount reflected current attrition rates, consolidation of FAMS into Aviation Security, and realignment of remaining FAMS funding into Surface Transportation. TSA was directed to brief the appropriations committee on efforts to implement recommendations for FAMS operations, training, and risk analysis. Quarterly reports on mission coverage, staffing levels, and hiring were also required. The Senate bill recommended $790 million for FAMS, reflecting current attrition rates and realignment of funding. TSA was directed to optimize coverage of flights and prioritize high-risk and long-distance flights. TSA is working on regulations to provide watchlist screening for charter and lease customers of aircraft over 12,500 pounds. TSA plans to expand regulations to include general aviation aircraft over 30,000 pounds, estimating coverage of 2,000 operators. An increase of $13 million for Secure Flight is requested to update software for screening requests from larger aircraft. The House bill supports the funding increase, while the Senate bill allocates $13 million less, anticipating it may not be needed in FY2015. In FY2015, $100 million was provided to Secure Flight, with $13 million less than requested due to delays in implementing the Large Aircraft and Charter Screening Program. VIPR teams, consisting of security inspectors and air marshals, deploy across all modes to detect suspicious activity. Following the 2013 LAX shooting, TSA modified VIPR deployment to split evenly between surface and aviation modes. In FY2015, TSA proposed reducing VIPR teams from 37 to 33, transferring positions to Surface Transportation Security. The House and Senate agreed on consolidating VIPR teams, with the House calling for a reduction to 31 teams. This accounted for $5 million below the requested amount for surface transportation security. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for U.S. port security and other missions. The President requested $8,152 million for the Coast Guard in FY2015, including $6,750 million for operating expenses and $1,084 million for acquisitions. The number of VIPR teams is being reduced to 31. The Coast Guard's funding for FY2015 includes additional funding for vessels and aircraft, with the House-reported bill providing more than the President requested. This includes funding for constructing four fast response cutters, acquiring a missionized long-range surveillance aircraft, backlogged depot maintenance, and a military pay raise. The Senate-reported bill allocated $273 million more than requested for the Coast Guard, including funding for six fast response cutters. It also provided $6 million for military housing construction backlog and $213 million for overseas contingency operations. P.L. 114-4 added $80 million for maintenance and $213 million for overseas operations, not counting against discretionary spending limits. The Coast Guard received additional funding for aircraft and vessel acquisition, with a net increase of $141 million compared to the requested level. The agency's mission includes oil spill prevention and response, as new drilling methods have led to a domestic oil boom, resulting in a shift towards refining large quantities of domestic oil. Crude oil transportation from new domestic fields to refineries is primarily done by rail, river barges, coastal barges, and tankers. The transportation of crude oil in the U.S. has shifted significantly in recent years, with a focus on moving oil from new domestic fields to refineries. This is primarily done by rail, river barges, coastal barges, and tankers. The movement of crude oil on U.S. waters has seen changes in the types of vessels used and the locations where crude oil is being transported. The Coast Guard's response to changes in oil movement on U.S. waters is being examined by Congress. Questions include resource allocation for safety, impact of increased crude oil traffic on vessel quality and crew experience, and implementation of new navigation rules. Additionally, the Coast Guard is establishing a new safety inspection regime for barges as mandated by Congress in 2004. The Coast Guard is facing challenges in implementing new safety standards for towing vessels, including crew qualifications and hours-of-service limits. Congress has expressed concerns about delays in finalizing rules related to oil pollution prevention and towing vessel inspections. The drilling boom is also posing challenges, with river barges potentially transporting hazardous materials from fracking sites. The Coast Guard is evaluating requirements for river tows to transport hazardous materials, including LNG. They provide safety reviews for waterways and security escorts for LNG tankers in U.S. harbors. Vessel operators are considering LNG as a fuel source due to emissions regulations. The Coast Guard is involved in establishing regulations for safe placement of LNG fuel tanks on vessels and fueling operations in ports. The Coast Guard is facing concerns about its capacity to oversee maritime operations due to the increase in domestic energy production and potential rise in chemical shipments. Congress provided funds for additional civilian maritime inspectors in response to stakeholder concerns. The Coast Guard's practice of rotating staff geographically or by activity may hinder its ability to develop a specialized cadre. The Coast Guard revamped its safety program by creating civilian safety positions and developing a long-term career path for inspectors and investigators in response to criticisms. Congress may question the effectiveness of these changes. Towing operators expressed frustration with having to repeat issues with a \"revolving door\" during a meeting in October 2011. Towing operators criticized the Coast Guard for focusing too much on one-day-per-year vessel inspections and not enough on human factors in marine accidents. The President's FY2015 budget proposed cuts to the Coast Guard's marine safety and environmental protection missions. Congress allocated more funding than requested for Coast Guard operations in P.L. 114-4. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) received $80 million more than requested for its operations in FY2015. The USSS has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection. Criminal investigation activities include financial crimes, identity theft, and computer-based attacks. The protection mission covers the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for those offices, and designated individuals. The Administration requested $1,636 million for the USSS, with $913 million for protection. In FY2015, the U.S. Secret Service requested $913 million for its protection mission and $347 million for its investigation mission. The House recommended $1,637 million, while the Senate recommended $1,635 million. Congress ultimately appropriated $1,666 million, with $990 million for protection, $381 million for criminal investigations, and $50 million for other expenses. In FY2015, the U.S. Secret Service received $1,666 million in appropriations, with funds allocated for protection, criminal investigations, and other expenses. Congress imposed specific requirements on the use of funds, including the need for agreements with federal agencies for protection services and advanced notification for opening new offices. Additionally, a new mandate required the USSS Director to submit a report on professional standards of conduct within 90 days of appropriations. The USSS has reviewed its professional standards of conduct and issued new guidance for overseas operations. Congress withheld $10 million until the USSS Director submits a report. Ongoing concerns include misconduct allegations and mishandling of protective missions. Unauthorized White House entry led to a hearing on Secret Service concerns. The USSS faced security breaches and misconduct incidents, leading to the resignation of Director Julia Pierson. Two senior agents were reported to have disrupted an investigation while under the influence of alcohol, indicating ongoing issues within the agency. The House Appropriations Committee expressed disappointment over recurring misconduct allegations within the USSS, recommending withholding $20 million from their management budget until the Service addresses issues related to ethical violations, security breaches, funding, staffing, and training of personnel. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about ongoing issues within the USSS, recommending withholding $20 million from their budget until problems with ethical violations, security breaches, funding, staffing, and training are addressed. P.L. 114-4 provided an additional $25 million for protection activities, including security enhancements and training. The DHS appropriations bill allocated funds for various agencies, with the Administration requesting $5,611 million for FY2015, a decrease from the previous year. The House-reported bill included $5,902 million, while the Senate-reported bill included $5,980 million. The Senate-reported bill included $5,980 million, an increase of 6.6% above the requested level and 0.5% above FY2014. Title III of P.L. 114-4 included $5,979 million, an increase of 6.2% above the requested level and 0.5% above FY2014. P.L. 114-4 also included $6,438 million for disaster relief as requested by the Administration. This amount is covered by an adjustment under the Budget Control Act (BCA). The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. The Directorate includes various programs such as the Information Protection and Infrastructure Security Program, the Federal Protective Service, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The administration requested $1,198 million for the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS), representing a slight increase from the previous year. Notable budgetary increases were seen in Next Generation Networks and Infrastructure Security Compliance. The NPPD planned to use an additional $49 million for Next Generation Networks to maintain wireless carriers for Priority Telecommunication Services. The Infrastructure Security Compliance PPA would receive an extra $6 million for creating permanent positions and developing technologies for facility data submission and monitoring. These increases were offset by budget decreases in other PPAs, with the largest decrease in the Federal Network Security PPA (-$28 million). The Federal Network Security PPA saw a $28 million reduction, mainly due to decreased funds for continuous diagnostic and monitoring. This reduction was a shift from procuring sensors to technology maintenance. The Global Cybersecurity Management PPA also faced an $8 million cut, primarily affecting cybersecurity education support, including reductions for Cyber Innovation Centers and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education. The PPA structure in Table 14 does not fully capture all programmatic changes in the budget request. The Administration requested additional funding for cybersecurity initiatives, including $6 million for the Cybersecurity Framework and $3 million for the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program. This was partially offset by a $2 million reduction in Sector Specific Agency Management. The Administration requested an $8 million increase for activities related to Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, including Regional Risk Assessments, Infrastructure Design and Support, and maintaining the National Coordination Center. The funds would partially offset by a $3 million reduction in Site Specific Agency Management. The House Appropriations Committee approved $1,139 million for the IPIS program, $59 million below the amount requested. This reduction was attributed to FY2015 spending caps associated with the National Defense Budget Function. The committee's recommendation did not include the increase sought by the Administration for the Next Generation PPA. Additionally, support for vulnerability assessments was recommended to be reduced by $3 million, and Regional Field Operations and Infrastructure Security Compliance PPAs would be reduced by $4 million each. The House Appropriations Committee reduced funding for Infrastructure Security Compliance PPAs by $4 million each due to concerns over misuse of overtime pay. They partially funded increases for automating compliance processes and encouraged the Department to work with industry partners on the CFATS Personnel Surety Program. Additionally, there was a slight net reduction in Network Security Deployment PPA, including an $8 million reduction for EINSTEIN 3 hardware and software. The Department was also encouraged to explore new capabilities. The House report encouraged the Department to explore new capabilities in detecting malicious traffic and engage the private sector and research centers to understand cyber threats. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding increases for various cybersecurity programs, including Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Bombing Prevention. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the department to fully fund training for public safety personnel at large venue events and to brief on new sensing technologies for building security. They supported the increase in funding for CFATS implementation but expressed concerns about misuse of overtime and overburdening industry partners. The committee also encouraged considering chemical neutralization technologies for responding to risks at chemical facilities and directed a review of using cybersecurity personnel and facilities outside the department. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding training for public safety personnel at large venue events and supported increased funding for CFATS implementation. They also encouraged the department to consider using cybersecurity personnel and facilities outside the National Capital Region to meet federal and national cybersecurity needs. The committee rejected the Administration's request to reduce cybersecurity training funding and allocated no less than $16 million for those activities. Additionally, they provided nearly full funding for the Next Generation Networks program. The NPPD budget request included additional funds for the Infrastructure Security Compliance PPA, with the Senate supporting the request and the House reducing it by $4 million. Concerns were raised about the misuse of uncontrolled overtime for inspectors, leading to a $2 million reduction in the PPA under P.L. 114-4. Congressional interest in the effectiveness of DHS's efforts to implement the CFATS program was expected to continue. The implementation of the program, including cybersecurity legislation and the 2013 Cybersecurity Executive Order, was supported by P.L. 114-4, which provided the requested funds. Congressional interest in cybersecurity was expected to continue. P.L. 114-4 provided funds for cybersecurity activities, with a focus on cybersecurity education. The Senate rejected cuts to DHS support for education efforts, while the House initially agreed but later restored funds. $16 million of the allocated $26 million was designated for educational activities. Differences between the House and Senate on funding for the Next Generation wireless program were reconciled, with the Senate recommending a nearly requested amount. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for cybersecurity activities, with the House citing spending limits. P.L. 114-4 allocated $53 million, $17 million below the request but $32 million above the previous year. Additional funds could be used from other sources if needed. For Infrastructure Analysis and Planning, the House proposed less funding, while the Senate proposed more. P.L. 114-4 provided slightly more than requested and allocated funds for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is allocated $17 million for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, $16 million for Vulnerability Assessments, and $9 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention. FPS focuses on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. They also assist other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service, at National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and employs 1,372 FTEs. Their budget of $1,343 million is funded by security fees charged to GSA building tenants. Both House and Senate appropriations committees recommended this amount for FPS in FY2015. The committee reports recommended $1,343 million for FPS in FY2015. The Senate committee report aligned with the Administration's proposal. P.L. 114-4 granted FPS authority to use its revenues for its mission. Congress should oversee federal facility security, especially FPS's challenges in training and monitoring contract security guards. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that FPS faces challenges in ensuring contract security guards are properly trained and certified. FPS lacks assurance that guards are prepared for active shooter incidents and may use screening equipment without proper training. The Office of Biometric Identity Management collects and shares biometric data, maintaining the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT). The Administration requested $252 million for OBIM in FY2015, a $24 million increase from FY2014. The House Appropriations Committee approved $250 million for OBIM in FY2015, slightly below the requested amount but higher than the previous year. The committee recommended full funding for IDENT improvements and directed OBIM to submit a plan for its replacement within 120 days. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $249 million for OBIM, citing budget constraints for the slight reduction from the requested amount. The Senate-reported bill allocated $252 million for OBIM in FY2015, exceeding the budget request and previous year's funding. The explanatory statement outlined requirements for OBIM, including submitting a management and investment plan, providing semi-annual briefings on operations and integration of biometric systems. The Administration requested $126 million for the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) and the department's occupational health and safety programs for FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $128 million for these programs, with allocations for BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125 million for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) for FY2015, $1 million below the requested amount and $2 million below the FY2014 level. The proposed allocations include $85 million for the BioWatch Program, $8 million for NBIC, almost $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $26 million for Salaries and Expenses. The final law provided $129 million for OHA for FY2015, almost $4 million more than requested and almost $3 million more than the FY2014 level. This included $87 million for the BioWatch Program and $11 million for NBIC, both funded above previous levels. The BioWatch program, funded at $87 million for FY2015, deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens quickly. OHA's budget mainly supports BioWatch, which aims to deploy more advanced sensors for faster pathogen detection. After a critical review and procurement delays, DHS terminated Gen-3 procurement activities in April 2014. The budget request for FY2015 did not include funding for Gen-3 system development. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $2 million increase for BioWatch to replace aging Gen-2 equipment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for BioWatch and urged efforts to enhance future capabilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2 million for BioWatch equipment replacement and urged OHA to enhance future capabilities. OHA staff provided medical care to undocumented children, prompting the Committee to suggest collaboration with CBP and ICE for future care. FEMA's primary mission is to protect life and property from all hazards. FEMA's mission is to lead and support the nation's preparedness for disasters through a comprehensive emergency management system. It provides assistance to state and local governments, disaster relief funding, and supports disaster preparedness through grant programs. The Administration requested a decreased budget of $3,970 million for FEMA in FY2015. The requested additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2015 was $6,438 million, paid for by an adjustment to the discretionary spending limit. The House-reported H.R. 4903 included a total discretionary appropriation of $4,320 million for FEMA, while the Senate-reported S. 2534 included $4,329 million. P.L. 114-4 included a total discretionary appropriation of $4,347 million for FEMA in FY2015. In FY2015, there was an increase of $377 million (9.5%) from the President's request and a decrease of $7 million (0.2%) from FY2014. P.L. 114-4 included an additional $6,438 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) specifically for major disasters. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. This could impact national preparedness levels. Before 9/11, three federal grant programs were available for homeland security. Several homeland security grant programs were available to state and local governments, including the State Domestic Preparedness Program, Emergency Management Performance Grant, and Metropolitan Medical Response System. Additional programs like State Homeland Security Grant Program, Citizen Corps Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and others have been added to enhance preparedness. The Administration requested $1,205 million for state and local grant programs and training in FY2015, $295 million less than FY2014. House-reported H.R. 4903 included $1,500 million for state and local grant programs and training for FY2015, the same as FY2014. The grant programs were structured as in the FY2014 DHS appropriations bill. The FY2015 grant programs were structured as in the FY2014 DHS appropriations bill, with a total of $1,500 million allocated for state and local grant programs and training. The National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) was proposed by the Administration in FY2013 and FY2014 but was denied by Congress both times. The Administration proposed the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) in FY2013 and FY2014, but Congress denied the request both times due to concerns about lack of authorization, detail, and stakeholder participation. In FY2015, the Administration made adjustments to address congressional concerns. However, committee-reported bills and P.L. 114-4 continued to oppose the NPGP and included a provision barring its establishment without explicit congressional authorization. The Administration's FY2015 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants, representing a 1.5% reduction. In FY2015, $335 million was allocated for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants, a 1.5% reduction from the previous year. Funding for management and administration of these grants would come from a separate FEMA account. The House Appropriations Committee bill provided $680 million in firefighter assistance, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. FEMA encouraged SAFER applicants to hire post-9/11 veterans to take advantage of the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. The committee funded firefighter assistance at the FY2014 level, separate from State and Local Programs account. DHS was granted waiver authority from SAFER requirements in FY2015. The committee expected FY2015 to be the last instance of annual waiver authority, as FEMA works on implementing new waiver criteria. In FY2015, annual waiver authority for firefighter assistance will be limited to the authorization provided in P.L. 112-239. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill allocated $680 million for firefighter assistance, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER, matching FY2014 levels. Waiver authority from SAFER requirements was granted by DHS. P.L. 114-4 also provided $680 million for firefighter assistance. In FY2015, $680 million was allocated for firefighter assistance, with $340 million each for AFG and SAFER. Section 557 of P.L. 114-4 granted DHS continuing SAFER waiver authority. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the main account for emergency and disaster assistance, with a proposed budget of $7,033 million for FY2015. The FY2015 budget proposed $7,033 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), an increase of $812 million compared to FY2014. The funding request includes $596 million for non-major disaster activities and $6,438 million for major disaster relief costs under the Stafford Act. This structure reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing costs for major disasters to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The House- and Senate-reported bills matched the Administration's request for $7,033 million for the Disaster Relief Fund, with $6,438 million designated for major disasters under the Stafford Act. P.L.114-4 retained this funding structure, with $596 million for base funding. States overwhelmed by disasters can request federal assistance, with FEMA calculating damage costs per capita to determine eligibility for aid. The FEMA threshold for issuing a major disaster declaration is $1.39 per capita. A 2012 GAO report found that this indicator is artificially low and not adjusted for income or inflation. Proper adjustments would reduce the number of incidents eligible for disaster assistance. FEMA agreed with the recommendation to develop a more comprehensive assessment methodology. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees have expressed concerns about FEMA's methodology for determining federal assistance eligibility. They have directed FEMA to conduct a comprehensive review of the criteria used for disaster declarations and brief the committees on its findings within 120 days. The current per capita indicator for disaster declaration is considered artificially low and not adjusted for income or inflation, leading to potential limitations in eligibility for federal assistance. The FEMA monthly report from September 5, 2014, revealed a significant amount of unobligated funds in the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), including funds for major disasters. This surplus is attributed to the congressional response to recent disasters like Hurricane Sandy. The DRF not only covers immediate relief costs but also reimburses state and local governments for disaster expenses over several years. In the first half of FY2014, the DRF spent nearly $400 million per month on costs from previous disasters. FEMA projected spending $3 billion in New York for Hurricane Sandy recovery in the last two months of FY2014. The House and Senate bills rescinded $352 million and $310 million from the DRF, respectively, due to anticipated unallocated funds. P.L. 114-4 included a rescission of $375 million from the DRF base to fully fund recovery efforts for previous disasters and future relief efforts. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program provides federal grants to mitigate property damage and loss of life due to disasters. Funding for the program has declined in recent years, with recent appropriations at the $25 million level. Despite congressional funding, the Administration has suggested zeroing out the PDM program in the last three budget cycles. The Administration has suggested zeroing out the PDM program in recent budget cycles, but the FY2015 request included the PDM fund in the \"Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative\" with a proposed $400 million funding. Mitigation aims to reduce future hazardous events, despite some calculations based on past losses. In FY2015, Congress recommended $25 million for the PDM program and expressed interest in mitigation concepts. P.L. 114-4 allocated $25 million for PDM. Additionally, there is a new initiative called the \"National Disaster Resilience Competition\" with $1 billion from the Hurricane Sandy funding bill, focusing on states affected by disasters in 2011-2013. S. 2534 includes provisions for mitigation funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. In FY2015, Congress allocated $25 million for the PDM program and introduced the National Disaster Resilience Competition with $1 billion from the Hurricane Sandy funding bill. The Stafford Act authorized Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) to help states control ongoing fires and fund mitigation efforts. The Senate committee report highlighted the need for more funding towards wildfire mitigation to prevent future fires. FEMA and its federal partners were directed to take specific actions to address this issue. The Committee directs FEMA, along with the Forest Service and Department of Interior, to provide a strategy for mitigating wildfire impacts on urban areas within 120 days. The strategy should involve partnerships with federal, state, and local governments to enhance wildfire prevention efforts. The EFS Program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act enables social service providers to offer emergency assistance to those in need. FEMA chairs a national board overseeing the program. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program is administered by a national board with representatives from various organizations. Funding decisions are made at the local level by a board similar to the national one. The program has a small administrative budget, with most funds going directly to services. The Administration's FY2015 budget proposed a $20 million cut to the EFS program to focus on FEMA's disaster response mission. The FY2015 budget proposed moving the Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) Program from FEMA to HUD, with funding levels set at $120 million. The program, not part of FEMA's primary mission, has been with FEMA for over 30 years and plays a significant role in communities during times of high unemployment. The move to HUD has been suggested by every Administration since 1983, but Congress has not approved it. FEMA's recent challenges in managing the program may support the transfer. The House-reported bill and P.L. 114-4 did not include the authority to transfer the EFS program to HUD. However, S. 2534 contained the legislative language to authorize FEMA to transfer the EFS funds to HUD. The House Appropriations Committee expects FEMA and HUD to jointly brief the Committee on the rationale for the proposed change and a plan for transitioning the program to HUD. The Senate Appropriations Committee included permissive transfer language for FEMA to transfer EFS funds to HUD. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill covers USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The requested funding for these accounts in FY2015 was $1,771 million, with the House bill providing $1,801 million and the Senate bill providing $1,761 million. The DHS appropriations bill provided $1,761 million for USCIS in FY2015, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 6.2% below FY2014. Title IV of P.L. 114-4 included $1,795 million, an increase of 1.3% above the request and 4.4% below FY2014 enacted levels. USCIS activities include processing immigration applications, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. USCIS funds processing of immigration applications, petitions, refugee, asylum, and citizenship benefits through fee revenues. Annual appropriations from the Treasury have been used for specific projects like reducing backlogs and E-Verify. The Administration requested $135 million for USCIS in FY2015, including $125 million for E-Verify and $10 million for Immigrant Integration.Projected fee collections were $3,125 million, totaling $3,260 million. The FY2015 budget request for USCIS included $3,260 million in new gross budget authority, with $2,654 million allocated for adjudication services. The House-reported H.R. 4903 recommended a slightly lower budget authority of $3,230 million, with reductions in service center spending authority and an appropriation of $125 million for the E-Verify Program. The House-reported bill allocated $125 million for USCIS's E-Verify Program as requested by the Administration. It did not include the $10 million for immigrant integration grants but allowed up to $10 million of fee revenue for that purpose. USCIS was directed to use at least $29 million to convert paper immigration records to digital format. Appropriations cannot be used for granting immigration benefits without a criminal background check. No funds for immigrant integration grants can be used for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The House-reported bill does not prohibit USCIS from providing pay raises using fee revenue, with potential savings to enhance the E-Verify program. Senate-reported S. 2534 recommended a budget authority of $3,382 million for USCIS in FY2015, including $124 million for the E-Verify Program. Up to $10 million of fee revenue could be allocated for immigrant integration grants, but not for aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Senate Committee directed USCIS to conduct background checks before granting immigration benefits and provide an overdue E-B5 visa program report. They also directed GAO to issue a report on USCIS's asylum process, incorporating previous recommendations and relevant information from investigative findings. P.L. 114-4 provided $124 million in appropriations for USCIS, $11 million below the Administration's request. In FY2015, USCIS received $3,221 million in total gross budget authority, $39 million less than the FY2015 request. Appropriated funds were provided for the E-Verify Program, with $10 million available for immigrant integration grants from fee revenues. Concerns about E-Verify operability remained a potential issue for Congress. Congress continued to express concerns about the operability and accuracy of E-Verify, a program to help employers verify their employees' legal status. The House committee requested updates on the Verification Information System modernization and oversight by USCIS's E-Verify Monitoring and Compliance Division. The Senate committee noted improvements in the program. The Senate committee report acknowledged improvements in the accuracy of E-Verify and increased prevalence in employers' use of the program. USCIS was directed to update the Committee on efforts to expand E-Verify among small employers through mobile applications and smart-phone technologies. P.L. 114-4 did not address E-Verify provisions, focusing on appropriation instead. FLETC provides law enforcement training to federal, state, local, campus, Native American, and international agencies to promote consistency and collaboration. FLETC administers training sites across the US, with online training and training at other locations as needed. The proposed budget for FLETC is $260 million, with increases in Salaries and Expenses for training additional CBP officers. The House and Senate reported bills included reductions in funding for FLETC, with the House bill cutting $2 million and the Senate bill cutting $1 million from the requested budget. The reductions were taken from various activities under the Salaries and Expenses appropriation for FLETC. The Senate-reported bill included $258 million for FLETC, slightly below the requested amount. The reduction came from Management and Administration activity. Both the House and Senate raised concerns about training federal law enforcement officers. The FY2015 appropriations bill included funding to train new CBP officers and the Senate-passed immigration reform called for additional Border Patrol agents. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development (R&D), conducting testing and technology-related activities. The FY2015 budget request for S&T was $1,072 million, 12.2% less than FY2014, with a decrease in funding for Laboratory Facilities. The FY2015 budget request for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) was $1,072 million, a decrease from FY2014. The House-reported bill proposed $1,107 million for S&T in FY2015, with specific increases and decreases in funding for various research and development areas. The Senate committee recommended funding for RD&I without specific thrust areas, praised Apex projects, urged expansion of the concept, supported $300 million for NBAF construction, allocated $10 million more for University Programs, and directed DHS to define key metrics for center awards. The Senate-reported bill proposed $1,071 million for the S&T Directorate in FY2015. The Senate committee recommended funding for RD&I without specific thrust areas, supported Apex projects, allocated $300 million for NBAF construction, and recommended $9 million more for University Programs. The final bill provided $1,104 million for the S&T Directorate in FY2015. The DHS statement did not specify the distribution of RD&I funds among thrust areas but directed briefing on the allocation of funds to Apex projects. $300 million was allocated for NBAF construction, with site preparation completed and construction underway. A contract for the main laboratory is expected to be awarded in FY2015. The $300 million, along with previously appropriated funds, would fully fund the NBAF construction. The DHS received $404 million for NBAF construction in FY2014, but did not start construction until full funding was appropriated. The total project cost for NBAF is now $1,250 million, with completion expected in Q3 FY2021, a year later than the previous estimate. The FY2012 budget estimated a total project cost of $725 million with a completion date of Q1 FY2016. DHS lacks department-wide coordination for R&D activities, as reported by GAO in September 2012. The GAO report highlighted that DHS lacks department-wide policies for defining and reporting R&D activities, leading to a lack of knowledge on the total investment in R&D. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop policies, guidance, and a tracking mechanism for R&D projects. In 2013, the Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to establish a review process for all R&D work within DHS. GAO listed DHS R&D as a concern in its 2012 report on federal program inefficiencies. In January 2014, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization and review. By July 2014, DHS had updated its guidance for R&D but had not yet developed policy guidance for department-wide R&D oversight. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research and operations. DNDO funding for FY2014 and FY2015 is detailed in Table 20. The Administration requested a $304 million budget for DNDO in FY2015, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. In FY2015, the Administration requested $304 million for DNDO, a 6.7% increase from FY2014. The House-reported bill recommended $312 million for DNDO, with additional funding for Securing the Cities program and Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems. The Senate-reported bill proposed $306 million for DNDO, also recommending increased funding for these programs. The Senate report recommended $7 million more than the Administration's request for the Securing the Cities program and $2 million less for Human Portable Radiation Detection Systems (HPRDS). The final bill provided $308 million for DNDO in FY2015, with allocations matching recommendations from the House and Senate committee reports. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions, including rescissions of funding from previous years and appropriations for special initiatives. The Administration proposed a $200 million rescission from the Disaster Relief Fund in the general provisions of the bill for FY2015. They retained 41 of the 78 general provisions from the previous year's DHS Appropriations act, amending 15 and leaving 26 unchanged. These provisions may be modified for clarity or flexibility. The Administration proposed eliminating 37 general provisions in the bill for FY2015, including those rescinding funds and adding new provisions for flexibility in departmental operations. The curr_chunk includes new provisions such as increasing aviation security fees, authorizing USCIS to use fee revenues for a U.S. Citizenship Foundation, and increasing CBP fees. House-reported H.R. 4903 included rescissions and funding for DHS financial systems modernization. The House Appropriations Committee concurred with the Administration's request to drop 11 general provisions from the FY2014 Homeland Security Appropriations act. They did not add any new general provisions except for a rescission that was deepened and nine new general provisions, three of which were also in the Senate-reported bill. The House Appropriations Committee concurred with the Administration's request to drop 11 general provisions from the FY2014 Homeland Security Appropriations act. Senate-reported S. 2534 included $731 million in rescissions in Title V, $49 million for DHS headquarters consolidation, and $40 million for DHS financial systems modernization, resulting in a reduction of $505 million in net budget authority. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not add most of the general provisions requested by the Administration, except for a deeper rescission and a fee proposal for hiring CBP officers. They added seven new provisions, bringing the total to 73. The Senate bill included $894 million in rescissions, funding for DHS headquarters consolidation, financial systems modernization, and CBP, resulting in a net budget reduction. The act includes a reduction in net budget authority of $674 million and does not add most of the general provisions requested by the Administration. Several new general provisions were added, including staffing of exit lanes at airports and a report on DHS purchases of weapons. The P.L. 114-4 act included fee increases in appropriations requests, departmental reports, and a transfer of funds to the Disaster Relief Fund. It contained 78 general provisions, one more than in FY2014. Federal government spending involves budget authority, obligations, and outlays determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding their budget authority. Budget authority is the amount of money allocated by Congress for federal agencies to spend, with limitations set by the Antideficiency Act. It can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis, with obligations incurred through personnel, contracts, and services. Outlays are the actual funds spent. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress. Outlays may not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year, as funds can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future year. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending consists of budget authority and outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions and are not counted as revenue. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset an agency's discretionary budget authority, while others offset an agency's mandatory spending, typically entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, others by annual appropriations. The DHS budget includes entitlement programs like Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget also contains Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget for calculating gross budget authority. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees then allocate the 302(a) funds among their subcommittees for each bill, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) amount to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee. The Budget Control Act established discretionary spending caps for appropriations bills, including those for the Department of Homeland Security. For FY2015, the overall cap on discretionary spending is $1,014 billion, with separate limits for defense and non-defense spending. The Budget Control Act set discretionary spending caps for appropriations, including the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS budget is mostly non-defense spending. The BCA allows adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, and health care fraud control. Three justifications in the BCA have influenced DHS appropriations, with disaster relief being limited. Adjustments for disaster relief are determined by OMB using a specific formula. The Department of Homeland Security's appropriations are subject to discretionary spending caps set by the Budget Control Act. Adjustments for disaster relief are determined by OMB using a specific formula, which includes a rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years. In FY2014, OMB determined an allowable adjustment for disaster relief of $12,143 million, with only $5,717 million exercised. In FY2015, the allowable adjustment was $18,430 million, with $11,913 million from the rolling average and $6,517 million carried over from FY2014. This was the first year with over $1 billion of allowable adjustment carried over from the previous fiscal year. The Department of Homeland Security was established by the Homeland Security Act, P.L. 107-296 in 2003. Its funding in FY2004 through FY2014 was presented in tables showing discretionary appropriations in nominal and constant FY2013 dollars. Comparing appropriations over time is complex due to supplemental funding for disaster assistance and border security. The Department of Homeland Security's funding varies widely due to supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance and border security, making year-to-year comparisons challenging. Since its inception, the department has received over $115 billion in gross supplemental appropriations through twenty separate acts. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is one of DHS's largest components, with a significant budget that includes the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a significant part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) budget, providing assistance to states, communities, and individuals after disasters. The funding for the DRF has varied widely over the years, from less than $3 billion in FY2008 to over $60 billion in FY2005. Tables and figures provide detailed information on the budget authority provided to the DRF and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)."
