    "content": "Since 2007, 19 state legislatures have introduced bills for state Do Not Mail (DNM) registries to reduce unsolicited advertising mail. Residents can submit their information to a state agency, compiled into a registry for direct mail marketers. Marketers who ignore the registry may face fines. This report examines environmental and economic impacts of DNM statutes, noting potential constitutional challenges. Environmental groups and direct mail marketers have conflicting views on unsolicited mail. Environmental groups argue that it creates paper waste, invades privacy, and increases the risk of identity theft. On the other hand, marketers and the USPS claim that advertising mail is essential for businesses and adds billions to the economy. The USPS estimates a potential loss of $4-10 billion in revenue if a Do Not Mail registry is implemented nationwide. No federal legislation for a Do Not Mail registry in the 110th Congress. Advertising mail is a concern at congressional hearings. Postmaster General warns DNM initiatives could harm mail services, jobs, businesses, and revenue. At the National Postal Supervisors Association Meeting in April 2008, Senator Susan M. Collins expressed concerns about proposed \"Do Not Mail\" legislation, equating it to the \"Do Not Call\" registry. This legislation could have devastating consequences by curbing direct mail growth, increasing costs, and jeopardizing universal mail service. Direct mail is not comparable to unsolicited phone calls restricted by the \"Do Not Call\" registry. A \"Do Not Mail\" registry would have devastating consequences for homes, communities, and businesses relying on the Postal Service. USPS delivered 100 billion pieces of advertising mail to US households in 2007, representing 60% of all household mail. Advertising mail accounted for 2.3% of municipal waste in 2006. In 2006, advertising mail made up 2.3% of municipal waste, generating nearly 5.9 million tons of solid waste. Around 38.7% of this waste was recovered. Critics argue that advertising mail imposes environmental and public costs, with nearly half ending up unopened in landfills. Organizations like New American Dream and Forest Ethics highlight the significant environmental impact of bulk mail, equating it to deforesting large areas and requiring hundreds of thousands of garbage truck loads for disposal each year. ProQuo advocates for reducing unsolicited advertising mail to prevent identity theft. The Direct Marketing Association points out that trees cut down for paper were grown specifically for that purpose. USPS study shows 48% read advertising mail, 33% glance at it, and 19% do not read it. According to USPS's Household Diary Study, 1 in 10 pieces of advertising mail elicits a consumer response. A 2007 USPS study found that advertising mail benefits the economy by $553 million annually. Direct mail marketers argue that advertising mail is constitutionally protected and poses minimal risk of identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission reported that only 2% of identity theft victims in 2005 believed their information was acquired through postal mail. These organizations emphasize the importance of advertising mail to the economy. Direct mail marketing is emphasized for its economic importance, with estimates showing $60 billion spent on advertising mail in 2006. The USPS employs 786,000 workers, with an additional 460,000 jobs directly linked to advertising mail. Indirectly, 3.1 million people are employed in roles such as warehouse workers and customer service representatives. The USPS generates $74.8 billion annually from mail users, with Congress providing additional funding. The USPS relies on Standard Mail sales, mainly advertising mail, due to declining First Class Mail sales since 2000. In 2007, 83% of advertising mail was sent as Standard Mail, which includes printed matter, flyers, circulars, and catalogs. The remaining 17% was sent as more expensive First Class Mail. Since 2000, USPS has seen a decline in First Class Mail volume, with Standard Mail surpassing it in 2005. First Class Mail, which includes handwritten or typewritten material, bills, and credit cards, provides higher profit per piece for USPS. Despite the growth in Standard Mail sales, a significant reduction in volume could occur due to factors like Do Not Mail legislation. The decline in First Class Mail volume has led to revenue losses for USPS, prompting an increase in postage rates. Despite stagnant revenue for First Class Mail, Standard Mail revenue has grown significantly. In 2007, Standard Mail generated 28% of USPS's total revenue and made up 49% of the mail pieces delivered. Both First Class Mail and Standard Mail volumes have been declining, with Standard Mail surpassing First Class Mail in volume in 2005. Standard Mail, the largest volume product since 2005, declined by almost 750 million pieces last year, a 2.6 percent drop from the first quarter of 2007. The USPS is facing a $1 billion budget shortfall in 2008 due to economic conditions, with troubled banks sending fewer credit card offers and declining new-home sales leading to empty mailboxes. Operating costs have risen while revenue has not kept pace, resulting in a $5.4 billion revenue loss in 2007. The GAO report attributed USPS's $5 billion shortfall in FY2007 to advance payments of retiree health benefits. During a congressional oversight hearing, USPS Postmaster General John Potter mentioned cost-cutting measures such as reducing expenses and using seasonal employees instead of paying overtime. USPS is exploring new revenue sources, including renting space in post offices to private companies like banks or coffee shops. However, restrictions on federal property use may hinder these plans. If Do Not Mail legislation is passed, USPS could lose $4 billion to $10 billion annually in sales revenue, leading to cost-cutting measures and adjustments. Decrease in First Class Mail makes direct mail advertising crucial for USPS's financial success, with concerns about future financial troubles. Direct mail marketing organizations and USPS warn that Do Not Mail legislation could significantly impact sales revenue and potentially lead to job losses at state and national levels. In 2007, 459,500 people were employed in businesses directly tied to advertising mail, with 3.1 million in indirectly related jobs. 12 states have pending legislation in 2008 for a Do Not Mail registry, similar to the National Do Not Call Registry but state-run. Some states propose Do Not Mail registries with high penalties for non-compliance, while others exempt certain types of mail. State legislatures are debating the environmental benefits versus potential commercial losses of these bills. Some states are considering Do Not Mail bills to address environmental concerns and reduce the impact of unsolicited bulk mail on the environment. North Carolina and Rhode Island highlight the environmental impact of junk mail, emphasizing the need to balance individual rights and commercial freedom of speech. Illinois and New Hampshire are considering Do Not Mail bills to address environmental concerns and reduce unsolicited bulk mail. Illinois's bill aims to give residents the choice to receive junk mail, while New Hampshire's bill faces opposition due to concerns about its potential effects outweighing the benefits. Rural postal carriers are concerned about the impact on their income. HB1506 would directly affect the income of rural postal carriers due to the volume of mail they deliver. The bill has exceptions for certain types of mailings, leading to the conclusion that it may not significantly reduce unwanted mail. The NHDES website offers preaddressed postcards for major mailing organizations to opt-out of junk mail, which could be as effective as the proposed legislation. The majority found it \"inexpedient to legislate\" on the initiative. Despite the public's dislike of unsolicited advertising mail, state legislatures have not referred bills on the environmental impact of \"junk mail\" to environmental committees. Instead, bills have been referred to consumer protection, judiciary, and finance committees. A 2003 poll found that a significant percentage of respondents viewed unsolicited advertising mail as intrusive in their lives. Individuals can reduce unwanted advertising mail by subscribing to Do Not Mail registries or contacting companies directly. Companies can reduce advertising mail delivery by contacting them directly or subscribing to \"do not mail\" registries. The Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service allows consumers to choose which advertising magazines they want to receive. To opt out of receiving certain magazines, catalogs, or direct mail, consumers can wait 30 to 90 days for the request to take effect. Companies like GreenDimes, DirectMail.com, and CatalogChoice.org offer services to remove names from marketing lists. GreenDimes provides a \"catalog screener\" for subscribers to choose which catalogs to keep receiving. Their basic service is free, with additional fee-based options like customer service access and tree planting in the subscriber's name. DirectMail.com also offers a Do Not Mail option online. DirectMail.com, CatalogChoice, and other companies offer services to help consumers reduce unwanted advertising mail. Consumers can register for free and customize their preferences. Optoutprescreen.com allows consumers to remove their address from credit card and insurance company mailing lists. Credit reporting companies may share consumer information with creditors and insurers for marketing purposes. The FCRA mandates a right for consumers to \"opt out\" of receiving credit card and insurance company advertising mail. Consumers can register at optoutprescreen.com to opt out for up to five years or indefinitely by mailing a form to the Opt Out Department in Illinois. Private DNM initiatives allow consumers to personalize advertising mail, but may not stop mail from all direct mail marketers. Private efforts to stop unwanted advertising mail may not be effective against direct mail marketers who do not use opt-out services. Companies that continue to send advertising mail to those who have opted out are often not penalized. Private opt-out services require consumers to contact multiple organizations to ensure removal from marketing lists, leading to a time-consuming process. While private initiatives exist, they may only minimally reduce unwanted advertising mail. To reduce unwanted advertising mail, consumers can contact individual mailers by telephone or mail, visit appropriate websites to stop bulk mail coupons, and request their personal information not be shared with other solicitors. This can be an effective method to curb the delivery of specific pieces of advertising mail. Consumers can refuse unwanted advertising mail by writing \"Refused\u2014return to sender\" on the envelope or catalog and leaving it in their mailbox for the mail carrier. This action prompts USPS to return the mail to the sender or dispose of it, leading mailers to remove the recipient's information from their lists. Consumers can reduce advertising mail by seeking advice from their letter carrier or visiting websites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's \"Reducing Junk Mail\" site. Participation in certain activities, such as signing up for sweepstakes, can lead to more advertising mail. Efforts are being made by private sector organizations and USPS to recycle unwanted mail and use eco-friendly paper providers. DMA encourages its members to adopt environmentally friendly practices known as \"Green 15.\" The DMA encourages its members to adopt environmentally friendly practices known as \"Green 15,\" which includes guidelines to increase wood purchases from recognized forest certification programs and submit alternate solutions for environmentally preferable packaging. Other organizations have also joined efforts to increase recycling, resulting in a 19% increase in magazine and catalog recycling in one city. USPS generates $7.5 million per year through recycling efforts and provides information on reducing, reusing, and recycling mail on their website. The USPS greenmail website promotes reducing, reusing, and recycling mail. USPS aims to increase revenue from mail-related recycling to $40 million by 2010. Undeliverable mail is handled differently based on mail class, with most Standard Mail being recycled. In 2006, nearly 317,000 tons of Standard Mail was undeliverable. Starting March 2009, USPS will use Intelligent Mail Barcodes to track undeliverable mail from large mail senders. State-level bills affecting USPS operations raise federalism and constitutional concerns. Legislation to protect the environment and consumer identity may impact job creation and USPS sustainability. Private-sector efforts to customize mail solicitations could reduce unwanted mail. Creating legislation to manage a Do Not Mail (DNM) registry could help reduce unsolicited advertising mail. The bill could specify registry management, access requirements for direct mail marketers, and penalties for non-compliance. This legislation would have costs and benefits, addressing concerns about environmental waste and consumer privacy. The legislation on a Do Not Mail (DNM) registry aims to reduce unsolicited advertising mail, with potential economic impacts on organizations reliant on advertising revenue. Congress may also consider allowing USPS more flexibility in renting retail space to generate additional revenue and address budget shortfalls. In response to resource usage concerns, Congress may consider implementing a Green Rate, a discounted postal rate for mailers using recycled and/or certified paper. This incentive would help offset costs and encourage the use of environmentally-friendly materials. Additionally, the Green Rate could reward direct mail marketers who respect Do Not Mail registries by not contacting opted-out consumers. The Green Rate could be offered to mailers who reduce undeliverable mail and use materials efficiently. GAO suggested feasibility studies to ensure USPS has the technology for a new mail class. Congressional and Postal Regulatory Commission approval may be needed. Congress could provide guidance on managing direct mail volume and suggest private registries for managing advertising mail."
