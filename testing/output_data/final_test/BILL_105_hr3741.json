    "content": "The \"Aviation Bilateral Accountability Act of 1998\" is the short title of this Act, which focuses on civil aviation agreements. Section 40105 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require Congressional approval for civil aviation agreements entered into after the enactment of this subsection. The agreement must be transmitted to Congress with an explanation and an approval resolution must be enacted into law. The House of Representatives and the Senate have the power to create rules for approval resolutions, which must be followed in each respective House. These rules can supersede other rules if they conflict and can be changed by each House. The term \"approval resolution\" is defined as part of this process. The term 'approval resolution' is defined as a joint resolution of Congress approving a civil aviation agreement between the United States and another country. This resolution must be introduced on the day the agreement is transmitted to Congress. The approval resolution for a civil aviation agreement must be introduced in the House and Senate by designated members if either House is not in session. The approval resolution for civil aviation agreements must be referred to specific committees in the House and Senate, with no amendments allowed and a limited period for consideration. The approval resolution for civil aviation agreements must be referred to specific committees in the House and Senate. If a committee has not reported the resolution within 60 days, it will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar for a vote. Each House must vote on the resolution within 30 days of it being reported or discharged from committee consideration. The approval resolution process for civil aviation agreements involves specific timelines for committee consideration and voting in each House. If one House receives the approval resolution from the other House, the procedure remains the same, but the final passage vote will be on the other House's resolution. The number of days for consideration excludes non-session days. In the House of Representatives, a motion to proceed to the approval resolution's consideration is highly privileged. Debate on an approval resolution in the House of Representatives is limited to 5 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Amendments, motions to reconsider, and motions to recommit are not allowed. In the House of Representatives, motions to postpone and appeals related to approval resolutions are decided without debate. Other rules of the House apply unless specified otherwise. In the Senate, a motion to proceed to consider an approval resolution is privileged and not debatable. Debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided between the majority and minority leaders or their designees. Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection with an approval resolution is limited to 1 hour, divided between the mover and the manager of the resolution, with additional time allotted by the leaders. In the Senate, a motion to further limit debate is not debatable, and a motion to recommit an approval resolution is not allowed."
