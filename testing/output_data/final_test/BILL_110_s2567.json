    "content": "The \"Sales Tax Holiday Act of 2008\" provides state and local sales tax relief for consumers. The \"Sales Tax Holiday Act of 2008\" mandates the Secretary to reimburse each State for 60% of uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period. Reimbursement is determined by a predetermined amount paid by May 1, 2008, and a reconciliation amount by July 1, 2008. The Secretary will pay each electing State an amount equal to 60% of uncollected State and local sales tax during the sales tax holiday period, minus the predetermined amount paid earlier. Reimbursement is contingent on the State's chief executive officer informing the Secretary by March 1, 2008, of their intention to qualify for reimbursement by not collecting sales tax during the holiday period. The State's chief executive officer must inform the Secretary, the Director of Management and Budget, and retail sellers of tangible property by March 1, 2008, of the intention to receive reimbursement for a reconciliation amount under subsection (b)(2). Additionally, the officer must inform retail sellers of the additional information required for reporting periods. The chief executive officer must report the reconciliation amount to the Secretary and Director of Management and Budget by June 1, 2008. If the amount paid to the State exceeds the determined amount, the officer must remit the excess to the Secretary by July 1, 2008. The State's CEO must certify compliance for retail sellers. During the sales tax holiday period, retail sellers unable to report taxable sales can use their sales revenue from the same period in 2008 as a good faith effort. They will not be held liable for errors resulting from this effort unless it is intentional. During the sales tax holiday period, retailers must comply unless they acted recklessly or fraudulently. Home rule States must certify agreement from all local governments imposing sales taxes for the holiday. The State's chief executive officer must pay each local government's share of reimbursement within 20 days. The Director of Management and Budget certifies the reimbursement amount for States electing reconciliation. The budget certifies reimbursement amounts based on reports from state chief executive officers. Local government reimbursement is determined by the ratio of local sales tax to state sales tax. Definitions include \"home rule State\" and \"local\" as subordinate revenue authorities within a state. The term \"sales tax\" refers to a tax imposed on retail sales of tangible property or services incidental to the sale, calculated as a percentage of the price and collected by retail sellers. It includes use tax and the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax, excluding taxes on food and beverages for immediate consumption. The sales tax holiday period is defined as the period between April 3, 2008, and April 14, 2008. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury, and \"State\" includes the several States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Use tax is a tax imposed on the storage, use, or consumption of tangible property not subject to sales tax."
