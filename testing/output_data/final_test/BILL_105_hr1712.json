    "content": "The Act titled \"China Market Access and Export Opportunities Act of 1997\" is aimed at providing opportunities for market access and exports to China. The Act aims to authorize the President to raise tariffs on imports from China to 1994 levels if China denies trade benefits or fails to become a full member of the World Trade Organization. It also provides an incentive for China to join the WTO by eliminating annual trade status reviews. The Act aims to enhance the President's ability to negotiate a trade protocol with China. The Act includes a SNAP-BACK MECHANISM to enhance the President's ability to negotiate a trade protocol with China. After consulting with congressional committees, the President will determine if China is providing adequate trade benefits to the US and making efforts to become a WTO member. A report with rationale for these determinations must be submitted within 180 days. If China fails to meet requirements, a tariff increase may be imposed. If the President determines that China is not providing adequate trade benefits to the US or making efforts to become a WTO member, a tariff increase may be imposed within 180 days. The President shall terminate any increase in the rate of duty on China when they become a WTO member or when the President proclaims that China is providing adequate trade benefits to the US and taking steps to become a WTO member. The President may modify tariffs as needed. The President has the authority to modify tariff increases, as long as the rate does not exceed the original duty imposed and cannot be used to end the increase in duty. Upon China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the Trade Act of 1974 will no longer apply to China, and non-discriminatory treatment will be granted to its products. The term \"WTO member\" is defined in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act."
