    "title": "AB 476",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 218 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to increase the homeowners' property tax exemption. The exemption amount is $7,000 through the 2015-16 fiscal year and $25,000 starting from the 2016-17 fiscal year, with adjustments based on the House Price Index for California. The exemption for property tax does not apply to rented, vacant, under construction, vacation or secondary homes, or properties where the owner receives the veteran's exemption. If a person receiving the exemption is temporarily not occupying the dwelling due to damage, they are still considered to occupy it as their principal residence. The exemption is not applicable if the dwelling has been totally destroyed until it is replaced and occupied again. A dwelling totally destroyed in a disaster, eligible for exemption prior to the disaster, and not changed ownership, is deemed occupied by the exempt person if they intend to reconstruct and reside there. \"Owner\" includes those purchasing under a contract or holding shares in a cooperative housing corporation for exclusive occupancy. A \"dwelling\" is defined as a building or structure used as a place of abode, including single-family dwellings, multiple-dwelling units, and condominiums occupied by the owner as their principal residence on the lien date. The exemption for cooperative housing corporation owners' principal residences is deducted from the total assessed valuation and benefits qualifying owners. The California Constitution's exemption is applied to the building first, then to any excess land. Section 17053.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 17053.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to provide a tax credit for qualified renters based on their adjusted gross income. The credit amount varies for different filing statuses and income levels, with adjustments made for taxable years starting in 2017. For taxable years starting in 2016, the credit is $214 for eligible taxpayers. For years starting in 2017, the amount will be adjusted by the Franchise Tax Board. Married couples can only receive one credit, which can be divided if filing separately based on residency status. For taxable years starting in 2016, the credit is $214 for eligible taxpayers, which can be divided between spouses based on residency status. A qualified renter in California must be a resident and rent their principal place of residence for at least 50% of the year. A \"qualified renter\" in California must meet certain criteria to be eligible for a tax credit. This includes not renting premises exempt from property taxes and not residing with someone who claims them as a dependent for over 50% of the year. An individual can claim the homeowners' property tax exemption if they or their spouse received it during the taxable year. Nonresidents can claim credits based on the months they resided in the state. Claiming the credit requires providing information to the Franchise Tax Board. The credit must be claimed on returns as prescribed by the board. The section defines \"premises\" as a house or dwelling unit used for living accommodations, excluding land only unless a mobilehome is present. It also specifies the effective date of the section and mandates the Franchise Tax Board to adjust income amounts and credit values for taxable years starting in 1999 and 2017 respectively. The Department of Industrial Relations annually transmits the California Consumer Price Index change to the Franchise Tax Board by August 1. The Board calculates an inflation adjustment factor and applies it to the previous year's taxable amounts, rounding to the nearest dollar. SEC. 3. This act does not appropriate funds and the state will not reimburse local agencies for any property tax revenue loss. If the Commission on State Mandates finds state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts. SEC. 4. This act imposes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
