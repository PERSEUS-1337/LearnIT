EPA that recipients of Section 404 Administrative Compliance Orders (ACOs) under the Clean Water Act can seek pre-enforcement review in court. This decision allows for jurisdictional objections to be heard before the EPA files a civil action, ensuring due process. The EPA issues over 1,000 ACOs a year under various statutes like the CWA, Safe Drinking Water Act, Superfund Act, and Clean Air Act. ACOs serve as a warning for recipients to comply with regulations by a deadline to avoid penalties, and are seen as a less confrontational enforcement option. ACOs are a less confrontational enforcement option compared to other options under the CWA, Clean Air Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. Recipients can face difficulties if they disagree with the facts or legal conclusions of the ACO, as pre-enforcement review is often barred for ACOs issued under Section 404. The Section 404 ACO recipient could either challenge the order later in court or comply with it, facing large civil penalties if the challenge failed. This dilemma, without pre-enforcement review, forces recipients to risk penalties or incur compliance costs for an ACO they dispute, attracting interest in legal literature and lower courts. The Supreme Court took the Sackett case, which concerned ACOs under Section 404 of the CWA, likely due to this issue. The Sacketts, owners of a lot in Idaho, received an ACO alleging their property was a wetland under CWA Section 404. They were ordered to remove fill material and restore the lot, with the option to discuss alternative compliance methods. Failure to comply could result in penalties. The Sacketts received an Administrative Compliance Order (ACO) under the Clean Water Act (CWA) regarding their property being a wetland. They sought a hearing to challenge the order, but EPA denied it. The district court dismissed their case, stating that CWA precludes judicial review of ACOs before EPA files an enforcement action in court. The Ninth Circuit affirmed this decision. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that the Clean Water Act prohibits pre-enforcement review of Administrative Compliance Orders (ACOs). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if pre-enforcement review of the ACO issued against the Sacketts is available under the Administrative Procedure Act and if the inability to seek pre-enforcement review violates the Due Process Clause. The Court's decision to grant certiorari in Sackett, while denying a similar petition for certiorari under the Superfund Act, may indicate a willingness to resolve the ACO pre-enforcement issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett allowed for judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination underlying the Administrative Compliance Order (ACO) issued against the Sacketts. This ruling was seen as a resolution of the ACO pre-enforcement issue, potentially influenced by concerns of the Court's conservative wing regarding the definition of wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett allows for judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination underlying the ACO issued against the Sacketts. The Court's ruling was unanimous and came quickly after oral arguments, showing signs of an easy decision. The Court found the ACO to be \"final agency action\" under the APA, determining rights and remedies for the Sacketts. The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett allows for judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination underlying the ACO issued against the Sacketts. The Court found the ACO to be \"final agency action\" under the APA, imposing duties on the Sacketts and limiting their options for obtaining a Section 404 permit. The Court also ruled that there is no other adequate remedy in court for a Section 404 ACO, rejecting EPA's argument that enforcement in federal district court suffices.

The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett allows for judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination underlying the ACO issued against the Sacketts. The Court emphasized the importance of judicial review and disagreed with EPA's reasoning against it. The constitutional question of whether a bar on pre-enforcement review satisfies procedural due process was not addressed in the Court's opinion. The merits issue of whether the Sacketts' property contains a wetland subject to permitting under CWA Section 404 was also not raised on appeal. The Supreme Court's decision in Sackett allows for judicial review of EPA's jurisdictional determination regarding the wetlands permit requirement. The Court has previously grappled with the geographic scope of this program, highlighting the vexing issue of federal vs. state authority. The Sacketts may still need to litigate in district court to prove their property contains no wetlands if they wish to build on it. The Sacketts may need to litigate in district court to prove their property contains no wetlands for building. If wetlands are found, they must apply for a Section 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers. EPA will need to decide on enforcement options in response to the ruling. The EPA may face a trade-off between preparing full administrative records for ACOs and issuing a smaller number of them after the Sackett case. Another option is for the agency to skip compliance orders and go straight to civil enforcement actions in court for monetary penalties, reducing negotiation opportunities with recipients. The EPA may consider using noncompliance letters as a response to the Sackett case, which inform recipients of suspected violations without direct legal consequences. Unlike ACOs, these letters do not result in penalties for non-compliance. The significance of Sackett lies in its potential application beyond CWA Section 404, with a focus on the number of ACOs issued by the EPA and the possibility of litigation options for recipients. The Sackett case's significance extends beyond CWA Section 404, with lower courts applying it to other parts of the CWA and other statutes. Some statutes allow pre-enforcement review of EPA orders, while others do not, raising questions about constitutionality. In the Sackett case, there are questions about its applicability within the Section 404 program, specifically regarding the division of enforcement responsibilities between the EPA and the Corps of Engineers. The 1989 memorandum of agreement outlines that the EPA is responsible for enforcement in cases of unpermitted discharges, while the Corps enforces permit violations. The Court's opinion in Sackett only applies to pre-enforcement challenges to EPA determinations on wetlands, not compliance orders. The Sackett case contrasts with current case law on reviewability of Corps jurisdictional determinations, which are separate from permit violations and may not be subject to judicial review despite being deemed final agency actions by the Corps. Sackett case found finality in agency decisions, focusing on consummation of decision-making process and fixing rights. Corps jurisdictional determinations may not easily fit this criteria. Landowners may seek to challenge reviewability post-Sackett. Debate on pre-enforcement review of agency decisions continues, balancing interests of government agency and order recipient. Future developments expected in judicial realm. Future developments are expected in both the judicial and administrative realms, addressing issues such as the precedential reach of court decisions and the vagueness of criteria for determining jurisdictional wetlands. Congress may need to focus on clarifying these criteria to avoid leaving interested parties to navigate on a case-by-case basis."
