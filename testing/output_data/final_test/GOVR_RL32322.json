    "content": "On October 1, 2002, the Bush Administration notified Congress of the intention to enter negotiations for a free trade agreement with five Central American countries. Negotiations for a U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) were completed on December 17, 2003, with Costa Rica joining later. President Bush signed the CAFTA pact on May 28, 2004. Additionally, negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Dominican Republic were completed on March 15, 2004. The Dominican Republic and Central American countries signed the United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) on August 5, 2004. Central America includes Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, with Panama and Belize having distinctive backgrounds. Panama was part of Colombia until 1903 and has special ties to the U.S. due to the Panama Canal. Belize was British Honduras until 1981. Belize was formerly known as British Honduras until gaining independence in 1981. The Central American Common Market (CACM) was formed in the 1960s to promote economic growth but collapsed in the 1970s and 1980s due to civil conflicts. A new integration mechanism was created in the 1990s after peace initiatives in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. The Central American Integration System (SICA) was established through two protocols to create a customs union and promote cooperation among member countries. Belize and the Dominican Republic later joined as members. The DR-CAFTA partner countries are small with varying levels of development, ranging in size and population. In 2004, Central American countries had varying Gross National Incomes (GNI) ranging from $4.5 billion for Nicaragua to $26.9 billion for Guatemala. Costa Rica had the highest per capita income at $4,670, classified as an upper middle-income country. Growth rates in 2004 ranged from 3.7% to 4.6% for Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras. In 2004, Central American countries had varying growth rates ranging from 1.7% to 4.6%. Costa Rica had high human development, ranking 47th globally, while other countries had medium human development with rankings between 95 and 110. Central American countries, except for Haiti, have medium human development rankings ranging from 95 to 117. The United States has close ties to the region, being the dominant market and major source of investment and assistance. The United States has had sustained interest in Central America for over two decades, providing significant economic and military assistance to the region, especially to El Salvador. This support was increased in response to President Reagan's call for the Caribbean Basin Initiative in the early 1980s and recommendations from the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America in the mid-1980s. Congress provided over $11 billion in aid from FY1978 to FY1990. In 1990, Congress passed the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) to address concerns in the region. The United States is a major trading partner for Central American countries, with significant exports and imports. The United States is a major trading partner for Central American countries, with Nicaragua receiving 25% of total imports and Honduras depending on the US for 49% of its imports. The US concluded a Free Trade Agreement with El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in 2003, with Costa Rica joining later in 2004 after initial withdrawal. Costa Rican delegations reached agreement on January 25, 2004, and the CAFTA pact was signed on May 28, 2004. Negotiations with the Dominican Republic were completed on March 15, 2004, and the United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) was signed on August 5, 2004. The United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) was signed on August 5, 2004. The agreement includes provisions for duty-free treatment of U.S. consumer and industrial products, with tariffs phased out over time. It also covers services, intellectual property rights, government procurement, and labor and environmental protections. Views on the agreement vary. The DR-CAFTA agreement aims to streamline trade, promote investment, slash tariffs, remove trade barriers, provide intellectual property protections, promote regulatory transparency, strengthen labor and environmental conditions, and settle disputes effectively. Various groups, including the U.S. Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, support the agreement as a model for trade liberalization. The U.S. Central America Trade urged House and Senate leaders to take action on the trade pact for better access for U.S. producers. Administration officials argued that the agreement would benefit small countries with important markets and promote economic reform and democracy. However, critics, including labor and environmental groups, found the labor and environmental provisions to be inadequate. Trade, a coalition of non-governmental organizations, criticized the CAFTA for weak labor and environmental provisions, with strong investor and intellectual property rights for businesses. The Dominican Participation and Consultation on Free Trade, a coalition of Dominican church and cultural groups, shared similar concerns about the integration of the Dominican Republic into the CAFTA agreement. Democratic Members from the House and the Senate criticized the labor and environmental provisions of the agreement before its signing. John F. Kerry, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, stated he would renegotiate the agreement if elected to strengthen labor and environmental provisions. In mid-December 2004, labor unions and non-governmental organizations filed petitions with the USTR. The USTR received petitions from labor unions and NGOs claiming Central American countries should lose GSP benefits due to labor rights violations. Representative Levin and Senator Bingaman argued that labor protections in these countries do not meet ILO standards. Contentious issues in the agreement included agriculture, apparel/textiles, and labor and environmental provisions. Over 50% of U.S. farm products will have immediate duty-free status in Central American markets under the agreement. The agreement will phase out within 15-20 years. Quotas for sensitive products like white corn, sugar, beef, peanuts, dairy products, tobacco, and cotton will gradually increase. Central American farm products will have permanent duty-free status in U.S. markets. Sugar quotas received an immediate increase, but high over-quota tariffs remain in force. Sugar imports from regional countries would be about 1.3% of U.S. sugar production in the first year. The U.S. sugar industry opposes the DR-CAFTA agreement due to concerns about increased sugar imports damaging U.S. producers. Despite efforts to address these concerns, no acceptable agreement was reached. Critics argue that the agreement unfairly pits subsidized U.S. agricultural interests against poor farmers in Central America, potentially leading to the loss of livelihoods. The U.S. sugar industry opposes the DR-CAFTA agreement due to concerns about increased sugar imports damaging U.S. producers. The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America (R-CALF USA) joined Americans for Fair Trade in calling for Congress to reject the pact. The agreement lacks safeguard provisions for U.S. producers in the event of a rapid increase in Central American imports. Apparel and textiles will be duty-free and quota-free immediately under more liberal rules of origin. The DR-CAFTA agreement will provide duty-free treatment to apparel produced in Central America and the Dominican Republic with certain fabrics from NAFTA partners. Some U.S. textile groups initially opposed the agreement but later supported it with modifications. Labor provisions in DR-CAFTA go beyond those in other free trade agreements. The DR-CAFTA labor provisions go beyond those in other free trade agreements by requiring enforcement of domestic labor laws, collaboration with the ILO, and providing technical assistance to Central American countries. The Emergency Committee for American Trade argues that these protections are strong, while the AFL-CIO believes they are deficient as they only require enforcement of current laws. The U.S. labor organization argues that the DR-CAFTA agreement's provisions are weaker than existing requirements for worker rights. Some members of Congress advocate for enforceable commitments to international labor standards. A scholar suggests enforcing current laws while strengthening worker rights. The Ministers responsible for trade and labor in the DR-CAFTA countries met in Washington, D.C. in July 2004 to strengthen labor law compliance. With assistance from various organizations, they are working to enhance labor and environmental law enforcement capacity through a $20 million assistance package. Labor unions and NGOs filed petitions claiming Central American countries should be denied GSP benefits due to lack of progress in respecting labor rights. Representative Sander Levin and Senator Jeff Bingaman cited reports showing countries' labor rights violations. The Labor Rights Fund, funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, highlighted that countries' labor protections do not meet ILO standards. The Administration pledged $40 million annually from FY2006 to FY2009 to help regional countries improve labor and environmental standards. USTR stated that DR-CAFTA includes an advanced environmental chapter with a public submission process and an Environmental Cooperation Commission. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the agreement. The seven DR-CAFTA countries signed agreements in 2005 to strengthen environmental monitoring, including establishing a multilateral secretariat and an Environmental Cooperation Agreement. The U.S. Congress approved $20 million in FY2005 for assistance to enhance labor and environmental standards, with a promise of $40 million annually from FY2006 to FY2009. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the environmental provisions in the agreement. In June 2005, the DR-CAFTA countries signed agreements to strengthen environmental monitoring. The U.S. Congress approved $20 million in FY2005 for assistance, with a promise of $40 million annually from FY2006 to FY2009. The pact was approved by three countries before the United States, with some opposition in others. The Bush Administration delayed submitting implementing legislation to Congress before the 2004 election. Following President Bush's re-election in November 2004, the issue of trade agreements reemerged as important. Disputes with the Dominican Republic and Guatemala were resolved in early 2005, and the vacancy in the leadership of the USTR was filled with the approval of Representative Rob Portman as the new leader in April 2005. President Bush's nominee Representative Rob Portman of Ohio was approved as the new USTR on April 28, 2005. The President pushed for the passage of DR-CAFTA as a top priority, with hearings held in mid-2005. The agreement was approved in the Senate Finance Committee on June 14, 2005, and in the House Ways and Means Committee on June 15, 2005. Various efforts to add amendatory language were made but most were unsuccessful. The President pushed for the passage of DR-CAFTA as a top priority. The implementing legislation (S. 1307 / H.R. 3045) was approved by the Senate and House in June and July 2005. The measure was signed into law (P.L. 109-53) by President Bush on August 2, 2005. The Administration agreed to limit sugar imports, study using sugar for ethanol production, and provide assistance to strengthen labor and environmental standards. They also promised favorable provisions for apparel and sock producers and established monitoring requirements for unfair Chinese trading practices. After U.S. approval, two other countries also approved the pact, leaving Costa Rica as the only non-approving country. Costa Rica is the only country that has not approved the agreement. In the Dominican Republic, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies approved it in August and September 2005. Nicaragua's legislature approved the pact in October 2005. President Pacheco of Costa Rica has been hesitant to push for approval due to upcoming elections. The agreement is set to enter into force on January 1, 2006, for approving countries. Costa Rica is known for its political stability and economic development since independence in 1848. Costa Rica abolished its military in 1948, with civilian governments in place since then. The Constitution prohibits a standing army, with law enforcement and national security handled by the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of the Presidency. The country ranks 47th in the UN's Human Development Report for 2004, with a life expectancy of 77.9 years and a literacy rate of 95%. Approximately 42% of the land is used for agriculture. Costa Rica's land is mainly devoted to agriculture, jungle, and protected areas for ecotourism. It serves as a transit point for illegal drugs but cooperates with the US on drug interdiction. The country has low corruption levels but recent presidents have faced corruption charges. Abel Pacheco, the current president, took office in 2002 and belongs to the Social Christian Unity Party. Abel Pacheco won the election against Rolando Araya of the National Liberation Party. He ran on an anti-corruption platform but later admitted to receiving illegal campaign contributions. His administration faced numerous cabinet changes due to disagreements on policies, leading to a sharp decline in public support. In 2003, the Constitutional Court ruled against the prohibition on non-consecutive re-election, benefiting former President Oscar Arias. Oscar Arias governed from 1986 to 1990 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his work on the peace process in Central America. He won the candidacy of the National Liberation Party in 2005 for the presidential election in 2006. Arias is the current front-runner, supporting CAFTA, while other candidates have criticized it. Costa Rica often served as a mediator during guerrilla conflicts in Central America in the 1980s. Relations with other Central American nations are close due to economic integration efforts. Costa Rica, known for its stable democracy and high economic development, has tensions with Nicaragua over navigation rights and immigration. It followed a social-democratic model until the 1980s, when heavy borrowing led to a foreign debt default in 1983. Structural adjustment agreements with international financial institutions followed. Costa Rica underwent economic liberalization and privatized many state-owned enterprises following agreements with international financial institutions. Despite this, certain sectors like insurance, telecommunications, and transportation remain state-owned. Difficulties with state monopolies led to Costa Rica briefly withdrawing from CAFTA negotiations in 2003. However, bilateral negotiations with the United States resumed in 2004, resulting in an agreement to open up Costa Rica's private network services and cellular phone market by specific deadlines. Costa Rica invested heavily in public health, with a GDP growth rate of 4% in 2004 despite challenges in agricultural exports. The country attracted foreign direct investment, particularly in the computer sector, and developed a more equitable income distribution. Costa Rica's economy relies on manufacturing, agriculture, and services. It is a major banana and coffee exporter, with a focus on attracting high technology companies. Intel has invested significantly in the country, creating a major export industry and attracting foreign direct investment. In 2003, Intel announced a $110 million investment in Costa Rican operations, increasing employment to 2,400. High technology electronics exports grew by 52.8%, earning $1.4 billion. Other key industries include food processing, textiles, and metal processing. Costa Rica has strong relations with the United States, supporting the U.S. military mission in Iraq. Costa Rica initially supported the U.S. military mission in Iraq, facing criticism from the public and former presidents. The country joined the G20 group opposing U.S.-EU positions at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun but later withdrew. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick warned Costa Rica to open its telecommunications and insurance sectors or risk exclusion from CAFTA, a move opposed by most Costa Ricans. Costa Rica withdrew from CAFTA negotiations due to unresolved issues with telecommunications and electricity monopolies. Despite receiving minimal U.S. aid, the country has seen a decline in economic assistance since the 1990s. IMET funds, used for training law enforcement and coast guard personnel, have also decreased in recent years. Costa Rica received $50,000 in FY2006 in IMET funds. The country has an active Peace Corps program and receives no direct U.S. counterdrug funds. The United States is Costa Rica's major trading partner, with a significant amount of U.S. investment in the country. Costa Rica also received $50,000 in disaster assistance from the United States in response to recent floods. Costa Rica has heavy business regulations causing inefficiency, delays, and corruption. Importation of U.S. beef was temporarily halted in 2003 due to BSE. Plant inspection requirements have hindered the resumption of imports. Major U.S. companies invested in Costa Rica include Chiquita, Dole, 3M, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, and others. Costa Rica attracts major U.S. companies like Colgate-Palmolive, Intel, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble. The country also hosts pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Abbott Laboratories. Leaders support liberalized trade, with internal debate on CAFTA benefits. Costa Rica's business landscape includes companies from various sectors like technology, healthcare, and tourism. Costa Rica's approval of the CAFTA agreement faced challenges due to disagreements with the United States over opening state-owned sectors. After bilateral negotiations in 2004, Costa Rica joined CAFTA and signed free trade agreements with several countries. Central American nations had tariff-free access to the U.S. market through the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, set to expire in 2008. The DR-CAFTA agreements aimed to make this arrangement permanent and reciprocal. Costa Rica sought greater foreign investment in strategic areas like electronics assembly, healthcare, and business services. The focus shifted from agriculture to manufacturing due to decreasing export value. An FTA with the US was expected to boost tourism and export sector productivity. The telecommunications sector is advanced but state-owned, with privatization proposals sparking controversy. Internet and e-commerce usage is high, but the system is deemed inadequate. President Pacheco aims to restructure the state-owned Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) to modernize infrastructure and attract high technology firms. Intel's growth in Costa Rica is hindered by the lack of modernization, especially in Internet connections and speed. Costa Rica has resisted calls to liberalize its telecommunications and insurance sectors, despite US negotiations for compatibility and non-discriminatory treatment between domestic and foreign suppliers. Costa Rica has resisted liberalizing its telecommunications and insurance sectors, leading to disagreements during U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick's visit in 2003. Costa Rican officials were told that an open telecommunications sector was necessary for an agreement, and that CAFTA could proceed without Costa Rica. This decision was met with displeasure from union leaders and business executives, who argued that other agreements allowed state ownership. Costa Rica eventually withdrew from the final round of CAFTA negotiations. Costa Rica resisted liberalizing its telecommunications and insurance sectors during CAFTA negotiations. The United States called for total access to the insurance industry, but Costa Rica believed there was not enough time to resolve differences. The final agreement allowed access to private network, internet, and wireless services by specific deadlines. The apparel industry in Costa Rica is less significant to its economy compared to its neighbors. Costa Rica supported a more liberal rule for the CAFTA agreement, allowing apparel makers to acquire yarn from the US, Central America, or third countries. U.S. negotiators proposed a rule for using third country providers when components are scarce, but Central Americans wanted duty-free access for apparel assembled in the region from foreign fabric. Agriculture also posed challenges in negotiations. Agricultural issues in negotiations with Central America included addressing US farm subsidies and gaining access to the US market for their products. Costa Rica agreed to eliminate tariffs on most agricultural products within specific timeframes, increase sugar export quota, and protect fresh onions and potatoes. Environmental agreements were also signed in 2005. Costa Rica endorsed the DR-CAFTA agreement in 2005 and has a full complement of domestic environmental laws. The country enforces environmental impact studies for construction projects and is party to 68 environmental agreements. Costa Rica is part of numerous international environmental agreements, such as the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity and the Kyoto Protocol. The power of organized labor has declined, with unions representing various sectors. The country guarantees the right of workers to join unions, with an estimated 12% of the labor force being unionized. Costa Rica guarantees the right of workers to join unions, with an estimated 12% of the labor force being unionized. Unions operate independently of the government, with 80% of members in the public sector. The Constitution and labor code provide strong protections for fundamental labor rights, allowing public sector strikes with judicial approval. Private sector unions have no restrictions on collective bargaining or striking. The Constitution in Costa Rica guarantees the right of workers to join unions, with 12% of the labor force unionized. The minimum wage is set by a National Wage Council, but enforcement is more effective in urban areas than rural areas. Health and safety laws require firms with ten or more workers to establish workplace committees, but resources for enforcement are lacking. Costa Rica's enforcement of health and safety legal requirements has been petitioned for review due to violations of workers' rights. The country has harmonized its regulations with international obligations on intellectual property, but enforcement issues persist, particularly in protecting copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Despite these challenges, Costa Rica was placed on the Special 301 Watch List by the USTR in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Intellectual Property Alliance criticizes Costa Rica's enforcement activities and fines for not deterring intellectual property infringement, estimating trade losses of $17.6 million in 2002. President Pacheco delayed sending the DR-CAFTA agreement to the legislature for over two years, facing opposition due to low public opinion and upcoming elections. President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) took office on August 16, 2004, and signed a $665 million loan agreement with the IMF in February 2005. The economy saw a 5.8% GDP growth in the first half of 2005, with inflation decreasing and currency value improving. However, challenges remain with high crime rates, corruption, and electricity shortages. Human rights organizations have criticized the government for various issues. The Dominican Republic approved the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement in 2005. The country underwent rapid economic growth in the 1990s and established stronger democratic institutions. The \"Pact for Democracy\" in 1994 led to free and fair elections, removing Joaquin Balaguer from power in 1996. Balaguer, a six-term president and follower of Rafael Trujillo, dominated politics until his death in 2002. Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez succeeded Balaguer in 1996 and oversaw a period of economic growth. After a period of economic growth, Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda easily defeated the PLD candidate in the 2000 election by promising rural development. However, he lost support due to excessive spending and bailing out deposit holders after bank failures. In the 2004 election, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez won with 57% of the vote, defeating Mej\u00eda and Eduardo Estrella. In the 2004 election, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez won with 57% of the vote, defeating Mej\u00eda and Eduardo Estrella. Record numbers of Dominicans turned out to support Fern\u00e1ndez, associated with the country's economic boom of the 1990s. The Dominican legislature passed the President's fiscal package in September 2004, leading to a new stand-by agreement with the IMF in January 2005. The agreement should pave the way for additional multilateral disbursements. Corruption was found in an official investigation involving Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda in October 2004. In October 2004, an official investigation revealed corruption involving Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda, who increased his wealth by $800,000 during his presidential term. Mej\u00eda and other officials received money and gifts from Ramon Baez, leading to control of Baninter's associated companies. The Fern\u00e1ndez administration later charged 12 former PRD officials with embezzlement and fraud. The Dominican government faced corruption issues in October 2004, leading to the forced retirement of hundreds of police officers accused of misconduct. The state prosecutor also pursued cases against officials who misappropriated luxury cars. Despite efforts to combat corruption, President Fern\u00e1ndez lost popular support for the low prosecution rate of corrupt officials. The country's human rights record remains poor, with reports of increased police killings and harsh prison conditions. The Dominican Republic faces issues with overcrowded prisons and a poor human rights record. In 2005, a fire set by rival gangs in a prison resulted in 133 deaths. Despite an anti-trafficking law, the country is on a Tier 2 Watch List for failing to prosecute human trafficking cases. The treatment of Haitians and Dominican-Haitians living in the country has also drawn international criticism. Thousands of migrants, many without proper documentation, come from Haiti to work in industries like sugar and construction. The Dominican Republic faces issues with overcrowded prisons and a poor human rights record. In 2005, a fire set by rival gangs in a prison resulted in 133 deaths. Despite an anti-trafficking law, the country is on a Tier 2 Watch List for failing to prosecute human trafficking cases. The treatment of Haitians and Dominican-Haitians living in the country has drawn international criticism due to an influx of cheap Haitian labor. The recent crisis in Haiti has accelerated illegal migration to the Dominican Republic, leading to mass deportations of Haitian immigrants. The Dominican government has requested international assistance to secure its border with Haiti. The Dominican economy experienced rapid growth in the 1990s, fueled by expansion in tourism and free-trade zones. Remittances from Dominicans abroad added $1.5 billion annually to foreign exchange reserves. Market-friendly economic reforms, including privatization of state enterprises, were implemented under President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez in the late 1990s. Several state-owned entities, such as a flour mill and airline, were privatized. The Dominican economy, under President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, saw privatization of state-owned entities like sugar mills and electricity distribution companies. However, the privatization of the electric sector faced criticism for not addressing power shortages and financial difficulties. The tourism industry and export-processing zones heavily rely on the global economy, with tourism recovering after a decline in 2001-2002 due to global events. The country's free trade zones faced competition from cheaper goods from Central America and China, leading to a trade deficit with Central American countries in 2003. Despite strong performance in mining and telecommunications, the Dominican economy entered a recession in 2002, putting strain on public finances. The Dominican Republic's public finances were strained after a bank bailout in violation of the monetary code, leading to a record fraud of $2.2 billion. President Mej\u00eda received gifts from the bank's former president. The administration negotiated a $600 million IMF loan but only received $120 million before failing to comply with conditions. In February 2004, a renegotiation allowed an additional $66 million disbursement, but the administration soon fell out of compliance with targets. Two other commercial banks were bailed out in late 2003, resulting in $700 million in losses to the Dominican Central Bank. By the end of 2003, inflation reached 42%, unemployment was at 16.5%, and the peso lost more than half its value. Since August 2004, the peso has regained its pre-crisis value, inflation has slowed, and the economy grew 2% in 2004. A fiscal bill aims to reduce the budget deficit, but austerity measures may negatively impact the poor and middle classes. The Dominican Republic is facing economic challenges with postponed salary increases, high inflation, and electricity providers struggling to provide service. The country's relationship with the United States remains strong, but the economic crisis is evident with undocumented migrants intercepted at sea en route to Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic's economic challenges include postponed salary increases, high inflation, and electricity providers struggling to provide service. The country's relationship with the United States is strong, with reforms in the justice system and market-friendly economic laws well received. Concerns arise from the Baninter scandal, economic crisis in 2003, and rise in crime against foreign tourists. The US government appreciates the Dominican government's participation in the coalition in Iraq and hopes to assist in restoring economic prosperity through free trade and fighting crime and corruption. The United States is the largest bilateral donor to the Dominican Republic, providing foreign aid for various development and health programs. In response to a flood in 2004, USAID donated $300,000 to NGOs in the region. President Bush designated the Dominican Republic as a major drug transit country in the Caribbean in 2005. The Dominican Republic is a major drug transit country in the Caribbean, with significant cocaine flow to the United States. The government has increased efforts to combat drug-related activities, including seizures, arrests, and extraditions. They have also implemented anti-money laundering laws and a new Criminal Procedure Code. The United States is the Dominican Republic's main trading partner, with significant exports and imports in goods like apparel and textiles. The Dominican Republic has a strong trade relationship with the United States, importing $4.5 billion in goods, with a focus on apparel and clothing. It has benefited from the Caribbean Basin Initiative and has the largest U.S. sugar quota. The country has 51 free trade zones that have driven rapid growth, and by signing DR-CAFTA, it aims to improve access to the U.S. market and attract new investments. The United States and the Dominican Republic concluded a free-trade agreement (FTA) to integrate the Dominican Republic into CAFTA, benefiting trade with Central American nations. The FTA allows 80% of U.S. exports to become duty-free immediately, with the remaining tariffs phased out. The Dominican Republic aims to improve access to the U.S. market and attract new investments through the agreement. The Dominican Republic and the United States signed a free-trade agreement to join CAFTA, with most tariffs on industrial and agricultural goods phased out over 10-20 years. A controversial issue was the Dominican tax on drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, which threatened the country's inclusion in DR-CAFTA. The Dominican government repealed the HCFS tax to secure inclusion in DR-CAFTA. The country must now address concerns of sugar producers while supporting its FTZs, which are a significant source of employment. Textile and apparel products would be traded duty-free under the FTA. The Dominican Republic would benefit from CAFTA provisions for incorporating Mexican or Canadian inputs, ensuring U.S. preferential treatment for textiles and apparel. The country has lost market share to China since 2005 due to quota elimination, resulting in job losses for textile workers. An unresolved issue is apparel made under co-production arrangements with Haiti. CBTPA benefits expire by September 30, 2008 or with the entry into force of another FTA between the U.S. and a beneficiary country. If the FTA between the Dominican Republic and the United States enters into force, articles co-produced by Haiti and the Dominican Republic might no longer qualify under CBTPA. The Dominican Republic is party to various environmental agreements and has taken steps to address erosion and deforestation issues. The Dominican Republic has made progress in environmental laws and established the Secretariat for the Environment in 2000. However, a new National Parks bill in 2004 may open up protected areas to foreign tourism developers. Deforestation in Haiti and building on dry riverbeds in the Dominican Republic have led to disastrous floods. Worker rights are protected by the Constitution and Labor Code, but there are challenges in implementing these rights. Workers in the Dominican Republic have the freedom to organize labor unions, but face challenges such as insufficient penalties for violating worker rights. Collective bargaining is legal, but requirements are considered excessive. Child labor is a serious issue, with almost one-fifth of children aged 5 to 17 working in various sectors. The Ministry of Labor, in collaboration with international organizations, is addressing child labor issues in the Dominican Republic, particularly in small businesses, sugarcane fields, and forced prostitution. Concerns have been raised about worker rights violations, especially in export processing zones and the sugar industry. Critics argue that trade agreements like CAFTA may not effectively monitor labor practices, leading to continued abuses such as firing pregnant women from jobs in the export-processing sector. Proponents of DR-CAFTA argue that the agreement includes provisions for enforcing domestic labor laws and improving labor standards. A Working Group was formed by the Dominican Republic and other DR-CAFTA countries to enhance labor law compliance and strengthen labor institutions. The Dominican Republic, as part of DR-CAFTA, has been working to improve labor law compliance and strengthen labor institutions. Despite having strong legislation and regulatory framework for intellectual property rights, concerns about enforcement remain. The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates U.S. industry losses due to piracy in the Dominican Republic at $16.3 million in 2004. In 2004, losses due to piracy in the Dominican Republic totaled $16.3 million. President Mej\u00eda sent DR-CAFTA to Congress on August 14, 2004, and President Fern\u00e1ndez supported the agreement on August 16, 2004. The Senate approved DR-CAFTA on August 26, 2005, followed by the Chamber of Deputies on September 6, 2005. The Dominican government must now address concerns of sugar producers without risking the country's finances. El Salvador's growth has stagnated, relying heavily on remittances after a peace accord ended a 12-year civil war in 1992. The peace accord ended El Salvador's 12-year civil war, with 75,000 deaths. President Antonio Saca, from the conservative ARENA party, was elected in March 2004 with 57.7% of the vote, defeating his rival Shafick Handal of the FMLN. Saca was inaugurated on June 1, 2004, for a five-year term. The third party candidates receiving 5% of the vote reflected the polarization between FMLN and ARENA. Handal opposed ARENA's economic policies, including privatization schemes, dollarization, participation in DR-CAFTA, and sending troops to Iraq. President Saca's victory in the first round was a setback for FMLN, which had high expectations based on previous election results. President Saca won the election for the third time, maintaining free market economic policies. Tensions within the FMLN led to mass defections and the creation of a new party. Saca aims to increase tourism and make the country a logistical hub for economic growth. He called for dialogue with the FMLN but faced boycotts. Less than three weeks after his inauguration, President Saca passed the 2004 budget by allocating more funds to health and education sectors and municipalities. This was followed by an increase in the minimum pension and the approval of anti-gang reforms known as the \"Super Firm Hand\" package, despite criticism for violating human rights standards. President Saca faces challenges in 2005 as FMLN withdraws support from multiparty commission and opposes budget provisions. Despite FMLN's opposition to privatization and changes in public health and education programs, their influence in the Assembly has decreased. President Saca was able to ratify the DR-CAFTA agreement with support from small parties. El Salvador's economy, once following a \"neo-liberal\" model, has seen a decline in growth in recent years. Factors such as high oil prices and disruptions from natural disasters have contributed to this slowdown. Remittances now make up 15% of the country's GDP, highlighting its reliance on the global economy for success. The economy of El Salvador faced disruptions from Hurricane Mitch in 1998, earthquakes in 2001, a decline in coffee prices, and the U.S. economic slowdown post-September 11, 2001. The earthquakes caused significant damage, leaving many homeless and jobless. The country's coffee industry suffered losses due to plummeting international prices. The U.S. recession and slow recovery in 2001-2002 reduced demand for Salvadoran exports. Despite some recovery, competition from other producers limited export demand. El Salvador's economy has struggled with natural disasters, declining coffee prices, and the impact of the U.S. economic slowdown. Despite modest growth, poverty levels have increased, with 48% of the population living in poverty. Dollarization has raised living costs, while privatization has faced opposition. A doctors' strike in 2003 halted the privatization of the social security system. The privatization of El Salvador's social security system was halted in June 2003. Income inequality is significant, with the richest 10% earning 47.4 times more than the poorest 10%. Gang violence is a major issue, with 30,000 youth belonging to street gangs. In 2004, there were 2,756 homicides, 60% of which were gang-related. Gangs are involved in human trafficking, drug trafficking, and kidnapping, posing a threat to the country's stability. Anti-gang legislation led to a 14% drop in murders in 2004. In 2005, El Salvador tightened gun ownership laws and established a joint security force with Guatemala to combat gang activity along their border. While anti-gang measures focused on law enforcement and penalties, NGOs urged more focus on rehabilitating gang members. The United States has maintained a strong interest in El Salvador's political and security issues. In the last two decades, the United States has been involved in El Salvador's political and economic situation. After the 1992 peace accords, U.S. aid shifted towards helping the country's economy. El Salvador signed the DR-CAFTA in 2003 to strengthen economic ties. Despite opposition, El Salvador ratified DR-CAFTA in 2004. El Salvador was the first country in Central America to ratify DR-CAFTA. Despite protests, they maintained troops in Iraq since 2003. The US is establishing an International Law Enforcement Academy in El Salvador. US foreign aid to El Salvador shifted from military to development assistance in the 1990s. Military aid peaked in 1984 but declined significantly by the 1990s. Reconstruction assistance was provided after natural disasters in 1998 and 2001. For FY2005, Congress appropriated $40.2 million for El Salvador, with a request for $42.5 million in FY2006. The funding supports various development and health programs, as well as Peace Corps volunteers. El Salvador serves as a transit country for narcotics, with the National Police seizing cocaine and heroin. The country also hosts U.S. anti-drug forces and helped seize narcotics in 2004. El Salvador supported U.S. military operations in Iraq by sending multiple contingents of troops despite opposition from 60% of Salvadorans. The United States granted Temporary Protected Status to around 290,000 undocumented Salvadoran migrants in response to natural disasters in El Salvador. The U.S. government extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for undocumented Salvadoran migrants in the United States until September 9, 2006. TPS is crucial for El Salvador, as its migrants sent home $2.5 billion in remittances in 2004. The exodus of migrants has eased pressure on El Salvador's social services and labor market. The U.S. has played a key role in El Salvador's market-friendly economy, with privatization, foreign investment, and free trade principles. The U.S. is El Salvador's main trading partner, with 60% of exports going to the U.S. and 50% of imports coming from the U.S. Over 300 U.S. companies operate in El Salvador. The composition of U.S. imports from El Salvador has changed significantly due to trade preference systems like the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. In 2002, apparel products made up 79% of the $1.98 billion worth of Salvadoran exports to the United States. More than 300 U.S. companies operate in El Salvador, many in free trade zones. DR-CAFTA aims to make permanent the duty-free treatment status for apparel made in Central America from U.S. fabrics. The CBTPA provides quota-free treatment for apparel made in Central America from U.S. fabrics and yarns. The agreement relaxes the \"yarn forward\" provision, extending duty-free access to garments made from materials from the U.S. or Central America. El Salvador supports DR-CAFTA to attract U.S. investment in local production capacity for paper, plastic, and processed foods. Some believe El Salvador withdrew from the G-20 group under U.S. pressure in 2003. El Salvador, under President Flores, supported DR-CAFTA and signed bilateral free trade agreements with several countries. The country ratified the agreement on December 17, 2004, becoming the first in the region to do so. The G-20 group, including Brazil, India, and China, challenged the US and European countries to remove agricultural subsidies at the WTO meeting in Cancun in 2003. El Salvador's Economy Minister denied reports of aligning with the G-21 group's interests. El Salvador ratified the DR-CAFTA agreement on December 17, 2004, making it the first country in the region to do so. Critics warn that without safeguards, the agreement may harm small farmers by exposing them to global economic downturns and competition from highly subsidized US producers. El Salvador's heavy reliance on apparel exports to the US raises concerns about the potential impact of DR-CAFTA on its economy. El Salvador hopes that DR-CAFTA, along with favorable external conditions, can help achieve the predicted benefits of CBTPA for its apparel sector and protect it from Asian competition. The country aims to develop its textile industry beyond basic operations to produce finished goods. Additionally, in May 1997, El Salvador passed an Environmental Law to protect its flora and fauna. El Salvador has strong environmental provisions and is a signatory to multiple international agreements. Despite this, it faces severe environmental challenges, being the second most deforested country in Latin America with contaminated water and soil erosion. The lack of forest cover increases vulnerability to natural disasters. The country's dense population exacerbates these issues. El Salvador, the most densely populated country in the region, has environmental provisions under DR-CAFTA but struggles with enforcement. It has ratified ILO conventions against discrimination, forced labor, and child labor but has not signed conventions protecting trade union rights. Only 5% of the labor force is unionized. In El Salvador, only 5% of the labor force is unionized, facing minimal protection due to a weak Ministry of Labor and a corrupt judicial system. The existing labor code restricts freedom of association, with burdensome union registration procedures and prohibitions on union formation and strikes in the public sector. Workers in Export Processing Zones report abuse, harassment, and lack of collective bargaining agreements. Opponents of DR-CAFTA criticize the agreement for potentially perpetuating labor abuses in El Salvador, citing weak provisions that only require enforcement of existing labor laws. The International Labor Rights Fund questioned El Salvador's eligibility for trade preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences due to its weak labor laws. In December 2004, Salvadoran-born U.S. union leader Gilberto Soto was murdered, raising concerns about labor rights in the country. Labor and human rights advocates have expressed concerns about the Salvadoran government's handling of the murder of union leader Gilberto Soto in 2004. The government's investigation was criticized for irregularities and accusations of torture. Despite obstacles, there have been positive developments for workers' rights in El Salvador in recent years. In recent years, El Salvador has made progress in addressing labor rights issues, including acknowledging problems in the maquila sector and receiving funding to combat child labor. A Working Group was formed with other DR-CAFTA countries to improve labor standards in the region. El Salvador has laws in place to protect intellectual property rights, including agreements with the WTO and the United States. The government passed an Intellectual Property Law in 1993 and has since improved compliance with TRIPS through the Law of Trademarks and Other Distinctive Signs. The Attorney General's office enforces these laws through raids on manufacturers and distributors of pirated goods, with a focus on pirated CDs since 2002. The focus of raids in El Salvador has shifted to pirated CDs, leading to significant trade losses for U.S. companies. Despite better laws, expedited court proceedings and tough punishments for pirates are lacking, hindering increased U.S. trade and investment. The Legislative Assembly ratified DR-CAFTA in 2004, despite objections, with a vote of 49-35. Guatemala ratified DR-CAFTA in 2005 with support from various political parties. The country has been transitioning towards democracy since the 1980s, with a democratic constitution adopted in 1985. Guatemala's civil war, which lasted 36 years, ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords between the government and left-wing guerrilla groups. The Peace Accords in Guatemala, signed in 1996, aimed at addressing the root causes of the civil conflict by reducing the military size and budget, investing in health and education for the rural and indigenous poor, and ensuring indigenous participation in decision-making. The accords also required changes in tax collection and government expenditures. The Peace Accords in Guatemala, signed in 1996, required fundamental changes in tax collection and government expenditures, as well as a restructuring of state institutions, including the military, police, and judicial system. The goal was to end impunity for government security forces and consolidate the rule of law. Former Guatemala City mayor Oscar Berger won the 2003 elections and launched initiatives to fight corruption and modernize the military. Berger has launched major initiatives to fight corruption, modernize the military, enact fiscal reforms, and implement the Peace Accords. He pursued corruption charges against his predecessor, Alfonso Portillo, for inadequate implementation of the peace process, human rights violations, drug trafficking, and corruption. Economic reforms include new income tax rates and a temporary tax for peace process programs. Retired General Efrain Rios Montt remains a destabilizing force despite losing in the first round of elections. Berger's top defense official is General Otto Perez. Berger's defense official, General Otto Perez, resigned in May 2004 over negotiations with the FRG, led by Rios Montt. Berger may protect Rios Montt from prosecution in exchange for support on fiscal reform. Rios Montt's grandson was sentenced for racial discrimination. Guatemala has a large indigenous population facing economic and social marginalization and ethnic discrimination. Guatemala faces significant ethnic discrimination with highly skewed income distribution. Indigenous people, half of the population, have limited income and consumption. Past free market policies have excluded and impoverished the indigenous population, hindering their development. Guatemala's per capita GDP is higher than Honduras and Nicaragua, but social indicators remain lower. Guatemala's per capita GDP is $3,630, with a total GDP of $20.5 billion, the largest in Central America. However, poverty is higher in Guatemala compared to other Central American countries, with estimates varying from 54% to 80% of the population living in poverty. Poverty is highest in rural areas and among the indigenous population, with 75% of rural residents and 76% of indigenous people living in poverty. GDP for 2003 was $24 billion with a growth rate of 2.4%. Traditional exports like coffee and sugar lead Guatemala's economic growth, while non-traditional exports have also seen significant growth. Tourism is increasing, but faces challenges due to security issues. Guatemala's social indicators are poor, with high malnutrition and infant mortality rates. Guatemala's social indicators are poor, with high malnutrition rates among children under five and a significant number of children suffering from stunted growth. The country's illiteracy rate is 31%, with low levels of schooling especially among women, indigenous people, and the rural poor. The implementation of Peace Accords to improve living conditions for indigenous people and women is behind schedule, and access to education remains a challenge according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The 2003 report highlighted that social ministries in Guatemala had low funding compared to the country's needs. Indigenous people and women faced discrimination in the labor market, with limited opportunities for higher-paying jobs. The government needed to address obstacles such as malnutrition, lack of basic services, wage discrimination, and mistreatment by officials. International donors criticized Guatemala for not meeting the minimum tax base target of 12% of GDP agreed upon in the Peace Accords. Guatemala's tax base in 2003 was around 10% of GDP. Guatemala's 2003 tax base was one of the lowest in Latin America, at about 10% of GDP. International donors urged the government to increase tax revenue, reduce military spending, and boost social spending as per the Peace Accords. The Consultative Group, consisting of over 20 donor countries and organizations, emphasized the need for the private sector to support efforts to raise taxes for social ministries and justice institutions. The Berger Administration has taken steps to implement the goals of the Peace Accords and the Consultative Group. The Guatemalan government has implemented a more inclusive development strategy by cutting military spending and reallocating funds to education and health programs. Despite efforts to increase tax revenues to 12% of GDP, they remained at 10.3% in 2004. U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala include strengthening democratic institutions, promoting human rights, supporting economic growth, combating drug trafficking, and fostering Central American integration. Relations between Guatemala and the United States have traditionally focused on these goals. Relations between Guatemala and the United States have been close but strained at times due to human rights and civil-military issues. The Bush Administration expressed concerns over government corruption and lack of cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts. U.S. assistance to Guatemala focused on supporting the Peace Accords with almost $400 million, but there is no longer direct support for their implementation. The change in government in Guatemala is seen as an opportunity to reverse negative trends with donor support essential to maintain democratic progress and prevent the country from becoming a failing state near U.S. borders. U.S. assistance to Guatemala has declined significantly in recent years, with the FY2006 request totaling just under $40 million. The funding includes allocations for Child Survival and Health Programs, development assistance, Economic Support funds, and P.L. 480 Title II food assistance programs. The Administration has provided $5 million in support. There is no longer direct support for the implementation of the Peace Accords, but certain activities will continue in other programs, such as the development of justice centers and efforts to reduce corruption and increase transparency in government institutions. The Administration has provided $5 million in support for Title II food assistance programs in Guatemala following the devastation of a hurricane in October 2005. Congress has placed conditions on military assistance to Guatemala related to democratization and human rights, prohibiting the purchase of weapons with U.S. funds. Since 1990, foreign military financing has been prohibited, with only expanded International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance allowed. The House-passed version of the Foreign Operations appropriations bill for FY2006 would remove restrictions on IMET but retain the prohibition of FMF. The Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights was signed in 1994, establishing a Truth Commission to investigate human rights violations in Guatemala from 1960 to 1996. The Commission reported over 200,000 deaths or disappearances. The Truth Commission in Guatemala reported over 200,000 deaths or disappearances during the armed conflict, with 80% of the victims being indigenous Mayans. The Commission concluded that the state was responsible for 93% of the violations, including acts of genocide against the Mayan population. The state's repressive response was deemed disproportionate to the insurgency, with the majority of victims being civilians. Guatemala has made efforts to improve respect for human rights. Guatemala has made significant progress in respecting human rights, with the armed conflict ending and civilian control over military forces increasing. However, security forces still commit human rights violations with impunity, and the country struggles with racism and social inequality. President Berger has prioritized implementing Peace Accords by reducing the military size and budget. The U.N., OAS, and the United States have expressed concerns about increasing human rights violations in Guatemala. President Berger of Guatemala is modernizing defense policy and improving women's and indigenous rights. Efforts are being made to establish the UN Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations (CICIACS) to prosecute clandestine groups involved in human rights violations, drug trafficking, and organized crime. The UN Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) closed in November 2004 after verifying compliance with the Peace Accords for ten years. President Berger of Guatemala has been focusing on modernizing defense policy and improving women's and indigenous rights. Despite efforts to establish the UN Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations (CICIACS), a climate of security remains elusive in the country. Violent crime has been on the rise, leading President Berger to initiate a \"national crusade against violence\" in July 2004. However, some critics have raised concerns about the effectiveness of this effort. The Guatemalan Supreme Court adopted a plan to protect judges who have received death threats following the murder of a judge in April 2005. Suspected gang members are being killed by clandestine vigilante groups, raising concerns about \"social cleansing\" activities. Guatemala is a major drug-transit country for cocaine and heroin. President Bush designated Guatemala as one of three countries that \"failed demonstrably\" in fulfilling international counter narcotics obligations in 2003. However, efforts were made to improve counter narcotics practices, leading to continued U.S. assistance. Guatemala made efforts to improve its counter narcotics practices, leading to its removal from the list of non-cooperative countries by the Financial Action Task Force in 2004. The Bush Administration acknowledged Guatemala's progress in enacting anti-money laundering legislation in its March 2005 report. The Bush Administration reported that despite Guatemala's substantial counternarcotics efforts in 2004, large shipments of cocaine continued to move through the country by air, road, and sea. Guatemala has a growing domestic drug abuse problem and an aggressive demand reduction program. The United States and Guatemala signed a trade and investment agreement in 1991, leading to the establishment of a bilateral Trade and Investment Council. Guatemala received export trade benefits in 2000 under the Caribbean Basin Trade and Partnership Act, with the United States being its top trade partner. Guatemala's primary exports to the United States include coffee, sugar, bananas, fruits, vegetables, cardamom, meat, apparel, petroleum, and electricity. The U.S. trade deficit with Guatemala was $758 million in 2002, with U.S. exports at $2.0 billion and imports at $2.8 billion. U.S. foreign direct investment in Guatemala was $907 million in 2000, dropping to $477 million in 2001, concentrated in manufacturing and finance sectors. Major U.S. companies in Guatemala include ACS, American Cyanamid Co., Avon Products, BellSouth, Cargill, Citibank, and Coastal Power. President Berger has prioritized attracting domestic and foreign investment to revive the economy and create jobs. The Guatemalan government supports the DR-CAFTA agreement for economic integration with neighboring countries. Guatemala has established free trade areas with El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and is in negotiations to add Chile. Additionally, Guatemala, along with El Salvador and Honduras, implemented a free trade agreement with Mexico in 2001. Guatemala signed a customs agreement with El Salvador in March 2004 to improve regional trade. Concerns about negative outcomes of DR-CAFTA limited opposition due to secretive negotiations. Despite efforts to facilitate foreign investment, Guatemala faced administrative hurdles, corruption, and heavy business regulation. Supporters of DR-CAFTA believe it will benefit farmers by helping those who grow non-traditional crops and reducing migration to the US. However, some Central American governments are concerned about the impact on small subsistence farmers who may struggle to compete with subsidized US commodities. Critics fear DR-CAFTA could have negative effects similar to NAFTA on farmers. The World Bank report suggests that NAFTA has had little impact on small farmers in Southern Mexico who have long been neglected. Concerns exist about the negative impact of opening Central American food production to US competition. Quotas on sensitive agricultural imports from the US will gradually be eliminated by 2020, with white corn receiving perpetual protection. The quota on U.S. white corn imports will increase annually, with high tariffs remaining above the quota level indefinitely. Guatemala sought clarification on sugar treatment in CAFTA, with an additional quota of 32,000 metric tons established for Guatemala's sugar exports to the U.S. The quota will increase annually, but tariffs on shipments over the quota will remain high. Guatemala has 13 free trade zones, with 7 more authorized for creation. In Guatemala, there are 13 free trade zones currently operating, with 7 more authorized for creation. The textile industry is the main beneficiary of Guatemala's free trade laws, with benefits extended under the Caribbean Basin Initiative in 2000. The DR-CAFTA agreement allows textiles to be cut, sewn, and finished in Guatemala for tariff-free export to the United States. However, some U.S. producers have raised concerns about potential harm to their businesses. Additionally, Guatemala has faced criticism for corruption, which has been highlighted by various international organizations and the U.S. government. The Bush Administration identified corruption as a major obstacle in Guatemala, with Transparency International ranking the country as the 33rd most corrupt in 2003. Corruption is a serious issue at various levels, particularly in customs transactions. Efforts to address corruption include the establishment of a Superintendency of Tax Administration in 1999, but corruption reportedly increased under the previous administration. President Berger has prioritized improving governance and combating corruption, introducing a code of ethics for cabinet members and investigating corruption in the previous government. The former Vice President, Finance Minister, Comptroller General, and Superintendent of Tax Administration are in jail awaiting trial for corruption under the previous FRG government. Former President Portillo fled the country in 2004 after his immunity from prosecution was lifted. The Berger Administration is improving government finances and transparency, including the military budget, and enacting reforms such as making procurement processes publicly available online. Guatemala is party to numerous environmental agreements but has not ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent for Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade is part of the Central American Commission on Environment and Development. Guatemala lacks specific environmental laws but passed a Law for Environmental Protection and Improvement in 1986 and a forestry law in 1996. There is a Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Guatemala faces environmental challenges such as water pollution and deforestation, exacerbated by poverty in the central highlands. Forest loss averages almost 2% annually. The tourism sector now contributes more to the economy than coffee. However, tourism development can harm the environment through pollution, waste disposal, habitat loss, and increased water demand. Floods from a hurricane in 2005 caused landslides. In October 2005, flooding from a hurricane caused landslides that destroyed Mayan villages and roads near Lake Atitlan. Guatemalans have legal rights to freedom of association and forming trade unions, but these rights are inadequately protected by the government. Employees fear reprisals from employers for unionizing activities due to weak labor inspectors, judicial system failures, poverty, historical repression of labor activists, impunity, and hostility from the business establishment. The Guatemalan legislature passed labor reforms in 2001, seen as a step forward by the labor movement. However, some reforms, like the requirement for a majority of workers to join a union, are seen as obstacles. Critics argue that labor provisions under DR-CAFTA are less strict than those under U.S. trade arrangements. Under DR-CAFTA, critics argue that governments may not need to reform laws to meet international labor standards. Advocates believe technical cooperation programs will help enforce labor laws in Central America. The U.S. Trade Representative granted $6.75 million to educate the public in CAFTA countries about labor laws. Labor rights groups petitioned the USTR to review Guatemala's eligibility under the Generalized System of Preferences in December 2004. Labor rights groups petitioned the USTR in December 2004 to review Guatemala's eligibility under the Generalized System of Preferences for violations of workers' rights, including judicial impunity, failure to enforce labor laws, and the need for labor law reforms. Despite Guatemala's constitution prohibiting children under 14 from working without permission, a third of children aged 7 to 14 were reported to be working in 2000, mostly in the informal economy. In November 2002, then-President Portillo created a National Commission for the Elimination of Child Labor to coordinate the implementation of the National Plan to Eradicate Child Labor in Guatemala. The country has taken steps to address piracy of copyrighted material, becoming a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization and passing laws to increase protection of intellectual property rights, including patent protection for pharmaceutical and agricultural products. The U.S. Trade Representative praised Guatemala's intellectual property rights legislation as \"greatly improved,\" but further legislation in 2005 suspended processing of pharmaceutical and chemical patents. Enforcement of these rights remains inadequate, with a new law limiting protection for foreign companies' pharmaceutical test data. UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization supported the repeal of a previous law providing test data protection. The Bush Administration criticized the new law for violating terms. In early January 2005, the Bush Administration criticized Guatemala's new law for violating DR-CAFTA terms and causing a process stall. Democratic Members of Congress opposed efforts to force Guatemala to adopt test data protection provisions, citing concerns about undermining public health measures and access to medicines. Doctors Without Borders also expressed worries about the negative impact on local access to HIV/AIDS treatment. The new intellectual property regulations in Guatemala will negatively impact local access to essential medicines, including HIV/AIDS treatment. President Berger promised to ensure compliance with DR-CAFTA obligations quickly, with the Guatemalan Congress approving legislation to protect confidential test data for agro-chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Guatemala became the third nation to ratify DR-CAFTA, despite delays due to protests calling for a referendum on the agreement. The Guatemalan Congress passed the DR-CAFTA with a simple majority, leading to ongoing protests from various groups. President Berger promised measures to offset negative impacts, including a concessions bill to regulate private sector investment. Critics are concerned about potential privatization of public services. Honduras has enjoyed 23 years of uninterrupted civilian democratic rule since the military relinquished power in 1982. In the November 2001 presidential elections, National Party candidate Ricardo Maduro defeated his Liberal Party rival. Both parties are considered center-right with few major ideological differences. Maduro ran on a strong anti-crime platform. Ricardo Maduro, a Stanford University-educated economist and businessman, won the 2001 presidential elections in Honduras on an anti-crime platform. He faced challenges in crime, human rights, and improving the country's economy. The next presidential elections are scheduled for November 27, 2005, with Porfirio Lobo and Manuel Zelaya as the main candidates. Manuel Zelaya, a former head of the Honduran Social Investment Fund, cannot run for president due to constitutional restrictions. President Maduro faced challenges with crime and human rights upon taking office, with kidnapping and murder being common in major cities. Youth gangs known as maras terrorized urban residents, leading to vigilantism and extrajudicial killings. The region, including Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, has seen an increase in gang activity fueled by poverty, unemployment, and U.S. deportation of criminals. President Maduro implemented a zero-tolerance platform, increasing police presence and cracking down on crime. The Maduro government in Honduras implemented a zero-tolerance policy, increasing police presence and cracking down on crime. Legislation was passed to make maras illegal, resulting in a significant decrease in crime rates. However, concerns were raised by human rights groups about abuses and the impact on civil liberties. Incidents such as a prison fire killing 104 inmates and a massacre on a public bus by the Mara Salvatrucha gang raised further alarm. The MS-13 gang was responsible for killings in Honduras, leading to arrests. Security concerns dominated the 2005 presidential election campaign, with calls for tougher action against youth gangs. Porfirio Lobo advocated for the death penalty and longer prison sentences, while Manuel Zelaya emphasized a comprehensive approach considering social conditions. The Maduro government proposed a regional battalion to address threats. Some Central American nations are questioning the mission of a regional battalion to address threats like natural disasters, gangs, and drug trafficking. President Maduro faces challenges in improving the Honduran economy, with traditional agriculture exports still important but nontraditional sectors growing. Honduras remains one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, with high poverty and infant mortality rates. Honduras faces significant challenges, with a poverty rate of 64%, high infant mortality, chronic malnutrition, and environmental degradation. The country also struggles with an HIV/AIDS crisis and was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Honduras signed a poverty reduction agreement with the IMF in 1999 to aid in hurricane reconstruction efforts. Honduras signed a three-year PRGF agreement with the IMF in February 2004, making it eligible for about $1 billion in debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. The government faces challenges balancing IMF demands for reduced public expenditures with public demands for increased spending, leading to street demonstrations against economic reforms. The recent review of Honduras' PRGF agreement emphasized the importance of maintaining consensus on the economic program through the 2005 election and transition to protect growth gains. The US has had a close relationship with Honduras, including foreign assistance, trade, military presence, and cooperation on various issues. In the 1980s, Honduras played a key role in US policy in Central America by supporting anti-Sandinista activities in Nicaragua. The United States has provided significant foreign aid to Honduras over the past two decades, totaling about $1.6 billion in economic and military assistance in the 1980s. The current U.S. policy goals for Honduras include strengthening democracy, promoting human rights and sustainable economic growth, and increasing economic linkages through DR-CAFTA. The Bush Administration sees DR-CAFTA as a way to solidify democracy and enhance environmental protection and labor rights in Honduras, while critics question its effectiveness in these areas. In the 1990s, U.S. aid to Honduras decreased due to regional conflicts subsiding. However, after Hurricane Mitch, the U.S. provided around $1 billion in aid. Assistance levels declined after 2001 but rose again with the Millennium Challenge Account, totaling $41 million in FY2002, $53 million in FY2003, $43 million in FY2004, and an estimated $41 million in FY2005. The Bush Administration requested almost $37 million for FY2006. The Bush Administration requested almost $37 million for FY2006 for development assistance projects, HIV/AIDS assistance, food aid, and a Peace Corps presence with over 250 volunteers. In 2004, Honduras became eligible for MCA funding, and in 2005, a $215 million compact was approved for rural development. The United States maintains a troop presence of about 550 military personnel in Honduras for activities such as disaster relief, counternarcotics exercises, and search and rescue operations. The United States maintains a troop presence in Honduras for activities such as disaster relief, counternarcotics exercises, and search and rescue operations. U.S. troops have provided extensive assistance in relief efforts after natural disasters and are involved in delivering relief supplies, repairing infrastructure, and operating medical clinics. Honduras serves as a transshipment point for cocaine destined for the United States. The State Department's report in March 2005 highlighted a decrease in cocaine seizures in Honduras in 2004, attributing it to the disruption of a major drug trafficking organization. Corruption was noted as a hindrance to law enforcement efforts. Honduras supported U.S. military operations in Iraq by sending a military contingent of 370 troops, approved by a narrow margin in Congress. The troops served under Spain's command but were brought back when Spain withdrew its troops. Honduras withdrew its troops from Iraq in 2004 after Spain did the same. Migration issues arise with 82,000 undocumented Hondurans in the US, protected by temporary protected status (TPS) since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Trade and investment ties with the US have grown since the 1980s. Since the early 1980s, Honduras has strengthened its trade linkages with the United States through initiatives like the Caribbean Basin Initiative and production-sharing arrangements. The country has seen growth in maquiladoras, with 36 industrial parks operating mainly in the north coast region. The passage of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and DR-CAFTA is expected to further boost the Honduran maquiladoras. The United States remains Honduras' primary trading partner. The United States is Honduras' major trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of exports and half of imports. In 2004, U.S. exports to Honduras were $3.1 billion, mainly in apparel. U.S. imports from Honduras were $3.6 billion, with apparel from the maquiladora sector being significant. Other Honduran exports to the U.S. include bananas, seafood, and coffee. U.S. foreign investment in Honduras was $270 million in 2003, with over 100 U.S. companies present, especially in the maquiladora sector. Honduras has investments in various economic activities such as banana production, tourism, energy generation, shrimp farming, and fast-food franchises from companies like Applebee's, Burger King, and McDonald's. The country is also moving towards closer economic integration with its Central American neighbors and negotiating free trade agreements with several nations. Honduras is negotiating free trade agreements with several nations to stimulate economic development. It has joined with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to establish a free trade area and signed agreements with the Dominican Republic and Chile. The country views DR-CAFTA as a way to attract investment, protect trade arrangements with the US, and transform its agricultural sector. Concerns exist about the agreement's impact on opening the market to US agricultural products. In the final agreement, tariffs for sensitive products in the Honduran market have longer phase-out periods, with some lasting up to 15-20 years. Concerns about job loss and social unrest are present, requiring long-term investment to make the agricultural sector more competitive. Honduras is the third largest exporter of apparel to the United States, with a developed maquiladora industry under special access programs. The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) provided NAFTA-like benefits to Caribbean Basin countries to prevent Mexico from having a trade advantage. Benefits under CBTPA are set to expire in September 2008 or upon the Free Trade Area of the Americas taking effect. Honduras, with a large maquiladora sector, is concerned about competing with Asian apparel producers after the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas ended in January 2005. They are interested in DR-CAFTA to continue apparel trade benefits beyond September 2008. The Central Americans pushed for liberalizing rules of origin for apparel in the CAFTA agreement, allowing duty-free export of apparel made with yarn from third countries and special quotas for apparel assembled in the region. This would benefit Honduras due to its large export-assembly sector. The agreement included provisions for duty-free benefits for apparel made in Central America with fabrics from NAFTA partners. Liberalized rules also allow duty-free entry for specific apparel items made from third-country fabric. CAFTA allows duty-free export of apparel made with third-country fabric in Central America. Apparel with specific content in short supply can also qualify for duty-free treatment. Honduras aims to compete with China in textile production with CAFTA. The country has limited environmental legislation compared to its neighbors. Honduras passed a general environmental law in 1993, with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment ensuring compliance and coordinating policies. The country is party to 54 agreements, including the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Kyoto Protocol. Key environmental challenges include deforestation, forest degradation, and poor watershed management highlighted by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Illegal logging by lumber companies is a problem in eastern Honduras, prompting increased security measures and plans for a new forestry policy in response to threats against environmental activists. Father Tamayo led a national protest in Honduras in 2004 against illegal logging, prompting President Maduro to promise committees to evaluate logging bans. Environmental groups in Central America have differing views on the DR-CAFTA agreement, with some supporting its provisions and others, like the Environmental Movement of Olancho, opposing it due to concerns about uncontrolled commercial logging. Father Tamayo, a leader in the fight against illegal logging in Honduras, criticizes the government for lacking the political will to enforce environmental protection laws. In 2005, Honduras and other DR-CAFTA signatories signed agreements to strengthen environmental provisions, including the establishment of a secretariat for citizen petitions on enforcement. The Honduran workforce has a 7.3% unionization rate, with public sector unions being stronger than those in the private sector. The Honduran workforce has a 7.3% unionization rate, with unions in the public sector having more strength than those in the private sector. The influence of unions has reportedly diminished in recent years. Honduras has three major labor confederations: the Confederation of Honduran Workers (CTH), the General Workers' Central (CGT), and the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers (CUTH). \"Solidarity\" associations in private companies, criticized by organized labor as employer-dominated, provide credit and other services to workers as an alternative to unions. Workers in both unionized and non-unionized companies are covered by the Labor Code, with the right to seek redress from the Ministry of Labor. Blacklisting is prohibited by the Labor Code, but there is evidence of blacklisting in maquiladoras due to employees' union activities. The Honduran Labor Minister stated that child labor in the maquiladora sector was a problem 10 years ago but no longer exists. However, over 350,000 children work illegally in Honduras, mainly in rural areas and small companies. Labor unions criticize the lack of progress in enforcing the Labor Code, including inspections in the maquiladora industry. U.S.-based labor groups have heavily criticized labor conditions in Honduras. There has been substantial criticism of labor sector conditions in Honduras by U.S.-based labor groups and the International Federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The AFL-CIO report highlights worker rights violations in maquiladoras, while the ICFTU points out restrictions on forming trade unions and harassment of workers. The National Labor Committee focused on alleged violations at a maquiladora factory producing shirts for Sean P. Diddy Combs. In December 2004, two labor groups submitted a petition to USTR to review Honduran labor practices regarding eligibility for trade benefits. Honduras has allegedly not fully implemented a 1995 memorandum of understanding with USTR to improve labor practices. In July 2004, trade and labor ministers of Honduras and other DR-CAFTA countries met to strengthen labor law compliance. In April 2005, a white book was unveiled endorsing a work plan to improve enforcement of labor laws, including projects to enhance trade union rights, labor inspections, women's workplace protections, labor ministry capacity, and ending child labor. Some Members of Congress criticize Central American labor laws for not meeting ILO standards, particularly citing burdensome requirements for union recognition and restrictions on union leadership in Honduras. In 1998, Honduras faced sanctions for piracy of U.S. television broadcasts and videos, leading to a partial suspension of benefits. The benefits were restored after Honduras took action to stop the piracy. The United States Trade Representative notes that Honduras has largely complied with the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), but reforms related to integrated circuit designs and plant variety protection are still pending. Honduras agreed to provide effective patent protection for plants in the DR-CAFTA agreement. The United States and Honduras signed a bilateral intellectual property rights agreement in 1999, which was later incorporated into the CAFTA and DR-CAFTA agreements. Honduras faced issues with piracy of books, recordings, and software due to limited enforcement capacity. The DR-CAFTA agreement aimed to strengthen intellectual property rights protection in line with WTO norms. The Honduran Congress approved the DR-CAFTA agreement in 2005 with broad support from both political parties. The Honduran Congress approved the DR-CAFTA agreement in 2005 with broad support from both the Liberal and National parties, with only members of the small leftist Party of Democratic Unity (PUD) voting against it. Active opponents included government sector employees, the Popular Block, CNRP, COPINH, and environmental groups like the Environmental Movement of Olancho. Nicaragua transitioned to democracy in 1990 after a struggle between a leftist regime and U.S.-backed forces, making progress in democratic institutions and economic development. Nicaragua has made progress in key social sectors, received debt relief, signed free trade agreements, and received foreign aid. Despite this, the country remains poor with weak institutions. A political crisis has threatened the government, but the impasse seems to have been overcome for now. The recent international support for President Enrique Bola\u00c3\u00b1os was demonstrated by a visit from U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, who warned against a potential coup and threatened to withhold U.S. assistance if the opposition continued to push for Bola\u00c3\u00b1os' removal. The Nicaraguan National Assembly agreed to postpone constitutional amendments transferring executive powers until after Bola\u00c3\u00b1os' term ends in December 2006. President Enrique Bola\u00c3\u00b1os, of the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC), was elected in November 2001, defeating Daniel Ortega. Bola\u00c3\u00b1os emphasized maintaining positive relations with the United States and faces challenges in stimulating economic growth. President Enrique Bola\u00f1os faces challenges in stimulating economic growth and promoting democratic reform while pursuing corruption prosecutions. The Bush Administration supports his anti-corruption efforts, but critics say he is too confrontational. Daniel Ortega, a former Sandinista leader, served as President from 1985-1990 amidst controversy over election fairness and a civil war. Ortega's administration was marked by a civil war with U.S.-backed \"contras\" and charges of corruption. In the context of the Central American Peace Plan, Ortega's Sandinista government agreed to internationally monitored democratic elections in February 1990. Ortega ran for president in 1990, 1996, and 2001, losing each time. The Sandinistas control 38 of the 92 seats in the National Assembly and have capitalized on divisions between President Bola\u00f1os and the PLC to win important victories in municipal elections. Ortega was named the FSLN candidate for the 2006 presidential elections. President Bola\u00f1os prosecuted former President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n and associates for embezzling about $100 million in public funds in 2003. Arnoldo Aleman and his associates were convicted of embezzling $100 million in public funds during his presidency from 1997-2002. Aleman, named one of the world's most corrupt ex-leaders, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fraud and money laundering in 2003. Despite efforts by his supporters to negotiate his release, he remains under house arrest. The PLC is pushing for an amnesty bill to revoke convictions for misuse of public funds and electoral crimes after 1990. President Bola\u00f1os' actions against Aleman have isolated him, with the opposition accusing Bola\u00f1os of electoral fraud linked to Aleman's alleged laundering of public funds. In October 2004, the Comptroller General's office renewed fraud charges against President Bola\u00f1os, leading to impeachment efforts by the opposition. A special commission was named in June 2005 to study the possibility of removing Bola\u00f1os' immunity for failing to disclose campaign funds sources. In 1998, Aleman and Ortega negotiated a power-sharing agreement known as \"el pacto\" which defined national politics. In 2004, the pact was renegotiated with a demand for Aleman's release. Constitutional amendments were adopted in 2005 transferring presidential powers to the legislature, but the Central American Court of Justice ruled them illegal. Ortega announced in 2005 that he had broken the pact with Aleman's faction of the Liberal party. Ortega has broken with the Liberal and Sandinista parties over a corrupt pact, gaining support for upcoming elections. The U.S. State Department supports President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os and condemns attempts to undermine the constitutional order in Nicaragua. The OAS is involved in encouraging democratic order and a national dialogue was established in January 2005. Tensions escalated with violent protests against public transportation fare increases. In April, there were violent protests against public transportation fare increases and calls for President Bola\u00f1os' resignation by the opposition. The government negotiated an end to the protests, with polls showing 68% opposed Bola\u00f1os' resignation. International support for Bola\u00f1os included a visit from the head of the U.S. Southern Command. The OAS Secretary General visited Nicaragua in June to restart political dialogue, but no settlement was reached under the OAS Democratic Charter. The OAS Democratic Charter was invoked in Nicaragua, leading to a \"Declaration of Support for Nicaragua\" at the OAS General Assembly in June 2005. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick's visit in October 2005 resulted in the passage of CAFTA and prevented constitutional changes. Aleman and Ortega's influence made governance challenging for President Bola\u00f1os. With OAS and U.S. intervention, CAFTA was passed, and constitutional changes were suspended. Nicaragua began free market reforms in 1991 after overthrowing the Somoza family dictatorship in 1979. The Sandinista regime led to economic challenges, civil war, and U.S. sanctions. The passage of CAFTA and suspension of constitutional changes eased governance for President Bola\u00f1os. Nicaragua's economic decline was influenced by economic policies, civil war with U.S.-backed contras, and U.S. economic sanctions. Post-conflict democratic governments implemented significant reforms, including privatizing state enterprises and reducing inflation. Despite progress, challenges remain with heavy dependence on foreign aid and remittances from Nicaraguans abroad. Nicaragua's economy heavily relies on remittances from Nicaraguans living abroad, making up 15% of GDP. The economy is vulnerable to external economic conditions and natural disasters, with severe malnutrition and high poverty rates. Unemployment and underemployment are significant issues, with income distribution being extremely unequal. Despite efforts to improve health and education indicators, gaps still exist in school enrollment rates. The government aims to further social progress with a World Bank loan of $75 million for social sector projects. U.S. involvement in Nicaragua shifted towards pressuring the government for political reforms after the Central American Peace Plan. The United States provided foreign assistance after Hurricane Mitch and extended Temporary Protected Status for Nicaraguans living in the U.S. Agreements have been negotiated on intellectual property, trade, and counter-narcotics efforts. Nicaragua contributed mine-clearing troops to coalition forces in Iraq and passed legislation to destroy anti-aircraft missiles. Nicaragua has received significant U.S. assistance since the 1990s, with a focus on promoting democracy, economic growth, and human capital investments. The country has signed trade agreements with the U.S., including CAFTA and DR-CAFTA, to improve market access. The U.S. has recommended the destruction of anti-aircraft missiles in Nicaragua. The United States has provided significant assistance to Nicaragua since the 1990s, focusing on promoting democracy, economic growth, and human capital investments. This includes financial support for reconstruction efforts after Hurricane Mitch, assistance for election processes, and approval of a $175 million compact with Nicaragua. President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os agreed to destroy 1,000 Soviet-era missiles as recommended by the U.S. In 2004, President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os agreed to destroy 1,000 Soviet-era missiles as a security measure. The Bush Administration suspended U.S. military aid in March 2005 due to legislative interference, but restrictions were lifted in October 2005. The Bola\u00c3\u00b1os Administration has been focused on combating government corruption, leading to convictions and arrests of high-level officials. Former President Arnoldo Aleman was sentenced to 20 years in prison for money laundering. In 2002, the National Assembly removed Aleman as president and stripped him of immunity from prosecution. Bola\u00c3\u00b1os faces opposition from the Liberal party, with efforts to reduce his powers or remove him from office. The OAS and foreign governments express concern over electoral fraud charges against Bola\u00c3\u00b1os and impeachment threats. The Central American Court of Justice called for suspending proceedings to transfer presidential powers. The National Assembly in Nicaragua is working on amendments to transfer presidential powers, but the process is stalled. The judicial system is undergoing reform but remains weak and susceptible to corruption. President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os criticizes the Sandinista-dominated judiciary, especially after one of his allies was convicted of corruption. The U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua has raised concerns about recent judicial decisions. The U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, Barbara Moore, criticized recent judicial decisions for damaging the country's reputation and hindering foreign investment. Human rights abuses were prevalent under authoritarian regimes and during the civil war, but have improved since 1990. The government is said to generally respect human rights, but there are still issues such as extrajudicial killings, torture, violence against women and children, and a degree of impunity for security forces. Human rights issues in Nicaragua include violence against women and children, trafficking, discrimination against indigenous people, labor violations, and inadequate minimum wage. The government has made efforts to address child labor and improve workplace safety, but enforcement remains a challenge due to limited resources. Resolution of Property Claims in Nicaragua remains a contentious issue in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations. The Nicaraguan National Assembly established new property tribunals in 1997 to resolve longstanding disputes, with procedures including mediation, arbitration, and expedited trials. U.S. assistance is aiding in improving the mechanism for settling property disputes, despite U.S. law prohibiting aid to countries that have confiscated assets of U.S. citizens. The National Assembly in Nicaragua passed a new law to create a land institute that critics fear will consolidate Sandinista land expropriations. Nicaragua is a transit zone for narcotics trafficking due to factors like poverty, lack of government presence, and a vulnerable banking system. Nicaragua is seen as an attractive location for drug traffickers due to factors like civil war and a vulnerable banking system. The country has cooperated with the Drug Enforcement Administration since 1997, but faces challenges with limited resources and a corrupt judicial system. Gunrunning to guerrillas in Colombia is also a concern, with arms ending up in the hands of paramilitaries. In January 2003, Nicaraguan President Bola\u00c3\u00b1os discussed closing loopholes in arms control legislation with the OAS. He also proposed a disarmament process in Central America to reduce regional arms. In November 2004, Bola\u00c3\u00b1os agreed to destroy a stockpile of Soviet-era missiles, but faced challenges from the Nicaraguan legislature and a suspension of U.S. military aid. The Bush Administration suspended U.S. military aid in March 2005 due to concerns about a stockpile of Soviet-era missiles in Nicaragua. The restriction was lifted in October 2005 after U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed confidence in the security of the missiles. The Nicaraguan economy heavily relies on trade and investment with the United States, with duty-free access to the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and preferential tariff treatment under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. Nicaraguan exports include traditional products like coffee, shrimp, seafood, beef, and gold, mainly to the United States and other Central American nations. The country's imports, such as machinery, industrial raw materials, and consumer goods, come primarily from the United States. U.S. exports to Nicaragua in 2002 totaled $438 million, with machinery and transport equipment being the largest category. U.S. imports from Nicaragua totaled $679 million, with apparel accounting for 26% of all import categories. Major U.S. companies operating in Nicaragua include Esso Standard Oil, Bellsouth, Texaco Caribbean, Pepsi-Cola, and Kraft. Nicaragua's economy relies on exports like coffee, shrimp, seafood, beef, and gold, with imports mainly from the United States. Major U.S. companies in Nicaragua include Esso Standard Oil, Bellsouth, Texaco Caribbean, Pepsi-Cola, and Kraft. The country's maquiladora industry is growing, focusing on apparel manufacturing. Nicaragua promotes free trade and has signed bilateral investment agreements with several countries. It is part of the Central American customs union with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Nicaragua's negotiating team views the free trade agreement with the United States positively, citing duty-free access for farm and industrial products. The agreement includes protections for domestic farmers and a 28-year adjustment period for rice farmers. Nicaragua also imposed strict quotas on U.S. corn imports and textile exporters received unique permissions. Nicaragua's negotiating team views the free trade agreement with the United States positively, citing duty-free access for farm and industrial products. Despite concerns about bargaining leverage, Nicaraguan farmers face challenges from increased U.S. corn imports. The agreement addresses specific sensitive issues, including environmental legislation in Nicaragua. Nicaragua's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) regulates national policy on natural resource management. Despite being a party to various environmental agreements, deforestation and lake contamination pose threats to Nicaragua's environment. Deforestation has increased vulnerability to natural disasters and droughts. Nicaragua's vulnerability to natural disasters, such as Hurricane Mitch (1998) and periodic droughts, has been exacerbated by deforestation and lake contamination. Lake Nicaragua, the world's twentieth largest aquifer, deteriorated significantly between 1994 and 2003. Critics of CAFTA question if enforcing existing laws is enough for environmental protection. The Nicaraguan labor force, consisting of 2.25 million workers, is mainly rural-based and unskilled, with high rates of unemployment and underemployment. The strength of the Nicaraguan labor movement has been eroded due to declining confidence in union leaders. Half of the unionized labor force belongs to militant Sandinista labor unions. Despite being a party to numerous International Labor Organization conventions, it still takes about six months for a union to go through all the necessary procedures to hold a legal strike in Nicaragua. Labor rights violations are most severe in export processing zones, where only 3% of workers are unionized. Nicaragua's labor movement faces challenges with declining union confidence. 9,500 workers in Chinandega pursue lawsuits against banana companies for pesticide exposure. Concerns arise over exploitation and unsafe conditions with free trade agreements. Nicaragua signed an intellectual property agreement with the US in 1998, leading to modern laws on copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Efforts were made to combat music piracy in 2001. The government in Nicaragua made efforts to combat music piracy in 2001 and is now targeting software piracy in public offices. Despite these efforts, the country still had a high piracy rate of 77% in 2002, with estimated losses of $2.6 million. Nicaragua ratified CAFTA in 2005 and signed the World Intellectual Property Organization's \"Internet Treaties\" in 2002. In May 2005, the committee issued a report advancing the process of CAFTA approval in Nicaragua. Opposition from some members of political parties was present, but U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick warned of consequences if the pact was not approved. Daniel Ortega withdrew the Sandinistas' opposition to CAFTA, allowing it to pass."
