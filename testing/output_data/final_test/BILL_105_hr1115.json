    "content": "The \"Opportunity-to-Learn Standards Implementation Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes amendments to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, specifically introducing the Opportunity-To-Learn Development Grant under Part B. The Secretary can award grants to consortia to develop national opportunity-to-learn standards and model programs for schools. These standards aim to provide all students with learning opportunities, assess school performance, and outline actions for schools that do not meet the standards. Each consortium must involve State-level policymakers, local policymakers and administrators, teachers, parents, business representatives, vocational-technical education experts, and regional accrediting associations. The consortium developing national opportunity-to-learn standards must include representatives from regional accrediting associations, experts in school finance and equity, curriculum and school reform experts, advocacy groups, higher education, and secondary school students. Their duties include drawing upon research on student achievement and effective teaching and learning conditions. The consortium developing national opportunity-to-learn standards must include representatives with expertise in educational needs of children from low-income families, minorities, limited-English proficiency, or disabilities. Members must also be geographically diverse and reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the United States. Each consortium seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Once the national opportunity-to-learn standards are developed, consortiums must report background, issues, and rationale. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998, with additional funding for 1999-2002.
