Congress finds that illegal drugs and alcohol contribute to thousands of deaths annually, spread communicable diseases like AIDS and Hepatitis C, and lead to social issues such as child abuse and domestic violence. There are approximately 14.8 million drug users in the US, with over 4 million being addicts, and 14 million Americans abusing alcohol. There is a significant treatment gap, with nearly 4 million drug users in need of immediate treatment, including 1.2 million children aged 12 to 25. Health professionals play a crucial role in identifying and providing early intervention for families and youth affected by alcohol and drug-related impairment. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease with no cure, but effective treatments are available. Treatment for addiction has been shown to be as successful as managing other chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Treatment for addiction is cost-effective compared to incarceration or untreated addiction. In 1998, substance abuse and addiction led to significant government spending. Many health professionals are unprepared to recognize substance abuse in patients. Only 56 percent of residency programs have a required curriculum in preventing or treating substance abuse. Few doctors feel confident about diagnosing alcoholism or identifying illegal drug use. Most doctors do not believe treatment works for alcoholism or drug addiction. According to a survey by CASA, a high percentage of primary care physicians and pediatricians are presented with substance abuse cases. Only 40% of pediatricians and physicians can properly recognize alcohol or drug addiction. Less than 1% of doctors can diagnose alcoholism in older women correctly, often mistaking it for depression. Training can improve screening for substance abuse in medical professionals and children impacted by addiction. Boston University Medical School conducted a seminar on detecting and intervening in substance abuse. A seminar was held for healthcare professionals on detecting and intervening in substance abuse. Follow-up studies showed that 91% of participants continued to use the techniques up to 5 years later. Substance abuse costs over $400 billion in healthcare annually, and training healthcare professionals could lead to significant cost savings. A study at the University of Wisconsin found a $947 net savings per patient in healthcare, accident, and criminal justice costs. The Act aims to improve healthcare professionals' ability to identify and assist patients with substance abuse, as well as children and youth affected by substance abuse in their families. It also seeks to establish training infrastructure for healthcare professionals on substance abuse issues.
