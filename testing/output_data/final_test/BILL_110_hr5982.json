    "content": "The \"Biometric Enhancement for Airport-Risk Reduction Act of 2008\" defines a biometric identifier system as a system using biometric information for identity confirmation in transportation security. The Secretary of Homeland Security oversees this system through the Transportation Security Administration. The \"Biometric Enhancement for Airport-Risk Reduction Act of 2008\" mandates a study on implementing uniform biometric identifier systems for airport workers with unescorted access to secure areas to enhance transportation security against terrorism risks. The study includes a risk-based analysis of selected airports to identify implementation strategies. The Secretary conducts a study to identify where biometric identifier systems could benefit airports, considering existing parallel biometric security systems for workers with unescorted access to critical infrastructure. The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) is developing biometric programs for airport security, focusing on infrastructure, technical requirements, existing airport systems, and potential incentives for airports. The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security is developing biometric programs for airport security, including incentives for airports to implement uniform biometric identifier systems and associated costs. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on implementing biometric security for airport workers with unescorted access, including recommendations from the Government Accountability Office and other sources. The Secretary, in consultation with aviation industry stakeholders, will identify best practices for administering biometric credentials at airports, including processes like registration, vetting, issuance, verification, expiration, cost structure, and redress for workers. The Secretary will develop redress processes for workers and submit a report to Congress outlining best practices. Additionally, an Aviation and Airport Security Working Group will be convened to assist with implementing this section. The Aviation and Airport Security Working Group includes stakeholders from the aviation industry, TSA's Aviation Security Advisory Committee, airports, airport workers with access to secure areas, the biometric technology sector, and other individuals deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The group will not fall under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The working group established for aviation and airport security will not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. It will cease operations 30 days after the submission of the report. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 18, 2008, as attested by Lorraine C. Miller, Clerk."
