Expansion of tax refund reduction provision to include past-due, legally enforceable state and local government tax obligations. Upon notice from a state or local government of a tax debt, the Secretary of the Treasury can reduce federal tax refunds by the amount owed and pay it to the government. The provision allows the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce federal tax refunds to pay past-due, legally enforceable state and local government tax obligations. The reduction is made after satisfying internal revenue tax liabilities, past-due support, and other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury can reduce federal tax refunds to pay state and local government tax debts before future federal tax liabilities. State or local governments must notify the person owing the tax debt before taking action. The State or local government must notify the taxpayer of any proposed action regarding tax debts, allowing 60 days to dispute the past-due liability. The determination of past-due, legally enforceable tax obligations must be valid and based on evidence presented by the taxpayer. The term 'past-due, legally enforceable tax obligation' refers to a debt resulting from a court judgment or administrative determination of tax due, no longer subject to review, or from an assessed but uncollected tax not delinquent for over 10 years. The Secretary will issue regulations on how States and local governments must submit notices of such obligations. The regulations will specify types of taxes and minimum debt amounts for reduction procedures. States and local governments may need to pay a fee to reimburse the Secretary for applying the procedure. Any erroneous payments made to a state or local government must be promptly repaid to the Secretary according to regulations. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for repayment of erroneous payments to State and local governments. Payments withheld under subsection (j) may be treated as payments to the person making the overpayment. Section 6103(l) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended for disclosure of information to agencies requesting refund offsets for tax obligations. The Secretary can establish rules for repaying incorrect payments to State and local governments. Payments withheld under subsection (j) can be considered payments to the person who made the overpayment. Section 6103(l) of the Internal Revenue Code is modified for sharing information with agencies seeking refund offsets for tax debts."
