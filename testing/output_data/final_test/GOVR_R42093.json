    "content": "The conservation title in the farm bill has been significant since 1985, with questions about funding, policy objectives, and program effectiveness. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized existing programs, modified some, and created new ones, expanding USDA conservation activities. Over 20 agricultural conservation programs are now administered by USDA, mainly by the NRCS. Each farm bill since 1985 has addressed a growing range of natural resource problems. The farm bill has expanded the range of conservation programs and funding levels. These programs address various natural resource problems and have unique provisions and eligibility requirements. They can be grouped into working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, conservation compliance programs, and other programs. Most programs receive mandatory funding and expire with other farm bill programs. Working lands conservation programs, like EQIP and WHIP, allow private land to remain in production while implementing conservation practices. These programs receive annual appropriations and have permanent authorities, separate from other farm bill programs. The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) operates differently from other working lands programs by using a \"pay-for-performance\" approach, incentivizing producers based on environmental outcomes. Land retirement programs provide federal payments for temporary land use changes, while conservation easements impose permanent land-use restrictions. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest land retirement program that reimburses landowners for removing land from production for up to 10 years. Other programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) use easements and restoration contracts to protect wetlands and grasslands. The Farmland Protection Program (FPP) restricts productive farmland from being developed for non-farm purposes. USDA also administers programs for highly erodible lands conservation and wetland conservation compliance. The Sodbuster, Swampbuster, and Sodsaver programs enforce compliance requirements for erodible lands and wetland conservation. Producers risk losing farm program benefits if they do not meet these requirements. Sodbuster mandates an approved conservation plan for cultivating erodible lands, while Swampbuster prohibits benefits for converting wetlands for agriculture. Sodsaver disqualifies producers from crop insurance and disaster assistance for planting on native sod. The USDA administers various farm bill conservation programs, including geographically specific ones like the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes Basin programs. Other programs, like the Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative (CCPI), use existing funds for partnership agreements. Grant programs like the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentives program and Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) are also available. Farm bill provisions redirect funding to priority areas and provide incentives for beginning, socially disadvantaged, and limited resource producers. The majority of farm bill conservation programs are funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) as mandatory spending, with additional incentives for beginning, socially disadvantaged, and limited resource producers. Mandatory funds from the authorizing law are assumed to be available unless they are expressly reduced by Congress. For more information on conservation programs, refer to the CRS Report R40763, Agricultural Conservation: A Guide to Programs. Since the 1985 farm bill, conservation programs have seen an increase in mandatory funding, making it easier to protect funding levels from reductions compared to the annual appropriations process. Congress continues to enact provisions allowing many conservation programs to receive mandatory funding. The 2008 farm bill increased mandatory funding for conservation programs, allowing for expansion from $4 billion in FY2008 to $6.1 billion in FY2012. Conservation groups and producers competed for resources, with the conservation title being one of the few to receive an increase in funding levels. In FY2012, mandatory conservation programs faced reductions from authorized levels due to domestic budget constraints. Critics argue that these reductions undermine programs that initially supported the farm bill's passage. Despite funding cuts, mandatory conservation program funding continues to increase. The debate on the next farm bill is driven by budget constraints, with many conservation issues being discussed. Key points of tension include funding levels and compliance requirements. Budget deficits and demand for fiscal responsibility are major factors affecting conservation in the upcoming farm bill. The farm bill debate is influenced by budget deficits and the demand for fiscal restraint. Conservation programs in the 2008 farm bill receive mandatory funding, but reauthorization proposals in the 112th Congress aim to reduce this funding. The Congressional Budget Office provides baseline projections for mandatory spending, which serve as a benchmark for budget discussions. Proposed reductions in mandatory funding for conservation programs face opposition from conservation and farm supporters. The farm bill committees determine funding allocations, with new provisions impacting mandatory spending measured against the baseline. Conservation receives less than 7% of baseline funding, with nutrition (like food stamps) receiving the largest share. Any new program funding will likely come from existing baseline funds, with crop insurance, conservation, and commodity support being major funding sources after nutrition. The authorizing committees have the flexibility to shift funding between different programs in the farm bill. The 2008 farm bill provisions were extended until September 30, 2013, with no additional cost as most major programs were already funded. Certain conservation programs did not receive additional funding under the extension. The 2008 farm bill provisions were extended until September 30, 2013, with no additional cost as most major programs were already funded. However, many conservation programs lack funding for FY2013 and require additional legislative action or appropriations. Five conservation programs from the 2008 farm bill would cost approximately $2.7 billion to extend for five years, and policymakers must find offsets to continue these programs. The extension of programs like CRP in FY2013 allows for enrollment of up to 32 million acres. Other programs, such as WRP, faced limitations in enrollment due to previous budget cuts. The current farm bill extension enables WRP to utilize additional baseline for enrollment within its original acreage cap. The extension of the 2008 farm bill in FY2013 allows for enrollment of up to 32 million acres in programs like CRP. Mandatory conservation programs, such as VPAHIP, require offset funding to continue as they have no baseline beyond FY2012. The extension authorized VPAHIP to receive $10 million in appropriations for FY2013, but no additional funding has been allocated. Unlike discretionary programs, mandatory conservation programs have an authorized level of funding available unless reduced in the appropriations process. Since FY2003, many conservation programs have faced reductions or caps in funding despite having increased mandatory funding authority. These reductions, requested by both the Bush and Obama Administrations, have varied in programs and amounts each year. Total mandatory funding for conservation was reduced by over $5.3 billion from FY2003 through FY2013, but has remained around $5 billion annually. Some programs like CRP have not been reduced, while others like EQIP have been repeatedly reduced below authorized levels. The conservation title in the 2008 farm bill received increased mandatory funding authority, viewed as a victory by supporters. However, subsequent budget proposals led to reductions in mandatory conservation program funding in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2013 continuing resolution maintained these reduced funding levels. Advocates argue that limitations on conservation programs have compromised their ability to provide benefits to producers and the environment. Despite reductions, overall funding for conservation has not decreased. The expiration of authority for farm bill conservation programs in FY2012 could impact future authorization levels. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extended the expiration date of selected farm bill conservation programs to FY2014 to prevent reduced funding levels from impacting future years. Programs like AMA, CSP, EQIP, WHIP, and FPP were unaffected by the 2012 farm bill expiration but faced funding reductions under the FY2013 continuing resolution. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extended the expiration date of selected farm bill conservation programs to FY2014 to prevent reduced funding levels from impacting future years. CSP, authorized to enroll acres annually, was affected by appropriations limitation, not limited by funding level. Reductions in appropriations to CSP affect program by limiting funding available for new acres, indirectly reducing number of acres enrolled for a given year. The farm bill baseline may be delayed by reductions in appropriations, leading to uncertainty in future support for conservation programs. The current conservation portfolio includes over 20 programs with annual spending exceeding $5 billion, causing confusion about their purpose and policies. Discussions about simplifying or consolidating programs to reduce overlap and generate savings are common. Conservation programs face potential consolidation to reduce overlap and generate savings during farm bill reauthorization. The 2008 farm bill eliminated some programs but also created new ones. Both the House and Senate farm bills in the 112th Congress included consolidation measures. Funding constraints may lead to further consolidation for savings. Some conservation groups support consolidation efforts, while others fear losing geographic or issue-specific focus. Programs nationwide have sub-programs addressing specific issues or geographically defined areas. Program consolidation may remove identified priorities that allowed program expansion. Efficiencies from reducing programs could be offset by additional carve-outs. Land retirement programs like CRP initially focused on soil conservation and commodity reduction. Land retirement programs like the CRP initially focused on soil conservation and commodity reduction during an economic downturn in the farm sector. As the conservation benefits were recognized, additional environmental benefits emerged, such as wildlife habitat, air and water quality, and carbon sequestration. However, high commodity prices and incentives to plant crops may be decreasing producer interest in land retirement. Forecasts suggest that high commodity prices may continue, leading to a potential shift in farm bill conservation policy. The farm bill conservation policy is shifting towards conservation working lands programs over traditional land retirement programs. There is a debate on the appropriate mix of programs, with some supporting long-term easement programs for sustainable ecosystems. The debate over conservation programs includes the cost-effectiveness of permanent easement programs versus short-term land retirement programs. The future of land preservation programs is uncertain due to high costs and lack of baseline data. Environmental interests may not support reducing one conservation program without increasing another. Payment limits exist for conservation programs to regulate maximum payments. The 2008 farm bill expanded limitations on payments received through conservation programs, now affected by both income and payment limits. Payment limits regulate the maximum amount of funding a person or entity can receive, sparking controversy over support distribution. The 2008 farm bill expanded limitations on payments received through conservation programs, affected by income and payment limits. Payment limits regulate the maximum funding a person or entity can receive, sparking controversy over support distribution based on farm size and conservation practices implemented. Large farms tend to receive higher payments due to scaling by acreage, leading to concerns from advocates of smaller farms and opponents of large animal feeding operations. Working lands conservation programs provide cost-share for conservation practices, with payments skewed towards contracts with more acres enrolled, benefiting larger agricultural producers according to small farm advocates. Opponents argue that payment limits in conservation programs disproportionately benefit large agricultural producers, especially in cases like EQIP where cost-share assistance is provided for expensive practices in concentrated animal feeding operations. They believe that higher payment limits allow for greater environmental stewardship on larger farms, while critics argue that conservation programs should focus on areas with the greatest environmental need, not on a price per participant. The AGI limit for conservation programs can create a disincentive for enrolling larger conservation easements, impacting programs like WRP and GRP. The 2008 farm bill increased the AGI limitation for conservation programs compared to commodity farm support programs, but controversy remains. If the three-year average of non-farm income AGI exceeds $1,000,000, no conservation program benefits are allowed. The AGI limit for conservation programs is higher than for commodity programs to promote environmental stewardship on farms. Exceptions may apply if two-thirds of AGI is from farming sources or for environmentally sensitive land. Supporters believe tighter limits benefit small producers, while opponents argue that producer enrollment benefits the public regardless of wealth. Enrollment in conservation programs benefits the general public by reducing soil erosion on croplands. The 1985 farm bill established conservation compliance programs, tying farm program benefits to conservation standards. Farmers must implement approved conservation plans on highly erodible lands or refrain from converting wetlands to production to remain eligible for benefits. Non-compliance could result in the loss of various farm program benefits, such as price and income supports, crop insurance, and farm loans contributing to erosion. The implementation of CRP and conservation compliance requirements led to a significant reduction in soil erosion between 1982 and 2007. The 1985 farm bill tied farm program benefits to conservation standards, requiring farmers to implement approved conservation plans on highly erodible lands. Non-compliance could result in the loss of various benefits, such as crop insurance and farm loans contributing to erosion. The 1996 farm bill removed crop insurance as a program benefit and added production flexibility contracts. Currently, major farm program benefits affected by compliance include counter-cyclical payments, direct payments, and conservation programs. The current financial climate has put direct payments under farm commodity support programs at risk. There is debate over potentially reducing or eliminating these payments in the farm bill reauthorization to save money. Conservation advocates are concerned that without direct payments, there will be less incentive for producers to meet conservation compliance and wetland conservation requirements. Environmental organizations are urging Congress to consider tying conservation compliance to crop insurance benefits or new revenue assurance programs. The farm bill debate may focus on strengthening voluntary conservation programs to address environmental impacts, rather than specific environmental regulations. \"Certainty\" or \"assurance standards\" are being discussed as assistance mechanisms to encourage water quality improvement measures by farmers. Several states are implementing certainty programs for this purpose. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between EPA and USDA to establish a water quality certainty program in Minnesota, the first of its kind. USDA officials are interested in developing a \"safe harbor\"-type mechanism for water quality with EPA, but no formal proposal has been released nationwide. Legislation was proposed in the 111th Congress (H.R. 5509) but not in the 112th. Legislation for a national certainty program was proposed in the 111th Congress (H.R. 5509) but not in the 112th. Additional proposals for a national program or pilot program in select watersheds may be included in the farm bill reauthorization debate. The USDA initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) to measure the environmental benefits of conservation programs and aid policymakers in developing new programs. CEAP aims to help conservation program managers implement programs more effectively to meet Congress and Administration goals. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) evaluates the effectiveness of conservation efforts in cropland, grazing lands, wetlands, and wildlife. Reports have shown that conservation practices reduce sediment, nutrients, and pesticides, but additional measures are needed. Targeting conservation resources to high-need areas could increase effectiveness but may limit funds in other areas. The focus on conservation programs in the farm bill may lead to reductions in funding, which could impact certain areas deemed lower risk. Conservation funding, a significant part of the overall farm bill baseline, is under scrutiny for potential cuts during reauthorization. While most producers support conservation efforts, the debate in Congress revolves around balancing federal spending on agriculture. Recent reports and studies show that conservation measures are effective in addressing environmental concerns. Spending reductions, program efficiencies, and federal policies will drive conservation farm bill discussion in the 113th Congress."
