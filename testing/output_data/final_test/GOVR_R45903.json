    "content": "Since early 2018, foreign nations targeted U.S. food and agricultural products with retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and imports from China. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports using presidential powers granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. India also proposed retaliatory tariffs. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in multiple rounds, starting in July 2018 with a 25% tariff on $34 billion of goods. This was followed by additional tariffs on $16 billion in August 2018, $200 billion in September 2018 (increased to 25% in May 2019), and two lists of Chinese imports facing 10% tariffs in August 2019. China retaliated with its own tariffs in response. The Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods led to retaliatory tariffs by China, including halting purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. China imposed additional tariffs on U.S. imports, affecting various agricultural tariff lines. Other countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products. India prepared a list of U.S. products for retaliatory tariffs in 2018 but implemented them in 2019 on specific items after being removed from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). India was removed from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program on May 31, 2019, leading to higher duties on goods imported from India by the United States. In response, India implemented retaliatory tariffs effective June 16, 2019. Additionally, the Trump Administration reached agreements with Canada, Mexico, and Turkey to remove tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and reduce retaliatory tariffs. On May 21, 2019, China reduced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, focusing on the impact of Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural trade. This report highlights the effects of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products exported to China, making them more expensive in the Chinese market. The report discusses the economic effects of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products exported to China, leading to an increase in imports from other countries. China has improved market access for imports from other countries while increasing tariffs on U.S. imports. Agricultural stakeholders express concerns about the tariffs, and potential issues for Congress are identified. China faces retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs on certain steel and aluminum products. Retaliatory tariffs for Canada and Mexico are increases from existing NAFTA rates. Table 1 compares tariff increases on U.S. agricultural products from September 2018 to June 2019. Tariffs may vary based on quantity and are converted to ad valorem rates for analysis. The report utilizes U.S. export data and partner country import data to accurately measure the impact of retaliatory tariffs. Table 1 shows the range of tariff hike rates for U.S. retaliating trade partners, with China facing the largest set of tariff increases. The ad valorem tariff rates can change based on price fluctuations of traded products. Matching U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule with retaliatory country's tariff codes can be challenging. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and Section 301 tariffs. The tariffs targeted various U.S. products, including agricultural goods like pork, fruit, and tree nuts. In July 2018, China expanded the list of products facing higher tariffs, including most U.S. agricultural exports to China. China imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. Section 301 action, with most products facing an additional 25% tariff. Additional tariff increases were implemented in August and September 2018, expanding coverage to more products. In September 2018, China imposed 5% and 10% tariff increases on certain products, including agricultural goods. In June 2019, tariffs were increased on additional products, resulting in almost all U.S. agricultural products shipped to China facing retaliatory tariffs ranging from 5% to 50% above their MFN rates. The average tariff rate increase across all products was 24% through August 31, 2019. In July 2018, Mexico imposed tariffs on U.S. sausage, pork, cheeses, apples, potatoes, cranberries, whey, blue-veined cheese, and whiskies. Canada also imposed tariffs on dairy, poultry, beef, coffee, chocolate, sugar, confectionery, prepared food, condiments, bottled water, and whiskies in July 2018. The U.S. removed steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico in May 2019 to facilitate the ratification of the USMCA. In response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs, the EU and Turkey imposed retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. imports. The U.S. then increased tariffs on steel imports from Turkey, leading to further retaliatory tariffs from Turkey on selected U.S. imports. The EU and Turkey imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs. Turkey halved its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports when the U.S. reduced tariffs on Turkish steel. India implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. food products, including chickpeas, almonds, walnuts, apples, and lentils. Foreign nations may target U.S. food and agricultural products with retaliatory tariffs due to the U.S. being the largest exporter of these goods. The retaliatory tariffs imposed by U.S. trading partners affected various American food and agricultural products, including meats, grains, dairy products, specialty crops, and alcoholic beverages. These tariffs were in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs, with countries targeting specific U.S. lawmakers' constituents. Total imports of affected U.S. food and agricultural products by retaliating countries in 2018 amounted to nearly $22 billion. The total value of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports by all countries was almost $22 billion in 2018, a 27% decrease from 2017. Chinese imports of U.S. agricultural products affected by tariffs dropped from $22.5 billion to $14.7 billion. Canadian imports declined to $2.3 billion in 2018. Canada's retaliatory tariffs covered various product categories including beef, poultry, dairy, fruits, vegetables, drinks, coffee, spices, chocolate, confectionery, and whiskey. Canada removed its tariffs in May 2019 in response to the U.S. lifting tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Mexican imports of U.S. agricultural products were also impacted. Imports of U.S. agricultural products by Mexico declined from $2.6 billion in 2017 to $2.5 billion in 2018, mainly due to decreases in sausage and pork products. Mexico also imposed retaliatory tariffs on various food items and whiskey. The EU retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products increased to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $1.1 billion in 2017, affecting items like prepared vegetables, fruit juices, and whiskey. The imposition of retaliatory tariffs by the EU led to a decline in imports of affected food and agricultural products from the United States. Sales surged before the duties were imposed, offsetting a later slump in sales. Factors contributing to the reduction in imports include importers stocking up on affected products prior to the tariffs taking effect. Turkey also saw an increase in imports of U.S. food and agricultural products affected by retaliatory tariffs between 2017 and 2018. Despite a decline in imports in the third and fourth quarter of 2018, Turkey halved its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports in May 2019. In contrast, India did not impose any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products in 2018, but started implementing them in June 2019. India implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, walnuts, chickpeas, lentils, and apples starting in June 16, 2019. The total value of Indian imports of these products was $824 million in 2017 and $859 million in 2018. Various countries including Canada, the EU, Mexico, Turkey, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in 2018. India did not levy any retaliatory tariffs in 2018 but started implementing them in June 2019. In 2018, U.S. food and agricultural exports saw changes, with exports growing to $140 billion despite retaliatory tariffs. Increased exports to nonretaliating countries offset losses to China and Turkey. The Chinese market is crucial for U.S. agricultural products like soybeans, distillers' grains, and sorghum. In 2017, China was a significant market for various U.S. agricultural exports, including soybeans, cotton, sorghum, dairy products, pork, wheat, and fruit. However, retaliatory tariffs imposed in 2018 led to a 53% decline in U.S. agricultural exports to China, dropping its rank to the fourth-largest market. China moved down to become the fourth-largest U.S. agricultural market after Canada, Mexico, and Japan. In 2018, China imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. soybeans, leading to a decline in U.S. soybean exports to China. This resulted in lower farm prices for affected commodities and reduced U.S. agricultural exports to China for several commodities. The 25% retaliatory tariff imposed by China on U.S. soybeans led to lower U.S. agricultural exports to China for various commodities, causing U.S. soybean prices to hit 10-year lows. Despite reported commitments by China to purchase a significant amount of U.S. agricultural goods, Chinese purchases did not materialize, leading to a downward trend in U.S. commodity prices. Brazilian soybean prices rose as demand from China increased, diverging from the usual trend of Brazilian and U.S. soybean prices moving together. In 2018, U.S. soybean prices fell due to China's 25% tariff, while Brazilian prices rose. The gap between the two prices widened, with U.S. prices $86 per metric ton lower than Brazilian prices in October 2018. Brazilian prices fell in anticipation of a record-high harvest, while U.S. prices climbed due to farmers holding stocks and increased exports. Chinese purchases did not materialize, causing prices to diverge again in May 2019. Soybeans were heavily impacted by retaliatory tariffs, especially due to China's dominant role in the market. In 2018, U.S. agricultural exports to China declined due to retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. products more expensive. Other countries increased exports to China, with studies suggesting Brazil could become the primary soybean supplier. Russia may also compete for China's agricultural import market in the future. Since 2017, Brazil and other countries have increased their agricultural exports to China, with Brazil surpassing the United States as China's top supplier in 2017. Following retaliatory tariffs in 2018, U.S. agricultural shipments to China dropped to $15 billion from $23 billion in 2017, while overall Chinese imports rose to $127 billion. In 2018, U.S. agricultural shipments to China decreased to $15 billion from $23 billion in 2017, with China's total agricultural imports reaching $127 billion. Brazil's market share grew from 18% to 26% during the same period, benefiting from Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports. Other countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also saw increases in their export market shares to China for various agricultural products. New Zealand's share of China's import market increased in dairy, hides and skins. Thailand and Indonesia also saw growth in their export shipments to China. Russia aims to fill the gap left by reduced U.S. food and agricultural exports to China, with plans to deepen trade in soybeans and other products. China's imports from Russia rose by 61% in 2018, with strong growth in oilseeds, wheat, fats and oils, cocoa, beer, and animal products. China's imports of food and agricultural products increased from various countries in 2018, including Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The U.S.-China trade war has raised concerns for American farmers due to tariffs, impacting soybean prices. The long-term consequences of the conflict could have lasting effects on the agricultural market shares in China. In 2018, China's imports of U.S. soybeans declined due to higher tariffs, leading to a decrease in export value to $3 billion. Despite this, China remained the top destination for U.S. soybeans, followed by Mexico. In 2018, China's import of U.S. soybeans declined significantly due to retaliatory tariffs, dropping from $2.5 billion in January to $140 million in July. By November, China stopped importing U.S. soybeans altogether. However, in December, China committed to purchasing a large amount of agricultural goods, including U.S. soybeans. China purchased U.S. soybeans worth $700 million in April 2019, but imports declined in May 2019 due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. China turned to Brazil for soybeans, with imports increasing in May and June 2018. Brazilian shipments to China declined in July 2018 when China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. In fall 2018, U.S. soybean shipments to China decreased while Brazilian shipments increased. China later expanded purchases of U.S. soybeans from February to May 2019, along with imports from Brazil, Argentina, Russia, and Central Asian countries. U.S. cotton exports to China totaled over $1 billion in 2014, but declined by 6% from 2017 to 2018. Chinese imports of U.S. cotton decreased after retaliatory tariffs were imposed in July 2018. In response to U.S. Section 232 action, China's imports of U.S. cotton decreased to $27 million in October 2018. China's imports from other countries, such as Brazil, Australia, India, and Uzbekistan, have increased. China also approved some domestic textile mills to buy 50,000 metric tons of U.S. cotton without retaliatory tariffs. However, after President Trump announced 10% Section 301 tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, China halted purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. In response to U.S. tariffs, China halted purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, including wheat. U.S. wheat exports to China declined significantly due to retaliatory tariffs, with Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia increasing their wheat exports to China instead. U.S. wheat shipments to China dropped from $256 million in the first half of 2017 to $113 million in the first half of 2018, and were zero after July 2018. China imported $208 million of U.S. wheat in 2016 and $390 million in 2017, but only $12 million in March 2019. In 2016 and 2017, China imported significant amounts of U.S. wheat, totaling $208 million and $390 million respectively. However, in March 2019, China only imported $12 million of U.S. wheat. The United States also accounted for a large portion of China's sorghum imports in 2016 and 2017, but the value of U.S. sorghum shipments declined to $726 million in 2018. China's imports of U.S. sorghum decreased after retaliatory tariffs were imposed in July 2018. Despite retaliatory tariffs, U.S. sorghum saw a decline in Chinese imports, leading to negligible purchases since October 2018. China's total sorghum imports in 2018 were dominated by the U.S. with an 85% market share. In July 2019, China allowed domestic companies to buy U.S. sorghum without tariffs, but tensions escalated with Trump's announcement of additional tariffs. China then instructed state-owned enterprises to halt U.S. agricultural goods purchases. In terms of pork, the U.S. supplied 13% of China's imports in 2016 and 2017, but the trade dynamics shifted in 2018. In 2018, U.S. pork shipments to China declined to $130 million, accounting for 6% of China's total pork imports due to retaliatory tariffs. China's imports of U.S. pork products decreased from July to December 2018, but increased from January to May 2019. China's African Swine Fever outbreak led to over 2 million culled hogs between September 2018 and May 2019. In May 2019, China reported over 2 million culled hogs due to African Swine Fever (ASF). Despite retaliatory tariffs, U.S. pork products are entering China, with USDA expecting an increase in imports in 2019. However, U.S. pork still faces Chinese tariffs, making it more expensive. China approved requests to buy U.S. pork without tariffs, but after Trump announced new tariffs, China halted purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and imposed additional tariffs. China imposed additional 10% tariffs on U.S. pork products in response to new U.S. Section 301 tariffs. The United States is the third-largest supplier of dairy products to China, with Chinese imports increasing over 50% from $10 billion in 2016 to $15 billion in 2018. The trade effects on dairy products due to retaliatory tariffs are not as clear as for other commodities. China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. dairy products in July 2018, leading to no clear trend in China's monthly imports of U.S. dairy products. Annual U.S. dairy shipments to China increased by 15% from $1.2 billion in 2017 to $1.3 billion in 2018. However, competitor countries like New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Australia saw faster growth in their dairy shipments to China during the same period. The retaliatory tariffs are likely contributing to faster market share growth for U.S. competitors in China. The imposition of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. dairy products in China has led to faster market share growth for U.S. competitors in China. Additionally, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. hides and skins have resulted in a decline in Chinese imports, with major competitors like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand unable to fill the gap. China's total hides and skins imports fell by 25% in 2018. In 2018, total hides and skins imports dropped by 25% to $1.6 billion from $2.2 billion in 2017. U.S. shipments to China decreased by 28%, maintaining a 41% share of China's imports. The additional 10% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports may further reduce U.S. shipments to China. Analysis by UC Davis economists showed that Chinese retaliatory tariffs also impacted U.S. alfalfa exports to China, with the U.S. supplying about 79% of China's total alfalfa imports from 2016 to 2018. In 2018, U.S. alfalfa exports to China declined due to retaliatory tariffs, with U.S. supplying 79% of China's total alfalfa imports. U.S. pistachio exports also decreased because of tariffs from China and Turkey. A study estimated a $2.64 billion export loss for various agricultural products in major markets including China, India, Mexico, and Turkey. Chinese retaliatory tariffs have impacted U.S. exports of various agricultural products, including field crops, livestock, animal products, specialty crops, and processed food. Tariffs raise the cost of imported products, leading to a decrease in quantities purchased as importers switch to other suppliers or alternate products. The trade impact depends on the availability of alternate foreign suppliers and substitutes within the domestic market. U.S. agriculture faces intense competition in both domestic and international markets, with thin profit margins, making international sales crucial for revenue. The retaliatory tariffs have led to a decrease in U.S. agricultural exports, impacting various products. This has caused a ripple effect in the economy, affecting infrastructure and employment. The short-term market impacts show lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products by countries implementing tariffs. The prospects for U.S. agricultural exports to China in 2019 are expected to follow a similar trajectory. During the first quarter of 2019, U.S. food and agricultural imports by the EU and Turkey were lower compared to 2017 and 2018. U.S. monthly exports to China from January to April 2019 also showed a decrease compared to the same period in 2017 and 2018. Retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries have impacted U.S. agricultural exports since April 2018. In response to U.S. Section 301 tariffs, China imposed increased tariffs on U.S. imports in 2018. This led to a halt in purchases of U.S. agricultural goods by China's state-owned enterprises. Additional rounds of retaliatory tariffs were implemented in September and December 2019, potentially causing U.S. agricultural exports to continue losing market share in China. Furthermore, U.S. agriculture faced challenges in 2019 due to abundant supplies of grains and oilseeds, leading to weak commodity prices. In 2018, record high stock prices pressured soybean prices, leading to speculation of farmers switching to corn in 2019. Despite reports of China agreeing to buy U.S. agricultural goods, soybean prices continued to decline in early 2019, reaching a 12-year low of $8.02 per bushel in May. This was accompanied by President Trump's threat to increase tariffs on Chinese imports. The Trump Administration increased tariffs on U.S. imports from China to 25% and planned additional tariff increases on all remaining imports. China responded with tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, affecting various crops and causing challenges for the U.S. farm sector in 2018. The imposition of U.S. Sector 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, along with domestic content provisions of the USMCA, could increase production costs for U.S. farmers. The Trump Administration's tariffs may raise consumer prices, including a 6% increase in manufacturing agricultural and construction equipment costs. Agro-chemical manufacturers warn that tariff-related cost hikes will be passed on to American growers, potentially leading to postponed equipment purchases and impacting the farm input sector. In 2019, agricultural commodity prices are under pressure due to a record soybean and near-record corn harvest in 2018, trade disputes with China, and high carryover stocks. Trade disruptions can lead to new alliances, impacting U.S. farm exports as seen in the 1980 embargo on grain exports to the Soviet Union. During the early 1970s, the United States imposed a partial embargo on soybean and cottonseed exports as an inflation fighting measure. This led to increased Japanese investments in Brazil's soybean industry, making it a major competitor to the U.S. market. Other countries like Brazil, Canada, Australia, and the EU have also increased their farm exports to China. Additionally, countries like Russia, Ukraine, and some African and Southeast Asian countries are looking to expand their agricultural foothold in the Chinese market, potentially benefiting from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. The USDA projects that China's soybean imports will grow despite retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, with Brazil likely accounting for two-thirds of the growth in global soybean exports to China. Lower U.S. prices may stimulate additional demand from other countries, but these markets are not expected to fully absorb the decrease in Chinese imports from the U.S. The USDA report predicts that alternative export markets for U.S. soybeans can only absorb a fraction of the soybeans exported to China before trade tensions began. China is investing in agricultural production in U.S. competitor markets like Russia, which has pledged land to Chinese farmers and committed to increasing agricultural exports to China. Russian agriculture has seen increased productivity growth due to strategic investments and product specialization. Russian regional agricultural productivity has increased by 25-75%, especially in southern Russia. In 2018, Russia gained market share in China for soybean oil, wheat, corn, soybeans, oilseeds, and hay. China's imports of Russian food and agricultural products grew by 61% in 2018, with significant increases in cereals, oilseeds, fats and oils, cocoa products, beer, and animal products. Despite the growth, Russia's agricultural exports to China in 2018 accounted for less than 1% of China's total agricultural imports. In 2016, over 1,300 Chinese enterprises invested $26 billion in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries globally. Most investments were in neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, Russia's Far East, and Africa. China's agricultural investments are linked to the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, with a focus on dairy, beef, and lamb imports from New Zealand and Australia. China has taken steps since 2018 to reduce import-export taxes and duties, particularly for non-U.S. agricultural products. This includes lowering value added taxes on agricultural products and implementing reductions in customs duties to boost imports. However, retaliatory tariffs have hindered U.S. agricultural exporters from fully benefiting from these improved market access terms. Various studies have estimated potential economic impacts of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. For example, one study predicted decreased farm prices, reduced exports to China, and lower production of soybeans, cotton, sorghum, and pork, leading to revenue declines for U.S. producers. The impact of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. dairy products was examined by a study from Texas A&M University. The study estimated significant export losses due to tariffs imposed by Mexico and China, leading to economic losses of $991 million per year and nearly 5,000 lost jobs for U.S. cheese exports to Mexico, and potential economy-wide losses of $2.8 billion per year and over 13,000 lost jobs for U.S. dairy imports to China. In September 2018, the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) at Iowa State University estimated that Iowa's soybean industry could lose $159 million to $891 million annually, with an average revenue loss of $545 million. The study also estimated that Iowa's corn industry could lose $90 million to $579 million annually, with an average revenue loss of $333 million. The study by the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University estimated revenue losses in Iowa's pork/hog industry at $558 million to $955 million, ethanol producers facing $105 million in lost revenues, and overall declines in labor income across the state due to price drops in corn and ethanol. The study estimates significant labor income declines in Iowa and Nebraska due to impacts on corn, soybean, and hog industries from retaliatory tariffs. Iowa could face annual tax revenue losses of $111 million to $146 million without federal offsets, while Nebraska could incur costs of $164 million to $242 million in lost labor income and 4,100 to 6,000 job losses. Overall, Iowa's gross state product could see losses of $1 billion to $2 billion annually. In 2018, Nebraska faced an estimated economic loss of $859 million to $1.2 billion due to retaliatory tariffs on corn, soybeans, and hogs. The tariffs were expected to reduce corn prices by $0.14 to $0.21 per bushel, soybean prices by $0.95 to $1.54 per bushel, and hog prices by $17.81 to $18.80 per head. This would result in farm revenue losses for corn, soybeans, and pork. The Nebraska Farm Bureau projected $943 million in lost revenues for producers in 2019 due to ongoing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. The estimated loss calculation for Nebraska farmers in 2018 did not consider trade-aid payments. Economists found that retaliatory tariffs on specialty crops in China, Mexico, Turkey, and India resulted in $2.64 billion of lost export value and $3.34 billion of combined U.S. revenue losses. Mexico and India had retaliatory tariffs on certain crops in 2018, but they were removed or implemented in 2019. Researchers at Purdue University conducted two studies using the GTAP model. The Purdue University study using the GTAP model analyzed the long-term impacts of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture and the economy. The study focused on a 25% tariff imposed by China on soybeans and other U.S. agricultural products, predicting that U.S. soybean market losses in China would benefit Brazil over time. The Purdue University study analyzed the impact of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture. It predicted large price declines and export losses for U.S. soybeans due to China's tariffs, benefiting Brazil. The study also estimated overall economic welfare decline for the U.S. and China, but an increase for Brazil. Another study looked at the implementation of USMCA and the existence of retaliatory tariffs, estimating a net increase in annual U.S. agricultural exports of $450 million under USMCA. A study by economists at Iowa State University analyzed the national-level effects of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, projecting export losses of around $8 billion when considering tariffs from all countries. The study focused on U.S. pork, soybeans, corn, and wheat, with Mexico removing retaliatory tariffs in May 2019. The study by economists at Iowa State University analyzed the impact of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports over nine years. It projected a 30% decline in pork and corn exports, 15% for soybeans, and 1.5% for wheat compared to the baseline scenario. In the short run, trade losses could lead to 26,000 job reductions annually and a $1.5 billion decline in labor income. In the long run, job losses could increase to nearly 60,000, with a $3.1 billion decrease in labor income and a $12 billion loss in national output. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) conducted a global analysis of U.S. tariffs. The UNCTAD global analysis focused on U.S. Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, including retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, particularly on soybeans. Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans disrupted global trade, leading to higher prices for Brazilian soybeans. This could benefit Brazilian producers in the short run but may impact long-term competitiveness due to uncertain tariff sizes and durations. Brazilian producers may face challenges if tariffs are removed, impacting their competitiveness. A USDA study highlighted that the US and Brazil are low-cost soybean producers, with the US having transportation advantages. Transporting soybeans from Brazil to China is costlier compared to the US due to logistical factors. The United States has lower transportation costs and greater production efficiency compared to Brazil in producing and shipping agricultural products to Asian markets. The current trade dispute and retaliatory tariffs may lead to inefficient allocation of resources. Livestock feed costs declined in 2018 but are expected to increase in 2019. The U.S. livestock sector is facing retaliatory tariffs, impacting processed food products using raw agricultural inputs. The Coalition for a Prosperous America suggests a 25% tariff on all imports from China could stimulate GDP growth. A study states that USDA trade-aid programs offset negative impacts of Chinese retaliation on US GDP. The negative impact of Chinese retaliation on US GDP is highlighted by various agricultural organizations. American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union express concerns about the tariffs affecting farmers and ranchers already facing economic difficulties. Temporary relief measures are deemed insufficient to address the long-term challenges. Various U.S. agricultural commodity groups, such as the American Soybean Association and the National Pork Producers Council, have expressed concerns over the negative impact of retaliatory tariffs on China. The tariffs have led to increased prices for U.S. pork in the Chinese market, affecting the livelihoods of American farmers. China's increased demand for imported pork due to African Swine Fever would have been a significant sales opportunity for U.S. farmers if not for the tariffs. The trade dispute with China has cost American pig farmers $8 per animal, resulting in $1 billion in total losses. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Mexico could lead to billions of dollars in lost sales for U.S. dairy producers. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have increased agricultural production costs. CropLife America and RISE state that escalating tariffs are raising the cost of pesticide products. The escalating tariffs on pesticide products for crop and turf protection will be passed on to American growers and businesses. Stakeholders testified to the USTR about proposed tariffs on imports from China. U.S. companies and industry groups argue that both sides will lose in a trade war. Tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. companies, not China, according to a letter signed by over 600 companies. On June 21, 2019, domestic producers and manufacturing/labor groups urged President Trump to maintain a hardline approach to China. The Coalition for a Prosperous America, including nonagricultural manufacturing companies and some food/agriculture-related small companies, signed the letter. USDA announced a second round of trade aid in 2019 to help with losses from retaliatory tariffs. Industry groups welcomed the aid but preferred trade over aid. Agricultural trade associations emphasized the importance of restoring agricultural markets and beneficial relationships with trading partners globally. Several major agricultural trade associations, including the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, American Soybean Association, National Cotton Council, National Milk Producers Federation, and National Pork Producers Council, expressed sentiments regarding the trade-aid package. The National Association of Wheat Growers criticized the package as a temporary solution. President Trump proposed tariff increases on Chinese imports in May 2019, which were postponed after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, in August 2019, Trump announced plans to raise tariffs on all other Chinese products not covered by Section 301 tariffs. China responded by halting purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. The USTR released lists of Chinese products to be levied with tariffs, prompting retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. agricultural goods. The trade dispute has led to an expanding list of affected sectors and a diversity of witnesses at USTR hearings. Congressional consideration may be needed on the issue. The trade dispute between the US and China has led to retaliatory tariffs affecting various sectors beyond agriculture. Congressional consideration may be needed on whether compensation for tariff-related losses should extend to other industries besides agricultural producers. Questions have also been raised about the distribution of trade aid payments in 2018 and 2019. Questions have been raised about the methodology and equity of the 2019 trade-aid package, as well as concerns about U.S. commitments under international agreements like the WTO. Several WTO members have requested more details on the trade-aid package to assess its market-distorting effects. With the increasing investments in agricultural productivity in countries like Russia and the growing market share of countries like Russia, Brazil, and others in China's import market, Congress may need to evaluate the adequacy of current policies. Congress should consider whether current policies are sufficient for U.S. agriculture to expand its overseas markets, especially as other countries increase agricultural production to meet China's import demand. Environmental groups warn that this expansion may harm tropical forests and fragile habitats crucial for global biodiversity. The U.S. is a cost-efficient producer of food, but the trade dispute could lead to long-term environmental costs if less productive or environmentally vulnerable areas are cultivated instead of more efficient U.S. production."
