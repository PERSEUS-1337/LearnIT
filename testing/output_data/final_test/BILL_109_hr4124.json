    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children and Media Research Advancement Act\" or the \"CAMRA Act.\" The Children and Media Research Advancement Act acknowledges Congress's recognition of the impact of electronic media on children's development. Hearings have been held to examine the influence of violent media on children's health, highlighting the need for behavioral and social science research to inform policy decisions. The role of electronic media, especially interactive digital media, in children's healthy development is not fully understood. Early screen usage by babies and toddlers and the psychological effects of high definition interactive media on child and adolescent viewers are areas with gaps in research. Studies show that children who watch educational shows during preschool years tend to be more successful in school later on, regardless of other environmental factors like household income and parent's education. The early stages of childhood are crucial for development, influenced by environments and media exposure. Research on the impact of sexual messages in the media on children's attitudes and behaviors was limited until the late 1990s. In 2001, a study found little research on how Internet pornography exposure affects youth. Developing a research program to track children's media habits over time is crucial for understanding its impact on their development. Currently, there is no primary effort supporting research on the media's influence on children and adolescents. The lack of centralized organization for research on the impact of media on children and adolescents hinders valuable findings. Establishing a well-coordinated research effort is necessary to provide evidence for implementing electronic media literacy initiatives. The Act aims to enable the CDC to study the effects of electronic media on children and adolescents' development and provide Congress with research findings. The Act enables the CDC to research the impact of electronic media on children and adolescents' development. The Secretary will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to establish an independent panel of experts to review the impact of electronic media on youth development in various areas. The impact of media on children and adolescents includes cognitive development (language, attention, problem-solving), physical development (coordination, diet, exercise), and socio-behavioral development (family activities, peer relationships, consumption habits). The Secretary will conduct pilot projects to study the impact of media exposure on cognitive and social development in infancy and childhood, as well as the link between media advertising and childhood obesity. Additional research will be conducted on the role of electronic media in cognitive, physical, and socio-behavioral development. The program focuses on the impact of electronic media on children and adolescents' development, considering factors like media content, format, exposure length, age, and parental involvement. Eligible entities must submit an application and agree to use grant funds for research activities. The program focuses on researching the effects of electronic mass media on children and adolescents' social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral development. Grant funds are to be used for studying various forms of media such as television, movies, DVDs, video games, the Internet, cell phones, and other electronic mass media. The panel will submit a report to the Secretary within 12 months of its establishment, and the Secretary will provide a report to Congress by December 31, 2011 summarizing the research results in a way understandable to the general public. The panel will submit a report to the Secretary within 12 months of its establishment, summarizing research results for the general public. Authorization of appropriations includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2007. The authorization of appropriations includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2010."
