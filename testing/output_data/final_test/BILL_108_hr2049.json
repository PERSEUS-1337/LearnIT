    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women and Children's HIV Protection Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that perinatal transmission is the leading cause of pediatric HIV infections, with nearly 7,000 HIV-infected women giving birth in the US each year. Medical advances have made it possible to almost eliminate perinatal HIV transmission through the administration of antiviral medication during pregnancy, labor, and after birth. Research shows that this treatment significantly reduces the risk of transmission, even if started shortly after birth. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal HIV testing in prenatal care, but 15% of HIV-infected pregnant women receive no prenatal care. CDC recommends testing all pregnant women, but nearly half are not tested. Mandatory testing of newborns and universal testing of pregnant women are considered best practices. The American Medical Association recommends mandatory HIV testing of all newborns and universal testing of pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to newborns. Over 100 babies could be saved from needless infection annually with routine testing. The provision of testing, counseling, and treatment for pregnant women and newborns can significantly reduce pediatric HIV infections and AIDS cases. New York State has mandatory HIV counseling and testing for pregnant women and newborns, resulting in a decrease in perinatal HIV transmission rate from 25% to 3.5% and linking over 99% of HIV-infected women and children to care. Universal routine HIV testing of pregnant women and newborns is recommended to reduce pediatric HIV infections. Medical organizations and public health officials should issue guidelines to make testing, counseling, and treatment standard care. SEC. 2625A.
