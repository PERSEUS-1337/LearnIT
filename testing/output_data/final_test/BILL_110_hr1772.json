    "content": "The \"Rural Wind Energy Development Act\" allows for a credit for the installation of wind energy property by rural homeowners, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses under section 30D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Rural Wind Energy Development Act\" provides a tax credit of $1,500 for each half kilowatt of qualified wind energy property installed, with a requirement that 50% of the energy produced must be consumed on-site. Qualified wind energy property includes wind turbines of 100 kilowatts or less placed in the United States. The tax credit for qualified wind energy property installation is subject to certain conditions such as the property being a dwelling unit, the turbine having a 5-year warranty, and limitations based on the taxpayer's regular tax liability. The tax credit for qualified wind energy property installation includes special rules for carryover of unused credit and treatment of tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations. Individuals in cooperative housing corporations are treated as having paid their share of expenditures for qualified wind energy property, allowing them to receive the appropriate tax credit. Similarly, individuals in condominium management associations are also eligible for the tax credit based on their proportionate share of expenses for qualified wind energy property. The term 'condominium management association' refers to an organization meeting specific requirements for a condominium project where most units are used as dwelling units. The basis adjustment rule reduces the increase in property basis by the amount of the credit allowed. The tax credit applies to property placed in service between December 31, 2006, and January 1, 2012.
