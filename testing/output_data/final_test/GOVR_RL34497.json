    "content": "The America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69, \u00a75012) established ARPA-E with the goal of enhancing US economic and energy security by developing technologies to reduce energy imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy efficiency. ARPA-E aims to make the US a leader in advanced energy technologies by promoting revolutionary advances in fundamental sciences and translating them into technological innovations. The agency focuses on accelerating transformational technological advances in areas where industry may not undertake due to technical and financial uncertainty. ARPA-E's programs in \u00a75012 aim to accelerate early-stage energy research, develop novel energy technologies, and facilitate technology transfer through collaborations with academic institutions, companies, and research foundations. Awards may also be given to consortia, including federally funded research centers, based on criteria such as novelty, technical merit, and future commercial applications. The management of ARPA-E is modeled after DARPA, known for catalyzing innovative technologies. DARPA sponsors high-risk, high-payoff research to bridge the gap between fundamental discoveries and military use. ARPA-E aims to accelerate early-stage energy research and develop novel energy technologies with potential commercial applications. The ARPA-E program, modeled after DARPA, focuses on high-risk research to accelerate early-stage energy technologies. It would be managed by a presidentially appointed director with the authority to approve programs, establish milestones, and appoint scientific personnel. Coordination with other federal programs is essential, and Program Managers would select projects based on merit. The ARPA-E program seeks advice from advisory committees and other sources, authorizes an Energy Transformation Acceleration Fund, and has specific budget allocation requirements. After operating for four years, ARPA-E will be evaluated by the National Academy of Sciences. The director must submit annual reports on supported projects and strategic vision roadmaps to Congress. Congress authorized $300 million for ARPA-E in FY2008 and additional funds for FY2009 and FY2010, but no funds were appropriated for FY2008. The Bush Administration did not request funds for ARPA-E in FY2009. In FY2009, ARPA-E received initial funding of $415 million from ARRA and FY2009 funds. The Obama Administration proposed $10 million for ARPA-E in FY2010, but the House Committee on Appropriations declined to provide this funding. President Obama announced ARPA-E's establishment in a speech at the National Academy of Sciences and released a funding opportunity announcement. The director and organization of ARPA-E have not been announced yet. President Obama announced the funding of ARPA-E, a high-risk, high-reward research initiative based on DARPA. He also mentioned plans for comprehensive legislation to cap carbon emissions and make renewable energy profitable. President Obama announced the launch of ARPA-E, a $400 million initiative to advance clean energy technology and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Additionally, grants will establish 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers to spur innovation in renewable energy. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) was created based on a recommendation from the National Academy of Sciences report \"Rising Above The Gathering Storm\" and funded through the Recovery Act. ARPA-E aims to enhance economic and energy security by developing breakthrough energy technologies, reducing foreign oil consumption and energy-related emissions, improving energy efficiency across sectors, and maintaining a technological lead in advanced energy technologies. Initial grants will focus on R&D plans for transformative concepts or new technologies. ARPA-E will fund energy technology projects that translate scientific discoveries into technological innovations and accelerate transformational advances in high-risk areas. DOE released a Funding Opportunity Announcement for ARPA-E's first solicitation, focusing on R&D of transformational energy-related technologies. Transformational technologies disrupt the status quo by significantly outperforming current approaches. ARPA-E funds scientists to develop immature technologies with the potential to make a large impact in energy-related areas, overcoming the \"valley of death\" that hinders new technologies from reaching the market. The \"valley of death\" in technology development occurs in two phases: first, in determining if a technology can be viable, and second, in developing it to a stage where industry can invest in its final development. ARPA-E's success is measured by its ability to invest in promising energy technologies and manage their rapid development. ARPA-E's success is judged on the rapid development and market adoption of new technologies to reduce domestic oil use and greenhouse gas emissions. Proposers must submit a concept paper by June 2, 2009, with potential awards ranging from $500,000 to $20 million. Projects must have at least 90% of work performed in the United States, with a maximum performance period of 24 months. Multiple awards totaling up to $150 million are anticipated. According to the America COMPETES Act, ARPA-E aims to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that reduce imports of energy, energy-related emissions, and improve energy efficiency across all economic sectors. The organization is tasked with ensuring that the United States maintains a technological lead in advanced energy technologies. ARPA-E aims to achieve energy security and economic growth by developing advanced energy technologies. Dr. Steven Chu suggested funding research for new solar cell technologies to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication costs. One promising avenue for inexpensive, efficient, and long-lasting solar cells is to create novel materials based on multiple elements that can be manufactured with thin-film technologies. Another approach is to develop nano-particle devices for solar cell conversion and charge collection. Additionally, the most cost-effective biofuels may come from converting cellulose into chemical fuel, which could potentially be carbon neutral. ARPA-E can fund the creation of new plants for energy by incorporating multiple genes. Scientists have successfully inserted genes into bacteria to produce an anti-malarial drug. Similar technology can be used to make plants self-fertilizing, drought, and pest resistant. Research on more efficient conversion of cellulose into liquid fuel is needed to reduce energy-intensive processes. Secretary Chu emphasizes the need for Nobel-level breakthroughs in electric batteries, solar power, and new fuel crops to address energy and environmental challenges. He believes a revolution in science and technology is necessary to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and combat global warming. Improved efficiency in converting cellulose to ethanol with modified micro-organisms is crucial. Solar technology must advance significantly, and new energy-efficient plant varieties need to be developed. Scientists need to find new energy-efficient plants for clean fuel alternatives and to burn coal cleanly. A report identified three strategic goals for breakthroughs in fuel from sunlight, carbon-free electricity generation, and energy efficiency. The BESAC subcommittee identified breakthrough research needs for clean fuel alternatives and clean coal burning. ARPA-E aims for a \"proof of concept\" to show feasibility, similar to university proof of concept centers like MIT's Deshpande Center and UCSD's von Liebig Center. The MIT Deshpande Center and UCSD von Liebig Center have made significant investments resulting in licensing agreements, startup companies, outside financing, and job creation. MIT's Catalyst volunteers provide guidance to researchers with relevant experience in innovation and technology commercialization. MIT's Catalyst volunteers provide guidance to researchers with industry expertise, willingness to assist MIT research teams, and commitment to MIT researchers' interests. They work with a multidisciplinary committee to evaluate research fund applications and help submit full proposals. At UCSD's von Liebig Center, Technology and Business Advisors, along with Champion Entrepreneurs, mentor project teams in developing commercialization strategies. Venture capitalists, experienced entrepreneurs, and angel investors assist in leading projects through the commercialization pipeline and starting a company around it. Advisors at UCSD help faculty prepare proposals based on technology novelty, market potential, maturity, grant utility, intellectual property, and investigator credibility. The America COMPETES Act mandates ARPA-E to be managed by a director appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, reporting to the Secretary of Energy for independence within DOE. The ARPA-E director reports to the DOE, ensuring independence. The director cannot head another DOE organization. Projects must complement DOE R&D activities. DOE funds EFRCs and proposes Energy Innovation Hubs. The FY2010 budget request includes three initiatives: Energy Innovation Hubs, Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs), and ARPA-E. EFRCs focus on basic science hurdles, ARPA-E explores risky technologies, and Energy Innovation Hubs will bridge basic to applied science for energy breakthroughs. The Energy Innovation Hubs proposed in FY 2010 will receive $280 million in funding to support multi-disciplinary teams working on priority technology challenges. Each Hub will be funded at $25 million per year, with additional start-up funding of $10 million in the first year. The Hubs aim to bridge basic research to engineering development and commercialization, focusing on transforming energy. Energy Innovation Hubs will support cross-disciplinary research on energy technology barriers, advancing promising areas to low-risk deployment. Renewal after 5 years is not guaranteed, requiring exceptional scientific progress. Research topics include Solar Electricity, Fuels from Sunlight, Batteries, Carbon Capture, Grid Materials, Energy Efficient Buildings, Extreme Materials, and Modeling. Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) are supported by the Department of Energy to address scientific roadblocks in clean energy and energy security. There are 46 EFRCs funded at $2 to $5 million per year, involving 1,800 researchers and students from universities, national labs, industry, and non-profit organizations. These centers focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage, and utilize advanced technologies like nanotechnology and supercomputers. The Department of Energy collaborates with advanced instrumentation to support Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) focusing on clean energy and energy security. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) funds high-risk, high-reward energy research projects to maintain a technological lead in energy technologies. ARPA-E provides grants ranging from $500,000 to $10 million for innovative ideas to be brought to market quickly. The ARPA-E funds research projects with grants ranging from $500,000 to $10 million, expecting rapid progress within three years. The America COMPETES Act allows for the establishment of multidisciplinary research institutes at DOE national laboratories, but no funding has been provided yet. One option to start ARPA-E's operations quickly could be to leverage DARPA's Program Managers and energy portfolio. DARPA's unique role is to investigate new technological capabilities with high-risk, high payoff research. They aim to create disruptive capabilities by creating surprise and building communities of change-state advocates among forward-looking researchers and operational experts. DARPA's success depends on instigating cooperation among forward-looking researchers and operational experts to define challenges, develop solution concepts, and demonstrate them. One policy option for ARPA-E could be to utilize DARPA's existing Program Managers focused on energy issues to leverage their expertise. ARPA-E could benefit from utilizing DARPA's trained Program Managers and potentially absorbing DARPA's energy projects. DARPA's energy programs include MISER, Very High Efficiency Solar Cell, and BioFuels projects aimed at developing innovative energy technologies. ARPA-E, like DARPA, focuses on innovative energy technologies and may face challenges due to budget disparities. DARPA has a larger budget and more Program Managers, while ARPA-E must have a minimum of 70 scientific personnel. This disparity in funding may make it difficult for ARPA-E to recruit high-quality Program Managers and for them to be successful in implementing their ideas. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized the establishment of HSARPA with a $500 million budget for FY2003. The HSARPA Director administers an Acceleration Fund for Research and Development of Homeland Security Technologies to support research and development in technologies for homeland security. Some experts believe that HSARPA, established with a $500 million budget in 2002, has not been adequately utilized. Concerns include a minimal budget, lack of leadership, and autonomy in decision-making. Congressional oversight is needed as HSARPA aims to promote revolutionary changes in technologies. HSARPA, established in 2002 with a $500 million budget, initially focused on incremental R&D but shifted to high-risk transformative R&D under DHS reorganization in 2006. This change led to the Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions (HIPS) program to demonstrate high-payoff technologies in two to five years. HSARPA, established in 2002 with a $500 million budget, shifted to high-risk transformative R&D under DHS reorganization in 2006. It includes Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions (HIPS) and High Impact Technology Solutions (HITS) programs. HSARPA's budget is smaller than DARPA's and lacks a dedicated funding stream, potentially affecting its autonomy. Experts suggest that real leadership and a supportive R&D mission are crucial for success, beyond just legislative authorization. The agency shows leadership in supporting a new R&D mission and aims to use flexible statutory authorities to create a strong entity. An ARPA-E requires its own budget and control over it, technical talent, experienced leaders, and a clear mission. IARPA was established in 2007 by the Director of National Intelligence and does not have an operational mission by design. IARPA, established in 2007, focuses on capabilities for the future needs of the Intelligence Community. It emphasizes high-risk, high pay-off research with clear goals and autonomy from current activities. Dr. Porter's management design elements include selecting top technical Program Managers for investigating the best ideas and performers. IARPA emphasizes high-risk, high pay-off research with clear goals and autonomy from current activities. It uses the \"Heilmeier Questions\" to determine program viability, focusing on identifying the best ideas and performers, providing sufficient funding, flexibility in organizational design, full and open competition, customer involvement, and acceptance of low success rates. The curr_chunk discusses key questions to consider when proposing a new approach, including the need for a compelling option, potential impact, timeline, cost, program plan, progress measurement, milestones, and transition strategy. It also mentions IARPA's strategic thrusts: Smart Collection, Incisive Analysis, and Safe and Secure Operations. IARPA's budget is classified. Likely events needed to establish ARPA-E include nomination of a director by President Obama, Senate confirmation, identifying operational location, hiring staff, developing operational plan, and recruiting program managers. Congressional oversight may ensure ARPA-E meets goals outlined in the America COMPETES Act. The process of establishing ARPA-E includes recruiting Program Managers, hosting proposer's days, soliciting and reviewing proposals, and making awards. Congress may need to ensure that ARPA-E aligns with the goals of the America COMPETES Act. The establishment of ARPA-E involves recruiting highly qualified technical Program Managers familiar with the DARPA process, maintaining autonomy from DOE's current activities, ensuring sufficient funding and organizational flexibility, and focusing on high-risk, high-payoff research with clearly defined end-goals. Congressional bills may impact ARPA-E's funding and operations. Title IV of the America Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009 would amend the America COMPETES Act to give ARPA-E separate contracting authority, make technical corrections to reporting requirements, and authorize ARPA-E through 2020. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 would provide funding for ARPA-E from cap and trade allowances and require coordination with Clean Energy Innovation Centers to avoid research duplication. The American Conservation and Clean Energy Independence Act (H.R. 2227) aims to modify the strategic petroleum reserve to fund ARPA-E and other energy-related activities. Congress is concerned about how ARPA-E will differ from existing DOE Office of Science activities. Several bills in Congress seek to provide ARPA-E with additional authority or funding sources. Several proposals have been made to improve the management of federal R&D, including the creation of an \"advanced civilian technology agency\" modeled after DARPA. In 1992, an NAS report suggested a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies. DOE previously had an Advanced Energy Projects division to explore novel energy concepts from basic research. In 1995, DOE reorganized AEP's activities under a new Computational and Technology Research program, which was formally stated in DOE's 1997 budget request. Funding for the program was reduced in FY1998 and FY1999, leading to the termination of the AEP program in FY2000. In October 2005, a committee of the NAS recommended the establishment of ARPA-E in its report Rising Above the Gathering Storm. In November 2005, House Minority Leader Pelosi proposed creating a new DARPA-like initiative within DOE, which eventually led to the establishment of ARPA-E. In 2007, the concept of ARPA-E was part of an \"Innovation Agenda\" proposed by Speaker Pelosi. The proposal became the basis for ARPA-E as authorized in the America COMPETES Act. Policy debates in Congress questioned the establishment of ARPA-E, with some considering it not the best policy option for energy challenges. The supply of new technologies in the energy market is insufficient due to a lack of fundamental research. Applying the DARPA model to the civilian energy sector could promote more research. Chairman Gordon emphasized the need for ARPA-E to be nimble and innovative like DARPA to succeed in boosting energy research. Investment in ARPA-E is crucial for boosting energy research to address the scale of challenges. Key questions debated include the necessity of ARPA-E despite existing government and industry investments in energy R&D, and whether a DARPA model is the best option for the energy marketplace. Additionally, the role of In-Q-Tel, the CIA venture capital firm, in funding energy research is discussed. ARPA-E, a CIA venture capital firm, is seen as a better model for the energy marketplace than DARPA. Proponents believe ARPA-E's small and flexible structure will address organizational issues at DOE, focusing on breakthrough research to bridge the gap between basic research and industrial development. Unlike existing programs, ARPA-E aims to transform the marketplace by accelerating research with emerging technologies like nanotechnology. Critics argue that while ARPA-E aims to be more flexible and less risk-averse, being under DOE may limit its ability to take risks. Some suggest reforming existing DOE programs instead of creating a new organization. Advocates believe ARPA-E can bridge the gap between basic research and industrial development, focusing on breakthrough technologies not yet ready for venture capital investment. Some witnesses suggest incorporating a venture capital component into ARPA-E's design to evolve like DARPA. The America COMPETES Act authorized $300 million for FY2008, with proposed gradual increase to $1 billion per year over five or six years. Concerns raised about whether the funding is sufficient for ARPA-E to reach its goals. Some suggest ARPA-E needs funding comparable to DARPA, around $3 billion per year. Concerns raised about funding constraints and potential resource shifting from DOE's Office of Science. Supporters emphasize prioritizing funding for the DOE Office of Science over ARPA-E to ensure success. Some policymakers and experts propose funding ARPA-E outside of the regular appropriations process to ensure its survival and innovation. Options include advance appropriations or identifying a dedicated revenue source, such as oil industry taxes or climate change programs. The Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Resources Program, funded at $50 million per year, faces challenges in Congress. Critics question ARPA-E's success due to lack of private-sector investment in research and technology transfer. Energy market diversity is seen as a hurdle compared to DARPA's single customer base. ARPA-E proponents argue that the agency is necessary for translational research, which identifies market needs, funds scientific approaches, and brings breakthrough products to the brink of production."
