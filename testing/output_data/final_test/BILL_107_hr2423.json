    "content": "The Act titled \"Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001\" mandates renewable content in motor vehicle fuel. The Act \"Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001\" mandates renewable content in motor vehicle fuel. Definitions in the act include biodiesel, biogas, biogas source, and biomass, which refers to renewable organic matter. The term \"biomass\" includes dedicated energy crops, wood, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal waste, municipal solid waste, and other waste. Biomass ethanol is ethanol derived from biomass. Renewable fuel includes biodiesel, ethanol, liquid fuel from biomass, and biogas. The Renewable Fuel Program requires motor vehicle fuel to contain a quantity of renewable fuel, such as biomass ethanol or biogas, to reduce fossil fuel usage. The Secretary of Energy determines the gasoline-equivalent gallons needed, and the program applies to fuel sold in the US from 2002 onwards. The applicable percentage for a 6-month period of a calendar year is determined according to a table, unless modified. The applicable percentage of renewable fuel for calendar years from 2002 to 2012 is as follows: 0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.6, 3.0, and 3.42. The applicable percentage of renewable fuel for calendar years from 2012 onwards is 3.42, 3.84, 4.24, 4.63, and 5.00. The Secretary may lower the percentage for a year based on inadequate domestic supply. The Secretary may adjust the renewable fuel percentage based on inadequate domestic supply. States can submit petitions for adjustment by September 1 of the preceding year, and the Secretary will approve or deny them before the calendar year begins. Additionally, a credit program will be promulgated within 270 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will promulgate regulations for generating credits by those who refine, blend, or import motor vehicle fuel with more renewable fuel than required. These credits can be used, held, or transferred to comply with regulations and expire after 2 years. Regulations will address the inability to purchase enough credits. The regulations allow refiners, blenders, or importers to enter agreements to generate or purchase credits to make up for any deficiency in meeting requirements. They may also be required to conduct tests and submit reports on fuel composition for compliance. Civil penalties and enforcement measures are also outlined. The Secretary may impose civil penalties up to $25,000 per day for non-compliance with regulations under subsection (b) or (c), plus any economic benefit gained from the non-compliance. Each day of non-compliance with regulations based on an averaging period constitutes a separate violation. The Secretary may enforce compliance through civil action in court, including injunctions and other relief, for violations of regulations under subsections (b) or (c). Each day of non-compliance during an averaging period is considered a separate violation."
