    "content": "CARRYOVER OF UNUSED BENEFITS FROM HEALTH FLEXIBLE SPENDING ARRANGEMENTS. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for the carryover of unused funds from health flexible spending arrangements to subsequent taxable years without affecting the plan's status or requiring inclusion in gross income. The Internal Revenue Code allows for the carryover of unused funds from health flexible spending arrangements to subsequent years, with a limit of $2,000 per plan year. Carryover amounts must be included in gross income for tax purposes. The carryover of unused funds from health flexible spending arrangements is limited to $2,000 per plan year, with any excess amounts forfeited. These forfeited amounts are to be used for Qualified Medical Care Expenses and can be invested in guaranteed principle and interest investments. Terminating participants are permitted to forfeit amounts. For terminating participants, forfeitures are allowed for health flexible spending arrangement account balances, excluding carry over amounts. Qualified medical expenses include amounts paid for medical care for the individual, spouse, and dependents. The text chunk discusses the limitations on payments for health insurance expenses under a group health plan for participants of a health flexible spending arrangement. It specifies exceptions for certain types of coverage, such as continuation coverage required by Federal law and qualified long-term care. The text chunk outlines the prioritization of reimbursing Qualified Medical Care Expenses from a participant's health care flexible spending arrangement. It specifies that certain types of coverage, such as Medicare supplemental policies and individual health insurance policies, must be reimbursed first before using carryover amounts. The text chunk explains the reimbursement process from a health flexible spending arrangement, prioritizing certain types of coverage. Upon termination of employment or loss of eligibility, the accumulated carryover amount plus interest must be distributed to the participant. The employer can retain the amount in a health care spending arrangement balance to reimburse Qualifying Medical Care Expenses of the former participant and their family. The carryover amount can be transferred to a subsequent employer if they provide a similar arrangement and agree in writing, or the employer may distribute the carryover. The employer has the option to distribute the carryover amount, along with any interest earned, to a designated vehicle or to the participant in cash. If received in cash, the interest earned is treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. The employer must offer at least one of these options, but not necessarily more than one. The employee must choose within 60 days if multiple options are provided. The employer must offer options for distributing the carryover amount within 60 days of termination or loss of eligibility. If no election is made, funds will revert to the employer. In case of death, the surviving spouse or dependents will receive the funds. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
