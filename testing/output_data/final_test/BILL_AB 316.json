    "title": "AB 316",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 4830 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to exempt certain veterinarians from the chapter, including those serving in the military, licensed veterinarians from other states in consultation or attending cases in California without establishing a business presence. Veterinarians employed by the University of California or the Western University of Health Sciences are exempt from certain regulations while performing duties related to agriculture, veterinary medicine, or agricultural extension work. Students in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California or the College of Veterinary Medicine at the Western University of Health Sciences are exempt from certain regulations when participating in diagnosis and treatment under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Additionally, veterinarians employed by the Meat and Poultry Inspection Branch of the California Department of Food and Agriculture are also exempt while performing their official duties. Unlicensed personnel working for the Department of Food and Agriculture or the United States Department of Agriculture can perform specific tasks under the direction of a veterinarian supervisor for government disease monitoring and control activities. A licensed veterinarian from another state can be exempt from licensing requirements if called by law enforcement or animal control agencies for cases related to animal fighting or cruelty investigations. Consideration is given to the availability of local veterinarians for such cases. When a veterinarian is called by an agency for animal fighting or cruelty cases, the board must be notified of the investigation. A licensed veterinarian from another state can provide care for animals in an investigation without needing to register a temporary shelter facility if certain conditions are met. The temporary shelter facility must comply with Section 4854 and can exist for up to 60 days, with the possibility of extension if needed for an investigation. A veterinarian called from another state must file a report with the board within 30 days of providing care at the facility. The board may inspect temporary facilities established under this section."
