    "content": "The Drug Sentencing Reform Act of 2001, also known as the \"Drug Sentencing Reform Act,\" aims to reduce sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine. It includes provisions for sentencing guideline changes and enhancements for acts of violence during drug trafficking offenses. Additionally, the Act emphasizes the defendant's role in the offense. The Drug Sentencing Reform Act of 2001 aims to reduce sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine through various provisions such as increasing sentences for leadership roles in drug offenses, limiting sentences for defendants with lesser roles, and implementing a pilot program for elderly, nonviolent prisoners. Amendment of the Controlled Substances Act to adjust mandatory minimums for cocaine possession: decreasing the amount of powder cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 5 to 4 kilograms and increasing the amount of crack cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 50 to 200 grams. Amendment of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to adjust mandatory minimums for cocaine possession: decreasing the amount of powder cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 5 to 4 kilograms and increasing the amount of crack cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 50 to 200 grams. The amendment adjusts mandatory minimums for cocaine possession by decreasing the amount of powder cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 500 to 400 grams and increasing the amount of crack cocaine triggering mandatory minimums from 5 to 20 grams. Additionally, the penalty for possession is reduced from 5 years to 1 year. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure consistency in offense levels for powder cocaine and crack cocaine quantities. They will also add a penalty increase of 2 to 8 levels for defendants who use violence during a drug trafficking offense. Increased emphasis on defendant's role in offense with a focus on leadership in drug offenses. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to increase levels for defendants involved in drug trafficking as organizers or with super-aggravating factors. The defendant's involvement in drug trafficking can lead to increased sentencing levels if they meet certain criteria, such as maintaining an establishment for manufacturing or distributing controlled substances, distributing to vulnerable individuals, or bribing law enforcement officials. The defendant's involvement in drug trafficking can result in increased sentencing levels if they are connected to importing controlled substances into the United States or if the offense is part of a criminal pattern engaged in as a livelihood. SEC. 202. LIMIT ON SENTENCE WHEN DEFENDANT HAS LESSER ROLE IN THE OFFENSE. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that the base offense level for defendants with minimal roles in drug offenses does not exceed level 32. Additionally, a 2-level reduction may apply for defendants with minimal roles who had little knowledge of the illegal activity, received minimal compensation, and acted impulsively or under duress. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"crime of violence,\" \"designated facility,\" \"Director,\" and \"eligible prisoner,\" which includes criteria such as age and length of imprisonment for participation in a pilot program. The term \"home detention\" in the Federal Sentencing guidelines refers to a program where eligible prisoners can serve half of their term of imprisonment at home, provided they meet certain criteria such as no prior convictions for violent crimes, no history of violence, no escape attempts, and no infractions involving violence as determined by the Bureau of Prisons. The term \"pilot program\" refers to a program established by the Director for designated facilities to place prisoners under home detention or in long-term care facilities. The term \"term of imprisonment\" includes multiple terms ordered to run consecutively or concurrently, treated as a single aggregate term for this section. The Director will place eligible prisoners on home detention until their sentence expires. Prisoners determined eligible before 90 days after enactment must be placed within 180 days, while those determined after that time frame but before 3 years and 91 days after enactment must also be placed on home detention. The Director will place eligible prisoners on home detention until their sentence expires. Violating the terms of home detention will result in the prisoner being returned to custody. An independent organization will monitor and evaluate the progress of released prisoners under the pilot program for a 3-year period, submitting annual reports to the Director and Congress. The pilot program will be evaluated for its effectiveness in transitioning eligible prisoners from incarceration to the community, including recidivism rates. It will also assess cost savings to the Federal Government from early prisoner release. SEC. 204. EMERGENCY AMENDMENT AUTHORITY; EFFECTIVE DATE. The United States Sentencing Commission has emergency amendment authority to make necessary changes to sentencing guidelines for consistency with other provisions and laws. Amendments must be promptly promulgated. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, with no retroactive application except for section 203."
