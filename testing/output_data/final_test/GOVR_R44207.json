    "content": "The Department of Labor proposed a rule in 2015 to expand the definition of investment advice within pension plans and IRAs, holding individuals to a higher fiduciary standard. This may increase the number of individuals held to this standard, requiring them to act in the best interests of plan participants. Workers can also prepare for retirement through tax-advantaged methods like employer-sponsored pension plans. A pension plan can be sponsored by employers or established by workers through IRAs for retirement income. It can be a single employer plan or a multiemployer plan, with the latter being operated under a collective bargaining agreement involving multiple employers and unions. Participants in employer-sponsored pension plans can earn pension benefits based on defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans. In DB plans, participants receive monthly payments in retirement calculated using a formula. Single-employer plans use a different formula than multiemployer plans. Payments are typically based on length of service, accrual rate, and final salary. In collectively bargained plans, payments are calculated based on service length multiplied by a dollar amount, providing lifetime payments after retirement. The pension plan provides lifetime payments for retired workers. Participants in DB plans may receive a lump-sum benefit or joint-and-survivor annuity. Private-sector DB plans are funded by employer contributions, with some workers required to contribute. Assets in private-sector DB plans totaled $3.1 trillion in 2014. DC plan participants contribute a percentage of their wages, with employers possibly matching contributions. DC plans, such as 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) plans, do not guarantee lifetime income unless an annuity is purchased. The Federal Reserve reported $5.4 trillion in assets in private-sector DC pension plans in 2014. IRAs are tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings, with traditional IRAs offering tax-deductible contributions and taxable distributions, while Roth IRAs have tax-free distributions. Individuals under 70\u00bd with earnings can establish and contribute to an IRA. Individuals can rollover their lump-sum payment from a DB plan or DC plan assets to an IRA or another employer-sponsored DC plan. The Federal Reserve reported $7.4 trillion in assets in IRAs at the end of 2014. Participants in DC pension plans and IRAs have various investment options like mutual funds, company stock, and variable annuities. Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC under the Investment Company Act. An annuity is an insurance product where an investor receives regular payments for life, either through a one-time purchase or series of payments. Fixed annuities provide a set payment, while variable annuities' payments fluctuate based on chosen investments. Annuities are regulated by states, with variable annuities also under SEC regulation. Variable annuities, like investment products, are subject to SEC regulation. Brokers buy and sell securities for others, while dealers trade securities for themselves. Broker-dealers often perform both roles. Registered investment advisers provide advice on financial securities and are regulated by the SEC. Advisers are regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to protect pension plan participants and beneficiaries. ERISA sets standards for pension plans regarding plan participation, vesting requirements, plan funding, and fiduciary duties. The fiduciary duty requires individuals overseeing pension plans to operate them with certain standards of conduct. ERISA, enacted in 1974, ensures private-sector pension plans are managed prudently for participants' sole benefit. It established the PBGC to insure DB pension plans. IRAs, authorized by ERISA, are governed by the IRC, overseen by the DOL and Treasury. DOL focuses on protecting pension plan participants, while the IRS manages contributions and taxes. The Treasury oversees most issues regarding IRAs, but certain issues regarding prohibited transactions are under the authority of the Secretary of Labor. ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from dealing with plan assets for their own interests, representing parties with conflicting interests, or receiving personal consideration from plan transactions. DOL can issue exemptions for prohibited transactions. The Department of Labor (DOL) can issue exemptions for prohibited transactions under ERISA, allowing individuals or groups to engage in transactions that would otherwise violate the law. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates various aspects of investing in financial securities, while registered investment advisers must act in their clients' best interest. Securities brokers and dealers are not covered by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 if their advice is incidental to transactions and they do not receive a fee for it. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) oversees brokers and dealers who receive commissions. The SEC conducted a study on the regulatory environment for securities recommendations to retail customers, considering changes to fiduciary duty exemptions for brokers and dealers. The SEC conducted a study on the regulatory environment for securities recommendations to retail customers, considering changes to fiduciary duty exemptions for brokers and dealers. The study recommended subjecting brokers and dealers to a uniform fiduciary standard no less stringent than that of investment advisers. Financial services professionals may face conflicts of interest due to their compensation structure when assisting individuals with retirement plan decisions. Financial services professionals may face conflicts of interest based on their compensation structures when providing retirement plan advice. Some professionals have fixed compensation, reducing potential conflicts. Different standards apply to individuals based on their role in transactions within a pension plan, with investment advisors held to a higher fiduciary standard than those acting on a plan participant's direction. ERISA Section 3(21)(A) outlines these standards. ERISA Section 3(21)(A) defines fiduciary duties for individuals involved in managing retirement plans, including the duty of loyalty, prudence, diversification, and following plan documents. Fiduciaries must act in the best interest of participants and beneficiaries. Other individuals without fiduciary duties under ERISA may have lower standards of duty. Individuals who do not have fiduciary duties under ERISA may be held to other standards of conduct, such as brokers and dealers who must adhere to a suitability standard when making recommendations on securities. Routine service providers to a plan may not be under any standard, and settlor functions related to plan formation are considered business decisions not governed by ERISA. The Department of Labor (DOL) established three situations for qualifying as a fiduciary, with the second situation involving providing investment advice for a fee. In 1975, DOL issued regulations creating a five-part test to determine if an individual is a fiduciary under ERISA, based on regular, individualized advice that serves as a primary basis for investment decisions. The Department of Labor proposed an update to the fiduciary regulation in 2010, which generated controversy and received numerous public comments. After a public hearing in 2011, the DOL announced plans to repropose the rule in 2012. The Department of Labor proposed an update to the fiduciary regulation in 2010, generating controversy and public comments. In early 2012, plans were announced to repropose the rule. On February 23, 2015, DOL forwarded the reproposed rule to OMB for review. President Obama called for updating rules for retirement advisers to prioritize clients' best interests. The reproposed rule was published in the Federal Register on April 20, 2015, with a comment period ending on July 21, 2015. DOL held a public hearing in August 2015, with comments accepted until September 24, 2015. DOL will review comments and may publish a final rule. The Department of Labor proposed a new fiduciary rule in 2015, with a comment period ending on September 24, 2015. The proposed rule would be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, with requirements becoming applicable 8 months after. It replaces the five-part test with language defining fiduciary investment advice activities and communications for a fee. The Department of Labor proposed a new fiduciary rule in 2015, replacing the five-part test with language defining fiduciary investment advice activities and communications for a fee. The rule includes recommendations for investment of securities or property from a plan or IRA, management of securities or property, appraisal of value connected to a specific transaction, and recommendations for investment advisors. Excluded activities are recommendations to plans with 100+ participants or $100 million+ in assets, selection and monitoring assistance meeting objective criteria, and marketing by platform providers. The proposal outlines marketing practices by platform providers, appraisals for ESOPs, and investment education for retirement plans. It exempts certain individuals from the fiduciary standard, prohibits specified transactions likely to harm pension plans, and bars certain transactions between a plan and a party of interest. The Department of Labor's proposed best interest contract (BIC) exemption allows certain broker-dealers and plan fiduciaries to receive compensation that would otherwise be prohibited under ERISA. The exemption requires compliance with conditions such as acknowledging fiduciary status in a contract and adhering to impartial conduct standards. The financial institution must adhere to impartial conduct standards, act in the best interest of the retirement investor, and disclose information on compensation, conflicts of interest, and costs of investments. Annual disclosures must be provided to retirement investors, and a web page describing compensation types must be maintained by the institution. The financial institution must update its web page at least four times a year and notify DOL of its intent to rely on the exemption. DOL may request records of compliance. The proposed fiduciary rule has sparked controversy over the Obama Administration's rationale, impact on small businesses and investors, and calls to wait for the SEC's rule on fiduciary standards for brokers and dealers. The Obama Administration cites the need to update the definition of investment advice for various reasons. The Department of Labor (DOL) argues for updating the definition of investment advice due to changes in retirement preparation, concerns about conflicted financial advice costs, and issues with rollovers from DC plans to IRAs. Participation in DB pension plans has decreased while participation in DC plans has increased since the 1970s. Participants in DC plans have more decisions to make than those in DB plans, including contribution amounts, investment allocations, rollovers, and withdrawals. The Obama Administration's rationale for updating the investment advice rule is based on a report estimating that conflicted advice costs IRA investors about $17 billion per year due to lower investment returns and higher fees. The CEA analysis criticized for flawed conclusions and lack of quantifying benefits brokers provide under current regulations. RIA supports proposal citing conflicts of interest in retirement plan market not addressed by current regulations. GAO report highlights confusion among plan sponsors on advisers' fiduciary standards. The DOL faces enforcement challenges due to conflicts of interest in retirement plan options offered by platform providers. Advisers may not be considered fiduciaries in certain situations, such as when providing recommendations for one-time events like purchasing annuity contracts for DB plan participants. IRA investors are at risk of conflicts of interest even within the current regulatory framework. The RIA found that IRA investors could benefit from the proposal, with estimated gains of $40-44 billion over 10 years. Compliance costs were projected to be $2.7-5.7 billion over the same period. Concerns were raised about the impact on investors with smaller account balances, but the RIA concluded that there would be little effect on their ability to receive advice. Some stakeholders questioned the evidence in the RIA, with the Investment Company Institute challenging the conclusion on mutual fund performance. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) challenged the RIA's conclusion on mutual fund performance, arguing that societal harms like loss of investment advice were not considered. Concerns were raised by the Obama Administration and policymakers about rollovers from DC plans to IRAs, with the SEC prioritizing examination of sales practices targeting retirement-aged workers. ICI highlighted the significant amount of funds transferred from employer-sponsored plans to IRAs, with 87% of traditional IRAs opened through rollovers in 2012 and $288 billion transferred in 2010. In 2010, $288 billion was transferred from employer-sponsored pension plans to IRAs. A Government Accountability Office report in March 2013 found that individuals may not receive best interest recommendations when rolling over their 401(k) to IRAs due to confusion, lack of employer assistance, and misleading marketing by financial institutions. Factors to consider include lower fees in 401(k) plans and a greater variety of investment options in IRAs. In December 2013, FINRA issued guidance on IRA rollovers adhering to the suitability standard, while DOL proposed a rule in 2005 regarding rollovers from 401(k) accounts to IRAs. This rule would consider rollover recommendations as investment advice subject to the proposed rule. Some stakeholders have varying views on the proposed rule regarding rollover recommendations being considered investment advice. Financial services professionals support a best interest standard for operating in the best interest of their clients. Many in the industry already adhere to this standard. Some financial services professionals support a best interest fiduciary standard for their clients, but have concerns about the proposed rule due to potential challenges in implementation. Large firms believe the rule could be \"unworkable\" and restrict their ability to provide necessary investment assistance. The rule may also prohibit certain marketing communications that currently exist, affecting how financial advisers can recommend investment options. The BIC exemption under the proposed rule requires fiduciary advisers to enter into a written contract with investors, disclose investment costs, compensation arrangements, and maintain records for analysis by DOL. Some industry professionals find the disclosure requirements unworkable and conflicting with existing regulations. The proposed rule requires fiduciary advisers to disclose investment costs and compensation arrangements, but industry professionals find the requirements unworkable. Small businesses are not exempt from fiduciary status, and advisers to small plans would not be able to take advantage of the BIC exemption. They would generally be required to provide their services for a level fee. Some advisers may exit the market due to new regulations requiring fiduciaries to provide services for a level fee. Financial institutions may be unwilling to advise small pension plans not exempt from fiduciary status. Consumer advocacy groups support the DOL proposal. Consumer advocacy groups, including the Consumer Federation of America and AARP, strongly support the DOL proposal. The AFL-CIO urged DOL to act quickly. Some Members of Congress and financial services companies suggest better coordination between the SEC and DOL for a uniform fiduciary standard. DOL addressed concerns about waiting for the SEC, noting different standards under ERISA and the Investment Advisors Act. Congress provided higher standards under ERISA due to the importance of retirement plans and IRAs. The SEC chair aims to implement a fiduciary rule for securities brokers and dealers, but no timeline has been set. Chair Mary Jo White proposed a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers, facing criticism from some SEC commissioners. She has tasked staff to develop rulemaking recommendations, but challenges remain in defining the fiduciary standard and providing clear guidance. The SEC chair proposed a uniform fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers, facing criticism from some SEC commissioners. Chair Mary Jo White aims to implement a fiduciary rule but challenges remain in defining the standard and providing clear guidance. Republican SEC Commissioners criticized the goal of a uniform fiduciary standard, citing budget constraints and inadequate supervision of investment advisers. The fiduciary policy discourse involves debate over whether the DOL or SEC should lead in setting new standards for broker-dealers. Industry officials argue for the SEC due to its technical expertise, with SIFMA's Kenneth Bentsen and FINRA's Richard Ketchum supporting this stance. FINRA believes the SEC is best suited to implement a new industry-wide fiduciary care standard. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt suggests the DOL fiduciary rule should be the standard. Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets argues for the SEC and DOL to set fiduciary rules at their own paces. Mr. Kelleher emphasized the importance of agencies acting on their separate mandates, with the DOL making progress in protecting retirement savings and the SEC lagging behind in developing a fiduciary standard. SEC Chair Mary Jo White mentioned the agency's work on a uniform fiduciary rule for brokers during a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Financial Services. Chair White noted that the SEC's uniform fiduciary rule for brokers and advisors may not be identical to the DOL's forthcoming fiduciary rule, emphasizing the importance of coordination between the two agencies. Crafting the SEC rule is a complex process, with discussions ongoing among commissioners. The DOL published its proposed rule on April 20, 2015, with an extended comment period. The DOL published a proposed fiduciary rule on April 20, 2015, with an extended comment period. A public hearing was held from August 10 to August 13, 2015, with an additional comment period until September 24, 2015. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to prevent or delay the implementation of the fiduciary rule. H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act, would require coordination between the DOL and SEC before issuing a fiduciary rule. The proposed fiduciary rule from the Department of Labor is criticized for potentially harming low- and moderate-income Americans seeking retirement advice. Representative Ann Wagner argues that the rule expands the definition of a fiduciary under ERISA without considering existing regulations. The bill aims to delay the rule's implementation and suggests the SEC should regulate this space first. The bill, H.R. 1090, has garnered support from various stakeholders but also faced criticism for potentially hindering the Department of Labor's fiduciary rulemaking. Two similar bills, H.R. 4293 and H.R. 4294, have been introduced in the House to define investment advice and establish a best interest PTE. These bills have companion legislation in the Senate. H.R. 4293 and H.R. 4294, along with companion Senate bills, aim to define investment advice and establish a best interest PTE. The bills would provide an exemption for recommendations that are in the best interest of the investor, with specific conditions to be met. The proposed bills aim to define investment advice and establish a best interest PTE, providing an exemption for recommendations that are in the best interest of the investor under specified conditions. Investment advice includes recommendations to buy, hold, or sell plan investments, manage plan assets, or appoint a person to manage plan assets. The advice must be provided with a written acknowledgement or mutual agreement that it is individualized and intended to be relied upon. The bills propose defining investment advice and establishing a best interest PTE with carve-outs for certain recommendations. These carve-outs include disclosures for sales or marketing, swaps transactions, plan sponsor employees without extra compensation, platform providers, valuation information, and financial education. The bills propose defining financial education as information on factors for distribution decisions and rollovers. Individuals can provide investment advice under a best interest recommendation, exempt from fiduciary standard if adhered to. Best interest standard includes reasonable compensation, prudent recommendations based on recipient's age and disclosed factors, and prioritizing recipient's interests. The best interest recommendation for providing investment advice includes disclosing fees and compensation received directly from the advice recipient and third parties. This disclosure must include information on indirect fees and the availability of similar investments at different costs from other sources. The bill allows individuals to request specific amounts of indirect compensation received in connection with transactions and correct errors in disclosing variable compensation. It would take effect 61 days after enactment and apply to information or recommendations made two years after enactment. The bill prohibits DOL from amending investment advice rules under ERISA or 26 U.S.C. and requires approval of regulations within 60 days of enactment. The bills H.R. 4293 and H.R. 4294 contain provisions that grandfather existing transactions, with H.R. 4294 adding special rules for prohibited transactions related to investment advice. The penalty for engaging in a prohibited transaction is an excise tax, which can be up to 100% if not corrected. H.R. 4294 also defines \"correction\" as the payment or reimbursement of actual amounts. The bill H.R. 4294 defines \"correction\" as payment for damages due to investment advice and provides a prohibited transaction exemption for certain fee arrangements. Investment advisors must disclose fees, potential cost differences, and correct any omissions in good faith. The bill H.R. 3020 and S. 1695, introduced in 2015, aimed to prohibit the Department of Labor from enforcing the proposed fiduciary regulation. P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, did not address this regulation. H.R. 3922, the Retirement Choice Protection Act of 2015, sought to transfer IRA regulation authority to the Department of the Treasury and establish a best interest standard for fiduciaries providing investment advice."
