    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bioterrorism Awareness Act\" and includes a section on a Bioterrorism website. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award a grant to create and maintain a government website with information about bioterrorism. The purpose is to provide accurate information to the public and targeted populations. The grant will last for 3 years, with a possibility of a 2-year extension. The selected entity must have a successful track record. The Director will select an entity with experience in bioterrorism research, website development, and working with Federal agencies. The entity awarded the grant must create the website within 180 days. Approval from the Director is required before placing information on the website, with consultation from various government agencies. The website mentioned in the previous section will provide scientifically-based information on bioterrorism, including definitions, consequences, recognizing symptoms, public preparation, talking to children and students about bioterrorism. It will be overseen by various Federal agencies with jurisdiction over bioterrorism. The website will also cover topics such as bioterrorism, chemical warfare, vaccines for terrorist agents, and other relevant information approved by the Director. Specific sections will be tailored for health care and public health professionals. The website on bioterrorism will cater to various groups including health care professionals, public health professionals, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, veterinarians, individuals in business and industry, children, parents, teachers, farmers, and others involved in the food supply chain. It will contain links to state and local agencies and use funds to create and maintain the website, gather essential information on bioterrorism, and consult with experts in the field. The website on bioterrorism will provide updated information, consult with experts, develop links to state and local agencies, implement a marketing strategy for public awareness, and offer information for sale in alternative forms. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for subsequent years."
