Congress finds that there are approximately 1,382,000 members in the seven reserve components of the Armed Forces. During fiscal year 1998, these members performed 13,000,000 person-days of military duty, double the level from 1994. Reserve component members are being called upon for more overseas missions and for longer periods of time than ever before in peacetime. During 1994-1999, reserve component personnel served in Haiti, Bosnia, and Iraq, with significant numbers in each country. In Bosnia, up to 33% of Armed Forces personnel were reserve component members. In Iraq, 9,752 reserve component personnel served during October 1997. During 1997-1999, reserve component personnel served in Iraq and Kosovo, constituting a percentage of Armed Forces personnel in Operation Northern and Southern Watch, and Operation Allied Force. Recent reports highlight the importance of reserve components in the Total Force according to the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review in 1997. The National Defense Panel in 1997 emphasized the need for full integration of reserve components with active duty forces, particularly urging the Army to rely more on its reserves to alleviate pressure on the active Army. The Reserve Component Employment 20005 Study in 1999 acknowledged progress in ensuring equity for reserve forces. The study found disparities in benefit packages for reserve component personnel despite progress in equity. Secretary of Defense Cohen prioritized \"quality of life\" issues for all servicemembers. Enhancements in military benefits are needed for reserve component members with increased overseas assignments. This includes extending eligibility for \"Space-A\" travel on military aircraft. The curr_chunk discusses provisions for reserve component members, including travel outside the US, billeting for training, raising retirement points, and extending legal services. Provisions for reserve component members include travel outside the US on military aircraft. Provisions for reserve component members include space-required and space-available travel for duty stations OCONUS. This includes annual training duty, inactive-duty training, and travel for Selected Reserve, reserve retirees under age 60, and their dependents. Retirees under age 60 and dependents are eligible for space-available travel on Department of Defense aircraft under the same terms as armed forces members entitled to retired pay. Eligibility includes Selected Reserve members in good standing and reserve component members under age 60 who would be eligible for retired pay if not for their age. Dependents of eligible individuals can receive transportation on the same basis as dependents of retired armed forces members. Reserve component personnel using space-available transportation are not required to present specific forms, only military identification and duty orders if requested. SEC. 4. BILLETING SERVICES FOR RESERVE MEMBERS TRAVELING FOR INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING. Regulations for space-available travel for Selected Reserve and reserve retirees under age 60, along with their dependents, must be prescribed within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations allowing Reserves traveling over 50 miles for inactive duty training to be eligible for billeting in Department of Defense facilities, similar to active duty members traveling under orders. Proof of reason for travel must be established. The Secretary of Defense will allow Reserves traveling over 50 miles for inactive duty training to seek billeting in Department of Defense facilities, similar to active duty members. Proof of reason for travel must be provided. The Secretary of Defense will allow Reserves traveling over 50 miles for inactive duty training to seek billeting in Department of Defense facilities, similar to active duty members, effective 180 days after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, there is an increase in the maximum number of reserve retirement points that may be credited in any year. Section 12733(3) of title 10, United States Code is amended to limit the number of days Reserve Component members can serve each year. Additionally, the provision of legal services to Reserve Component members after release from active duty is authorized. Members of a reserve component not covered by paragraph (1) or (2) are eligible for legal services after a release from active duty under a call or order to active duty for more than 29 days. Regulations to implement these amendments must be prescribed within 180 days of the enactment of this Act."
