The Act, known as the \"Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act\" or the \"TREAT Act,\" acknowledges the significant increase in opioid overdoses in the United States. Deaths from drug overdose, particularly from prescription pain relievers, have risen sharply over the past decade. Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that burdens the healthcare system, leading to numerous emergency room visits each year. Effective medication-assisted treatment can reduce overdose deaths, be cost-effective, and mitigate social harms like criminal activity. Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction should include medications, cognitive and behavioral supports, interventions, and drug testing. These programs may use a team of staff members to deliver comprehensive care. Access to medication-assisted treatments, such as office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment, is limited due to practice regulations and a shortage of providers. Best practices for successful care have been informed by over 10 years of experience with office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment in the United States. SEC. 3.
