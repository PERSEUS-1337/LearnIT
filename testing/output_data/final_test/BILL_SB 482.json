    "title": "SB 482",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Health and Safety Code is amended to maintain the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) for monitoring and accessing information on prescribing and dispensing controlled substances by practitioners. The Department of Justice can use grant funds for operating and maintaining CURES, with annual reporting to the Legislature. CURES must adhere to privacy and security laws. CURES operates under existing provisions of law to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality. Data can be shared with appropriate agencies for disciplinary, civil, or criminal purposes, and for educational purposes with approval. Patient information must not be compromised, and data cannot be disclosed to third parties without authorization under privacy laws. The Department of Justice establishes policies for managing information in CURES in compliance with privacy laws. A regulatory board without licensees prescribing controlled substances cannot access CURES data. Health care practitioners can provide patients with their CURES patient activity report, following privacy laws. The dispensing pharmacy must report specific information to the Department of Justice within seven days of dispensing a Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance, including the full name, address, contact information, gender, and date of birth of the ultimate user or research subject. The dispensing pharmacy must report information such as prescriber details, pharmacy information, drug details, quantity dispensed, diagnosis code, refill information, prescription origin and dispensing dates for controlled substances within seven days. The Department of Justice may seek input from stakeholders to establish rules for the proper administration of the CURES database. Prescribers and dispensers invited must be licensed in California, actively practicing, and regular users of CURES. The Department of Justice consults with prescribers and stakeholders to improve the CURES Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. They may also provide education on accessing and using the program. Section 11165.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 11165.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require health care practitioners to submit an application to access online information on a patient's controlled substance history stored by the Department of Justice. A pharmacist must submit an application to access a patient's controlled substance history online, maintained by the Department of Justice. The application can be denied or suspended for reasons like falsifying information, failure to control access to patient reports, or having a suspended DEA registration. Authorized subscribers must notify the Department of Justice of any changes to their account within 30 days. Healthcare practitioners and pharmacists can access the CURES database if approved through the process outlined in the Business and Professions Code. The Department of Justice guidelines govern requests for controlled substance history. To prevent misuse, practitioners and pharmacists may receive a patient's dispensing history from CURES. This information is protected under the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. The CURES database provides controlled substance history to prescribers and pharmacists, including specific types of prescriptions. Health care practitioners and pharmacists are protected from liability for submitting or relying on information in the database. Section 11165.4 is added to the Health and Safety Code. Health care practitioners must consult the CURES database before prescribing certain controlled substances to a patient for the first time and every four months thereafter. Health care practitioners are required to consult the CURES database before prescribing Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances to a patient for the first time and every four months thereafter. Health care practitioners must consult the CURES database before prescribing Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substances to a patient for the first time, with exceptions for veterinarians and pharmacists. The consultation should occur no earlier than 24 hours before prescribing. If a health care practitioner prescribes a controlled substance for a patient in certain medical facilities, they must consult the CURES database beforehand. This applies to clinics, outpatient settings, health facilities, and county medical facilities. In certain medical facilities, a health care practitioner can prescribe a controlled substance for a patient for a limited supply to be used as directed. This includes emergency departments in general acute care hospitals and facilities like licensed clinics and outpatient settings. A health care practitioner can prescribe a controlled substance to a patient receiving hospice care if accessing the CURES database is not possible in a timely manner and another authorized practitioner is unavailable. The quantity of controlled substance prescribed should not exceed a nonrefillable five-day supply and no refill is allowed. A health care practitioner must document the reason for not consulting the CURES database. If the database is not operational, the practitioner should seek to correct any technological or electrical failure promptly. If the CURES database is inaccessible due to technological limitations beyond the health care practitioner's control, or if consulting the database would delay a patient's prescription and harm their medical condition, the practitioner may not consult the database. Failure to consult the CURES database may result in administrative sanctions by the state licensing board. This section does not create a private cause of action against a health care practitioner or limit their liability for negligence. It will only be effective after the CURES database is certified for statewide use by the Department of Justice. All duties required by this section are subject to state and federal privacy laws. All duties required by this section are subject to state and federal privacy laws. The provisions of this section are severable, governed by applicable state and federal privacy laws."
