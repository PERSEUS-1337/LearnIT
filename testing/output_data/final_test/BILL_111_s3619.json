    "content": "Title VI of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include a new section 616A on Large-Scale Geothermal Energy. Congress finds that the Geothermal Technologies Program and the Building Technologies Program focus on the direct use of geothermal energy and energy efficiency in buildings, including geothermal heat pumps. Geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy have potential for large-scale applications. The Geothermal Technologies Program and Building Technologies Program focus on geothermal energy and energy efficiency in buildings, including geothermal heat pumps. Geothermal energy has potential for large-scale applications, but is underrepresented in research and development. The purpose is to improve components, processes, and systems for geothermal heat pumps and increase energy efficiency in large buildings and projects. The term 'direct use of geothermal energy' refers to utilizing water between 38 to 149 degrees Celsius for heating buildings or industrial processes. A 'geothermal heat pump' exchanges heat from shallow ground or surface water to provide heating and cooling through closed or open loop systems. The Secretary will establish a program for research, development, and application of geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy, including large-scale applications. The program for geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy includes research, development, demonstration, and commercial application in areas such as ground loop efficiency improvements, installation cost reduction, and utilizing existing structures for new construction. The geothermal energy program aims to improve efficiency and reduce costs by utilizing existing structures, using wastewater for heat exchange, integrating geothermal systems with other building systems, implementing advanced geothermal systems, and utilizing hot water from mines and surface waters for heat exchange. The geothermal energy program includes heating districts, neighborhoods, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities using geothermal systems integrated with solar thermal water heating. It also involves utilizing hot water coproduced from oil and gas recovery and water sources below 150 degrees Celsius for direct use. The geothermal energy program promotes system integration of direct use with geothermal electricity production and coproduction of heat and power. The Secretary will identify and mitigate environmental impacts. Grants are available for various entities to develop geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy, with priority given to applicable proposals. The Secretary will prioritize proposals for large buildings, commercial districts, and residential communities for grants under this section. A national solicitation for applications will be conducted within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary must submit progress reports to the Senate and House committees every year. The House of Representatives technology report on geothermal energy development progress and results includes an analysis of areas described in subsection (d)(2) and relevant recommendations with plans for implementation. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2011 through 2015."
