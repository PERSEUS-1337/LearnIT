    "content": "In late February and early March 2020, the global outbreak of COVID-19 entered a new phase with community spread in many countries and U.S. states. Concerns grew over widespread transmission, leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths. On March 6, 2020, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted to provide emergency funding to address the outbreak. This report outlines the appropriations and policies in Division A of the supplemental. The term \"coronavirus\" refers to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-2019, or another coronavirus with pandemic potential. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 116-123, domestic health coronavirus preparedness and response activities were mainly supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using existing funding streams and transfer authorities. For example, on January 25, 2020, the HHS Secretary allocated $105 million from the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund for COVID-19 response activities. On February 24, 2020, the Administration requested $1.25 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 response efforts. The bill, H.R. 6074, was passed into law on March 6, 2020, providing a total of $2.5 billion for COVID-19 response efforts. Division A of P.L. 116-123, signed by the President on March 6, 2020, allocates $7.767 billion in supplemental appropriations for U.S. and global coronavirus preparedness. The funding includes $6.497 billion for HHS, $20 million for the Small Business Administration, and $1.250 billion for foreign operations activities. The focus is primarily on domestic public health response, with some funds for global health and economic assistance. Division B addresses telehealth services. Title I and III of P.L. 116-123 allocate $6.5 billion to the Department of Health Human Services for COVID-19 response activities. The funds are for domestic and international prevention, preparation, and response efforts, with some funding also supporting global health activities. FDA receives $61 million for coronavirus-related activities. Title III of P.L. 116-123 allocates $2.2 billion to CDC for coronavirus preparedness and response activities. This includes grants for states, localities, tribes, and health service providers for core public health functions like surveillance and infection control. Each grantee will receive 90% of the amount they received in FY2019. The PHEP grant for FY2019 will receive 90% of the total amount, totaling $561 million. $40 million will be allocated to tribes and tribal organizations. Grantees must submit a spend plan to the CDC within 45 days of enactment. CDC awarded almost $600 million to state and local PHEP grantees, with additional funding to Houston, Philadelphia, and the Cherokee Nation. HHS announced an additional $80 million for tribes and tribal organizations, exceeding the required allocation. Total funding to tribes and tribal organizations is estimated at $81 million. The CDC has about $265 million remaining for targeted funds, research, public health activities, and administrative functions. $300 million is allocated for global disease detection and emergency response, with an additional $300 million transferred to the CDC Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund. The funds can be used for domestic and global activities, as authorized by the Public Health Service Act. The supplemental specifies that funds appropriated to the CDC can be used for grants to improve preparedness at state and local levels. $836 million is allocated to NIAID for COVID-19 preparedness and response, supporting research and product development for medical countermeasures. $10 million is designated for worker-based training at NIEHS to reduce exposure for at-risk workers. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) provides funding for coronavirus preparedness and response, including support for medical countermeasure development and manufacturing. $3.1 billion is available for domestic and international efforts, prioritizing U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities. Title III of the bill allocates $3.1 billion for various purposes including the purchase of medical countermeasures and supplies, expanding medical surge capacity, grants for improving facilities at state and local levels, and grants for the production of medical countermeasures. The HHS Secretary is authorized to ensure affordability of products developed with the funding. $100 million is designated for grants under the Health Centers Program, and up to $2 million for oversight by the HHS Office of Inspector General. The supplemental bill provides an additional $300 million in appropriations for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF), contingent upon future actions by HHS. These funds may be used to purchase medical products, but HHS must certify to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for the funds to become available. Title III of the supplemental bill allocates additional funds for the purchase of vaccines, therapeutics, or diagnostics to address public health needs. It includes provisions for HHS to have hiring and contract flexibilities, restore prior obligations, and establish expectations for spend plans, transfers, and reporting to Congress. Title III of the supplemental bill directs HHS to reverse actions related to coronavirus preparedness and response, restore transferred funds, and reimburse entities for costs incurred between January 20, 2020, and the date of enactment. HHS must provide a spend plan to Congress within 30 days and adhere to reporting and notification requirements. The spend plan must address anticipated uses of all funds made available to HHS in the supplemental and be updated every 60 days until September 30, 2024. HHS must notify Congress 10 days in advance of any transfers between CDC, NIH, and PHSSEF accounts. HHS may transfer funds to specified agencies for coronavirus response. Notification is required before entering into contracts for personal services. The HHS Secretary must provide reports every 14 days to Congress regarding the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF) after making certain determinations. Funds from the IDRRRF were allotted for COVID-19 on January 25, 2020, after a Public Health Emergency declaration. The Secretary declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency on January 27, 2020. Title II of P.L. 116-123 provides $20 million to the Small Business Administration for administrative expenses related to the SBA Disaster Loan Program. The amendment clarifies that SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans can be made available for the coronavirus outbreak. The SBA EIDL loan funding for the coronavirus outbreak is supported by $1.2 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy, with $1 billion available for anticipated defaults and related expenses. The Disaster Loan Account is a \"no-year\" account, allowing funding to carry over to the next fiscal year. This funding may be a concern if EIDL assistance increases or if there is an uptick in disasters in 2020. The SBA EIDL loan for the coronavirus outbreak requires a request from the state governor for specific declarations under different acts. Congress may need to consider additional funding if disasters increase in 2020. Title IV of P.L. 116-123 provides $1.25 billion for SFOPS appropriations, with $264 million for the Department of State and $971 million for USAID. $264 million is designated for the Department of State's Diplomatic Programs account, supporting consular operations, evacuation expenses, and emergency preparedness. $971 million is allocated across various bilateral assistance appropriations accounts. The provision of $971 million across bilateral assistance appropriations accounts includes $1 million for USAID's Office of Inspector General for oversight of COVID-19 programming and $435 million for Global Health Programs to prioritize interventions in developing countries affected by COVID-19. The USAID funding of $971 million includes $200 million transferred to the Emergency Reserve Fund to address COVID-19 in high-priority countries. The USAID funding of $971 million includes $300 million for coronavirus response efforts through the International Disaster Assistance account and $250 million for addressing coronavirus-related economic, security, and stabilization requirements through the Economic Support Fund. The Emergency Reserve Fund was established to support pandemic prevention, preparedness, and control. The P.L. 116-123 focuses on guiding development activities to align with U.S. political and strategic goals. It grants transfer authorities to USAID for COVID-19 response across various funds. The act mandates a joint strategy from the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator within 15 days of enactment to address the global coronavirus situation. Reporting requirements are also specified for appropriations accounts. The act mandates additional reporting for the supplemental funds, requiring a report detailing their use to be submitted every 30 days by the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator. This reporting structure is consistent with past SFOPS supplemental appropriations measures. Supplemental funds can be used to reimburse prior obligations in certain accounts. The act mandates additional reporting for supplemental funds used by the Department of State and USAID for activities related to coronavirus. Certain limitations apply to funds used for obligations previously incurred by ESF."
