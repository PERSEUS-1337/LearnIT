    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Jesse Gray Housing Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Congress finds that the number of rental dwelling units for lower income families is insufficient, with many units in poor condition. New construction is mainly in higher income areas, and current Federal housing assistance programs often benefit middle and higher income families instead of meeting the demand for lower income families. These programs are not cost-effective due to a lack of suitable units, and many families are paying more than 25% of their income on rent. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all families in the United States have access to rental units at rents not exceeding 25 percent of their monthly income. It aims to benefit lower income families with Federal housing assistance and promote the establishment of a public housing system in various areas. The Act aims to provide low-density public housing units that are visually similar to private units, revitalize the housing construction industry, and address discriminatory practices in construction unions. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to include a program for constructing 500,000 new public housing units annually from 1994 to 2003. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Additionally, there is a provision for the revitalization of public housing. Section 14(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to provide financial assistance for public housing projects at risk of demolition or disposition. The Secretary will prioritize public housing agencies requesting assistance for such projects. The budget authority for contracts for annual contributions is increased each year starting in 1993. The budget authority for contracts for annual contributions is increased each year from 1993 to 2002 to revitalize 100,000 dwelling units in public housing. SEC. 5 prohibits the demolition and disposition of public housing, amending the United States Housing Act of 1937. Section 18 is amended to remove certain subsections. SEC. 6 introduces a new section on employment in public housing construction and revitalization. In connection with public housing construction and revitalization, public housing agencies must implement a job training and employment program for residents in the area. The program gives preference to individuals living in public housing. 50% of individuals employed in public housing projects must be from the program, with 60% in skilled positions. The job training and employment program for public housing projects requires 35% of individuals employed to be from the program, with 70% in skilled positions. The Secretary will issue necessary regulations for implementation. SEC. 7. TENANT RENT CONTRIBUTIONS. Amendments are made to various housing acts to lower the income requirements for rental and cooperative housing, lower income housing, and rural housing for lower income families. The changes include reducing the percentage from 30 to 25 in different sections of the acts. Amendments to various housing acts lower income requirements for rental and cooperative housing, lower income housing, and rural housing for lower income families by reducing the percentage from 30 to 25 in different sections of the acts. The provisions and amendments in this section will be effective on October 1, 1993, and may impact benefits received by families under the Social Security Act. SEC. 8. REPORT REGARDING FEDERAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will submit a report to Congress proposing to limit Federal housing assistance to public housing to ensure funds benefit lower income families."
