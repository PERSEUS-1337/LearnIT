FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959 aimed to equalize allotments for the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians in response to a specific court case. The Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959 aimed to equalize allotments for the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians by allotting or selling tribal lands, excluding designated parcels like parcel A and parcel B. Revenues from these parcels were restricted to tribal members for equalization purposes, and all revenues were used for tribal governmental purposes from 1959 to 1984. The Director of the Sacramento Area Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs informed the regional solicitor that equalization of allotments on the Agua Caliente Reservation had been completed in 1961. In 1968, files related to the equalization program for the Agua Caliente Reservation were destroyed. Full equalization was declared in 1983, and regulations for allotment equalization were rescinded. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Band\" refers to the Agua Caliente Band, \"parcel B\" is the land in the Mineral Springs area known as \"parcel B\" in the Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959, and the \"Secretary\" is the Secretary of the Interior. The full equalization of allotments on the Agua Caliente Reservation under the Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959 is completed, leading to the expiration of entitlement to distribution of net revenues from parcel B. The Agua Caliente Equalization Act of 1959 is amended to remove a restriction on allotments, ensuring equal per capita distribution of tribal revenues to all Band members. The curr_chunk summarizes the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
