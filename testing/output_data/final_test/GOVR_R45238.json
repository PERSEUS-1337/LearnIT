    "content": "Individuals and households affected by disasters can apply for Individual Assistance (IA) from FEMA and disaster loans from the SBA. The report discusses the application processes, eligibility criteria, appeals process, and the interconnection between FEMA IA and SBA Disaster Loan Program through a computer matching agreement. The interface between SBA and FEMA systems helps identify duplication of benefits and determine loan and grant eligibility. There is overlap between the programs causing confusion, with unclear criteria for grant and loan eligibility. Questions arise about the decision-making process for granting assistance. The SBA and FEMA programs provide disaster assistance to individuals and households, often requiring assistance from both programs as well as other sources for full recovery. Homeowners, renters, and personal property owners in declared disaster areas can apply for SBA home disaster loans, which come in two categories: Personal Property Loans and Real Property Loans offering up to $40,000 for repairs or replacements. Personal Property Loans provide up to $40,000 for homeowners or renters in declared disaster areas to repair or replace personal property like furniture, appliances, clothing, and automobiles. These loans cover uninsured or underinsured items and have a maximum interest rate of 8% per annum. Borrowers start repayments five months after the loan date, with maturities of up to 30 years. Luxury items are limited to the cost of ordinary items with the same function. The Small Business Administration offers loans of up to $200,000 for uninsured or underinsured losses in declared disaster areas to repair or replace a homeowner's primary residence. The loans cannot be used for upgrades or additions unless required by building codes. Mitigation funds are limited to 20% of the disaster damage, with interest rates capped at 8% per annum. Borrowers can also borrow funds for property improvements to prevent future damage. The Small Business Administration offers loans up to $200,000 for uninsured or underinsured losses in declared disaster areas. Loans must be used to repair or replace a homeowner's primary residence, with a 30-year repayment period. FEMA's Individual Assistance programs include Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Unemployment, Legal Services, Case Management, and Individuals and Households Program. Mass Care involves sheltering, feeding, and emergency supply distribution, while Emergency Assistance includes coordinating volunteer organizations and managing community relief services. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program provides short-term counseling and support to disaster survivors. It offers coping strategies, emotional support, and connects survivors with other resources for recovery. Disaster Unemployment Assistance helps individuals unable to work due to disaster-related reasons. Disaster Legal Services and Disaster Case Management provide legal assistance and support to low-income individuals affected by disasters. The Individuals and Households Program offers Housing Assistance for temporary lodging, repairs, and replacement of destroyed residences. Housing Assistance under the Individuals and Households Program includes replacing owner-occupied residences, entering lease agreements for multifamily rental properties, home repair and construction services in certain areas, and providing temporary housing through manufactured housing units. The Stafford Act originally capped financial assistance at $25,000 per disaster but was later amended. The Stafford Act was amended to adjust the cap annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The current IA cap is $33,300 with an approximate per household award of $8,500. Households with damages exceeding $33,300 may need an SBA disaster loan. Other Needs Assistance (ONA) provides financial aid for disaster-related expenses, divided into SBA dependent and non-SBA dependent categories. Personal Property Assistance is available for essential household items, accessibility items, and specialized tools. Non-SBA dependent types of ONA may be awarded regardless of the individual's or household's SBA disaster loan status and may include transportation assistance, moving and storage assistance, funeral assistance, and medical and dental assistance for expenses caused by a major disaster. FEMA IA and the SBA Disaster Loan Program provide various types of assistance, including Child Care Assistance, Miscellaneous Items Assistance, and other forms of aid authorized by the Stafford Act and the Small Business Act. The FEMA provides a range of federal assistance in response to disasters, including Public Assistance for infrastructure repair, Hazard Mitigation grants, and Individual Assistance for individuals and households. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines the types of assistance to be provided under each presidential major disaster declaration. The FEMA provides various types of federal assistance in response to disasters, including Public Assistance for infrastructure repair, Hazard Mitigation grants, and Individual Assistance for individuals and households. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate authorizes supplementary federal assistance requested by the governor based on the severity of the damage. Major disaster declarations may not always include Individual Assistance, but trigger the SBA Disaster Loan Program. The IA designation determines the availability of disaster loans for individuals and households. The SBA Disaster Loan Program provides loans to individuals and households in counties designated as IA for major disasters. The program can also be triggered by an SBA declaration, separate from FEMA IA. Individuals and households in declared disaster areas can register for FEMA and SBA assistance after a major disaster declaration. Registration can be done online or by phone within 60 days of the declaration. Required information includes social security numbers, financial details, insurance information, and banking details for receiving assistance. Applicants for SBA disaster loans must provide detailed personal and financial information, including social security number, income, assets, and tax details. Proof of residency, employment history, and ownership of damaged property may also be required. Each agency independently assesses eligibility based on losses and assistance received. The SBA's Office of Disaster Assistance determines eligibility for disaster loans based on disaster-related losses. The SBA uses three main criteria for credit decisions: eligibility, satisfactory credit, and repayment ability. Collateral may be required for loans over certain amounts. FEMA uses four criteria for determining Individual Assistance eligibility. FEMA uses four criteria for determining Individual Assistance eligibility, including U.S. citizenship, identity verification, lack of insurance coverage, and disaster-caused needs. Household income plays a role in grant determinations, with an income test applied during the application process. Applicants above certain income thresholds may not be eligible for FEMA assistance. SBA sets minimum income levels based on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines. The formula multiplies poverty levels for different family sizes to determine eligibility for SBA Disaster Loan Program. Applicants above certain income thresholds are referred to SBA for loan consideration if they do not qualify for FEMA grant assistance. Individuals with income levels above a certain threshold may be denied FEMA grant assistance and directed to apply for an SBA disaster loan. Those who fail the income test are referred back to FEMA for possible additional grant assistance. Applicants can appeal FEMA determinations within 60 days of eligibility notification. Appeals must be in writing and signed, not accepted via email. ONA appeals must be submitted to the state, territorial, or tribal government. SBA disaster loan applicants have six months to request a reconsideration of a decline decision. Following a major disaster, homeowners and businesses may have access to various resources for recovery, including insurance payouts, government assistance, charitable donations, and federal aid. Applicants have 30 days to appeal a decline decision on their SBA disaster loan application. Recipients should be cautious of duplication of benefits, as they may be required to repay any excess amounts received from multiple sources. The Stafford Act prohibits duplication of benefits in disaster assistance, with FEMA overseeing policy and guidance. The delivery sequence of assistance is determined by FEMA regulation 44 C.F.R. \u00a7206.191, ensuring no duplication occurs within the sequence. Each organization must provide assistance without duplicating later in the sequence. According to FEMA regulations, lower agencies should not duplicate assistance provided by higher agencies in the delivery sequence. SBA and FEMA have a computer matching agreement to share real-time data on assistance. Personally identifiable information requires a Memorandum of Understanding to avoid benefit duplication. The Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) between FEMA and SBA, established under the Privacy Act of 1974, aims to prevent duplication of benefits for disaster survivors. While some suggest expanding the CMA to other agencies like HUD, concerns exist about its effectiveness outside of FEMA and SBA. Congress could investigate the use of the Computer Matching Agreement (CMA) in conjunction with other disaster assistance programs and mandate its use across federal agencies if not universally implemented. Oversight could assess the CMA's effectiveness in preventing duplication. Additionally, Congress could review the efficacy of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) in reducing duplication and consider making them a requirement for certain entities. Congress could consider making MOUs a requirement for certain types of assistance or explore other incentives to encourage entities to sign them. SBA screens applicants based on minimum income levels derived from the U.S Department of Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines. The income test table in SBA Memorandum 85-20 serves as a guide for screening applicants, but it is unclear if income levels are strict limits or if there is some discretion in the process. FEMA's income standards for disaster assistance have caused confusion among disaster survivors. While FEMA claims that income is not a factor for grant assistance, they still review household income, leading to questions about the purpose of this practice. Congress may need to intervene to clarify whether income should be considered in FEMA grant determinations. Congress may need to decide if grant determinations should be based on income for FEMA assistance. This decision could impact how income information is used as a screening tool. Additionally, Congress may consider if SBA should have discretion in determining eligibility for disaster loans, balancing uniformity with addressing special circumstances. The ability to repay disaster loans should not be solely determined by income, as other factors like assets or co-signers could be considered. Strict adherence to an income test may prevent some individuals from obtaining loans, even if they can repay through nontraditional means. Congress should evaluate if the income test is an effective screening tool for loan applicants. The income test for disaster loan eligibility includes various sources such as wages, alimony, child support, interest income, and more. There may be discrepancies in income reported to FEMA and SBA, leading to different eligibility determinations. Congress could consider requiring SBA and FEMA to publish specific criteria for determinations or put the formula into statute. Congress may consider putting the determination formula for disaster assistance benefits into statute and deciding on uniformity in the process. Relevant statutory authorities include the Stafford Act, which governs federal disaster assistance. Section 312 of the Stafford Act requires the President to establish procedures to prevent duplication of benefits for individuals, businesses, and entities receiving federal disaster assistance. This includes repayment of assistance that duplicates benefits from other sources. FEMA Regulation 44 C.F.R. 206.191 also addresses policies related to disaster assistance for individuals and households with necessary expenses and serious needs. FEMA Regulation 44 C.F.R. 206.191 aims to prevent duplication of benefits between FEMA programs, other assistance programs, and insurance benefits. It requires repayment of duplicated assistance and outlines a hierarchy to prevent fraud and abuse. Additionally, 44 C.F.R. 206.111 defines the financial ability of applicants to pay housing costs based on household income changes post-disaster. The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7636(b)(1)(A)) determines housing assistance based on pre and post-disaster income. SBA can provide disaster loans if damage is not covered by insurance. Section 18(a) prohibits duplicate benefits from other government agencies. Financial circumstances can be considered by the Regional Administrator. SBA Regulation 13 C.F.R. 123.101(c) states that applicants for SBA Disaster Loan assistance are not eligible for a home disaster loan if their damaged property can be repaired or replaced with insurance, gifts, or other compensation. FEMA and SBA provide resources for constituents in declared disaster areas. Application websites for FEMA and SBA assistance are available for those in need. Assistance for disaster relief can be accessed through FEMA and SBA, with contact numbers provided. FAQs for FEMA Individual Assistance and SBA Disaster Loan Program are available online, along with necessary forms like SBA Form 5C and IRS Form 4506-T instructions. IRS Form 4506-T and instructions in Spanish can be accessed online."
