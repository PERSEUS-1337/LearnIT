    "content": "In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Booker that federal sentencing guidelines are now advisory, not mandatory, to comply with the Sixth Amendment. Prior to this, crack cocaine offenders faced much harsher sentences compared to powder cocaine offenders. In 2007, the Supreme Court further clarified in Kimbrough v. United States that judges can impose sentences below the guidelines if they see fit. The federal court can impose a sentence below the Guidelines' ratio based on its conclusion that it is unnecessary or may cause disparity. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established a system under the federal sentencing guidelines, giving judges broad sentencing ranges tailored to individual defendants. Before Booker, judges had discretion in sentencing, but under the Guidelines, their role became more uniform. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established federal sentencing guidelines, giving judges broad ranges for sentencing based on individual factors. Crack cocaine's notoriety led to the quick passage of a federal sentencing law in 1986, creating mandatory sentencing for crack cocaine offenses. The 1986 legislation created mandatory sentencing ranges for crack cocaine offenses, with widely disparate threshold quantities compared to powdered cocaine. Congress cited crack's perceived higher addictiveness and potential for violent crimes as reasons for the disparity. The Sentencing Commission acknowledged the disparity in drug sentences, particularly the 100:1 powder to crack ratio, which led to sentences greater than necessary. Congress enacted a safety valve provision in 1994 to lower mandatory minimum sentences and address racial disparity in drug sentencing. In 1994, Congress enacted a safety valve provision to lower mandatory minimum sentences and address racial disparity in drug sentencing. The Sentencing Commission recommended revising the 100:1 crack-to-powder ratio in 1995, finding it unjustified. Despite recommendations to reduce the ratio to 5:1, Congress did not amend the law. In 2001, the Sentencing Commission recommended narrowing the gap between crack and powder cocaine offenses due to disproportionate penalties falling on low-level criminals and African Americans. They suggested addressing crack dangers through sentencing enhancements for all drug offenses and eliminating the 5-year mandatory minimum for simple offenses. The Sentencing Commission recommended narrowing the gap between crack and powder cocaine offenses by eliminating the 5-year mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine. Congress did not act on the Commission's 2002 report. Judges criticized mandatory minimum sentences enacted in 1986 to combat the drug trade. Before the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, case law upheld the 100:1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine sentencing disparities. In the case of United States v. Booker, the Supreme Court considered the sentencing of crack cocaine offenders. Booker was found guilty of possessing and distributing crack cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's criticism of the 100:1 ratio was not considered a valid basis for leniency in sentencing. The judge sentenced Booker to 360 months for distributing 566 grams of cocaine and obstructing justice. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but overturned the sentence. Fanfan was arrested with 1.25 kilograms of cocaine and 281.6 grams of cocaine base. He was found guilty of possessing \"500 or more grams\" of cocaine with intent to distribute. The court labeled him as the leader of a significant drug conspiracy. Fanfan, labeled as the leader of a significant drug conspiracy, faced a sentence of 188 to 235 months. However, due to the Blakely v. Washington decision, the sentencing judge recalculated the Guidelines and imposed a 78-month sentence based on possession of 500 grams. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Booker and Fanfan to provide guidance on the application of the Blakely decision to federal prisoners. In Booker, the Supreme Court found that federal sentencing guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment by requiring judges to increase sentences based on their own findings, thus making them unconstitutional. In Booker, the Supreme Court ruled that federal sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional as they violated the defendant's right to trial by jury. The Guidelines were mandatory, creating a statutory maximum, and judges, not juries, were required to find sentence-determining facts, which was deemed unconstitutional. In Booker, the Supreme Court declared federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional for violating the defendant's right to trial by jury. Breyer's majority opinion in a different case made the Guidelines advisory, requiring courts to consider them along with other factors when determining sentences. The court also allowed appellate review of sentences for \"reasonableness\" and removed certain provisions from the Sentencing Reform Act. District judges now only need to \"consider\" the Guideline range among other factors when sentencing. The Sentencing Reform Act allows judges to apply their own perceptions of punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public, even if different from the Sentencing Commission. Appeals from sentencing decisions can be made based on an \"unreasonableness\" standard. Federal courts have debated imposing sentences below Guidelines' ranges in crack cocaine cases post-Booker. The federal courts follow a three-step sentencing procedure to determine the appropriate sentence in light of statutory factors. While not compelled to lower sentences based on the crack cocaine sentencing disparity, the application of Booker has led to lower sentences in some cases. The federal courts follow a three-step sentencing procedure to determine the appropriate sentence in light of statutory factors. In some cases, courts found different ratio ranges more compatible with the statutory command to avoid unwarranted disparities. The appellate courts were not inclined to ignore the 100:1 ratio reflected in the Guidelines, but allowed for consideration of factors on a case-by-case basis. The disparity in sentencing associated with the 100:1 ratio has been a concern since its promulgation by Congress. The federal courts have debated the fairness of maintaining the 100:1 crack-to-powder ratio in sentencing guidelines. The First and Fourth Circuits ruled against substituting a 20:1 ratio, emphasizing the need to consider individual case factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for a reasonable non-Guideline sentence. The Fourth Circuit decision in Kimbrough v. United States emphasized the need for courts to consider individual case factors in arriving at a reasonable sentence, without relying on factors that would result in sentencing disparities. Derrick Kimbrough was arrested in Norfolk, VA, for drug trafficking and possession of a firearm during a drug offense. He pleaded guilty to federal charges and faced mandatory sentencing. Derrick Kimbrough faced mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years for crack trafficking and 5 years for possessing a firearm during a drug offense. His attorney argued for a departure from the sentencing guidelines due to dissatisfaction with the 100:1 ratio, Kimbrough's military service, lack of prior felonies, and federal involvement in what was primarily a state case. The district court deemed the guideline's recommended sentence \"ridiculous\" and imposed a lower sentence. The district court found the Guidelines-recommended sentence for Derrick Kimbrough \"ridiculous\" and instead sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 180 months in prison. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals later vacated and remanded the sentence, citing a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses. The Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the district court abused its discretion in not following the Guidelines in Kimbrough's case. The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in a 7-2 ruling regarding Derrick Kimbrough's sentence. Justice Ginsburg stated that judges have discretion to depart from the Guidelines based on the crack/powder cocaine disparity. The Court emphasized that the Guidelines are advisory only, not mandatory. The 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough was deemed reasonable. The Supreme Court found that the 180-month sentence for Kimbrough was reasonable, considering the crack/powder disparity and the sentencing objectives. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Spears emphasized that district courts cannot reject the crack-to-powder ratio set by the Guidelines. The Supreme Court later reversed the appellate court's decision, stating that judges have discretion in applying the Guidelines. The Supreme Court affirmed Kimbrough's 180-month sentence, highlighting the discretion of district courts to vary from crack cocaine Guidelines based on policy disagreement. Rejecting the 100:1 ratio implies adopting a different ratio to correct disparities in sentencing. The Supreme Court clarified its holding in Kimbrough in Spears v. United States, addressing misinterpretations by multiple Circuit Courts. The Court warned against treating crack-to-powder ratio as mandatory or masking policy disagreements as \"individualized determinations.\" This institutionalized subterfuge contradicts the Court's stance in Kimbrough and is deemed unacceptable in sentencing practices. In May 2007, the United States Sentencing Commission proposed amendments to eliminate the 100:1 ratio in sentencing guidelines for drug offenses, seeking to address problems associated with the ratio. The Commission acknowledged that the amendment was only a partial remedy and not a complete solution. In July 2007, retroactive application of the changes was proposed. The Sentencing Commission proposed amendments to eliminate the 100:1 ratio in sentencing guidelines for drug offenses in May 2007. The amendments went into effect on November 1, 2007, and on December 11, 2007, the Commission voted to apply the crack amendment retroactively. The Controlled Substances Act outlines penalties for trafficking in crack cocaine and cocaine powder based on quantity. These penalties are reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines, which assign federal crimes to specific sentencing levels. The Sentencing Guidelines assign offenses to specific sentencing levels based on factors like drug quantity. Offense levels can be adjusted for aggravating or mitigating factors in a defendant's case. Final offense level and criminal history determine the recommended sentence, with 43 possible offense levels each having six sentencing ranges based on criminal history. The Sentencing Guidelines determine sentencing levels based on factors like drug quantity. Offenses are assigned to specific steps with corresponding sentencing levels. The recommended sentence is influenced by the final offense level and criminal history, with different sentencing ranges for each offense level. Prior to the November 1, 2007 amendments, the Sentencing Guidelines had a 100:1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Offenses involving specific drug quantities were assigned offense levels, with corresponding sentencing ranges. For example, offenses triggering 5-year minimums were assigned an offense level of 26, resulting in a sentencing range of 5 to 6 years. Similarly, offenses triggering 10-year mandatory minimums were assigned an offense level of 32, with a sentencing range of 10 to 12 years. The Commission's amendments reassign crack offenses to offense levels where the mandatory minimum falls within the middle of the ranges. They provide a two-level reduction for crack offenses involving amounts above the mandatory minimums, but no changes for powder cocaine offenses. The 100:1 ratio for powder cocaine and crack cocaine offenses has been removed from the Guidelines, but the statutory ratio still applies for mandatory minimum penalties. The Commission voted in favor of retroactively applying an amendment to previously sentenced crack cocaine offenders, giving federal sentencing judges the authority to determine if a reduction in sentence is appropriate. Federal sentencing judges have the final authority to determine if a reduction in sentence is appropriate for previously sentenced offenders based on guideline amendments retroactively applicable. The court may consider factors like public safety before approving a sentence reduction. The federal court has discretion to reduce imprisonment sentences retroactively based on statutory factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature of the offense, defendant's history, and the need for punishment, deterrence, public safety, and rehabilitation. The court cannot reduce a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum. The Sentencing Commission's policy statement, outlined in Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10, governs reduction of imprisonment terms based on amended Guidelines ranges. It clarifies that proceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute a full resentencing and prohibits reducing a term below the minimum of the amended guideline range. In March 2008, after the Sentencing Commission's crack cocaine amendment retroactivity decision, over 3,000 prisoners had their sentences reduced, with 1,000 inmates released immediately. By May 2010, 15,778 motions were granted, reducing sentences by an average of 26 months (17% decrease), while 8,280 petitions were denied. Issues arose regarding legal representation, eligibility for reductions, and the possibility of reducing sentences below the amended guideline range minimum. Many \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions have been filed by defendants seeking sentence reductions, with questions arising about legal representation and the possibility of reducing sentences below the amended guideline range minimum. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals used discretionary authority to appoint an attorney for a prisoner \"in the interest of justice,\" while other federal courts have rejected the argument that prisoners have a constitutional right to counsel in pursuing sentence reductions. Many defendants sentenced as career offenders for crack cocaine offenses may not benefit from amended sentencing guidelines. Courts of appeals, like the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, have ruled that reductions in base offense levels do not authorize sentence reductions if the sentencing range remains unchanged. The issue of whether Booker applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings has also been addressed by federal courts. District courts have the authority to impose a sentence lower than the minimum of the amended Sentencing Guideline range. Ten courts of appeals have held that Booker does not apply to sentence modification proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because they are more narrow in scope. One federal appellate court reasoned that since \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings can only reduce a defendant's sentence, the constitutional holding in Booker does not apply. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Dillon v. United States to resolve a circuit split on whether Booker applies to sentence modification proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that Booker renders the Guidelines advisory in a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding, allowing a district court to reduce a sentence below the amended guideline range. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Dillon v. United States to address a circuit split on whether Booker applies to sentence modification proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2). Percy Dillon, convicted of felony offenses involving cocaine, received a reduced sentence of 270 months after amendments to the crack cocaine Guidelines were made retroactive in 2007. The Third Circuit upheld the district court's decision not to further reduce Dillon's sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) despite acknowledging his potential as a candidate for a non-Guidelines sentence. Dillon argued that Booker should apply to resentencings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in his Supreme Court briefs. The United States argued against applying Booker to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencings, stating that it only applies to plenary sentencing and not one-way reductions. They warned of the consequences of applying Booker to these proceedings, which could potentially reopen thousands of cases. The Supreme Court's decision in Dillon on June 17, 2010, ruled that Booker does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, preserving the finality of sentences and the Sentencing Commission's discretion in making Guidelines amendments retroactive. The Supreme Court's decision in Dillon in 2010 upheld the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, allowing the Sentencing Commission to revise Guidelines and determine retroactive revisions. The court's power under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is limited to modifying a term of imprisonment under specific circumstances set by the Commission. The Commission's decision to make retroactive amendments to the Guidelines was upheld in Dillon in 2010. Justice Sotomayor explained that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is a congressional act of lenity, not a constitutional requirement. The court is bound by the Commission's determination on reducing a prisoner's term. Justice Stevens dissented, arguing that Booker should apply. Justice Stevens dissented in the case, arguing that the Court should apply Booker to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. He criticized the Court for treating the Commission's policy statements as mandatory rather than advisory, and believed that all mandatory features of the Guidelines should be eliminated. Stevens expressed concern that the Court's decision may discourage the Commission from issuing retroactive amendments to the Guidelines. Justice Stevens dissented in the case, criticizing the Court for its handling of the Commission's policy statements and advocating for the elimination of all mandatory features of the Guidelines. He expressed concern about the impact of the Court's decision on retroactive amendments to the Guidelines and highlighted the need for reform in federal punishment schemes, particularly in relation to cocaine sentencing laws. Senator Richard Durbin introduced S. 1789, which aims to address these issues by increasing the threshold amounts for mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine and reducing the sentencing disparity. The bill, known as S. 1789, addresses crack cocaine sentencing issues by increasing criminal fines for major drug traffickers and directing the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend Guidelines for penalty increases related to violence in drug trafficking offenses. The bill was passed by the Senate on March 17, 2010, and by the House on July 28, 2010, before being signed into law by President Obama on August 3, 2010 (P.L. 111-220). The bill S. 1789 was signed into law on August 3, 2010, generating $42 million in savings for the federal prison system. H.R. 18 aims to equalize mandatory minimum sentences for cocaine offenses, while H.R. 265 seeks to eliminate the 100:1 ratio in cocaine cases. The Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Bobby Scott, aims to amend cocaine penalties by treating crack cocaine the same as other forms of cocaine, eliminating mandatory minimum penalties, and increasing fines for drug trafficking offenses. It also calls for a reexamination of sentencing guidelines and funding for drug treatment programs. The Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Bobby Scott, aims to treat all forms of cocaine equally for sentencing purposes, eliminate mandatory minimum penalties, and allow for probation or suspended sentences for cocaine offenders. Additionally, Representative Maxine Waters introduced the Major Drug Trafficking Prosecution Act of 2009, which would eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and provide courts with more flexibility in sentencing drug offenders. The Crack-Cocaine Equitable Sentencing Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Charles Rangel, aims to equalize sentencing for crack and powder cocaine, eliminate mandatory minimums for crack possession, and require approval from the Attorney General for federal prosecutions involving small amounts of cocaine. Past legislation has proposed different drug quantity ratios between crack and powder cocaine."
