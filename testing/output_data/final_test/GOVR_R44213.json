    "content": "The United States Constitution grants Congress the authority to discipline its Members, allowing for the determination of rules, punishment for disorderly behavior, and expulsion with a two-thirds majority. Initially, discipline was handled on a case-by-case basis, leading to inconsistent and sporadic enforcement. James Madison expressed concerns about self-discipline in the Federalist Papers. Prior to the creation of ethics committees in the 1960s, Congress relied on criminal prosecution or voter rejection to punish misconduct by Members. The lack of a formal ethics process led to following societal norms until 1957 when the first government-wide code of ethics was adopted. Madison's concerns about conflicts of interest and the need for trust in government are still relevant today. The lack of a formal ethics process in Congress led to sanctions being applied only in the most egregious cases, following societal norms of decency. Calls for reform resulted in the creation of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1967, after no ethics cases were brought to the floor between the 69th and 89th Congresses. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct was established in 1967 to investigate disciplinary cases and recommend sanctions, which are usually adopted by the House. In some cases, floor amendments or alternatives to the committee's recommendations have been proposed, with some being successful. Since 1967, the committee has recommended sanctions for Members 16 times, with 43% of cases involving attempts to alter the recommendation, and 18% of all cases resulting in successful changes. Between 1789 and 1957, the House dealt with few ethics cases as standards of behavior shifted over time. Cases included disorderly behavior like spitting or hitting on the House floor, insulting the Speaker, and taking up arms against the US. Before 1967, cases were investigated by existing committees or ad-hoc committees. The Senate began efforts to create a code of conduct in the late 1940s. In the 85th Congress (1957-1958), a general Code of Ethics was adopted. In the 85th Congress (1957-1958), a general Code of Ethics for Government Service was adopted to oversee officials and employees in all three branches of government. The code, although not legally binding, set the foundation for ethics guidance in the House and Senate. Despite this, Congress continued to rely on unwritten norms of conduct and a \"club spirit.\" Investigations in the 1960s highlighted the lack of standards for congressional conduct. In response to the perceived absence of standards for congressional conduct, the Senate created the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct in 1964, and the House established the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in 1967. The House committee has the authority to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, adjudicate misconduct, recommend penalties, and provide guidance on congressional rules and laws. The Ethics Committee oversees the Code of Official Conduct and Member financial disclosure, with membership divided equally between majority and minority to ensure noncontroversial operations. The Ethics Committee operates in a bipartisan manner to investigate and recommend sanctions for misconduct. High-profile investigations have been conducted against members of both parties. The committee follows specific rules when deciding to open an investigation. The Ethics Committee operates in a bipartisan manner to investigate and recommend sanctions for misconduct. Investigations are initiated if allegations have merit, leading to the appointment of an investigatory subcommittee. If wrongdoing is found, formal charges are sent to the full committee, which then appoints an adjudicatory subcommittee to evaluate the violations and recommend sanctions. The process ensures that facts are reviewed thoroughly before determining further actions, such as sanctioning the Member. The Ethics Committee recommends sanctions for misconduct, including expulsion, censure, reprimand, or letters of admonition. Members who leave the House end the case, as the committee has no jurisdiction over former Members. The House has the power to expel a Member by a two-thirds vote for offenses related to official conduct or being deemed unfit to participate in House decisions. Expulsion is the only punishment mentioned in the Constitution and has historically been used sparingly. Censure is a formal vote by the majority of Members disapproving a Member's conduct, derived from the Constitution's authority for punishments. It involves a verbal rebuke in the House chamber and is considered a lesser sanction than expulsion. Prior to the 1970s, reprimand and censure were considered synonymous. A reprimand is adopted by a majority vote, while a censure requires the Member to stand in the well. A Letter of Reproval, created in 1987, can be imposed by the Ethics Committee with a majority vote. A Letter of Admonition, not authorized under House rules, was sent to a Member in 2004. The House has the authority to levy fines on Members for misconduct, as outlined in the Constitution. In the past, fines have been imposed for improper use of funds and misuse of congressional resources. Resolutions recommending expulsion, censure, or reprimand are considered a question of privilege and are typically acted upon based on the Committee on Ethics' recommendation. The Ethics Committee may recommend sanctions on Members or officers, reporting to the House via a privileged resolution for immediate consideration under the \"Hour Rule.\" Under the \"Hour Rule,\" the manager in the House is recognized for one hour and can yield time for debate to other Members. The time is typically divided equally among the manager, the ranking minority Member, and the individual accused of the ethics violation. For example, during a debate on a Koreagate investigation, Representative John Flynt divided his time among other Members for debate purposes. Debate on the resolution with committee sanction recommendation follows House rules. The manager controls debate time and can yield to others for amendments. Closing speeches order is minority manager, subject of resolution, then resolution manager. After debate, a motion for the previous question ends debate for a vote on the sanction recommendation. Before the House votes on the resolution embodying the committee's recommendations, a motion to recommit is in order. The motion, typically offered by a Member from the minority, can include amendatory instructions to make changes to the sanctions recommended by the committee. Only one motion to recommit is allowed, with 10 minutes of debate permitted. If agreed to, the resolution and amendment are immediately before the House for a vote. After the House votes on the resolution embodying the committee's recommendations, a motion to recommit can be made with amendatory instructions. If the House agrees to the amendment, it replaces the original sanctions, and the final vote is on the resolution as amended. The House then takes appropriate action based on the discipline imposed. For example, a reprimand results in a recorded vote total, while a censure involves the Member standing in the House \"well.\" If a Member is expelled, the Clerk reports the expulsion to the governor of the Member's state. The Ethics Committee sanction recommendation in the House can be potentially changed through options like a motion to recommit, an amendment to the resolution, or a separate resolution with a different punishment. This process has been used successfully in the past to alter committee recommendations. The investigation found that two Members of the House had engaged in improper sexual conduct with House pages between 1973 and 1980, in violation of the House Rules and the Code of Conduct. The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct recommended the reprimand of the two Members, but the House changed the recommendation to censure through separate motions to recommit with amendatory instructions. Members debated on the severity of the punishment, with some feeling that reprimand was not enough for violating the trust of the pages' parents. In the 101st Congress, the Committee on Standards investigated a Member of Congress for hiring a prostitute as a personal employee and engaging in improper conduct. The committee recommended reprimand for bringing discredit upon the House of Representatives. A resolution recommending expulsion was debated and defeated, followed by debate on the reprimand resolution. The resolution recommending expulsion was defeated, leading to a debate on a reprimand resolution. Despite the failed expulsion efforts, some Members felt reprimand was not a sufficient punishment. A motion to amend the resolution to censure was not agreed to, and the House ultimately passed the resolution reprimanding the Member. The motion to recommit has limitations, such as the requirement for amendments to be germane under House Rule XVI, clause 7. This restricts the range of alternatives that can be considered. The motion to recommit allows the House to have a say on the severity of punishment for Members recommended by the Ethics Committee. It offers a procedural device for the House to retain final control over sanctions, regardless of the committee's position. Multiple votes are required to ensure a majority of Members support the alternative recommended by the motion. Ultimately, the House must render a decision on the punishment of Members. The House retains final control over sanctions regardless of the committee's position. One option to alter an Ethics Committee sanction recommendation is to offer an amendment to the House Ethics Committee's resolution, although this is not commonly used. In 1979, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct recommended censure for a Member who had accepted cash gifts, placed an individual on his payroll, converted campaign funds, and testified falsely. Representative Tom Foley proposed an amendment to remove the section stripping the Member of his committee chairmanship during the debate on the censure resolution. Time was yielded for the Foley amendment to be offered by the floor manager. The Democratic Caucus had a rule to remove censured committee chairs. The Foley amendment passed, and the House debated the censure resolution. A motion to lessen the sanction failed, and the House voted for censure. Offering an amendment to change Ethics Committee sanctions has pros and cons compared to a motion to recommit. To offer an amendment to change Ethics Committee sanctions, the floor manager would likely need to yield time for it. This amendment could modify a section or the entire resolution, avoiding drawbacks of a motion to recommit. To impact Ethics Committee sanctions, offering an amendment within the debate on a resolution is a strategic alternative to a motion to recommit. Unlike a motion to recommit, offering an amendment is not guaranteed under House rules and requires cooperation from the committee's floor manager. Introducing a separate resolution with desired alternative sanctions is another effective strategy. In some cases, a resolution to expel, censure, or reprimand a Member could be considered by the House under House Rule IX. Initiating consideration in this way may not always lead to a direct vote on the sanction, as it could be subject to motions like postponement, tabling, or referral to committee. For example, in the 95th Congress, a Member convicted of felony mail fraud was reelected to the 96th Congress after serving a prison sentence. After being reelected to the 96th Congress, a convicted Member faced potential expulsion for voting on a bill despite House rules advising against it. An expulsion resolution was introduced but referred to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct without further action. The Committee recommended censure after investigating the Member's actions. After negotiations, a Member admitted violating House Rules and agreed to be censured. A separate resolution was introduced but immediately tabled. The censure resolution was debated and unanimously agreed to by the House. Offering a separate resolution as an alternative to an Ethics Committee sanction recommendation has pros and cons. Introducing a separate resolution as an alternative to an Ethics Committee sanction recommendation allows for a fuller articulation of reasons but may risk being tabled or referred to committee instead of reaching a direct vote. The House of Representatives has three main methods for adjusting disciplinary decisions: motion to recommit, amending Ethics Committee sanction resolutions, and introducing a separate resolution with an alternate sanction. Only 16 ethics cases have been brought to the House floor since 1967, with attempts to alter sanction recommendations in seven cases, successful in three. The House ultimately decides on disciplinary actions for its members, with the Ethics Committee investigating and reporting recommendations. This process highlights the unique relationship between the House and ethics committee products. The unique relationship between the House of Representatives and the Ethics Committee is characterized by the committee's jurisdiction over ethics matters and its role in investigating alleged violations and recommending sanctions. Some Members may be reluctant to serve on the Ethics Committee due to the perceived lack of political advantages compared to other committee service. The Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is internal, focusing on currently serving Members of Congress, officers, and staff. Unlike policy committees, Members may be hesitant to join due to the lack of perceived political benefits. If a Member under investigation leaves office, the committee's jurisdiction ends. The Ethics Committee's jurisdiction is internal, focusing on currently serving Members of Congress, officers, and staff. Membership on the Ethics Committee does not offer the same opportunities for pursuing personal or policy goals as other committees. Members may not build true seniority or expertise in ethics-related issues due to the unrequested nature of service on the committee. The committee's narrow jurisdiction limits opportunities for cooperation with other committees to develop policies. The House Ethics Committee operates independently to consider sanction recommendations as privileged matters under the \"Hour Rule,\" avoiding direct involvement from the majority leadership in raising or considering resolutions."
