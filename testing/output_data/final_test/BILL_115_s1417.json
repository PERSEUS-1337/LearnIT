    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sage-Grouse and Mule Deer Habitat Conservation and Restoration Act of 2018\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act titled \"Sage-Grouse and Mule Deer Habitat Conservation and Restoration Act of 2018\" defines \"covered vegetation management activity\" as activities on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management that meet specific objectives and protect sage-grouse or mule deer habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Circular 1416 of the United States Geological Survey and habitat guidelines for mule deer provide concepts for understanding and applying restoration without permanently impairing the natural state of the treated area. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for identifying restoration projects in natural areas, including opportunities for solitude, primitive recreation, economic benefits, and conservation values. It also mentions the restoration of native vegetation and the prevention of habitat expansion for sage-grouse and mule deer. The curr_chunk discusses activities for restoring natural areas by removing juniper, pinyon pine, and invasive vegetation to reduce habitat loss for sage-grouse and mule deer after natural disturbances. Activities for restoring natural areas include removing juniper, pinyon pine, and invasive vegetation to reduce habitat loss for sage-grouse and mule deer. This involves various methods such as mechanical mastication, cutting, mowing, burning, chaining, and herbicide use in accordance with legal requirements. Native vegetation collection, seeding, and planting are also part of the restoration process. Activities for restoring natural areas include targeted livestock grazing to mitigate hazardous fuels and control invasive weeds, temporary removal of wild horses or burros to ensure treatment objectives are met, and modification of grazing permits to achieve restoration treatment objectives. Installation or modification of infrastructure may also be necessary. The term \"covered vegetation management activity\" includes installation or modification of fencing or water sources for wildlife habitat improvement, as well as maintenance, repairs, or reconstruction of existing roads. Exclusions are activities in wilderness areas or for permanent road or trail construction. The term \"temporary road\" refers to a road authorized by a contract, permit, or emergency operation, not intended for permanent use by a Federal department or agency, and designed with safety and cost considerations in mind. The temporary road must consider safety, cost, transportation costs, impacts on land and resources, erosion, and invasive species. SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF HABITAT FOR GREATER SAGE-GROUSE AND MULE DEER. The Secretary must develop categorical exclusions for vegetation management activities to benefit sage-grouse and mule deer habitat within a year of this Act's enactment, complying with environmental regulations. The Secretary must develop categorical exclusions for vegetation management activities to benefit sage-grouse and mule deer habitat within a year of this Act's enactment, complying with Federal Regulations. When determining the use of categorical exclusions, factors to consider include the efficacy of landscape-scale habitat projects, the likelihood of population declines in sage-grouse and mule deer without vegetation management, and the need for habitat restoration post-wildfire or natural disturbances. When implementing a covered vegetative management activity in an area with both greater sage-grouse and mule deer, the activity must improve habitat for both species. Before starting any covered vegetation management activity, a long-term monitoring and maintenance plan must be developed to ensure habitat gains are maintained for at least 20 years. Any vegetative material resulting from the activity must be disposed of according to local restrictions. Vegetation management activities covered by a categorical exclusion may involve using fuel wood or other products, or piling and burning. Temporary roads built for these activities must be used for a maximum of 2 years and decommissioned within 3 years after they are no longer needed. Reestablishing native vegetative cover must be done within 10 years of completing the project. The bill was passed by the Senate on September 6, 2018, with Julie E. Adams as the Secretary."
