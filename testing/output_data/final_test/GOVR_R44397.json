    "content": "The Administration has requested $19.025 billion for NASA in FY2017, which is 1.3% less than the FY2016 appropriation. The House bill would provide $19.508 billion, while the Senate bill would provide $19.306 billion. The FY2017 request includes $763 million in mandatory funds to accelerate progress in Science, Aeronautics, Space Technology, and Exploration. NASA's FY2017 budget request includes additional mandatory funding for Aeronautics to support research on low carbon emission aircraft. The discretionary portion of the budget request is $18.262 billion, 5.3% less than the FY2016 appropriation. The House and Senate bills do not include mandatory funding, and there is no authorized level for NASA appropriations in FY2017. The NASA Authorization Act for 2016 and 2017 includes proposed authorization amounts for FY2017, with changes in funding for different science areas. The House and Senate bills differ in funding amounts, with the House bill shifting funding from Earth Science to Planetary Science. The House bill proposes shifting funding from Earth Science to Planetary Science, with a focus on the Landsat-9 land imaging satellite. Launch is expected in 2021, with plans to prioritize Landsat-9 funding and evaluate commercial data options in case of a data gap. The Senate bill recommends the requested amount for Landsat-9 and directs NASA to provide a plan for a 2020 launch date. The request for Planetary Science includes $50 million for a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, a high priority according to the 2011 National Research Council decadal survey. Congress has consistently appropriated more funding for a Europa mission than NASA has requested. NASA's FY2017 budget justification includes a five-year estimate for funding assuming a 2022 launch, with a potential launch in the late 2020s if the mission concept remains stable. The House report recommends at least $260 million for Europa orbiter and lander missions, with the orbiter launch no later than 2022 and the lander launch no later than 2024. The Senate report calls for an expeditious launch and reduced travel time to maximize the scientific return of a Europa mission. NASA is directed to provide a report on mission options to assist in evaluating potential configurations. The FY2017 request for the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is $790 million, including the New Aviation Horizons initiative with $100 million for subsonic aircraft projects. The President's proposed 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan includes $100 million in mandatory funding. An additional $56 million would fund a low-boom supersonic flight demonstrator. The House bill provides $78 million less than the request for Aeronautics, while the Senate bill provides $189 million less. Both House and Senate committees direct NASA to work with the FAA on research for unmanned aerial systems integration. The FY2017 request for Space Technology Mission Directorate is $827 million, a 20.4% increase from FY2016. The Administration has proposed increasing Space Technology funding, with Congress providing increases each year except FY2014. Proposed mandatory funding of $136 million in FY2017 would mainly support technology demonstration missions, including the Restore-L satellite servicing mission. The House bill would allocate $88 million less than the request for Space Technology, while the Senate bill would provide the FY2016 amount. Both House and Senate committee reports prioritize nuclear propulsion research and a small launch technology demonstration platform. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) is also funded. The Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) is funded by two appropriations accounts: Exploration and Space Operations. The FY2017 request for Exploration is $3.337 billion, a decrease of 17.2% from FY2016, while the request for Space Operations is $5.076 billion, an increase of 0.9%. The House and Senate bills would both provide more than the request for Exploration and less than the request for Space Operations. The Exploration account funds development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket for future human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The FY2017 request for Exploration Systems Development, including Orion and the SLS, is $2.860 billion, a 22.3% decrease from FY2016. The SLS program is on track for a test flight in November 2018 and a crewed flight in FY2023. The House and Senate bills propose funding the SLS at or above FY2016 levels. The House and Senate reports recommend funding for the SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) which is not included in the Administration request. The House report specifies that funds are not for the Asteroid Redirect Mission. The Space Operations account primarily funds operational human spaceflight activities. Congress gave limited direction on how the FY2016 appropriation for Space Operations should be allocated, making it difficult to compare to the FY2017 request. The FY2017 budget highlights Space Transportation as a top-level item within Space Operations, combining U.S. commercial cargo flights to the ISS, payments to Russia for Soyuz flights, and the program for commercial transportation of ISS crews. The House and Senate bills propose less funding than the request for Space Operations, with the Senate report specifying $1.185 billion for Commercial Crew. The balance of funding between Exploration Systems Development and the Commercial Crew program has been contentious, with NASA arguing that the requested amounts for Commercial Crew are necessary to maintain scheduled availability of commercial crew transportation to the ISS. NASA officials stated that accelerating the schedule for the EM-1 test flight would be difficult even with additional funding due to technical requirements. The Orion and SLS programs are facing funding challenges, with Congress and the Administration having differing priorities for human spaceflight. The Administration is requesting a reduction in funds for Exploration Systems Development, while Congress is allocating more than requested. The Commercial Crew program is also a point of contention, with the Senate bill providing the requested amount, but the House report does not specify a recommendation. The FY2017 request for the Office of Education is $100 million, a decrease of 13.0% from FY2016. Programs of congressional interest include the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program ($24 million), EPSCoR ($9 million), and MUREP ($30 million). Some NASA education activities are not managed by the Office of Education, such as the $25 million for STEM education in Astrophysics. Administration initiatives aim to consolidate and reorganize STEM education activities across the government. The FY2017 request for NASA's Office of Education is $100 million, a decrease from FY2016. The House and Senate bills propose funding above the request, with specific allocations for Space Grant, EPSCoR, and MUREP. Education activities in the Science Mission Directorate would receive $37 million according to the House report and $42 million according to the Senate report. NASA's Safety, Security, and Mission Services account supports management and oversight activities. The FY2017 request for Safety, Security, and Mission Services at NASA is $2.837 billion, up 2.5% from FY2016. This increase includes funding transferred for IT services consolidation. Construction and Environmental Compliance and Remediation request is $420 million, up 7.9%. Office of Inspector General request is $38 million, up 1.9%. House and Senate recommendations are in Table 1."
