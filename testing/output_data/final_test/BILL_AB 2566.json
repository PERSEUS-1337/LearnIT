    "title": "AB 2566",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1185 of the Civil Code in California is amended to require satisfactory evidence for the acknowledgment of an instrument, ensuring the person making the acknowledgment is the individual described in the document. This includes the oath of a credible witness who personally knows the individual and can confirm their identity. The acknowledgment process in California requires the person making the acknowledgment to be personally known to a witness who can confirm their identity and believes it would be difficult for them to obtain other forms of identification. The person making the acknowledgment must not possess certain identification documents, and the witness must not have a financial interest in the document. A notary public in California must obtain satisfactory evidence for identification. Failure to do so may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000. The penalty can be enforced by the Secretary of State or a public prosecutor. Additionally, two credible witnesses can provide an oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury to confirm the truth of a statement. Reasonable reliance on certain identification documents issued within five years is also allowed. Acceptable forms of identification for a notary public in California include a driver's license, passport, inmate identification, consular identification document, or a valid passport from the applicant's country of citizenship. The document must be current or issued within five years, contain a photograph and description of the person, be signed by the person, and bear a serial or identifying number. Acceptable forms of identification for a notary public in California include driver's license from another state, identification cards from other states, Armed Forces ID, and employee ID from California or local government offices. A party filing a claim for officer's failure to verify identity must prove negligence. Perjury under this section results in forfeiture of financial interest in the document. Section 1185 of the Civil Code is amended to require satisfactory evidence for acknowledgment of an instrument, including the oath of a credible witness. The person making the acknowledgment must be personally known to a witness and have difficulty obtaining identification. The witness must not have a financial interest in the document. A notary public failing to obtain satisfactory evidence may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000, enforceable as a civil judgment. Two credible witnesses can provide an oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury to verify the truth of a statement. Reasonable reliance on certain forms of identification issued within five years is allowed. Acceptable forms of identification for notary public purposes include a driver's license, passport, inmate identification cards, and consular identification documents. The documents must be current or issued within five years, contain a photograph and description of the person, be signed by the person, and bear a serial or identifying number. Acceptable forms of identification for notary public purposes include driver\u2019s licenses from states other than California, Canadian or Mexican driver\u2019s licenses, out-of-state identification cards, military identification cards, California employee identification cards, and tribal government identification cards. An officer taking an acknowledgment is presumed to have followed the law, and the burden of proof lies with the party claiming negligence or misconduct. Section 1.5 of the bill incorporates amendments to Section 1185 of the Civil Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 997. If both bills are enacted by January 1, 2017, and this bill is enacted after Senate Bill 997, certain provisions will not become operative."
