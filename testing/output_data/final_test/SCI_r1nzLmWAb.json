A novel hybrid temporal convolutional and recurrent network (TricorNet) is introduced in this paper, with an encoder-decoder architecture that effectively captures local motion changes and long-term action dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing models on three public action segmentation datasets. The proposed model for action segmentation achieves superior performance by segmenting videos into labeled parts. Current approaches use features from CNNs and sequence prediction models for this task, with applications in video-to-text and action localization. The proposed model for action segmentation uses a one-dimensional sequence prediction model to label actions on frames. It explores local motion changes in actions, such as the sub-actions within the action \"pour ketchup.\" The model utilizes an encoder-decoder framework with 1D temporal convolutional and deconvolutional kernels for video sequence labeling. The proposed model, TricorNet, combines temporal convolutional and recurrent networks to capture both local motion changes and long-term dependencies in video action segmentation. It addresses the limitations of fixed-size receptive fields in capturing sequential features, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various datasets. TricorNet is a model that combines temporal convolutional and recurrent networks for video action segmentation. It uses frame-level features in an encoder-decoder architecture, with the encoder focusing on local motion changes and the decoder on long-term action dependencies. The network is effective in handling different action durations and dependencies among actions, outperforming other models in public datasets. Our proposed TricorNet model achieves superior performance in action segmentation compared to recent networks, capturing long-term action dependencies effectively. The paper includes a survey of related work, introduces the hybrid temporal convolutional and recurrent network, presents experimental results, and concludes with promising findings. The TricorNet model outperforms recent networks in action segmentation by effectively capturing long-term action dependencies. It is inspired by various models such as attention LSTM, multi-stream bi-directional recurrent neural network, and spatial CNN. The model is compared with existing approaches in experiments, showing promising results. The TricorNet model proposes an end-to-end generative approach for action segmentation in videos. It utilizes a hierarchy of temporal convolutional kernels in the encoder network and Bi-LSTMs in the decoder network to capture local motion changes and long-term action dependencies. Comparison with other methods on the 50 Salads dataset is also discussed. Additionally, various approaches for action detection, including two-stream R-CNN and reinforcement learning-based frameworks, are mentioned. These methods primarily focus on single-action, short videos, while recent work considers action detection and dependencies for untrimmed and unconstrained Youtube videos. The TricorNet model introduces a generative approach for action segmentation in videos, utilizing temporal convolutional kernels and Bi-LSTMs. The proposed model takes frame-level video features as input and assigns action labels using a sparse vector. The framework of TricorNet is illustrated in Figure 2. The TricorNet model has an encoder-decoder structure with K layers, a middle layer L mid, and uses temporal convolutions and max pooling. The number of convolutional filters in each encoding layer is specified by F i. The TricorNet model utilizes an encoder-decoder structure with K layers, including a middle layer L mid. It employs temporal convolutions and max pooling, with the number of convolutional filters in each encoding layer specified by F i. The decoding part consists of K layers using Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) units for modeling long-range action dependencies and up-sampling to decode frame-level labels. The TricorNet model utilizes an encoder-decoder structure with K layers, including a middle layer L mid. It employs temporal convolutions and max pooling. The decoder network combines up-sampling and Bi-LSTM to model long-range action dependencies. The LSTM unit updates its hidden state using specific equations. A Bi-LSTM layer contains two LSTMs, one moving forward and one backward. The output is a concatenation of results from both directions.

The output of the decoding part is a matrix D = H (K) \u2208 R T \u00d72H K. A softmax layer computes the probability of the label of each frame at time step t taking one of the c action classes. TricorNet model combines temporal convolutional layers and Bi-LSTM layers in three different designs to encode local motion changes and model sequence dependencies at different levels. TricorNet (high) places Bi-LSTM units at the middle-level layer Lmid to compress information while maintaining local encoding and decoding. The TricorNet model combines temporal convolutional layers and Bi-LSTM layers in three designs to encode motion changes and sequence dependencies at different levels. The encoding part uses max pooling with 32 + 32i filters, while the decoding part involves up-sampling and LSTM layers with 2H i latent states.ReLU is used as the activation function for the temporal convolutional layers. The TricorNet model utilizes temporal convolutional layers and Bi-LSTM layers in three designs to encode motion changes and sequence dependencies. The models are trained from scratch using categorical cross entropy loss with Stochastic Gradient Descent and ADAM updates. Spatial dropouts are added between convolutional layers and Bi-LSTM layers. Experiments are conducted on three action segmentation datasets, comparing results with baseline methods and state-of-the-art results. The University of Dundee 50 Salads dataset includes annotated accelerometer and RGB-D video data. The experiment involves using features extracted from RGB-D video data of salad preparation. The videos range from 5 to 10 minutes and contain 17 classes of actions. The dataset used for the experiment is the Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA) BID3 dataset, which includes seven types of daily activities. Various models such as ST-CNN, Bi-LSTM, Dilated TCN, and ED-TCN are evaluated on this dataset with cross-validation splits. The JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) BID4 dataset consists of 39 videos of surgeons performing surgical tasks, with each surgeon having around five videos. Each video is approximately two minutes long and features around 20 action instances. The dataset includes 10 different action classes, with features and cross-validation splits provided by BID11. Frame-wise accuracy is a common metric used in action segmentation problems, but it may not capture qualitative differences between models. Some studies use a segmental edit score as a complementary metric to address this issue. In this paper, frame-wise accuracy is used for three datasets: JIGSAWS, GTEA, and 50 Salads. Different convolution lengths and layers were experimented with, and a background label is introduced for frames without an action label. The study also compares results with previous works like BID12 and BID11, along with state-of-the-art methods. TricorNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 50 Salads and GTEA datasets. Best results with two layers, 30 convolution length, and 64 hidden states per Bi-LSTM direction. Stable performance with 1% variation. Ensemble approach from BID20 achieves best accuracy on GTEA dataset. TricorNet achieves the best accuracy on 50 Salads dataset by combining EgoNet features with TDD. It avoids mistakes caused by visual similarity and learns long-range dependencies of actions. Using simpler spatial features like BID12 may improve results. TricorNet outperforms ED-TCN on all metrics and shows state-of-the-art results on JIGSAWS dataset. TricorNet achieves superior segmental scores and frame-wise accuracy on various datasets, including the 50 Salads dataset. It utilizes hierarchical LSTM units to learn long-range dependencies of actions, outperforming ED-TCN. The model's performance is attributed to its ability to avoid mistakes caused by visual similarity between actions. TricorNet outperforms ED-TCN on action segmentation by utilizing long-range action dependencies. It successfully predicts actions like peel cucumber and place cucumber into bowl, even when visually challenging. TricorNet improves action segmentation accuracy by learning action dependencies, especially in visually challenging scenarios. It outperforms ED-TCN in recognizing actions like peel cucumber and place cucumber into bowl. The proposed hybrid temporal convolutional and recurrent network can better learn action ordering and dependencies, enhancing performance in noisy or occluded video data. TricorNet utilizes temporal convolutional kernels and bi-directional LSTM units to improve action segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show superior performance over the state of the art, particularly in capturing long-term action dependencies. However, the model achieves the best results with a limited number of layers, as adding more layers may lead to overfitting or getting stuck in local optima. Future work for TricorNet includes evaluating it on other action segmentation datasets to explore its strengths and limitations, and extending it to solve other video understanding problems due to its flexible design and capability in capturing video information."
