    "content": "The Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) was embroiled in controversy due to issues with OMB Circular A-76 competitions, the military health care system, and a planned BRAC action. Washington Post articles exposed poor conditions and treatment of veterans, leading to investigations and congressional hearings. The U.S. Army's decision to conduct a public-private competition for WRAMC was also a significant aspect of the situation. The U.S. Army conducted a public-private competition for base support services under Circular A-76, a Bush Administration initiative. General Richard Cody accepted responsibility for substandard conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Being on the BRAC list did not prioritize repairs or building replacement. The U.S. Army conducted a public-private competition for base support services under Circular A-76. General Richard Cody took responsibility for issues at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Legislation was introduced to address concerns raised at WRAMC, questioning the effectiveness of A-76 cost-comparison studies for achieving cost savings in federal government activities. The proposed FY2008 NDAA includes provisions impacting future competitions. The Army plans to cancel competitions at its medical facilities for 2007 and 2008. Prior to this decision, competitions were planned at various Army facilities, including Fort Detrick. OMB Circular A-76 and the FAIR Act of 1998 govern federal policy on commercial activities. The OMB Circular A-76 requires federal agencies to submit inventories of commercial activities performed by Federal employees annually. It distinguishes between commercial and inherently governmental activities, with the latter being closely tied to the public interest and requiring government personnel to perform. The OMB Circular A-76 distinguishes between commercial and inherently governmental activities, with the latter involving actions that bind the United States, protect interests, affect private persons, or control government property. The OMB Circular A-76 was revised in 2003 based on recommendations from a Commercial Activities Panel. The panel suggested replacing A-76 with an integrated competition process combining elements of Federal Acquisition Regulations and the A-76 Circular. There is a perception among federal employees and labor organizations that the A-76 process favors the private sector, while private sector contractors believe government employees have an unfair advantage. The National Treasury Employees' Union President blamed the exodus of skilled personnel from federal jobs on the contracting process. The contracting process is driving experienced federal employees away and replacing them with private contractors. The President of the Professional Services Council believes that the issues at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are due to poor management and lack of resources, not the fault of the contractor. H.R. 5658 aims to halt the closure of Walter Reed and stop construction of replacement facilities. The bill aims to halt closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and suspend future DOD public-private competitions until conditions are met. The Senate-proposed version requires DOD to develop a strategic human capital plan to improve the civilian acquisition workforce. The FY2008 NDAA (H.R. 4986) includes provisions to improve the civilian acquisition workforce, such as prohibiting public-private competitions without addressing workforce gaps. It also requires retirement benefits comparison and allows for insourcing of certain functions. The FY2008 NDAA (H.R. 4986) includes provisions for insourcing certain functions, prescribing guidelines for federal employees to perform work currently done by contractors, limiting OPM's influence on public-private competitions, amending the definition of \"interested party,\" and granting bid protest rights to employee representatives. It also grants authority to the Comptroller General to expedite actions in protests of public-private competitions. Section 327 of the FY2008 NDAA amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to require public-private competitions for certain agency functions before they can be contracted out. Section 1676 prohibits announcements or conduct at military medical facilities without meeting specific conditions. A business case analysis is conducted to determine if work should be subject to competition, and a Performance Work Statement team develops the work statement for the competition. Both government and private sector proposals must reflect all functions and personnel outlined in the Performance Work Statement. The contractor's proposal must align with the Performance Work Statement, which outlines functions and personnel. The Most Efficient Organization (MEO) is developed by a team of federal employees and a private sector contractor, with a \"firewall\" to prevent communication with the Performance Work Statement team. The MEO consists of federal employees and management bidding for streamlined reorganization. If the MEO wins a competition, it takes over the existing government function. The A-76 policy sets a minimum cost differential of $10 million or 10% for activities to be converted between in-house federal employees and private sector contractors. Competitive sourcing through managed competition was a key initiative in the Bush Administration's Presidential Management Agenda to improve federal government performance. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uses a scorecard to evaluate federal agencies' performance and progress on initiatives. The Army was coded \"red\" on the scorecard in July 2006, with a goal to study 77,873 positions for competition by the end of FY2009. The Army Installation Management Agency (IMA) planned to study 1,574 positions in FY2006 and 13,500 positions by FY2009, with the WRAMC competition being highlighted as significant. The events at Walter Reed, described as the \"perfect storm,\" were influenced by the unexpected casualty load of the Iraq War, contracting out requirements imposed by the A 76 program, and the decision to close Walter Reed. The difficulties at Walter Reed, acknowledged by President George W. Bush, were caused by bureaucratic failures. The A-76 competition highlighted the consequences of federal agency mismanagement. Questions arose about the Army's culture and prioritization of competitive sourcing goals. Congress may need to consider policy questions regarding future A-76 studies. The WRAMC competition, unique and lengthy, was governed by the OMB Circular A-76 policy. It raised questions about the efficacy of the A-76 policy and highlighted issues with federal agency mismanagement at Walter Reed. Congress may need to consider new approaches for future A-76 studies. After 2003, a higher number of injured troops were treated at WRAMC, a military base with aging facilities. The 2005 BRAC Commission voted to realign Walter Reed with NNMC in Bethesda, creating the WRNMMC. This realignment would result in the closure of the Walter Reed campus. The Army awarded a $120 million contract to IAP Worldwide Services for services at the Walter Reed campus in 2006. IAP had previously provided support after Hurricane Katrina and in Afghanistan. The firm had $393 million in military contracts in 2006 and had been working at Walter Reed since 2003. In June 2000, the Army announced a competition for base operations support positions, including information technology, clerical support, hospital services, and maintenance. Grant Thornton LLP was awarded a contract to assist federal employees in developing a bid proposal. Johnson Controls World Services was selected as the contractor to compete against federal employees in May 2003. The solicitation period closed in September 2003. In September 2003, DOD requested permission from OMB to use pre-2003 Circular rules. In November 2003, OMB authorized DOD to extend the competition until September 30, 2004. By April 2004, the Army Audit Agency independently reviewed and certified the MEO's bid proposal. In July 2004, the Army made extensive revisions to the solicitation and Performance Work Statement. By September 2004, bid proposals were received from the MEO and the contractor. On September 29, 2004, the Army announced that the MEO won the contract with a proposed price of $124,479,881. In March 2005, IAP Worldwide Services, Inc. acquired Johnson Controls and became the company of record. The 2005 BRAC Commission recommended realigning Walter Reed in May 2005. The AAA withdrew its certification of the MEO in June 2005. The Army notified Congress of IAP's contract award in June 2005. The AAA requested to cancel the A-76 competition in August 2005, but the Army denied it. In January 2006, the AAA declared IAP as the winner with a revised proposal price of $140,490,286. In June 2006, IAP won a competition with a proposal price of $133,028,548, $7,461,737 lower than the government MEO. Alan King filed a protest with GAO on behalf of the MEO, but it was dismissed. The transition to IAP at WRAMC was delayed due to Congress's legislation to block the contract award. Despite protests and appeals, IAP began work on February 4, 2007, after the Army notified Congress and employees of a pending reduction-in-force. The competition was complicated by the lengthy decision-making process, appeals, protests, and Congressional involvement. The competition to transition to IAP at WRAMC was delayed by Congress, leading to complex challenges for the Army. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates commissioned the Independent Review Group to assess outpatient care and administrative processes at WRAMC and NNMC. The panel, co-chaired by former Secretaries of the Army, identified staffing issues, management neglect, and resource shortages at WRAMC. The Panel found that the BRAC action created additional pressures for WRAMC management, affecting outpatient services and staff retention. They recommended relief from future A-76 studies for military medical treatment facilities like WRAMC. The decision-making process at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) was complex, with various Army officials having different opinions on whether to cancel the competition. The Army was represented by WRAMC management, Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), the AAA, and Army attorneys. Senior Army officials, including Lieutenant General Kevin Kiley, had varying reactions to the competition. The decision-making process at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) involved various Army officials, including Major General George Weightman and Colonel Peter Garibaldi. Colonel Garibaldi sought MEDCOM's help to resolve issues related to the A-76 competition at Walter Reed, requesting approval and funding to fix problems since the competition began in 2000. The Army initiated the A-76 competition in 2000, but the workload at the hospital and garrison missions has significantly increased in the past six years due to caring for Wounded Warriors from GWOT. The competition was based on outdated data, leading to a need for more personnel in 2006. This has caused challenges in retaining skilled personnel and hiring new staff at WRAMC. WRAMC faces challenges in retaining skilled personnel and hiring new staff due to outdated A-76 competition data. The garrison command lacks positions for essential functions like DOL and PAIO, putting base operations and patient care services at risk of mission failure. Colonel Garabaldi's memorandum highlights the difficulties in managing day-to-day operations at Walter Reed. The competition to manage day-to-day operations at Walter Reed took over six years to complete, facing challenges and criticism from lawmakers for violating DOD policy and public law. Senator Mikulski and colleagues urged the cancellation of the contract for base operations support. The lawmakers are urging against entering a contract for base operations support services at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center due to concerns over the privatization review process and potential violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Department of Defense received special permission to continue the review under previous rules. The Army continued the WRAMC A-76 privatization review past the deadline set by OMB, violating the terms of the waiver. DoD did not request an extension, and the review should have been cancelled when the deadline expired. The Army's failure to complete the WRAMC privatization review in a timely manner violated DoD rules and the Defense Appropriations Bill, leading to potential violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act. Deadlines for A-76 privatization reviews are crucial to prevent excessive costs and productivity issues. The Army's failure to complete the WRAMC privatization review in a timely manner led to significant costs and productivity issues. The longer A-76 privatization reviews continue, the higher their costs, making actual savings less likely. Lawmakers urge against entering into troubled reviews like the WRAMC privatization study. The undersigned lawmakers urge against entering into a contract for base operations support services at WRAMC due to apparent violations of DOD rules and the Antideficiency Act. The six-year delay was caused by various factors, including congressional intervention and the Army's decision to continue the competition despite issues. The Army's decision to continue the competition despite time limits not being kept and the addition of over 1,500 amendments caused delays. Skilled personnel may quit, new employees are hesitant to join, and existing employees may start looking for other jobs during A-76 competitions. Colonel Garabaldi's struggle to retain skilled personnel at Walter Reed due to the uncertainty caused by the ongoing competition and impending closure of the main campus. Major General Weightman and Navy Surgeon General Arthur testified that privatization of base support services and the decision to close WRAMC contributed to the base's problems. Financial commitments for infrastructure improvements were withheld during BRAC actions. The testimony highlighted the impact of A-76 competitions on workforce stability at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Generals Kiley and Weightman mentioned how the competition's length affected employee morale, leading to a shortage of skilled personnel. The uncertainty caused by the ongoing competition and impending closure of the main campus contributed to the struggle to retain staff at Walter Reed. Financial commitments for infrastructure improvements were also withheld during BRAC actions. The testimony at Walter Reed Army Medical Center highlighted the impact of A-76 competitions on workforce stability, affecting employee morale and leading to a shortage of skilled personnel. General Weightman responded to questions about privatizing the workforce amidst uncertainties from BRAC actions. General Kiley approved requests for privatization at MEDCOM but faced challenges with execution due to job uncertainties. Privatization efforts began in 2000 under A-76, leading to questions about the wisdom of privatizing everything except clinical and medical workforce at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. General Kiley and General Weightman acknowledged that privatization efforts at Walter Reed Army Medical Center increased instability for the civilian workforce. The costs for the government MEO significantly increased from September 2004 to January 2006, while the contractor costs remained stable. The Army responded to Senator Sarbanes's request for cost information on the WRAMC competition. The memorandum by Mr. William A. Armbruster discusses the high costs incurred by the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center base operations support services competition due to delays caused by protests and contests. Transition costs were estimated based on employee interest in voluntary retirement or separation incentives. The U.S. Army Medical Command incurred high costs in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center base operations support services competition due to delays from protests and contests. Transition costs were estimated based on employee interest in voluntary retirement or separation incentives, resulting in annual savings of about $4.5 million. The contractor's cost proposal was significantly lower than the government workforce's proposal, with savings of almost $17.5 million over a five-year term. Despite extraordinary expenses, the resultant savings were deemed significant by an observer of the A-76 process. The U.S. Army Medical Command incurred high costs in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center base operations support services competition due to delays from protests and contests. Threlkeld highlighted violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act during the competition process. The Army sought DOD's approval to cancel the competition at one point, but was instructed to continue. The implications of the WRAMC competition on future competitive sourcing studies under OMB Circular A-76 are being questioned. The Army's decision to cancel future outsourcing contracts at military medical facilities for 2007 and 2008, including at Fort Detrick and WRAMC, may be influenced by the Walter Reed controversy. The Chief of Staff of the Army Medical Command cited the increased need for health care assets to support the global war on terrorism as a reason for the cancellation. The implications of the WRAMC competition on future public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76 are being questioned. Former Secretary of the Army Togo West questioned if problems at Walter Reed exposed flaws in the A-76 policy. He highlighted maintenance deficiencies at the facility and criticized the poorly executed competition. Former Secretary of the Army Togo West raised concerns about the impact of the A-76 policy on Walter Reed Medical Center. He pointed out that the facility faced challenges due to a lack of caseworkers, leading to unattended cases and missed appointments for servicemembers. The A-76 policy converted governmental assignments to private contractor assignments at Walter Reed Medical Center, leading to a 37 percent decrease in key staff. This resulted in a shortage of personnel to handle the increasing number of patients. The six-year competition highlighted the challenges and complexities involved, raising questions about the decision to continue with the competition. The decision to continue the Walter Reed A-76 competition faced challenges due to competing interests and priorities, including the pressure to meet numerical quotas of the Bush Administration's Presidential Management Agenda. The Army's desire to meet PMA goals may have influenced the decision, despite constrained resources from combat operations and BRAC actions. The Army's decision to cancel the A-76 competition may have been influenced by constrained resources from combat operations and BRAC actions. Some activities, like maintenance of health care facilities, may not be suitable for A-76 competitions due to their impact on military health care. Activities that affect military patients should be considered inherently governmental. Activities that impact military patients should be considered inherently governmental, exempt from competition. Congress may consider legislative initiatives to evaluate the efficacy of the A-76 policy, such as requiring specific reporting on ongoing competitions and prohibiting competitions at military medical facilities. The text suggests changes to A-76 policy, including considering health care and retirement costs in competitions, enforcing rules, providing parity for contractors and federal employees, and exploring alternatives like \"high-performing organizations.\" Congress may cancel outstanding competitions under pre-2003 Circular and direct DOD to provide detailed updates on ongoing A-76 studies. Congress could consider prohibiting numerical quotas for federal agencies in A-76 competitions, declare activities at military medical facilities affecting patient care as inherently governmental, and ensure all activities at these facilities are not subject to competition. The activities at military medical facilities at WRAMC are deemed critical to national security and may require federal employees for performance. A proposed legislative initiative suggests a one-year moratorium on future A-76 competitions at these facilities. Representative Ortiz introduced this amendment to halt competitions at the Department of Defense for work at medical facilities due to identified flaws in the program. The issues at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are just the beginning, as per a memo from the garrison commander in September 2006. The garrison commander at military medical facilities faced challenges in retaining skilled personnel due to A-76 competitions, RIFS, and BRAC. A proposed amendment aims to review the effectiveness of A-76 competitions for cost savings without sacrificing service quality. The amendment only applies to future contracts, not overturning existing ones like at Walter Reed. It also calls for a report to evaluate the value of the A-76 process. The Army failed to comply with excluding health care costs from the A-76 process if DOD contributed more than the contractor. Excluding retirement costs may affect contractor benefits. The Walter Reed Competition lacks clear authority. Complex competitions like at Walter Reed involve multiple officials and shared responsibilities between the Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The Army and the Office of the Secretary of Defense share authorities and responsibilities for A-76, leading to conflicting roles. The Deputy Garrison Commander lacked legal standing and resources to appeal a competition outcome. One suggestion is for OMB to establish a team of experienced A-76 professionals as ATOs. ATOs would need sufficient funds and independence to represent federal employees in competitions. Congress could ensure A-76 rules are followed. Congress could ensure that the A-76 rules are followed to maintain integrity in the process and final decisions. Lack of enforcement of rules has led to loss of confidence in the A-76 process. Suggestions have been made for OMB, DoD, and the Army to intervene in cases where rules are not followed, potentially leading to different outcomes. The Walter Reed A-76 competition rules may have influenced the outcome, with the right to protest being a crucial factor. The Competition in Contracting Act allowed private sector contractors to file protests, while federal employees were initially prohibited. P.L. 108-375 expanded the definition of an \"interested party\" to include the Agency Tender Official (ATO). Despite attempts by the ATO to protest, GAO ruled that no ATO existed pre-2003, leading to inequity in the A-76 process. The Walter Reed A-76 competition highlighted issues of inequity and fairness, particularly regarding the lack of direct protest rights for federal employees. The competition outcome was influenced by a protest filed by the contractor, IAP, which the federal employees were unable to do. WRAMC management faced challenges advocating for their employees due to lack of expertise and financial resources, leading them to seek help from AFGE. Congress could grant legislative authority for federal employees to have direct protest rights, potentially prohibiting federal agencies from conducting competitions without adequate funding for employee representation. Additionally, incentives could be provided for agencies to explore alternatives like high-performing organizations to achieve efficiencies sought through A-76 competitions. The GAO's Commercial Activities Panel recommended the creation of High-Performing Organizations (HPOs) as alternatives to A-76 competitions. Federal employees are winning the majority of competitions, prompting agencies like the Army to consider cost-effective alternatives. The American Federation of Government Employees suggested canceling the A-76 study at Keesler AFB due to lengthy completion times. The leadership at Walter Reed Army Medical Center struggled to manage outpatient services for injured service members due to various challenges, including being on the Base Realignment and Closure list. The closure of Walter Reed was recommended by the Base Realignment and Closure Committee in August 2005. The Committee recommended the closure of the Center installation, including the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and the realignment of Walter Reed Army Medical Center with the National Naval Medical Center to create the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). The integration is set to be completed by September 2011, causing challenges for capital improvements and staff recruitment. The current leadership is focused on the complex transition, diverting attention from effective hospital management. The facilities at Walter Reed need replacement due to limited space for patients. The establishment of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on the Bethesda campus, along with co-location with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and close proximity to the National Institutes of Health, creates an ideal setting for continued cooperation between the civilian sector and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The Base Realignment and Closure decision to create the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center led to staffing problems, leadership inattention to day-to-day operations, and a lack of resources for capital improvements. The leadership complexities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center Command are challenging. The leadership complexities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center Command are challenging, involving the operation of a major military academic medical center, casualty care, healthcare market management, and oversight for the northeastern United States. The Base Realignment and Closure decision has impacted recruitment and retention of critical specialists. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recently reduced the accreditation of many Walter Reed Army Medical Center's programs due to instability, leading to the loss of key staff members. The Assistant Secretary of the Army made a decision to discourage capital expenditures for facility improvement projects on Army installations scheduled for closure. The Assistant Secretary of the Army discouraged capital expenditures for facility improvement projects at installations recommended for closure, leading to a decline in facility improvements and hindering efforts to advocate for critical projects like the Warrior Rehabilitation Training Center. The Base Realignment and Closure targeted the replacement of aging hospital facilities at Walter Reed and others in the National Capital Region, with plans to accelerate the processes for new facilities at Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir to modernize patient care. The recommendation is to accelerate the implementation of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's recommendations to move patients to modern facilities faster, with proposals to complete construction of the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Warrior Care Center ahead of schedule. Acceleration strategies should also be considered for the new hospital construction at Fort Belvoir. The focus is on serving the needs of soldiers and families by providing the best possible facilities for care and recovery. Accelerate the Environmental Impact Competition (EIS) and release funds for the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center construction. Integration of facilities should be expedited to improve treatment for servicemembers and their families without delays in service. Maintain full operation until closure with A-76 program for efficient task performance. The A-76 process was implemented at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2000 to select the most efficient organization for non-inherently governmental tasks. The government initially bid $7 million less than a private contractor for base operations support, but the private contractor's bid was ultimately deemed more favorable. This process had a significant impact on the civilian workforce at the center. The Department of Defense can opt-out of the A-76 process during times of war or military mobilization. The Department of Defense can opt-out of the A-76 process during times of war or military mobilization. The Deputy Undersecretary of Defense, Installations and Environment, has the authority to make this decision. Exercising this option could have prevented significant personnel shortages at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center during critical times. The focus on A-76 business led to neglect in other important areas such as recruitment of healthcare personnel. The A-76 process caused personnel shortages at Walter Reed Army Medical Center due to awarding a contract to a private vendor for facility maintenance. This led to a hiring freeze, reduction in force, and a serious shortage of staff for eight months. Leadership's ability to hire essential staff was restricted, resulting in critical shortages. The hiring freeze at Walter Reed Army Medical Center caused critical staff shortages, impacting garrison and brigade functions supporting outpatient servicemembers and their families. The delay in contractor selection led to shortages of over 100 personnel during peak patient load. The Secretary of Defense should allow Service Secretaries to seek relief from A-76 during wartime. President George W. Bush attributed the problems at Walter Reed to bureaucratic and administrative failures. Assessments from the Department of Army revealed that leadership at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was aware of complaints about administrative processes and poor facility conditions but failed to act promptly. The decision to create the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center contributed to staffing issues and a lack of resources for capital improvements. The Secretary of Defense should seek legislative approval to accelerate the implementation of the BRAC Commission's recommendations, including starting construction of the new medical center. Integration of the two facilities should be expedited to prevent the existing facilities from deteriorating. The integration of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center should be expedited to prevent deterioration of existing facilities. Funding is needed to maintain full operation until closure. The A-76 process hindered hiring and retaining qualified staff, with cost savings proving counterproductive. The Secretary of Defense should allow regulatory relief from A-76 during times of war for military treatment facilities like Walter Reed."
