    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Western Hemisphere Environmental Cooperation Act of 1993\". It includes findings related to environmental cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. Congress finds that biological diversity offers various medical, biotechnological, agricultural, and industrial benefits. Tropical forests, home to a significant percentage of Earth's species, are being cleared rapidly, leading to potential species loss. Poverty and limited economic opportunities in certain regions contribute to the destruction of important biodiversity areas. Cooperation among US institutions is crucial in addressing these issues. Cooperation between US institutions and Latin American governments in preserving biodiversity can benefit conservation and economic growth. Access to biological resources enhances US competitiveness. The Convention on Biological Diversity supports intellectual property rights and resource exchange agreements. The Conference on Environment and Development highlights the crucial connection between protecting the environment, biodiversity, and economic growth on an international level. The purpose of the document is outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to promote the conservation of biological resources and sustainable use of tropical forests in Latin America and the Caribbean. It also seeks to ensure a stable supply of biological resources for US entities by assisting in the establishment of biodiversity management organizations and facilitating resource exchange agreements. The Act aims to promote conservation of biological diversity and technology transfer in agreements. It also focuses on understanding intellectual property rights and fair distribution of benefits. Additionally, it proposes a study on establishing a Western Hemisphere Environmental Partnership for technological cooperation on environmental issues. SEC. 4. WESTERN HEMISPHERE BIODIVERSITY COOPERATION PROGRAM. The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall establish a Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program to assist in establishing and strengthening biodiversity management organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean. Assistance will be used for cataloging and studying biological resources, creating databases for monitoring and commercial purposes, and building institutional capacity for biodiversity. The Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program aims to assist biodiversity management organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean by providing training in research, contract law, and negotiation, advising governments on conservation legislation, facilitating cooperation among organizations, and exploring sustainable economic opportunities from biological samples. The Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program supports biodiversity management organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean by providing training, advising on conservation legislation, facilitating cooperation, and exploring sustainable economic opportunities. Assistance may include purchasing discounted commercial debt of governments in the region to ensure steady income for these organizations. The Administrator consults with relevant US government agencies in program administration. The Administrator of the Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program collaborates with biodiversity management organizations and national governments in Latin America and the Caribbean to promote conservation efforts. SEC. 5. WESTERN HEMISPHERE BIODIVERSITY COOPERATION GRANTS. Establishment of Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Grants program under section 4 to award grants to biodiversity management organizations for resource exchange agreements promoting conservation of tropical forests and sustainable economic development in biodiversity-rich areas. The Administrator has the authority to provide grants to support these organizations. The Administrator can provide grants to biodiversity management organizations for resource-sharing agreements that benefit conservation of tropical forests and biodiversity. Criteria include ensuring that at least 50% of benefits from the agreement are given back to the organization. The organization will provide equipment and training to carry out resource-sharing agreements for conservation of tropical forests and biodiversity. Intellectual property rights must be protected, and benefits from product use shared. The organization will provide equipment and training for conservation agreements. Grants must support agreement purposes, be under $100,000, and not exceed 20% of the initial investment. The US cannot receive proceeds from resource exchange agreements. Assistance under section 4 and grants under this section are not considered assistance for any provision of law limiting assistance to any country. SEC. 6. WESTERN HEMISPHERE ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERSHIP. The President will direct a Federal entity to study the feasibility of establishing a Western Hemisphere Environmental Partnership to promote cooperation on environmental issues in the Western Hemisphere. This partnership aims to promote public-private sector partnerships, facilitate technology application for environmental problems, and provide training in sound environmental practices for personnel in Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States aims to develop innovative financing mechanisms for environmental protection in Latin America and the Caribbean. They also seek to assist countries in the region with appropriate technologies for their environmental needs and promote information-sharing on environmental technologies within the Western Hemisphere. The role of the United States Government in a Western Hemisphere Environmental Partnership will be explored as part of the study. The Committee conducting the study will consider the experiences of the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership and the Caribbean Environment and Development Institute. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The President must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment, detailing the implementation of the Act, including the Western Hemisphere Biodiversity Cooperation Program and Grants, as well as the results of the study on a Western Hemisphere Environmental Partnership. Subsequent annual reports are also required. The terms defined in this Act include the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, biodiversity management organization, resource-sharing entity, and resource exchange agreement. A resource exchange agreement is a deal between a biodiversity management organization and a resource-sharing entity where the organization provides biological resources in exchange for benefits like money, technology transfer, or training."
