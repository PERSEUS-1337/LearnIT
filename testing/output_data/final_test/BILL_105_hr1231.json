    "content": "The \"Post Office Relocation Act of 1997\" outlines guidelines for the renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation of post offices. Section 404(b) of title 39, United States Code, is amended to require the Postal Service to provide 60 days notice to persons served by a post office before renovating, relocating, closing, or consolidating it. Notification must be in writing, hand-delivered or mailed, and published in newspapers within the zip codes served. The Postal Service must provide 60 days notice to persons served by a post office before any renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation. During this notice period, individuals can offer alternative proposals which the Postal Service must respond to in writing. After the notice period, a determination will be made following a hearing where individuals can present testimony. The Postal Service allows individuals served by a post office to provide testimony on renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation. Factors considered include the post office's location in a downtown area, impact on the community, community opposition, effect on employees, and consistency with government policy. The Postal Service considers factors such as economic savings, negotiations with affected individuals, management contributions to relocation decisions, adequacy of existing post offices, and exploration of alternatives when deciding on renovation, relocation, closing, or consolidation. The Postal Service must provide a written determination and findings when renovating, relocating, closing, or consolidating a post office, considering factors like economic savings and exploring alternatives. This information must be made available to those served by the post office, and no action can be taken until 60 days after the determination is shared. Appeals can be made to the Postal Rate Commission within 30 days. The Postal Rate Commission reviews determinations made by the Postal Service regarding post office actions. The Commission must make a determination within 120 days of receiving an appeal. They can set aside determinations that are arbitrary, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by evidence. The Commission can affirm the Postal Service's determination or send the matter back for further consideration, but cannot modify it. The Postal Rate Commission can suspend the Postal Service's determination until the appeal is resolved. If a community has stricter procedures for post office actions, the Postal Service must follow those instead. The Postal Service must also comply with relevant regulations when making decisions on post office renovation, relocation, closure, or consolidation. The curr_chunk discusses zoning, planning, land use regulations, and building codes applicable to State or local public entities. The Postal Service must consider the impact of new postal facilities on the community served by the prior facility, as stated in an amendment to Section 101(g) of title 39, United States Code."
