    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Toxic Metals Protection Act of 2010\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Toxic Metals Protection Act of 2010 defines key terms such as antimony, barium, cadmium, and children's product as products designed for children 12 years of age or younger. When determining the suitability of a product for use by children 12 years of age or younger, factors to consider include manufacturer's statement, product label, packaging representation, consumer recognition, and adherence to Age Determination Guidelines. The Commission defines \"chromium\" as elemental chromium and its compounds or alloys. \"Commission\" refers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \"Sold or distributed at retail\" means sold or distributed to a consumer. The text prohibits the manufacture, sale, or distribution of children's products containing high levels of antimony, barium, cadmium, or chromium. Violations will be treated as a violation of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Additionally, alternative measures for heavy metal content are discussed. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish a new measurement standard for heavy metals in children's products within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Reports on enforcement actions and heavy metals banned from children's products must be submitted to Congress annually. The Act will impact both federal and state laws. SEC. 6. EFFECT ON FEDERAL AND STATE LAW.\n\nThis Act does not preempt State authority to regulate products containing certain metals, except when compliance with both State and Federal law is impossible. It also does not affect any enforcement actions or liabilities under State law. Additionally, existing State warning requirements for consumer products or substances remain unaffected by this Act.\n\nSEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will be effective on the date of its enactment and will apply to children's products manufactured 90 days after that date."
