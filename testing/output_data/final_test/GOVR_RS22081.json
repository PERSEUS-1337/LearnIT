    "content": "The bill establishes the Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation within the Department of Labor to award damages to claimants based on injury and asbestos exposure levels. The Administrator, appointed by the President with Senate approval, would oversee the Office and report to the Assistant Secretary of Labor. Claims would be paid from the Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution Fund, and new asbestos claims would no longer be pursued in federal or state courts. All pending asbestos claims would be stayed upon enactment of the bill. If the administrative process outlined in the bill is not operational after nine months, exigent health claims for mesothelioma or those with a life expectancy of less than one year can be maintained in the same courts. Other asbestos claims must be filed within two years. Any individual meeting the medical criteria listed in the bill can bring a claim within five years. The draft bill sets a five-year statute of limitations for filing asbestos claims after receiving a medical diagnosis. The Administrator would establish a claimant assistance program and attorneys can charge no more than five percent of the final award. Claimants must prove eligibility for compensation by showing they suffer from an eligible disease. The bill outlines a tiered compensation scheme for asbestos-related injuries, ranging from medical monitoring to $1.1 million for mesothelioma. Claimants must demonstrate minimum asbestos exposure and eligibility for compensation. Exceptional medical claims can also be considered. Smoking and lung cancer are controversial aspects of the legislation. The tiered compensation scheme for asbestos-related injuries includes levels VII and VIII, where awards are based on claimants' smoking history. The Administrator must provide a proposed decision within ninety days, with the option for claimants to seek review. A final decision can be issued if no review is requested, followed by a ninety-day window for judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The bill proposes structured payments for asbestos claimants over a three-to-four year period, with reductions for collateral source compensation. There is debate over including \"mixed dust\" claims in the legislation. S. 852 proposes a Fund for asbestos claimants with structured payments over three-to-four years. Silica claims would be moved to an administrative process unless proven otherwise. Defendant and insurer participants would contribute to the Fund, with limits set at $90 billion and $46.025 billion respectively. The Administrator could borrow to enhance liquidity. The Administrator of the proposed Fund for asbestos claimants would have the authority to borrow for liquidity, take legal action against non-paying participants, and monitor asset transfers. If the Fund lacks resources, it would sunset, allowing claimants to return to court. Defendant participants would be categorized based on prior asbestos spending, with a special tier for recent bankruptcies. Asbestos or class action trusts must adopt the bill's medical criteria post-termination. The bill proposes tiers and subtiers to determine defendant participants' annual contributions to the Fund, ranging from $27.5 million to $100,000. Participants can petition for adjustments in cases of financial hardship or inequity. Small businesses are exempt from payment obligations. The total annual payments to the Fund must be at least $3 billion for the first thirty years, with ten-percent reductions every five years.

Participants can petition for adjustments in cases of financial hardship or inequity. Small businesses are exempt from payment obligations. The total annual payments to the Fund must be at least $3 billion for the first thirty years, with ten-percent reductions every five years. Additionally, the Asbestos Insurers Commission would establish a methodology for determining the amount to be contributed to the Fund by insurer participants, with aggregate annual payments of $2.7 billion for the first two years and $5.075 billion for subsequent years.

Participants can petition for adjustments in cases of financial hardship or inequity. Small businesses are exempt from payment obligations. The total annual payments to the Fund must be at least $3 billion for the first thirty years, with ten-percent reductions every five years. The Administrator would have the power to suspend insurer participants' payments if the Fund has enough assets. Regulations would be put in place to ban products containing asbestos, with exemptions granted in certain cases. The bill proposes exemptions for certain asbestos-containing products, such as those necessary for Defense Department or NASA functions, diaphragms for chlor-alkali manufacturing, and encapsulated asbestos in roofing materials. The EPA Administrator must review and may revoke the exemption for roofing materials within eighteen months. Additionally, the bill requires the EPA to study exposure risks and develop guidelines for naturally occurring asbestos."
