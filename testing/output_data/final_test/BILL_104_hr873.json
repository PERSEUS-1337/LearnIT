    "content": "SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS. The Helium Privatization Act of 1995 acknowledges the shift towards private industry involvement in helium recovery due to the abundance of private helium sources and the decreased national security need for government-controlled helium reserves. Private industry currently dominates helium extraction and consumption, with the Government's helium recovery program facing a significant debt of $1.4 billion to the Department of the Treasury. The program has been losing an additional $120 million yearly on interest alone, with no foreseeable prospect of repayment. Given the surplus of public and private helium reserves exceeding national needs, there is no longer a necessity for the Federal Government to own and operate a helium extraction and reserve program. The Helium Act is being amended, with sections 3, 4, and 5 being revised to grant authority to the Secretary. The Secretary may enter agreements with private parties for helium recovery and disposal on Federal lands, granting leasehold rights under fair terms. Helium sales are limited to parties with recovery agreements. Agreements must consider existing rights of Federal oil and gas lessees. The Secretary is authorized to store, transport, and sell helium in accordance with the Helium Privatization Act of 1995. They are also authorized to monitor helium production and reserves in the United States and prepare reports on helium quantities. The Secretary is authorized to store, transport, and sell helium in accordance with the Helium Privatization Act of 1995. The Secretary is authorized to store and transport crude helium, operate existing storage facilities, and cease production, refining, and marketing of refined helium one year after the Helium Privatization Act of 1995. The Helium Privatization Act of 1995 requires the sale of 600,000,000 cubic feet of helium reserves owned by the United States. Within one year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary must dispose of all facilities, equipment, and property related to helium production in accordance with laws governing surplus properties. Proceeds from the sale will be treated as moneys received under the Act. Costs associated with sale, disposal, termination of personnel, and cessation of activities under subsection (b) will be paid from the helium production fund. Paragraph (1) does not apply to facilities, equipment, or property necessary for storage and transportation of crude helium. Existing contracts for purchase of refined helium will remain in force until facilities are disposed of. Costs associated with termination of contracts under subsection (c) will be paid from the helium production fund. The Secretary can impose fees on individuals for helium storage, transportation, and withdrawal services to cover the full costs. The fees collected will be considered moneys received under the Act. Section 6 is amended to require persons with contracts to purchase crude helium from the Secretary. The Secretary is restricted from disrupting the market price of crude helium when making sales under this section. Sales of crude helium will now include interest, and fees collected for helium services will be considered moneys received under the Act. The amendment requires repayment of funds to the US by October 1, 1993, based on the volume of crude helium owned by the US. The price of crude helium sold by the Secretary must not be lower than a calculated amount adjusted by the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, subsection (d) is amended regarding the extraction of helium from deposits on federal lands. The Secretary shall pay moneys received from helium sales on Federal lands to the Treasury to offset repayments required under subsection (c). Subsections (e) and (f) are repealed and amended, respectively, with excess funds over $2,000,000 to be paid to the Treasury annually. Upon full repayment under subsection (c), the fund is terminated, and all moneys received are deposited in the Treasury as General Revenues. SEC. 8 is amended to eliminate the stockpile. The Secretary annually reviews domestic helium reserves, excluding federally owned helium at Cliffside Reservoir, to determine their expected life. Starting January 1, 2004, the Secretary must sell crude helium from US reserves in minimum amounts to dispose of excess reserves by January 1, 2014, ensuring repayment to the Treasury. The Secretary must sell crude helium from US reserves annually in minimum amounts to dispose of excess reserves by January 1, 2014. The minimum annual sales requirement may be deferred if the Secretary is unable to arrange sales at the minimum price. Sales shall be determined by the Secretary in consultation with the helium industry to minimize market disruption. The discovery of additional helium reserves will not affect the Secretary's duty to make sales as provided. SEC. 6. REPEAL OF AUTHORITY TO BORROW. Sections 12 and 15 are repealed. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Inspector General of the Department of the Interior is required to prepare annual financial statements for the Helium Operations of the Bureau of Mines, to be audited by the General Accounting Office and reported to the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. The annual financial statements for the Helium Operations of the Bureau of Mines must be prepared by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior and audited according to government auditing standards. The financial statements should include a balance sheet, Statement of Operations, statement of cash flows, and a reconciliation of budget reports. The Statement of Operations should detail revenues and costs related to sales, storage, transportation, production, and refining of crude helium. The curr_chunk discusses the production, refining, marketing, and storage of helium at the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field. Revenues exclude royalties and asset sales proceeds, while expenses include labor costs and interest on repayable amounts. The balance sheet for helium reserves includes the market value and accrued debt to the United States. Accrued interest on outstanding repayable amounts is also included for financial reporting purposes."
