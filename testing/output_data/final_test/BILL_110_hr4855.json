    "content": "Studies and reports by the Department of Agriculture and the National Academy of Sciences on food products from cloned animals. The Department of Agriculture, in coordination with the Economic Research Service, will conduct a study on the economic and trade impact of agricultural exports of food products from cloned animals. The study will analyze the implications of allowing milk and meat from cloned animals into the food supply, focusing on domestic and international trade economics. The study will analyze the impact of agricultural exports of food products from cloned animals on Federal agricultural expenditures, meat and milk exports shifts, and potential bans on exports from the United States by other countries. It will also consider consumer and exporter behavioral responses in the economic and health impact analysis required under this section. The Secretary, in coordination with the Comptroller General of the United States, will conduct the study. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on monitoring food products from cloned animals in the food supply, including evaluating processes and reviewing safety studies. Additionally, a study with the Government Accountability Office will focus on health effects and costs of milk from cloned animals in the food supply. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Comptroller General of the United States, will conduct a study on the health effects and costs of milk from cloned animals in the food supply. This study will evaluate public health effects, associated healthcare costs, consumer behavior changes, negative impacts on nutrition, and prevention of chronic diseases resulting from decreased milk consumption due to the commercialization of milk from cloned animals and their progeny. The Secretary will contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the safety of food products from cloned animals. The study will review the data and analysis used in the FDA's draft risk assessment on animal cloning to determine if there were enough studies to support the conclusions. The Secretary will contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the safety of food products from cloned animals, reviewing data and analysis from the FDA's draft risk assessment. The studies will assess if additional information affects the conclusions drawn in the draft risk assessment. Ongoing scientific research in artificial reproductive health technologies is not impeded by this section. The studies must be completed before the final risk assessment on cloned animals and food products is issued. The voluntary moratorium on introducing food from cloned animals remains in effect. The current supply regulations will remain in effect until the final risk assessment is issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
