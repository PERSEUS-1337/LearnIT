    "content": "The National Intelligence Council (NIC) warned in January 2000 that new and reemerging infectious diseases would increasingly threaten global security over the next 20 years. Factors contributing to this threat include drug resistance, slow development of new antibiotics, urban sprawl, environmental degradation, and ease of cross-border movements. In 2002, the international community struggled to contain an unknown infectious disease that spread across 31 countries, infecting over 8,400 people. In 2003, an unknown infectious disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 31 countries, infecting over 8,400 people and killing 813. In the same year, Influenza A/H5N1 (bird flu) reemerged, spreading to more than 50 countries with 381 cases and 240 deaths by April 17, 2008. Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease with one-third of the world's population currently infected, mostly in latent form. Tuberculosis (TB) can lie dormant in an infected person for years without symptoms. Active TB can infect 10-15 people annually if untreated. The disease becomes active when the immune system is weakened, like with HIV/AIDS. In 2006, there were 14.4 million prevalent TB cases, with 80% in 22 high-burden countries, mostly in Africa and Asia. India, China, Indonesia, South Africa had the highest number of new TB cases. In 2006, TB killed an estimated 1.7 million people, including 230,857 with HIV/AIDS. Southeast Asia had the highest number of new TB cases, but incidence and mortality rates were higher in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the 15 countries with the highest TB incidence rates, 13 were in Africa due to high rates of HIV co-infection. Sub-Saharan Africa had higher TB-related deaths and mortality rates compared to Southeast Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, 639,089 people died of TB, with a rate of 83 per 100,000 infected. Factors contributing to Africa's high rate include weak health systems, poor access to healthcare, and HIV/AIDS increasing TB prevalence. HIV/AIDS weakens immunity, increasing the risk of contracting TB. TB shortens survival for those with HIV/AIDS, while HIV/AIDS is a significant risk factor for developing active TB. In developing countries, HIV/AIDS is a potent risk factor for converting latent TB into active TB. The two diseases together are more destructive than alone. Key facts include: TB is harder to diagnose and progresses faster in HIV-positive individuals, almost always fatal if untreated, and kills up to half of all AIDS patients worldwide. People with HIV/AIDS are up to 50 times more likely to develop TB in a year than HIV-negative individuals. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS and TB co-infection is a growing problem, with 85% of HIV-positive TB cases found in Africa in 2006. In Africa, HIV/AIDS and TB co-infection is a significant health challenge. In 2006, 606,000 African people were co-infected, with 205,000 deaths from TB, 89% of which were African. In high-burden countries, TB patients are not routinely tested for HIV, but HIV testing for TB patients has increased between 2002 and 2006. In 2006, 21,806 TB cases for HIV were reported, representing less than 1% of all TB cases. HIV testing of TB patients in Africa increased from 7.5% to 35% from 2004 to 2006, primarily driven by Kenya and South Africa. MDR-TB are TB organisms resistant to at least two first-line drugs due to poor treatment adherence or incorrect drug usage. MDR-TB is a concerning issue as patients are less likely to complete treatment regimens due to longer cure times, higher toxicity, and limited availability of treatments. Cure rates for non-resistant TB are higher (80-95%) compared to MDR-TB (50-60%). MDR-TB cure rates are lower (50-60%) compared to non-resistant TB (80-95%). WHO recommends treating MDR-TB patients separately from HIV/AIDS patients due to challenges in resource-limited settings. In 2006, WHO estimated almost 490,000 MDR-TB cases worldwide. Among the 490,000 MDR-TB cases worldwide, China, India, and Russia have the highest numbers. Russia has the greatest proportion of MDR-TB cases among new cases. 27 countries account for 86% of all global MDR-TB cases, with 15 of them in Eastern Europe. The WHO report provided insight into drug-resistant TB cases globally, with 27 countries accounting for 86% of cases. Limited data on resistance in Africa was noted, with only six countries included in the analysis. South Africa's data was used in illustrations but not in the analysis due to different methodology. In 2006, WHO estimated that 2% of all TB cases were MDR-TB. In 2006, WHO estimated that 2% of all TB cases were MDR-TB in Africa, 7% in the Western Pacific Region, and 19% in Eastern Europe. WHO found trends of MDR-TB cases declining in China and the United States, stable in Thailand and some parts of Vietnam, and increasing in the Republic of Korea and Peru. Notifications rates suggest weaknesses in TB control in Peru, while in Korea, the burden is shifting to the elderly with an increase in MDR-TB cases among new TB cases. The proportion of MDR-TB among new cases is increasing in two regions in the Russian Federation, with a slow decline in TB notification rates. WHO warns of undetected outbreaks of drug resistance in African countries due to limited laboratory capacity. MDR-TB patients in Africa are not routinely checked for HIV/AIDS, except in Botswana, Mozambique, and South Africa. In 2006, almost 90% of new MDR-TB cases in these countries occurred in high HIV-prevalent settings. XDR-TB occurs when MDR-TB becomes resistant to three or more second-line drugs. XDR-TB, a form of tuberculosis resistant to multiple second-line drugs, has a 30% treatment success rate in high-quality health facilities but is almost always fatal in low-resource settings. WHO estimates XDR-TB is widespread, with 45 countries reporting cases, most frequently in the former Soviet Union and Asia. In the United States, 4% of MDR-TB cases meet the criteria for XDR-TB, while in Latvia, 19% of cases are classified as XDR-TB. In Latvia, 19% of MDR-TB cases met the criteria for XDR-TB. An outbreak in South Africa in 2006 caused several deaths, with high mortality rates among XDR-TB patients. CDC and WHO assessed the situation, finding 53 cases of XDR-TB, all HIV/AIDS-positive, with only one patient surviving. Similar outbreaks are occurring in other African countries, with high mortality rates due to drug resistance. In Africa, there is a lack of routine TB screening for HIV/AIDS patients, leading to undetected cases. In South Africa, 5.6% of MDR-TB cases were identified as XDR-TB, with a higher rate in Kwazulu-Natal. Concerns exist about inaccurate testing and outdated methods, with Botswana confirming cases of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Officials urge those with chronic coughs or exposure to TB patients to seek testing. WHO has intensified efforts in southern Africa to address XDR-TB, with missions in Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland to improve surveillance and treatment. Countries like Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe have submitted national response plans to WHO. Lesotho has completed a rapid survey on suspected XDR-TB cases, while Botswana has started one. Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania are also planning to conduct surveys in the near future. Swaziland plans to start surveys soon, while Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania have ongoing anti-TB drug resistance surveys. Several countries in southern Africa are implementing measures to address XDR-TB, with Lesotho, Malawi, and Swaziland improving surveillance and treatment. Various U.S. agencies are involved in global TB interventions, with USAID leading efforts in over 35 countries. Funding for global TB initiatives is designated to USAID by Congress, while other agencies may use discretionary funds for support. USAID is the primary U.S. agency involved in global anti-TB efforts, providing training, funding research, coordinating interventions, addressing MDR-TB, and improving TB treatment management. Congress allocated increasing funds to USAID for international TB programs from FY2004 to FY2008, with a requested budget of $97.1 million for FY2009. CDC supports global TB efforts by providing epidemiologic, laboratory, and programmatic support to USAID, WHO, and the International Union Against TB and Lung Diseases. CDC provides support to USAID, WHO, and the International Union Against TB and Lung Diseases for global TB programs, including developing guidelines on TB prevention in resource-limited settings, strengthening laboratory capacity, and refining information on TB prevalence and incidence. CDC has spent an average of $2 million annually on global TB efforts since FY2004 and anticipates spending the same amount in FY2008 and FY2009. USAID also transferred $3.4 million in each of FY2006 and FY2007 to CDC for technical efforts in other countries. President Bush proposed $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR, authorized by P.L. 108-25. $10 billion is allocated to 15 Focus Countries, $4 billion to global TB programs and bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, and $1 billion for U.S. Global Fund contributions. Congress appropriates the majority of funds for PEPFAR. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) transfers funds from the GHAI account to implementing agencies and international partnerships like the Global Fund for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in 15 Focus Countries. OGAC reported transferring $48.4 million for TB projects in FY2006 and $131.0 million in FY2007. Congress directed OGAC to provide at least $150 million for joint HIV/TB programs through FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations. Organizations globally collaborate to combat TB following WHO guidelines. WHO is the leading authority for global health, responsible for setting norms, standards, and providing technical support to countries. In 1991, the World Health Assembly recognized TB as a major public health issue and set goals for TB control. In 1994, WHO recommended the use of the DOTS strategy to combat TB. The DOTS strategy for TB control has five key components: political commitment, TB detection, standardized treatment, effective drug supply, and monitoring systems. The Global Plan to Stop TB was launched in 2000, leading to over 20 million patients treated by 2004. Mortality from TB has decreased globally, with a treatment success rate of 83% among new cases by 2003. In 2005, WHO Member States passed a resolution advocating sustainable financing for TB control and prevention to achieve targets in the Millennium Development Goals. WHO estimates $56 billion is needed from 2006-2015 to implement the Global Plan to Stop TB. The estimated $56 billion needed to reverse the incidence of TB includes funds for expanding DOTS, DOTS-Plus initiatives, treating HIV/AIDS and TB co-infections, and research. Governments and donors are expected to provide 45% of the funds, leaving a funding gap of $31 billion. DOTS-Plus projects are operational in several countries with moderate to high levels of MDR-TB. The Working Group on DOTS-Plus for MDR-TB facilitated access to discounted second-line anti-TB drugs in countries like Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Nepal, Nicaragua, Romania, and Syria. The Green Light Committee reviews requests for treatments through DOTS-Plus projects to ensure compliance with international standards. The Stop TB Partnership aims to achieve universal access to high-quality TB diagnosis and treatment, reduce human suffering and socioeconomic burden, and protect vulnerable populations from TB, MDR-TB, and TB/HIV co-infections. The Stop TB Partnership aims to eradicate TB, protect vulnerable populations from TB, MDR-TB, and TB/HIV co-infections, and develop new TB treatment and diagnostic tools. It is comprised of international organizations, countries, donors, and governmental and non-governmental organizations. Seven Working Groups focus on TB-related issues such as advocacy, communication, DOTS expansion, MDR-TB, new TB diagnostics, new TB drugs, new TB vaccines, and TB/HIV/AIDS. Each group independently governs efforts to increase access to accurate diagnoses and effective treatments, expand availability of TB drugs, promote research for new TB drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines, and ensure effective use of these tools. The Global Drug Facility (GDF) is a financing mechanism housed in WHO that provides technical assistance and procurement of high-quality TB drugs at affordable prices. It works with countries to ensure proper use of funds, detection and monitoring of TB cases, and uninterrupted drug administration. The Global Fund also plays a role in TB treatment support. The Global Fund, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is a foundation that disburses resources for fighting diseases. It has approved over $10 billion for grants in 136 countries, making it a major donor for TB and malaria control and HIV/AIDS programs. About 17% of its grants target TB control and treatment, helping to detect 5 million TB cases and treat 3 million using the DOTS strategy. The Gates Foundation has provided $781 million to combat TB since 1999. The Gates Foundation has funded grants totaling $781 million since 1999 to combat TB globally. An additional $650 million has been pledged to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, with $350 million already paid. The grants focus on TB research, innovative strategies, new tools for control and prevention, and advocacy. U.S. spending on international TB initiatives has been around $90 million annually since FY2004. In FY2004, Congress appropriated $85.1 million to USAID for global TB efforts, with funding increasing in subsequent years. Congress provided $162.2 million in FY2008 for international TB programs. Some Members expressed concerns about potential impacts on other global health programs. Weak health systems and limited access to diagnostic tests are key factors contributing to the spread of TB in Africa. Limited access to rapid and accurate TB diagnostic tests in developing countries contributes to the rise in new TB cases. Sputum testing, the most widely used method, only detects 40-60% of TB cases and 20% of HIV co-infected cases. Health experts advocate for improved access to advanced testing technology to address this issue. Experts advocate for improved access to advanced testing technology as sputum tests do not reliably detect smear-negative TB cases, especially among HIV-positive patients. Culturing is the most definitive method for detecting TB, particularly in smear-negative cases. WHO recommends countries have at least one laboratory per 5 million people capable of culturing samples. South Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa meeting this criteria. Laboratories must be able to conduct drug susceptibility tests to prescribe medications properly and avoid drug resistance. In many countries, patients may face interruptions in TB treatments due to stock shortages at clinics. This can lead to reduced effectiveness of treatments, prolonged use of medication, and drug resistance. Health advocates stress the importance of consistent medication use to enhance the impact of TB programs. The African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 aims to improve health care capacity in Africa by training health workers, providing incentives for retention, and establishing off-site HIV/AIDS testing facilities. Shortages of trained health workers and equipped health centers in high-burden countries complicate TB containment efforts. High-burden countries lack sufficient health workers to meet basic healthcare needs, including TB treatment and drug monitoring. HIV prevalence in Africa complicates the issue, as HIV and TB patients are often housed together in poorly equipped facilities. WHO recommends separating HIV/AIDS and TB patients, training specialized health workers, and addressing the risk of HIV-positive health workers. Global health advocates urge Congress to increase support for health worker training, fund initiatives for indigenous health workers, and stop recruiting from countries with shortages. Concerns arise about the convergence of HIV/AIDS and TB in Africa, leading to high mortality rates. Early diagnosis and treatment can extend life expectancy. In Africa, early diagnosis and treatment of TB and HIV can extend life expectancy and decrease transmission rates. WHO urges routine testing of TB patients for HIV, but expresses concern that HIV patients are not routinely tested for TB. Testing all newly diagnosed HIV patients for TB could improve case identification, ameliorate outcomes, reduce costs, and make efforts more efficient. OGAC spent $50 million on TB efforts in 15 Focus Countries in FY2006 and $120 million on HIV/TB co-infection in FY2007. Health advocates urge Congress to increase funding for integrated programs. Health advocates urge Congress to increase funding for programs integrating HIV/AIDS and TB responses, with a directive for OGAC to allocate $150 million for joint HIV/TB programs. Support is needed for TB research to develop treatments with shorter regimens to improve adherence and reduce drug-resistant strains. Efforts are underway to develop new TB treatments effective against MDR-TB, curing patients in one to two months, and curing latent TB infection. Researchers aim to create affordable and easily managed drugs for resource-limited settings. Advocates stress the importance of congressional support for TB vaccine research, including efforts by organizations like Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation. They highlight the need for new diagnostic tests that can be easily used in low-resource settings, as current culturing methods are time-consuming and require advanced laboratory facilities. Efforts such as WHO's Tuberculosis Diagnostics Initiative are recommended for support. In 2007, Congress was urged to support the Comprehensive Tuberculosis Elimination Act and the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act, which aimed to fund research for TB vaccines, new treatments, and diagnostic tools for low-resource settings. The bills authorized significant funding for related foreign assistance programs. In FY2008 and FY2009, Congress authorized funding for foreign assistance programs and anti-TB programs at CDC. Debate on forcefully detaining XDR-TB patients has intensified, especially in South Africa. WHO stated that limiting human rights may be necessary to protect the public from XDR-TB threats. Human rights implications arise from forcefully isolating individuals in low-quality health facilities. Patients in South Africa protested poor treatment and prison-like conditions. Several provinces in South Africa have taken legal action to force drug-resistant TB patients to stay in hospitals in isolation units surrounded by wire fences and guards. The South African Medical Research Council (MRC) argues against coerced treatment for MDR- and XDR-TB patients due to low success rates and reduced life expectancy. Forced isolation is complicated by socio-economic factors, with about 25% of South Africans receiving social welfare. South African policy mandates that hospitalized patients lose government assistance, leading some MDR-TB patients to avoid hospitalization due to financial concerns. The Stop TB Partnership is studying the economic impacts of TB at household and macro levels in Africa, highlighting the intersection of poverty and tuberculosis. Urban slums with crowded, unsanitary conditions facilitate TB transmission. Around 1 billion people live in urban slums, expected to reach 2 billion in 30 years. In the poorest countries, 80% of the urban population live in slums. Some argue TB control should be part of poverty reduction strategies."
