    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Stable Oil Supply (SOS) Home Heating Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that over 35 percent of northeastern US families rely on oil for winter heating, facing price increases in 1989, 1996, and 1999. These spikes have impacted families, individuals on fixed incomes, rural residents, the elderly, farmers, truckers, and governments. The Act aims to ensure adequate stocks of home heating oil in the Northeast to meet winter demand and protect consumers from price spikes. The Act aims to ensure adequate stocks of home heating oil in the Northeast to meet winter demand and protect consumers from price spikes. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 152 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include definitions for home heating oil and the Northeast region. The term 'home heating oil' now includes No. 1 and No. 2 diesel and fuel oils. The Northeast region is defined as including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The term 'primary heating oil inventory' refers to inventory held by an importer, refiner, or wholesaler, excluding inventory held by a retailer for direct sale to end users. A 'wholesaler' is defined as a person who owns or operates a bulk terminal with a storage capacity of 50,000 barrels or more, stores home heating oil, and resells petroleum products to retail. The term 'winter season' refers to the months of November through March. This term is used in the context of reselling petroleum products to retail businesses or receiving petroleum products by tanker, barge, or pipeline. SEC. 4. HOME HEATING OIL RESERVE FOR THE NORTHEAST. Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include a new section for voluntary plans for a home heating oil reserve. Importers, refiners, and wholesalers in the Northeast are encouraged to develop voluntary plans to maintain minimum heating oil inventories to stabilize energy fuel markets and protect consumers from price fluctuations. Plans should be submitted to the Secretary within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will certify plans that are likely to achieve the purposes of the Act, and issue a statement for plans that are not likely to succeed. A report will be submitted to Congress within 240 days of enactment, detailing the reasons for certification or failure to certify a plan. The defense to antitrust actions is available for actions taken to develop and carry out a voluntary plan under subsection (a) if the plan is certified by the Secretary. The action must not be taken to harm competition. The defense to antitrust actions is available for actions taken to develop and carry out a voluntary plan certified by the Secretary. The importer, refiner, or wholesaler must be in compliance with the plan. The burden of proof lies with the person asserting the defense, except for proving actions taken to harm competition. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on the compliance of importers, refiners, and wholesalers in the Northeast market with certified voluntary plans for home heating oil supply. If certified plans are not implemented within 240 days, the Secretary will adopt and implement a plan in accordance with section 157B. \"SEC. 157B. HOME HEATING OIL RESERVE FOR THE NORTHEAST.\" The Secretary will establish a private home heating oil reserve for the Northeast if a certified plan is not implemented within 300 days. The Secretary will monitor supply levels to ensure each importer, refiner, and wholesaler has a required quantity of home heating oil available. The Secretary may require importers, refiners, or wholesalers to store a quantity of home heating oil to meet customer needs without causing sudden price increases. The storage quantity cannot exceed 95% of the average capacity available in the previous 2 years. If inventory levels are insufficient, the Secretary can direct them to acquire and store more oil. The Secretary can mandate importers, refiners, or wholesalers to store a necessary quantity of home heating oil to meet Northeast heating needs and prevent sudden price increases. Regulations will be enacted to enforce this requirement and ensure cooperation with State energy authorities. Excess inventory at the end of each winter season will be addressed. The Administrator of the EPA will facilitate the sale of excess heating oil inventories at the end of each winter season. The Secretary will ensure that the implementation supports a competitive petroleum industry. A report on compliance with the plan will be submitted to Congress within a year."
