The alliance aims to assist homeowners in distress and create a unified plan. The ASF Plan, proposed by the American Securitization Forum, is a key aspect of the alliance. This report examines the ASF Plan and discusses potential liability concerns for servicers. The voluntary Framework aims to provide guidance for servicers in streamlining borrower evaluation procedures and utilizing foreclosure prevention efforts. It applies to subprime mortgages originated between January 1, 2005, and July 31, 2007, with adjustable interest rates. The voluntary Framework provides guidance for servicers on subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates. It applies to mortgages with introductory fixed-rate periods of less than 36 months, first interest rate resets scheduled between January 1, 2008, and July 31, 2010, and that have been securitized on the secondary market. The Framework does not apply to interest-only mortgages or prime mortgages. Servicers can separate borrowers into three segments, with Segment 1 for borrowers with current loans eligible for refinancing into FHA, FHA Secure, or private mortgage products. Segment 2 is for borrowers with mortgages meeting specific requirements who may not qualify for refinancing. Borrowers must be current on payments, reside in the secured residences, have credit scores below 660, and face a mortgage payment increase of more than 10% after reset. Qualifying borrowers receive a \"fast track\" loan modification with an interest rate freeze lasting five years to allow time for refinancing. The fast track rate freeze is designed to help borrowers and lenders refinance into more affordable loans to prevent defaults and reduce homes for sale in a saturated market. Servicers can efficiently apply this rate freeze to eligible borrowers based on financial data. For mortgages that do not qualify for other segments, servicers can conduct individualized analysis to mitigate losses. Servicers of securitized mortgages not covered by the Framework can perform loan modifications according to service contracts. The Framework provides guidance for servicers to identify borrowers at risk of default and offer refinancing, loan modifications, and loss mitigation measures in line with governing service contracts. Pooling and Servicing Agreements (PSAs) govern the relationship between MBS trustees, investors, and servicers, allowing servicers to modify loans if default is foreseeable and increases the net present value of the mortgage. In 2007, loan servicers and policymakers recognized the challenge of upcoming payment resets overwhelming resources for voluntary modifications. Individual loan analysis for NPV test comparison was time-consuming and costly, leading to the need for a faster approach to help borrowers in need. The Framework aimed to facilitate fast track loan modifications for broad swaths of mortgages to assist borrowers in need efficiently. However, servicers hesitated due to potential tax, accounting, and contract liabilities from secondary market investors and federal regulators, which could deter them from engaging in loss mitigation efforts. The HOPE NOW Alliance sought opinions from the IRS and SEC regarding tax and accounting implications of loan modifications to address potential liabilities that could deter servicers from engaging in loss mitigation efforts outlined in the ASF Plan. The IRS stated it would not challenge the tax status of affected trusts, providing assurance to participants of the ASF. The IRS issued Rev. Proc 2008-28 to clarify tax issues related to modification of securitized mortgage loans, ensuring that loan modifications meeting specific criteria will not affect the tax status of trusts holding securitized loans. Conditions outlined include the mortgage being for a single-family dwelling, owner-occupied, with overdue mortgages making up less than 10% of trust assets at start-up. The SEC provided a letter in 2008 stating it would not object to loan modifications under FAS 140, but did not pass judgment on alternative plans or third party rights. The IRS's tax opinion and SEC's accounting opinion may need updates if plan features change. Servicers offering fast track loan modifications could still face objections. Fast track loan modifications may face objections from secondary mortgage market investors challenging servicers for contract violations if gains from avoiding foreclosures do not outweigh losses from freezing payments at lower rates. Investors could argue that modifications did not increase the NPV of the trust, breaching the governing PSA. Data from the HOPE NOW Alliance shows the number of initiated loan modifications and repayment plans. The data shows a steady increase in loan modifications and formal repayment plans per quarter since the issuance of the Framework. Total workout plans rose from 398,691 in Q3 2007 to 502,520 in Q1 2008. In April 2008, an additional 182,901 mortgages received workout plans, bringing the total to 1,558,854 compared to 573,133 foreclosure sales. It is unclear how many of these measures were made pursuant to the ASF Plan. The majority of loan modifications before the ASF Plan were likely based on individualized analysis and agreements, similar to the ASF Plan but specific to California. It is uncertain how many modifications in Q1 2008 were fast track modifications. In Q1 2008, only 14,418 subprime mortgages with hybrid ARMs were modified, possibly due to decreased short term rates like the LIBOR, reducing the \"reset shock\" and preventing a 10% payment increase for fast track modifications. The falling rates likely kept subprime mortgage payments affordable for borrowers, reducing the need for fast track modifications. The limited necessity of modifications under current conditions may lead to proposals to change the ASF Plan, potentially triggering another round of requests for SEC and IRS letters. Different root causes of mortgage problems in various regions complicate finding a uniform solution. For example, subprime loans are a small share of California's total loans, but alternative mortgages are prevalent in the prime and Alt-A markets. The rapid increase in prime and Alt-A loan delinquencies in California and other states with rising house prices may prompt a reevaluation of limiting focus to subprime or adjustable rate loans. Arguments for new programs addressing specific regional issues could arise."
