    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smart Electronics Act\" and includes findings. The International Energy Agency predicts a significant increase in energy consumption by new electronic gadgets, potentially tripling by 2030. These gadgets already make up 15% of household electricity usage, costing $80 billion last year, projected to reach $200 billion annually by 2030. The majority of this growth will occur in developing countries with lower gadget ownership rates. The proliferation of electronic gadgets is projected to triple by 2030, posing a threat to energy security and greenhouse gas emissions. Existing technologies could reduce energy consumption by more than 30%, with potential for further savings through governmental policies and programs like Energy Star. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" and does not contain any additional information to summarize. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator (referring to the head of the EPA), Consumer electronics (everyday electronic devices), Secretary (referring to the head of the Department of Energy), and Smart electronics (energy-efficient consumer electronics with specific features). The Act defines key terms related to energy-efficient consumer electronics, including on-demand processing speed, off-peak operation, low power modes, and efficiency with multiple functions on semiconductors. Within 1 year of enactment, the Secretary and Administrator must submit a report to Congress assessing the integration of smart electronics in Energy Star products, consumer electronics growth and energy consumption, potential energy and cost savings from focusing on smart electronics, and ranking cost-effective smart electronics technologies. SEC. 5. INCORPORATION OF SMART ELECTRONICS IN ENERGY STAR PROGRAM. The Secretary and the Administrator will develop a smart electronics emphasis in the Energy Star program. SEC. 6. ENERGY STAR SMART ELECTRONICS REGISTRY. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish a Smart Electronics Registry within the Energy Star program for manufacturers and sellers to register their smart electronics products. This registry will include testing protocols for product qualification and criteria for sales location labeling. States can enact stricter smart electronics standards than those established in this section."
