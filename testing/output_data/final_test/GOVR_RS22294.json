    "content": "The Social Security Act of 1935 did not initially include monthly survivors benefits but later established them in the Social Security Amendments of 1939. These benefits were expanded to include widows, parents, and children, with a reduction in lump-sum death payments. Coverage for survivors benefits is based on the insurance status of the deceased worker. To qualify for survivors benefits, a worker must have a sufficient work history in covered employment and earn at least one credit for each year between age 21 and turning 62, dying, or becoming disabled. Fully insured workers have at least 40 credits, and in 2017, 87% of Americans over 20 were fully insured. Spouses, former spouses, children, and parents of fully insured workers are eligible for survivors benefits if they meet the requirements. Survivors benefits are available to the children and former spouse of a deceased worker who was currently insured at the time of death. The benefits are based on the deceased worker's average lifetime earnings, with higher earners resulting in higher benefits. The benefit formula is progressive, providing a higher proportion of wages for lower earners. Survivors benefits are determined based on the deceased worker's primary insurance amount (PIA) and are subject to reductions. Eligible family members can receive benefits starting from the month of the beneficiary's death. Surviving spouses of fully insured workers must meet age requirements to qualify. Surviving spouses of fully insured workers must meet age requirements to be eligible for widow's or widower's benefits. Divorced surviving spouses may also qualify if married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years. They receive 100% of the worker's PIA if they start collecting benefits at full retirement age. Widow(er)s may receive reduced benefits if claimed early, ranging from 71.5% at age 60 to 100% at full retirement age. Disabled widow(er)s can receive benefits as early as 50 years old. Benefits are not paid if the spouse remarries before eligibility. If a worker is receiving reduced benefits due to claiming benefits before full retirement age, the widow(er) benefit cannot exceed the worker's reduced benefit amount. Benefits are increased at death to take into account delayed retirement credits from claiming benefits after full retirement age, thereby increasing the widow(er) benefit. Unmarried surviving spouses of insured workers may be entitled to mother's or father's benefits if not eligible for widow(er)'s benefits. The spouse, divorced spouses, mother, father, surviving children, grandchildren, step-children, and parents of deceased insured workers may be eligible for various benefits. These benefits include child's benefits for unmarried children under 18 (or under 19 if still in high school), disabled children, and dependent grandchildren. Parents may also qualify for parent's benefits. The parent's benefits are available to surviving parents of fully insured workers over the age of 62 who were financially dependent on the deceased worker. The benefits amount to 82.5% of the worker's PIA for one parent and 75% for each parent if both are eligible. The total survivors benefits paid to a worker's family are capped at 150% to 188% of the worker's PIA, with reductions for excess amounts and for beneficiaries working before full retirement age. Divorced widow(er) benefits do not count towards the maximum. The survivor beneficiaries' benefits can be reduced if they are younger than full retirement age and earn above certain limits. Government pension offset (GPO) affects beneficiaries who have worked in non-covered employment, reducing their benefits. A one-time death benefit of $255 is available to the deceased worker's family, with the lump-sum payment going to the surviving spouse. The death benefit is paid to the insured worker's surviving spouse or children who qualify for child's benefits. If no eligible spouse or child exists, the lump-sum death payment will not be paid."
