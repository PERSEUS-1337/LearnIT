    "content": "Natural, accidental, or intentional hazards can lead to disasters with varying severity and consequences. Local, state, or tribal governments usually handle these disasters without federal support, especially in the first 72 hours. However, the federal government can provide significant assistance through deployable federal assets as needed. This report explores various federal assets that can aid in disaster response, offering support for different types of consequences such as radiological exposure or command and control assistance. This report analyzes key concepts related to deployable federal assets, including their definition, usage in response operations, guiding authorities and policies, and level of federal support. It also discusses potential issues for Congress to consider regarding authorization and funding for these assets, such as policy benefits, staffing models, financing methods, operational control, and challenges faced by Congress. The report provides summaries of deployable federal assets, including information on authorization, funding, and past uses in disasters. These assets consist of specially trained federal employees who support disaster response operations in communities, offering unique capabilities not always available at the local or state level. Deployable federal assets are specialized personnel and capabilities that can supplement overwhelmed capabilities in disasters. These assets provide federally owned commodities like power generation or telecommunications equipment and can deploy quickly to no-notice incidents. They are colloquially known as the federal government's \"first responders.\" Deployable federal assets, also known as the federal government's \"first responders\" to disasters, include specialized personnel and capabilities that can supplement overwhelmed resources. However, some assets like the National Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces are not federal employees but can be deployed in a federal capacity with FEMA's direction. Other forms of federal assistance, such as financial, logistics, and technical support, are not included in the term deployable federal assets. Deployable federal assets, also known as the federal government's \"first responders\" to disasters, include specialized personnel and capabilities that can supplement overwhelmed resources. This term does not include federal personnel already permanently deployed nationwide, like FAA air traffic controllers and DHS field personnel performing essential homeland security duties regularly. The U.S. Coast Guard and scientific government agencies provide emergency management and homeland security capabilities during disasters. Local, state, or tribal governments typically provide resources for disaster response, following federalism principles. During disasters, local, state, or tribal governments may be overwhelmed and request assistance through mutual-aid agreements before seeking federal help. To obtain federal assistance for unmet needs after a disaster, an official request must be made through the relevant jurisdictional chain, such as from a city to county, county to state, and then state to federal government. Tribal governments can appeal directly to the federal government or seek assistance from a state or local government first. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act outlines the process for requesting assistance. In some cases, the federal government may provide assistance without a formal request. The federal government may provide immediate assistance without a formal request, especially in situations involving issues or hazards under federal responsibility. The Department of Defense has regulations allowing for immediate assistance without a formal request through the \"immediate response authority.\" The Department of Defense has regulations allowing for immediate assistance without a formal request through the \"immediate response authority\" in response to serious conditions. The federal government scales its support for disaster response operations to prevent waste of resources and avoid overwhelming the community with excess assets. The federal government may deny requests for more resources from local, state, and tribal governments under the Stafford Act process. This could result in denial of major disaster declarations or specific types of federal assistance. In extreme disasters, all federal resources could be directed to support response operations. The Department of Defense can also provide support under its \"inherent emergency power.\" The federal government can use its \"inherent emergency power\" to deploy federal resources without prior funding from Congress. Detailed government plans for maximum response capacity are likely classified for national security reasons. Public information, such as a 2011 FEMA draft, gives insight into the potential consequences the federal government is preparing to address. In a Preparedness Goal, FEMA outlined a \"meta-scenario\" of a no-notice event impacting seven million people across multiple states. Severe damage to critical infrastructure is expected, with 195,000 projected fatalities and 265,000 survivors needing medical attention. 25% of the population will require mass care and sheltering. This scenario was simplified in the final National Preparedness Goal as a \"no-notice, cascading incident.\" The curr_chunk discusses the development of national and regional catastrophic plans by FEMA and the DOD to improve understanding of capacity for disaster response. It also mentions the wide array of deployable federal assets across departments and agencies, without providing a comprehensive list. The specific authority for each deployable federal asset is discussed later in the report. The curr_chunk discusses the essential assistance authority provided by the Stafford Act for deployable federal assets during major disasters and emergencies. The federal government can provide assistance to supplement State and local efforts to save lives and protect property. The Stafford Act provides legal justification for federal resources to support response operations during disasters. The National Response Framework guides the nation's response to all types of disasters and emergencies, including large-scale terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The National Response Framework (NRF) guides response operations at all levels of government and the private sector. It establishes 14 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) to organize national response capabilities. The NRF outlines specific responsibilities of federal agencies through supplementary documents like the Federal Interagency Operational Plan (FIOP) and various annexes. The Response FIOP identifies federal response requirements and capabilities, often fulfilled by deployable federal assets. The NRF is closely linked with the Stafford Act, providing legal justification for federal resources during disasters. The National Response Framework (NRF) is always in effect and does not require a formal Stafford Act declaration to be used. It can manage any disaster requiring federal coordination, incorporating the National Incident Management System (NIMS) as a central guideline. NIMS, mandated for the federal government and encouraged for state and local governments, integrates the Incident Command System (ICS) for standardized response operations. The National Response Framework (NRF) incorporates the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) for standardized response operations in disasters. NIMS establishes a scalable response structure for all jurisdictions, agencies, and organizations to ensure a unified response. Defense Support for Civilian Authorities (DSCA) regulations guide the use of DOD deployable federal assets in accordance with legal requirements. Various incident-specific planning guidelines, like the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, provide critical guidance on the use of federal assets for specific incidents. The report discusses policy issues related to the authorization and funding of deployable federal assets by Congress. It also explores theoretical benefits and disadvantages of deploying these assets, rooted in macroeconomic and social science theory. The federalism structure of the nation plays a significant role in shaping these benefits and disadvantages, which may also apply to state-provided deployable assets. Authorization and appropriation of deployable assets by state legislatures and the federal government can provide similar benefits and disadvantages. Deployable federal assets serve as a form of risk pooling, allowing the nation to combine uncorrelated hazard risks and response capabilities. For example, the federal government's resourcing of DOD Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Response Forces helps manage the risk of various hazards across different communities. Risk pooling at different government levels, including federal, state, and tribal, allows communities to share resources and response capabilities for hazards. This collaboration reduces costs and ensures access to deployable federal assets like U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Planning and Response Teams at a lower cost due to economies of scale. Reductions in production costs may occur at the federal level due to efficiencies gained in training and equipping a larger number of units. However, the establishment of deployable federal assets may lead to moral hazard, where non-federal actors increase their risk exposure expecting federal response capabilities. This moral hazard is a concern with most forms of federal disaster assistance, including financial aid. The establishment of federal firefighting capabilities may deter other actors from mitigating wildfire risk and crowd out investment in response capabilities by other sectors. Federal investments in response capabilities could raise costs for non-federal actors and limit their ability to develop their own capabilities. The government's investment in Federal Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMATs) may crowd out other actors in emergency management by dominating the supply of skilled managers and driving up costs. This could transfer financial responsibility to the federal government but may reduce private sector investment in response capabilities, impacting the nation's risk profile. The government's investment in Federal Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMATs) may reduce private sector investment in response capabilities, increasing taxpayer costs. Congress should evaluate cost-effectiveness of staffing deployable federal assets. The government's investment in Federal Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMATs) may reduce private sector investment in response capabilities, increasing taxpayer costs. Congress should evaluate cost-effectiveness of staffing deployable federal assets. Deployable assets are staffed through conditional employment and dedicated versus multiuse staffing models, which can impact effectiveness and turnover ratios. The employee's job revolves around their responsibilities with the deployable federal asset. They may have additional duties in a multiuse staffing model, but are dedicated solely to the mission of the deployable asset during activations or trainings. Different staffing models, such as full-time dedication for Federal Coordinating Officers and Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinators, are compared for cost-effectiveness based on frequency of use and specialized training requirements. The \"federalization\" or \"activation\" employment model involves deploying employees who are not regularly employed by the federal government, but may be public employees of other government entities or private citizens with specialized skills. The President or federal government official can activate the asset, pay employee salaries while deployed, and grant authority. The \"federalization\" or \"activation\" employment model involves deploying non-federal employees with specialized skills, who may be public employees or private citizens. This model allows for the payment of salaries, benefits, and protections to these employees while deployed. Additionally, it may receive federal funding for training and equipment. The National Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces and components of the National Disaster Medical System use variations of this staffing model. Benefits include leveraging non-federal expertise in national response operations, cost-effectiveness, and limiting federal expenditures when the asset is not in use. However, challenges include managing the quality of training and capabilities of personnel, as well as integrating the asset into operations. The costs to maintain a deployable federal response asset are predictable and funded through annual appropriations. Deployment costs for providing direct assistance to communities may not have regular funding mechanisms, leading to unpredictable costs. Congress or agencies have developed mechanisms to cover deployment costs for some incidents and assets, while others may require supplemental appropriations or funding from annual budgets. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a common source of deployment funding for direct federal assistance authorized by the Stafford Act. FEMA officials may direct federal agencies to provide assistance to affected communities through mission assignments, with costs reimbursed through the DRF. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) covers at least 75% of costs for federal assistance during Stafford Act declared incidents. FEMA may not pay for assets deployment if it's a normal agency activity or if there's a more specific authority for emergency assistance. During Stafford Act declared incidents, federal agencies may need alternative funding for emergency protective measures. In non-Stafford Act incidents like National Special Security Events, federal response assets may still be deployed, but costs are not covered by the Stafford Act or other blanket funding mechanisms. Responsible agencies typically cover deployment costs for such events. Federal agencies are usually limited to using their administrative budgets for asset deployment costs and are not allowed to seek outside funding without congressional authorization. This restriction, known as augmentation of appropriations, can hinder agencies from accepting private funding or unreimbursed assistance for deployments. Congress may address funding challenges for federal agencies by providing supplemental appropriations, as seen in the 2009 influenza pandemic. There is no precedent for a major disaster declaration in response to an infectious disease incident, and no federal mechanism to cover healthcare costs in disaster response. Congress provided supplemental appropriations for disaster response, including funding for the 2009 influenza pandemic and unreimbursed healthcare costs from Hurricane Katrina. Two trust funds managed by the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA finance federal responses to oil spills or hazardous substance releases. The federal government can recover response costs from liable parties to replenish the trust funds. The federal government provides disaster assistance and deployable assets at the request of state or tribal governments. Federal resources are provided based on the needs identified by local or state incident commanders, following federalism principles. This approach allows for a lesser degree of executive decision-making by federal officials. The federal government provides disaster assistance based on the needs identified by local or state incident commanders. Congress may consider granting the federal government more decision-making power in incidents to improve coordination and apply lessons learned from past disasters. Granting the federal government more decision-making power in disaster response may improve coordination and prioritize national implications. However, it could discourage state and local entities from requesting assistance, sideline local expertise, and potentially lead to breakdowns in the response structure. The challenges in Congress's oversight of federal operations include limited reporting on the use of deployable federal assets, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in supporting response operations. Analyzing the benefits of these assets is complicated due to the uniqueness of each disaster and the lack of specificity in authorizations and appropriations for them. The limited specification of deployable federal assets, stemming from vague authorizations and appropriations, hinders oversight and reporting. This lack of detail makes it challenging for Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of these assets in disaster response. The recommendations from after-action reports (AARs) and their implementation can inform Congress on the use of deployable federal assets in disaster response. AARs are developed by state and federal governments after incidents and exercises, but may lack independent objectivity. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified opportunities to enhance oversight provided by DHS. Opportunities exist to enhance oversight of resolving capability gaps identified in exercises and incidents. AARs and AAR-IPs highlight federal challenges, but tracking problem resolution is lacking. Congress can use AARs to identify thematic issues and shortcomings in federal assets. Sensitivity to national security may hinder Congress's oversight using AARs and AAR-IPs. The report provides brief summaries of deployable federal assets that can support disaster response operations. It is not comprehensive and does not include specialized law enforcement or cyber-related response teams. Table 1 reviews basic information in each summary. Federal Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMATs) are a new federal asset managed by FEMA, evolving from Emergency Response Teams (ERTs). IMATs provide on-scene incident command capabilities and work with affected communities to identify and fulfill initial federal assistance needs. IMATs are a core command structure for federal assistance in response operations, assisting state and local management. FEMA trains IMATs for CBRNE incidents and they can deploy for disasters, special events, and exercises. FEMA is revising the structure and operations of IMATs based on lessons from Hurricane Sandy, with plans for 3 national and 13 regional IMATs. FEMA is restructuring IMATs post-Hurricane Sandy, with plans for 3 national and 13 regional teams. Each national IMAT will have an ICS structure led by an SES member and staffed by FEMA employees and team members from different departments. Regional IMATs will have specialized personnel and deploy within 2 hours to support response operations. The revised structure is being implemented for several teams and is expected to be fully in place by FY2016. The restructuring of FEMA's IMATs post-Hurricane Sandy includes plans for 3 national and 13 regional teams, with specialized personnel and funding from the Disaster Relief Fund. The new structure is expected to be fully implemented by FY2016. FEMA estimates that the annual costs of maintaining the new IMAT structure will be $31.6 million, with an additional $19 million in one-time capital costs. The IMATs deployed during Hurricane Sandy were different from the current design by FEMA. Since then, newly constructed IMATs have been deployed to incidents nationwide, such as the response to the Washington State mudslide in March 2014. A Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) is responsible for coordinating federal resources during disaster response operations. The FCO leads the federal government's response and works with various federal departments and agencies to deliver assistance. Defense assets may be involved in the response, with a Defense Coordinating Element (DCE) supporting the FCO. The formal cadre of FCOs was established in 1999 to improve coordination during disasters. The Federal Coordinating Officers (FCOs) are full-time employees of FEMA, with approximately 40 FCOs assigned to disasters. They have a long history and are directly authorized by the Stafford Act. In contrast, the Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinators (FDRCs) were established more recently and serve a coordinating purpose similar to FCOs in providing federal disaster recovery assistance. FDRCs, approximately 10 in number, are not required for every disaster declaration like FCOs, but are deployed selectively for long-term recovery. The Federal Coordinating Officers (FCOs) are FEMA employees authorized by the Stafford Act to coordinate federal resources for disaster recovery. States and tribes receiving a Stafford Act declaration may appoint a Coordinating Officer to fulfill similar roles. The cost of maintaining FCOs and Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinators (FDRCs) is funded by the DRF, with FEMA requesting funding for 55 FCOs/FDRCs for FY2016. Specific budget figures for FCOs/FDRCs have not been publicly reported by FEMA. FEMA estimates that the cost of maintaining and deploying 55 FCOs/FDRCs is approximately $12.9 million in a fiscal year. The FCOs and FDRCs are supported by an Office of the Federal Disaster Coordinating Officer (OFDC) in FEMA, which is responsible for hiring, training, equipping, managing, and evaluating them. FEMA estimates that the OFDC will cost $5.9 million in FY2016. FCOs are assigned to every Stafford Act declaration and support disaster response operations nationwide. The National Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) Task Forces, designated by FEMA, provide specialized assistance in locating survivors after disasters. They are deployable federal assets funded and trained by the government. The U.S. Coast Guard handles maritime search and rescue operations. National US&R Task Forces are federally funded and trained entities that provide specialized assistance in disaster response. They work to stabilize structures, locate survivors, and provide medical care. Task Forces can deploy quickly and integrate with other search and rescue teams. There are 28 Task Forces in the US, ready for deployment within 4 to 6 hours. Each US&R Task Force in the United States can deploy as Type I (70 personnel) or Type III (28 personnel) configurations. Task Forces are encouraged to maintain a full roster of 210 personnel for quick deployment. Unit members have expertise in various skillsets such as engineering, emergency medicine, canine handling, firefighting, hazardous material handling, communications, and logistics. Additionally, there are three national Incident Support Teams (ISTs) comprised of specialists available for rapid deployment to disaster areas to provide advice, management, and coordination of US&R Task Forces. The federal role in urban search and rescue efforts has evolved over time, stemming from the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977. FEMA plays a key role as the lead agency for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. Task Forces, including specially trained canine units, are appointed as temporary federal volunteers for liability protection and worker's compensation when activated by FEMA. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Congress and FEMA expanded the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in 1990. This included developing federal interagency plans for earthquake response in high-risk areas, ensuring emergency resources availability. In 2006, Congress authorized the Urban Search and Rescue Response System in FEMA, allowing coordination of US&R Task Forces during federal service. US&R Task Forces are funded by the federal government and sponsoring agencies, such as city fire departments. Task Forces must have agreements with DHS/FEMA for preparedness and response, with costs shared between the federal government and sponsoring agencies. FEMA provides funding for Task Forces deployed in response to disasters under the Stafford Act. The deployment of US&R Task Forces in response to disasters is funded through the DRF, with federal funding designated in appropriation bills for the National US&R Response System. Congress allocated approximately $41.3 million in FY2012, and $35.2 million each in FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015. FEMA has requested $27.5 million for FY2016. Deployment costs for Task Force teams are covered by the Disaster Relief Fund for Stafford Act declarations. Task Forces have been deployed for various events, including the Oklahoma City bombing, 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Haiti Earthquake, and Hurricane Sandy. Between 1992 and 2010, National US&R Task Forces responded to 53 incidents, with over 316 deployments in Type I and III configurations. In response to the 2005 Madrid train bombings, the TSA developed the VIPR program to enhance security in transportation. VIPR teams collaborate with federal, state, and local agencies to protect national assets and critical infrastructure. The VIPR program in the transportation domain includes DHS assets like security inspectors, canine teams, Air Marshals, and TSA officers. DNDO provides nuclear detection equipment. VIPR deployments are coordinated through TSA's joint center in Arlington, VA, using threat assessments for prioritization. Deployments are based on TSA's authority to protect transportation infrastructure. The VIPR teams, authorized under the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, can augment security for all modes of transportation in the US. TSA consults with local officials and transportation entities before deploying VIPR teams. In FY2013 and FY2014, Congress allocated funds for 37 VIPR teams, with a reduction to 33 teams planned for FY2015. TSA proposed transferring positions to consolidate Surface Inspectors and VIPR teams under one program. The FY2015 appropriation for surface transportation security inspectors was $3 million less than requested, with a directive to further reduce VIPR teams to 31. VIPR teams are deployed to high-profile events targeted by terrorist groups. VIPR teams are often deployed to high-profile events and key transportation facilities as a deterrent against terrorist activities. In FY2013, the teams conducted over 15,260 operations primarily for deterrence rather than as a response to real incidents. They provide a surge capability for disaster response, focusing on surface modes like transit systems and intercity rail. In FY2013, VIPR teams focused on surface modes, including transit systems and intercity rail, with over 10,000 operations in surface transportation. After the LAX shooting incident, TSA adjusted VIPR deployment to split evenly between surface and aviation modes. In FY2015, VIPR teams were formally aligned with surface transportation security, while FAMS and airport law enforcement handle aviation incident response. Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) are field operatives who work with state Homeland Security Advisors, law enforcement officials, and critical infrastructure stakeholders. They help enhance the security of critical infrastructure assets by establishing relationships, inventorying assets, and providing situational awareness to DHS. There are 94 advisors in the field, with at least one in each state and Puerto Rico, along with 7 advisors at DHS headquarters. The Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) work to enhance the security of critical infrastructure assets by coordinating requests for DHS training, grants, and vulnerability assessments. They act as Infrastructure Liaisons between state/local emergency operations centers and FEMA's Joint Field Office, assessing damage and prioritizing recovery efforts. The program is authorized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) are authorized by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to coordinate efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets. The PSAs work with state and local agencies, the private sector, and other entities to promote security and resilience. The anticipated cost of the PSA program in FY2015 is $33.3 million. PSAs have been used to support disaster response operations by assisting in prioritizing requests for critical assets. The Protective Security Advisors (PSAs) coordinate efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets, working with state and local agencies, the private sector, and other entities. They assist in disaster response operations by prioritizing requests for critical assets and helping to coordinate the restoration of critical infrastructure. PSAs deploy to emergency operations centers to communicate with infrastructure owners and operators, applying their expertise to reduce damages and enable rapid system restoration. The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps is a branch of the U.S. uniformed services, separate from the armed services. The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps is a branch of the U.S. uniformed services, under the authority of the U.S. Surgeon General. Officers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and engineers, serve in federal agencies or support public health activities. With over 6,500 health professionals, officers may conduct research, provide healthcare services, or participate in deployments for public health activities. The USPHS Commissioned Corps officers participate in short- or long-term deployments for public health activities, including disease outbreak response, global vaccination campaigns, and disaster response. They are part of incident response teams providing rapid deployment and various public health services. Corps officers, as uniformed services officers, have more stringent requirements than civil service employees, being on call 24/7 and subject to reassignment and relocation as needed. The USPHS Commissioned Corps officers are subject to involuntary deployment, fitness standards, and medical treatments. They can be armed by order of the President for war or emergencies. Militarization occurred during World War II. Officers are entitled to military and veterans benefits, with salaries paid by employing agencies. Deployment costs may be reimbursed by HHS or another responsible party, such as the DRF for FEMA missions under the Stafford Act. The USPHS Commissioned Corps officers can be deployed under the authority of the Stafford Act. Congress has provided authority to establish a USPHS \"Ready Reserve Corps\" to augment existing personnel during disasters. Deployment of Corps officers is common, with teams from the Office of Force Readiness and Deployment being involved. In 2005, over 2,400 officers were deployed for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita responses, setting up field hospitals and conducting disease surveillance. The USPHS Commissioned Corps officers are deployed for various tasks during public health emergencies, including setting up treatment centers and conducting disease surveillance. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is maintained by the federal government to provide medicine and medical supplies for emergencies, managed by the CDC. The SNS contains assets valued at over $6.3 billion, including antibiotics, vaccines, and treatments for diseases like anthrax and smallpox. The CDC manages the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) containing over $6.3 billion in assets for emergencies. Governors can request SNS supplies, delivered within 12 hours of deployment decision. The CDC's Stockpile Service Advance Group (SSAG) assists in managing and maintaining supplies. Local authorities assume stewardship of supplies, provided free of charge by the federal government. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) contains over $6.3 billion in assets for emergencies. The federal government provides SNS supplies free of charge, but local authorities are responsible for storage, distribution, and dispensing costs. Congress mandated the creation of the stockpile in 1999, and the name was changed to SNS in 2002. The stockpile includes drugs, vaccines, medical devices, and other supplies to ensure emergency health security in the event of a bioterrorist attack. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) contains over $6.3 billion in assets for emergencies, including drugs, vaccines, and medical supplies. The SNS is administered by the CDC Office of Public Health Preparedness and funded through various acts of Congress. The stockpile is configured for flexible deployment, with some supplies held in ready-to-transport containers called Push Packs. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) contains pharmaceuticals, antidotes, and medical supplies in Push Packs for rapid response to emergencies. These Push Packs are strategically located in secure warehouses and can be deployed within 12 hours of a federal decision. Other stockpile assets can be tailored to specific needs and may be vendor-managed or stored in federal caches. The SNS is deployed for major disasters and National Special Security Events. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) contains pharmaceuticals, antidotes, and medical supplies for rapid response to emergencies. Assets may be pre-positioned for disasters and events like the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The Forest Service (FS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides emergency response assistance, including firefighting support. The Forest Service (FS) provides various forms of disaster response assistance, including firefighting support, fire suppression, command and control support, emergency road clearing, logistics facility support, radio/communications system support, and cache support for mass care shelters. This assistance is carried out by wildfire suppression crews, such as Type 1 Interagency Hotshot Crews (IHC), which are highly trained and placed in rugged terrain on active wildfires. Interagency Hotshot Crews (IHC) are highly trained wildfire suppression crews sponsored by various agencies, including the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Park Service. They are a national shared resource coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Nonfederal crews operated by states and local governments must also meet IHC standards to be recognized. In addition to IHCs, other suppression crew levels may be deployed for disaster assistance, and Incident Management Teams (IMT) provide qualified personnel to manage complex incidents. The Forest Service coordinates federal firefighting activities under the National Response Framework, serving as the primary agency for Emergency Support Function #4\u2014firefighting. This includes providing personnel, equipment, and supplies for wildland, rural, and urban fires during all-hazard incidents. Different levels of federally-sponsored Incident Management Teams (IMTs) are utilized, such as Type 1 IMTs, Type 2 IMTs, and National Incident Management Organization (NIMO) IMTs. The Forest Service collaborates with various agencies for firefighting operations, including federal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area agencies. They work closely with other federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department to manage wildfires. The FS has broad authorities to respond to disasters and manage wildfires on federal, state, and private lands. They have cooperative agreements with states and are authorized by the Organic Administration Act of 1897 to manage wildfires on National Forest System lands. The Forest Service collaborates with various agencies for firefighting operations, including federal, state, tribal, territorial, and insular area agencies. They have cooperative agreements with states and other countries for wildfire protection and response to emergencies. The FS received over $2 billion in wildfire management appropriations annually for the last five years, supporting not only fire fighting but also response to other hazards like Hurricane Sandy. The Forest Service deployed wildfire suppression crews to assist with emergency response in five states affected by Hurricane Sandy. Approximately 1,100 personnel, including 950 FS employees, were involved in activities such as emergency road clearing, power restoration support, and debris removal. They cleared fallen trees from over 900 miles of road, provided assistance at FEMA logistics facilities, and supported local emergency response agencies. The Department of Defense also has capabilities that can be deployed in emergency situations. The Department of Defense has a range of capabilities that can be deployed in support of civil authorities during emergencies, known as Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA). DSCA involves support provided by US Federal military forces, Department of Defense civilians, and National Guard forces in response to requests for assistance from civil authorities for domestic emergencies and other activities. The Department of Defense evaluates requests for support based on six criteria: legality, lethality, risk, cost, appropriateness, and readiness. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, an agency within the Department of Defense, is also discussed in the report. The U.S. Armed Forces, including the Reserve Components, possess capabilities for disaster response missions. Military aircraft can transport doctors, food, and medical supplies to disaster zones. The Armed Forces are governed by Title 10 of the U.S. Code, with relevant sections on organization and employment of military forces. The National Guard, as a federal reserve component and organized militia, has additional statutory authority in Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Active component units operate under Title 10 authority, under the President's control. The chain of command extends from the Secretary of Defense to lower echelon commanders. Reserve component forces follow a similar chain of command. National Guard forces are part of the organized militia of their state or territory and also serve as a reserve component of the Army or Air Force. They are structured to meet the requirements of the Department of the Army or Air Force and are under the operational control of the President of the United States. National Guardsmen can be employed under state law, Title 10, or Title 32 of the U.S. Code. They can be called up by their governor for state active duty, responding to disasters and civil disorders. They can also be called to federal active duty, where control passes to the President for military training or operations. National Guardsmen can be employed under state law, Title 10, or Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Title 32 status allows for duties under state control with pay and benefits from the federal government, including training and disaster response. National Guard units can be employed by governors or the President, with a chain of command extending from the Governor to the Adjutant General. During disasters, National Guard forces can be utilized for law enforcement functions without restrictions from the Posse Comitatus Act. When on federal active duty, they fall under the President's control and are subject to the Act. In response to Hurricane Katrina, around 72,000 military personnel, including 50,000 National Guard members in Title 32 status, conducted various activities like search and rescue, evacuations, distribution of supplies, crowd control, and medical treatment. The Armed Forces also aided in the Hurricane Sandy response. The Department of Defense has forces ready to respond to domestic CBRN incidents and disaster response operations, including tasks such as search and rescue, transportation of supplies, security, and power restoration. The Department of Defense has general purpose forces ready to support CBRN response efforts, including the Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF), Command and Control CBRN Response Elements (C2CRE), National Guard Homeland Response Forces (HRFs), Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Consequence Management Advisory Teams, and the U.S. Army's CBRNE Command. These units can also be utilized for disaster response missions beyond CBRN incidents. The Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) is composed of military units with approximately 5,200 personnel, providing command and control, CBRN assessment, search and rescue, decontamination, medical care, security, engineering, logistics, transportation, aviation lift, and medical evacuation capabilities. It deploys in phases, with the first force package of 2,100 personnel deploying within 24 hours and the second force package of 3,100 personnel deploying within 48 hours. The DCRF includes elements of the Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force. The C2CRE has 1,500 personnel and provides command, control, and logistical support for up to 20,000 follow-on forces. It can deploy within 96 hours and can be adjusted by the commander of U.S. Northern Command. The Homeland Response Force (HRF) consists of 10 regionally oriented National Guard units with about 577 personnel each, including command and control, CBRN Assistance and Support Element (CASE), and task force elements. The CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) National Guard units provide capabilities such as incident site search, rescue tasks, decontamination, medical triage, and recovery of CBRN incident fatalities. There are currently 17 CERFPs, each consisting of 197 personnel organized into different teams. The National Guard WMD-CSTs support civil authorities during events involving weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks, or disasters. There are 57 WMD-CSTs in total. The National Guard WMD-CSTs consist of 22 National Guard personnel who are certified hazardous materials technicians and receive specialized training. They deploy within 90 minutes of notification and can operate for 72 hours independently. Equipped with sophisticated communication and laboratory equipment, they analyze chemical, biological, and radiological hazards. The Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) responds to CBRNE incidents. The Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) is a specialized unit that responds to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or High Yield explosive (CBRNE) incidents. It consists of about 500 Marines with capabilities including command and control, detection, search and extraction, decontamination, rescue, medical, explosive ordnance disposal, and logistics. The CBIRF has assessment teams on standby for rapid deployment within one to six hours. Additionally, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has Consequence Management Advisory Teams (CMATs) available for support. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has CMATs that provide expertise and support for chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear incidents. The U.S. Army CBRNE Command is tasked with countering various hazards and consolidating control of related assets. The 20th Support Command consolidates control of CBRNE assets and includes subordinate organizations for CBRNE operations. It can provide support in CBRN incidents but is not part of the DCRF. The military operates under general statutory authority for organization, training, and employment of forces. Exceptions include the Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force and National Guard WMD-CSTs. The Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force and National Guard WMD-CSTs were established to aid in the detection, neutralization, containment, dismantlement, and disposal of weapons of mass destruction. The National Guard's WMD-CSTs were created to enhance domestic preparedness against various threats, with funding requested to establish 10 RAID teams in 1998. The funding for Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection (RAID) teams, precursor to WMD-CSTs, was provided in P.L. 105-277. The teams were established in 44 states to provide chemical/biological response capabilities. Additional funding was allocated for the establishment of 17 RAID teams and the renaming of RAID teams to Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams. The Department of Defense has fielded 10 Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams, with plans to establish a total of 32 teams by fiscal year 2001. Congress directed the expansion of WMD-CSTs in subsequent years, with the establishment of additional teams specified in the National Defense Authorization Acts for FY2001 and FY2003. The Department of Defense has expanded the number of Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams to 57, with at least one team established in each State and territory. These teams have responded to various CBRN events, such as chemical leaks and anthrax incidents, providing analytical support to law enforcement agencies. In 2013, WMD-CSTs provided support in various incidents, including a ricin letter investigation in Spokane, WA, air toxicology testing after an explosion in West, TX, and monitoring at the Boston Marathon. DOD CBRN response forces have multiple potential uses, including command and control, monitoring, decontamination, and medical care. They can also assist in disaster response missions beyond CBRN incidents. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has over 40 planning and response teams trained for emergency response activities, including providing ice, water, power, debris removal, temporary housing, roofing, and safety assessments. They also have deployable tactical operating systems for command and communication during disasters. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coordinates emergency support for public works and engineering during disasters. They provide technical assistance, engineering, construction management, emergency contracting, and repair of essential infrastructure. This includes monitoring and stabilizing damaged structures, debris management, and establishing routes into affected areas. Coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is done for contaminated debris management. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers coordinates emergency support for public works and engineering during disasters, including debris management and infrastructure repair. Funding for these activities is provided through FEMA appropriations, with the Corps having its own emergency response authority under P.L. 84-99 for disaster preparedness and response. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has emergency response authority under P.L. 84-99 for disaster preparedness and response. This includes measures such as emergency operations, rehabilitation of flood control works, protection of shore protection works, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. Funding for these activities is usually provided through supplemental appropriations directly to the Corps, with the authority to transfer money from ongoing projects to emergency operations until additional funding is available. In recent years, emergency appropriations for disaster response were provided through supplemental appropriations in FY2010 ($20 million), FY2012 ($388 million), and FY2013 ($1.01 billion for Hurricane Sandy). Funding for preparedness has been sporadic, with amounts ranging from $25.6 million to $34 million. After Hurricane Sandy, the Corps provided water, housing units, and sandbags for relief efforts. The Corps provided relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy, including housing units, sandbags, and unwatering flooded areas in New York City's mass transit system. PRTs were organized into an Unwatering Task Force with pumps that removed 116,000 gallons of saltwater per minute, draining 475 million gallons in nine days. Additionally, the Corps supported FEMA-assigned missions and carried out their own regular missions in the region. The Corps' New York and Philadelphia districts conducted missions after Hurricane Sandy, including reopening the port of New York and New Jersey, closing barrier island breaches, and assessing damages to shoreline projects for coastal storm damage risk management. The 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) can provide technical expertise and operational assistance in power generation and distribution for contingency and emergency response operations. The 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) focuses on restoring power to critical facilities during domestic emergencies. Created in 1994, the battalion specializes in low to medium voltage electricity and is ready to respond to disasters under the National Response Framework. It is funded through Department of Defense appropriations and FEMA for domestic missions. The 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) is funded through Department of Defense appropriations and FEMA for domestic missions. They work with power-related PRTs to restore power during disasters like Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Irene. They have completed power assessments, installed generators, and provided power to critical facilities such as mass transit systems and petroleum terminals. The National Nuclear Security Administration's Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response program provides rapid response in radiological or nuclear incidents, drawing on technical expertise from the nuclear weapons complex. It includes subprograms like the Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST) that offers technical support to FBI, DoD, and DHS in such events. The National Nuclear Security Administration's Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response program includes specialized teams like the Accident Response Group and Radiological Assistance Program to respond to radiological or nuclear threats. NCTIR provides training to federal, state, and local agencies for handling emergencies. National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF) supports the mission by providing technical support and analyzing radioactive samples. The National Nuclear Security Administration's Office of Emergency Operations is the primary capability for radiological and nuclear emergency response, focusing on radiological search, nuclear device safety, and consequence management. The Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory provides predictions for hazardous material spread in the atmosphere for emergency response. The National Nuclear Security Administration Act established NNSA, giving the Administrator authority over all programs, including emergency management. The Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs is responsible for directing assets to respond to incidents involving nuclear weapons and materials. NNSA's budget request for Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Programs in FY2016 was $234.390 million. NNSA teams are deployed in response to various disasters, such as industrial fires, nuclear power plant releases, and volcanic eruptions. In response to various disasters, NNSA teams are deployed over 100 times a year within the U.S. for radiological search deployments. They support law enforcement and planned events like the Super Bowl. After the Fukushima accident, NNSA sent teams to Japan with equipment for aerial measurements and ground samples to analyze radiation data. NARAC has also responded to other atmospheric releases. On August 19, 2004, a large fire occurred at a barrel recycling facility in Cincinnati, causing concern about health effects from combustion of unknown chemicals. The city's health department contacted NARAC for plume models to assess the situation. The NTSB is an independent federal agency that investigates transportation disasters. The NTSB is mandated to coordinate disaster resources and provide assistance to victims' families after major transportation accidents, including air carrier and rail passenger accidents. They may also offer support to those affected by general aviation accidents, commuter rail incidents, highway accidents, marine accidents, and pipeline disasters. The NTSB investigates mass casualty transportation accidents and coordinates with the U.S. Department of State for crises involving U.S. citizens abroad. They are responsible for recovery and identification of passengers in major airline and passenger rail accidents, and establish family assistance centers near accident sites. The NTSB's disaster assistance division and family assistance centers provide support and resources to victims' families after rail disasters. This includes disseminating information, coordinating victim identification, managing personal effects, offering crisis counseling, and arranging memorial services. The NTSB works with the American Red Cross to provide emotional care and support through trained mental health providers. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) is the federal government's main plan for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases. It delegates response authorities to the EPA, USCG, and other federal agencies with relevant expertise, coordinating federal, state, and local roles in incident response. The NCP is authorized by three federal statutes. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) is authorized by three federal statutes and codified in federal regulation at 40 C.F.R. Part 300. It has the force of law and is binding and enforceable, establishing a coordinated National Response System (NRS) with a multi-tiered framework. Key components include the National Response Team (NRT) composed of representatives from 15 federal departments and agencies. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) establishes a coordinated National Response System (NRS) with key components including the National Response Team (NRT), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), Area Committees (ACs), and On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) for federal responses in coastal and inland zones. The On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) directs federal response efforts and coordinates related federal efforts at the scene. The OSC is empowered to direct and coordinate response and recovery activities of federal departments, state, local, and private entities involved in a federal response. The OSC may draw upon resources identified in the appropriate Area Contingency Plans (ACPs) and Regional Response Teams (RRTs) when an incident occurs. The National Contingency Plan (NCP) primarily uses existing resources of federal departments and agencies to respond to specific incidents based on their scope, nature, and associated hazards. The federal response to incidents depends on the scope and nature of the incident and associated hazards. Various federal departments and agencies maintain specialized resources for response purposes. These resources can be used to respond to incidents at federal facilities or vessels under their jurisdiction. Private contracting may also be used to augment federal assets in a federal response. EPA and the Coast Guard, as co-chairs of the NRT, maintain dedicated response resources for their respective roles. The Coast Guard and EPA maintain specialized response resources for federal incidents, including oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The Coast Guard's National Strike Force Coordination Center lists response equipment and private sector inventories for contracting. Coast Guard assets include District Response Advisory Teams and National Strike Force Strike teams. The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA have specialized response teams and equipment for oil spills and hazardous substance releases. Congress has authorized two trust funds for funding federal responses to such incidents: the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) administered by the Coast Guard, and the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund administered by the EPA. These funds are used to finance response costs and are disbursed to federal departments, states, and local entities involved in the response efforts. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) and Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund provide funding for federal responses to oil spills and hazardous substance incidents. The OSLTF has up to $150 million in funding each fiscal year and is not subject to discretionary appropriations. The Superfund Trust Fund requires discretionary appropriations before funds are available for response actions. Congress appropriates funds annually for emergency response capabilities, with a cap of $1 billion on total expenditures per incident. Oil spills and hazardous substance incidents involve responsible parties liable for federal response costs and damages under OPA and CERCLA. Liability includes response costs and natural resource damages, but not other economic or property damages. CERCLA allows federal actions for pollutant incidents but does not establish liability for response costs. The federal government can recover its response costs under OPA and CERCLA. The federal government can recover response costs from responsible parties under OPA and CERCLA, depositing them back into trust funds. Responsible parties may assist in federal response efforts and use their own resources. The OSC oversees their actions to ensure compliance. State and local governments also respond to numerous oil and chemical spills annually. State and local governments respond to oil and chemical spills in the United States each year, with varying levels of federal involvement based on their request for resources. For example, West Virginia requested federal assistance under the NCP in response to a chemical spill in 2014, highlighting the potential impact on local populations. The President declared a state of emergency in West Virginia under the Stafford Act, with FEMA providing alternative water supplies during a chemical spill. The Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 resulted in the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, with federal resources deployed under the NCP. A Spill of National Significance was declared, and a National Incident Commander appointed for coordination among federal, state, and local entities. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a partnership between HHS, DOD, and VA, utilizing trained medical teams to respond to mass casualty incidents and support healthcare infrastructure. NDMS has two main missions: providing medical assistance upon request and assisting the DOD during wartime conflicts. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) provides medical, mortuary, and veterinary response capabilities, with HHS responsible for over 5,000 members in more than 80 teams. This includes patient movement for definitive medical care, coordinated by DOD in conjunction with HHS. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) provides definitive medical care through a network of federal and non-federal hospitals managed by Federal Coordinating Centers (FCCs). NDMS was established in 1984 and authorized in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Its authority was extended through FY2018 in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. VA is responsible for coordinating NDMS definitive medical care, and can provide care in its facilities to NDMS patients during emergencies. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) allows VA to provide medical care to NDMS patients during emergencies. DOD assets can be used for emergency response, with reimbursement sought for costs. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority to deploy NDMS components without specific triggers. NDMS supports ESF #8 and ESF #6 in the National Response Framework. ESF #6\u2014Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Temporary Housing, and Human Services, coordinated by FEMA, involves NDMS personnel who are intermittent federal employees paid by the government. They have statutory protections, but concerns were raised about their deployment during the Ebola outbreak due to unclear disability and death benefits. Proposed amendments to the law were included in the FY2016 budget request. Administrative costs for the NDMS program are covered in HHS appropriations. Costs for the NDMS program are covered in HHS appropriations, with specific funding levels shown in Table 3. Deployment costs may be paid by different federal entities depending on the type of incident. Reimbursements for deployment activities can come from FEMA, Department of State, or USAID. In some cases, HHS is responsible for covering the costs of NDMS response teams for events like NSSEs or public health responses without a Stafford Act declaration. HHS must cover costs for NDMS response teams deployment, seeking $110 million for emergency reserve fund in FY2016. Participating hospitals receive reimbursement for services at 110% of Medicare rate. FEMA policies do not provide assistance for long-term medical care costs beyond immediate emergency care. The NDMS system provides immediate emergency care, evacuation, and stabilization during disasters. Congress has provided supplemental appropriations for hospital reimbursement in past activations. NDMS has deployed its components over 300 times since 1984, with the medical response component being the most common. For example, during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, 2,300 NDMS personnel were deployed. The NDMS system is utilized for domestic public health incidents and international aid missions, as well as for NSSEs and incidents with a risk of public health emergencies. The patient movement and medical care components are deployed less frequently, with all components deployed during Hurricane Katrina in 2005."
