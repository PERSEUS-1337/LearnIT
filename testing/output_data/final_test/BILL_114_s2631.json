SEC. 3. UPDATES TO LEAD-CONTAMINATED DUST AND LEAD-CONTAMINATED SOIL STANDARDS. The EPA and HUD are required to update regulations for lead-contaminated dust and soil within a specified timeframe. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO RESIDENTIAL LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARD REDUCTION ACT OF 1992. In the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, amendments are made to include a definition for \"elevated blood lead level\" and to remove reference to \"0-bedroom dwelling\" in paragraph 28. The Act does not affect the EPA's authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Secretary must amend regulations within 120 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. AMENDMENTS TO THE LEAD-BASED PAINT POISONING PREVENTION ACT. Section 302(a) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act is amended to include additional procedures for families with children under the age of 6 living in covered housing constructed before 1978 and receiving Federal assistance. The text chunk refers to multi-family housing eligible for insurance from the Federal Housing Administration. The text chunk states that (AA) is covered by a mortgage insurance application from the Federal Housing Administration, and (BB) does not receive any other Federal housing assistance. The Secretary must establish regulations within 120 days of the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2016, requiring an initial risk assessment for lead-based paint hazards in covered housing where a family with a child under 6 will reside. A visual assessment alone is not sufficient for compliance. The regulations must provide an exception to the lead-based paint removal requirement for covered housing where all lead-based paint has been removed and clearance achieved, or if the Secretary deems another standard appropriate. The Secretary must promulgate regulations for emergency relocation of families with young children from housing with lead-based paint hazards to safer units within 120 days of the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2016. The blood lead level for a child is considered elevated according to the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. The GAO will provide reports on lead hazards in federally assisted housing. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit two reports to Congress on lead hazards in housing receiving Federal assistance. The initial report, due within 90 days of enactment, will analyze the implications of aligning Department regulations with CDC guidance and requiring risk assessments for lead-based paint hazards. The subsequent report, due within 180 days, will further address lead hazards in federally assisted housing. Federal assistance will analyze existing programs and funding for lead hazard control in housing to meet current needs. It will evaluate the financial and social costs of lead-based paint hazard prevention and provide recommendations for improving coordination of public and private funds. Existing partnerships with public housing will also be identified. The federal assistance will evaluate existing partnerships with public housing and public health agencies in addressing lead-based paint hazards, identify gaps in compliance and enforcement, and assess the appropriateness of Department protocols on reducing lead-based paint hazards. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 is granted to carry out this Act and its amendments."
