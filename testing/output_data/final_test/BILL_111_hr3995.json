    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Financial Crisis of 2008 Criminal Investigation and Prosecution Act of 2009\". Congress finds that the FBI testified about the significant impact of mortgage fraud on the current global financial crisis, stating that it would be irresponsible to neglect its effects on the housing and financial markets. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the United States faced a financial crisis with the collapse of Savings and Loan institutions. The Department of Justice and FBI were given tools through FIRREA and CCA to combat the crisis. Fraud played a significant role in the crisis, leading to prosecutions by the FBI and Justice Department. The FBI and Justice Department prioritized prosecuting elite frauds during the loan crisis, leading to over 1,000 felony convictions. However, due to personnel limitations, the FBI struggled to assign enough agents to investigate the global financial crisis, with only 120 agents assigned to mortgage fraud cases. The FBI should have at least 1,000 agents to address corporate, securities, and mortgage fraud cases, along with more forensic experts and Federal prosecutors. This staffing increase is crucial to investigate complex financial crimes and prosecute the perpetrators effectively. The funds authorized in this Act will be used to hire additional employees, including 1,000 FBI agents, forensic experts, and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute violations of laws related to the United States financial markets. AUTHORIZATIONS: Sums are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2009-2012 to carry out the Act, available until obligated."
