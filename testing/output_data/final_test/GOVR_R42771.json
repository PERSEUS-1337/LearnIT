    "content": "Specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and horticulture crops, are a significant part of U.S. agriculture. In 2012, farm-level specialty crop production was valued at nearly $60 billion, accounting for a quarter of U.S. crop production. Despite this, specialty crops only occupy 3% of harvested cropland acres. The USDA reports that retail sales of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables total around $100 billion annually. Additionally, exports of U.S. specialty crops reached about $14 billion in 2013, representing 10% of total U.S. agricultural exports. Specialty crop production is widespread across the U.S., with California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, and Michigan being key states. USDA data show the distribution of vegetable, fruit, tree nut, and floriculture crop areas nationwide. Most specialty crop producers are specialized, relying on these crops for at least half of their income. Specialized farms account for 90%-95% of the total value of U.S. specialty crop production. Specialized fruit and vegetable farms account for 90%-95% of U.S. specialty crop production, mainly concentrated in the western states like California, Washington, and Oregon. Specialty crops are ineligible for federal commodity support programs but can receive other types of USDA support. Farm bill programs tailored for specialty crops benefit all producers in the sector and do not directly benefit individual growers. Some programs supporting specialty crops and organic agriculture have been long-standing. Farm bill support for specialty crops and organic agriculture includes marketing and promotion programs, crop insurance, disaster assistance, plant pest and disease protections, trade assistance, and research services. These programs benefit all agricultural producers and are regularly included in omnibus farm legislation. Specialty crop programs were established following the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 led to the expansion of programs reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill, which included a title dedicated to specialty crops and organic agriculture. Other laws like the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 and the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 also serve the produce industry. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and expanded provisions to support agriculture. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and expanded provisions to support specialty crop and certified organic sectors, including marketing, data collection, pest control, food safety, and support for local foods. Provisions also benefit certified organic agriculture producers through USDA's National Organic Program. These programs apply to a range of agricultural commodities, such as fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops. Specialty crop producers benefit from various USDA programs, including research, extension, conservation, and rural development programs. Approximately $676 million annually was authorized for specialty crops and organic agriculture from 2008 to 2012, mainly for government purchases of fruits and vegetables for nutrition programs. Total funding sources for specialty crops are challenging to estimate due to spread across different USDA programs. The 2014 farm bill increased spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture, with total mandatory spending expected to average $773 million annually. Despite the increase, this funding will still be a small portion of total farm bill spending and significantly lower than spending on commodity crops. Specialty crop producers benefit from various USDA programs, including research, extension, conservation, and rural development programs. The 2014 farm bill increased spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture, with total mandatory spending expected to average $773 million annually. Various USDA programs support specialty crop and certified organic producers. Key USDA programs and programs administered by other federal agencies are described, with a primary source of information being the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). These programs are administered by various USDA agencies, including AMS, APHIS, FNS, RMA, FSA, NIFA, ARS, and Natural Resources. The USDA, along with other federal agencies like FDA and EPA, play a role in overseeing food safety and global trade for specialty crops. These programs are not part of the omnibus farm bill legislation and are managed separately. The USDA established a Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee in 2001 to address issues faced by the industry. The USDA established the Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory Committee in 2001 to address industry issues. The committee consists of up to 25 members representing various sectors of the industry and holds open meetings to provide suggestions on tailoring USDA programs. Members serve two- to three-year terms appointed by USDA. The USDA provides insurance options for eligible producers, including catastrophic insurance which is mostly free, and revenue insurance that compensates for income loss. The federal government subsidizes premiums for higher coverage levels. USDA determines coverage for crops based on factors like farmer demand and regional risk levels. The USDA offers insurance options for eligible producers based on factors like farmer demand and regional risk levels. RMA provides pilot programs for new crops or geographical areas to inform coverage decisions. In 2011, federal crop insurance covered 73% of fruits and tree nuts acreage and 32% of vegetables acreage. Coverage varies by crop type, with some specialty crops having over 90% coverage and others less than 50%. The USDA offers insurance options for eligible producers based on factors like farmer demand and regional risk levels. More than 80 types of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops are covered by individual federal crop insurance plans, including almonds, apples, avocados, blueberries, citrus, grapes, and more. Specialty crops like asparagus, beets, broccoli, and others do not have insurance available. The USDA offers insurance options for specialty crops like squash, tropical plants, and root plants. Some crops may have insurance coverage based on historical farm income. Producers have expressed concerns that offering insurance could affect the market by reducing producer risk. Participation in specialty crop insurance is relatively high in major producing states like California, Florida, and Washington. Other states with specialty crop production also have varying participation rates. In purchasing crop insurance, producers choose coverage levels and pay a portion of the premium, with the federal government covering the rest. Specialty crops received $425 million in premium subsidies out of a total of $7.5 billion in FY2011. Fruits and vegetables account for less than 5% of annual crop insurance premiums, despite making up 22% of U.S. crop receipts. Commodity crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton receive 87% of crop insurance premiums, despite accounting for 58% of U.S. crop receipts. Specialty crop growers face challenges in expanding insurance coverage due to small acreages, multiple crop varieties, quality and price discovery issues, and non-weather risks. Despite the introduction of new policies in the last decade, there have been calls to improve the safety net for specialty crops as they are not eligible for farm commodity support programs. The 2014 farm bill introduced a revised whole farm insurance plan to provide coverage for specialty crop growers, including direct-to-consumer marketers and producers of multiple agricultural commodities. The plan increased coverage to 85% with a maximum liability of $1.5 million and expanded coverage for on-farm activities. USDA had previously broadened coverage for organic crops by offering organic price elections for higher product value. The 2014 farm bill extended organic price elections to reflect actual retail or wholesale prices of organic crops. Producers not eligible for federal crop insurance may receive up to $125,000 per person under USDA's noninsured assistance program. NAP applicants pay an administrative fee before planting, with no premium charged. To qualify for NAP payment, a producer must experience a 50% crop loss due to a natural disaster or be unable to plant more than 35% of intended crop acreage. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) provides 55% of the average market price for production losses exceeding the minimum. Specialty crops eligible for NAP include mushrooms, flowers, Christmas trees, and ginseng. Producers with an average adjusted gross income over $900,000 are ineligible. NAP is a mandatory program funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, with $342 million in payments made to U.S. agricultural producers in FY2013. The 2014 farm bill expands coverage for specialty crops under NAP, providing additional coverage at 50% to 65% of established yield and 100% of average market price. The farmer-paid premium is 5.25% of the selected coverage level and production value. Section 12305 of the bill retroactively allows NAP payments for fruit crop losses in 2012 due to freeze and frost. Two supplemental agricultural disaster assistance programs were authorized by the bill to assist specialty crop growers for losses after October 1, 2011. The Tree Assistance Program (TAP) and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provide assistance to orchardists, nursery tree growers, and beekeepers for losses due to natural disasters. TAP helps replant or rehabilitate trees, bushes, and vines damaged by disasters, while ELAP covers losses from adverse weather conditions not covered by other programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers programs for farmers affected by natural disasters such as blizzards and wildfires. They offer low-interest emergency loans to help farmers recover from production or physical losses, including destruction of fruit trees or buildings. Eligible growers can borrow up to 100% of actual losses, not exceeding $500,000. Additionally, owners of cropland with a history of growing \"program crops\" have received federal subsidy payments decoupled from crop planting decisions, providing flexibility in planting choices based on market conditions. Expansion of planting flexibility policies allowing growers to plant fruits and vegetables on subsidized land is generally opposed by major specialty crop groups to protect unsubsidized growers. This restriction was reviewed in the 2008 and 2014 farm bills. The 1990 farm bill introduced planting flexibility by designating 25% of base acres as \"flex acres\" for growing certain crops. Subsequent farm bills expanded this flexibility to all base acres, with the 2008 bill allowing a pilot project for fruits and vegetables on up to 75,000 acres. The 2014 farm bill removed restrictions on planting crops without affecting base acres. In the 2008 farm bill, Congress authorized a one-time \"market loss payment\" program for asparagus growers to compensate for revenue losses during crop years 2004-2007 due to imports. The program allocated $7.5 million for producers of fresh asparagus and $7.5 million for producers of processed or frozen asparagus. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (PACA) and the Produce Agency Act of 1937 are laws that protect the produce industry. Administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, these laws enforce fair business practices for handling perishable agricultural commodities in interstate and foreign commerce. Traders violating PACA face consequences. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) requires traders to obtain a license and follow fair trading practices. Violators risk license suspension or revocation. PACA also includes a dispute resolution process for buyer-seller complaints. In 1984, Congress added a statutory trust to protect sellers in case of buyer non-payment. USDA enforces PACA through fees, with over 200 enforcement actions from FY2000 to FY2009. In 2011, AMS resolved 1,563 disputes and issued orders in 427 reparation cases totaling $11 million. AMS initiated 17 disciplinary cases against firms for alleged PACA violations, resulting in 19 disciplinary orders. These orders included suspensions or revocations of PACA licenses, civil penalties, and findings of repeated violations. AMS administers various programs to support the produce industry's market expansion, including marketing orders, research programs, USDA Market News reports, grading services, and promotion programs benefiting specialty crop producers. Their mission is to facilitate competitive agricultural product marketing. AMS administers marketing and promotion programs for specialty crop producers, including the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) authorized by the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. The program provides block grants to state departments of agriculture to enhance specialty crop competitiveness, funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Program funding for FY2014-FY2018 was $72.5 million annually and increased to $85 million for FY2018 onwards. Funding for multistate project grants also increased from $1 million to $5 million. The Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants program saw project grants increase from $1 million in FY2014 to $5 million in FY2018. Each state receives a base grant plus additional funds based on their share of U.S. specialty crop production. California, Florida, and Washington are the top recipients. Projects cover marketing, education, research, pest and plant health, food safety, and production. Funding details are outlined in USDA's annual report. The Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants program, established in the Agricultural Risk Act of 2000, was expanded and renamed in the 2014 farm bill. Administered by USDA's Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the program provides grants to eligible entities for developing strategies and business plans to add value to their products. Grants can be used for planning activities and working capital, with maximum amounts of $100,000 for planning grants and $300,000 for working capital grants. The Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants program, established in the Agricultural Risk Act of 2000, was expanded and renamed in the 2014 farm bill. Grant funds may be used to pay up to 50% of a project's costs, with the applicant contributing at least 50% in cash or in-kind contributions. Priority funding is provided for projects benefiting beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged farmers, operators of small- and medium-sized family farms, and veteran farmers. The 2014 farm bill provided mandatory funding levels of $63 million. The 2014 farm bill allocated $63 million in mandatory funding for the Value-Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants program, with an additional $40 million in discretionary funding annually. Grant funding for the program has ranged from $15 million to over $20 million annually since 2001. USDA's farmers' market and direct-to-consumer marketing programs support small and medium-size farmers by providing market access and assistance. The Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 aims to promote direct marketing of agricultural commodities through various channels. The 2014 farm bill expanded funding for various agricultural marketing programs, including the Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program. This program supports local and regional food enterprises through competitive grant programs, with increased mandatory funding of $30 million annually. The Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMPP) provides $15 million in annual funding for marketing support for farmers markets and direct-to-consumer outlets. USDA grants support activities like establishing and promoting farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supported agriculture. Funding can also be used for education, infrastructure purchases, and bringing local farm products into federal nutrition programs. The Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMPP) provides funding for marketing support at direct-market outlets to accept SNAP benefits, WIC-FMNP, and SFMNP. Eligible entities include farmer cooperatives, grower associations, and local governments. Grant awards range from $15,000 to $100,000 with no matching funds required. The Local Food Promotion Program (LFPP) offers $15,000 in award funding with no matching funds required. It provides $15 million annually for marketing and promotional support for local food businesses. Two types of grants are available: planning grants for market research and feasibility studies, and implementation grants for establishing or expanding local food enterprises. Planning grants range from $5,000 to $25,000 and must be completed within 12 months. The LFPP Implementation Grants offer funding for new or existing local and regional food businesses. Activities include training, marketing, working capital, and infrastructure improvements. Grants range from $25,000 to $100,000 and must be completed within a 24-month period. Eligible entities support food businesses that process, distribute, or store locally produced products. The AMS Market News program provides grant funds for entities involved in the production, distribution, or storage of locally or regionally produced food products. These entities include agricultural businesses, cooperatives, producer networks, and government entities. The program requires a 25% match for grant funds and is authorized by various statutes. AMS collects and disseminates market information for agricultural commodities under this program. The AMS Market News program collects data on agricultural commodities from various locations and disseminates information online. The program is funded annually with $33 million, including $9 million from the 2014 farm bill for specialty crops. Marketing orders and agreements are overseen by local administrative committees. Marketing orders and agreements are managed by local growers and handlers through administrative committees. AMS publishes regulations in the Federal Register, covering quality standards, quantity controls, grading, packaging requirements, research, promotion, and imported products. Industry assessment fees fund these activities, collected from handlers at the time of sale. AMS uses funds from USDA appropriations acts to ensure legal and public interest compliance. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes AMS to oversee marketing orders and agreements. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes AMS to oversee marketing orders and agreements for various fruits, vegetables, and nuts. These orders and agreements are initiated by producers and handlers in specific growing areas and are binding on all parties involved in marketing the eligible commodity within a designated geographic area. Currently, there are more than 20 active marketing orders and agreements in place. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 directs USDA to provide quality grade standards for various fruits, vegetables, and nuts to promote uniformity in commercial practices. AMS develops these standards under cooperative agreements with states and Puerto Rico. AMS-licensed state employees work in various locations to ensure quality standards are met. In FY2011, AMS graded approximately 15.8 billion pounds of processed fruits and vegetables at processing plants, field offices, and inspection points. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 directs USDA to provide quality grade standards for fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Grading is voluntary unless regulated for quality, subject to export requirements, or purchased by USDA. AMS administers federal commodity research and promotion programs for specialty crop industries. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 directs USDA to provide quality grade standards for fruits, vegetables, and nuts. AMS administers federal commodity research and promotion programs for specialty crop industries like blueberries, Hass avocados, mangos, mushrooms, potatoes, and watermelons. The 2014 farm bill authorized USDA to create new research and promotion programs for fresh-cut Christmas trees and certified organic products. FDA is directed to establish definitions and standards for food to promote honesty and fair dealing for consumers. The FDA has established around 300 identity standards for various categories of processed foods, including meat, dairy, seafood, and fruit and vegetable products. Standards of identity cover processed and value-added foods, with the exception of fresh or dried fruits and vegetables. FDA may develop new standards in response to consumer interests or petitions, but the process can be time-consuming. The rulemaking process for developing food standards is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. Input from supporters and opponents is considered, and the burden of providing information lies with the petitioner. Country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requires retailers to disclose the origin of certain foods, with specific criteria for the \"United States country of origin\" declaration. This process is similar to FDA actions for food additives, color additives, and product claims. The final rule for country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for covered commodities, including specialty crops and selected meat products, went into effect on March 16, 2009. The USDA estimated that around 86,500 establishments would be affected by the rule. Before the rule, over 50% of fresh produce in retail stores was labeled with country of origin stickers, reflecting consumer interest in food safety and healthy eating habits. The nature of production, handling, and preparation makes produce vulnerable to contamination, leading to foodborne illness outbreaks. Statistics show that between 1990 and 2009, 639 outbreaks and 31,496 illnesses were associated with produce consumption. Recent outbreaks have been linked to leafy greens, sprouts, celery, tomatoes, and green onions, highlighting microbial hazards like pathogenic E. coli strains. Hazards associated with produce include pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Cyclospora, Toxoplasma gondii, Norovirus, and Hepatitis A viruses. These hazards can be introduced during production through water, soil amendments, worker hygiene, sanitation practices, and transportation. The FDA is the primary federal agency responsible for produce food safety in the United States, with oversight from the CDC. The FDA is the primary federal agency responsible for produce food safety in the United States, regulating the safety and labeling of all domestic and imported fruit and vegetable products. Other agencies involved in food safety monitoring include HHS, CDC, EPA, CBP, AMS, APHIS, and USDA's research agencies. FDA's authority was amended by the 111th Congress with the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is developing mandatory food safety regulations and traceability requirements for farmers, packers, and processors of domestically produced and imported products. FSMA Section 105 mainly affects produce growers, while other food producers like meat, poultry, and dairy farms are likely exempt. Small grower and processing operations selling locally are also exempt. The final rule deadline for FSMA Section 105 has been extended to October 31, 2015, to establish science-based standards for safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. The FDA is developing mandatory food safety regulations for produce growers, including requirements for soil amendments, hygiene, packaging, temperature controls, animals in the growing area, and water. FDA is also working on rules for food safety requirements for food facilities and imported produce. Additionally, Congress passed a bioterrorism preparedness law addressing import safety after September 2001. The Bioterrorism Act requires food establishments to register with FDA, keep records, and notify FDA of incoming shipments. Other agencies like CBP and APHIS also ensure food safety. AMS offers an audit-based inspection service for fresh-cut produce. The QTV program, similar to HACCP, focuses on food safety for fruits and vegetables. AMS previously administered the MDP, a monitoring program for foodborne pathogens in produce like cantaloupe and cilantro. The QTV program, similar to HACCP, focused on food safety for fruits and vegetables such as cantaloupe, cilantro, green onions, hot peppers, lettuce, spinach, sprouts, and tomatoes. Approximately 17,000 samples were collected from over 600 food distribution sites. The program was discontinued in 2012 due to budget concerns and disagreements between USDA and FDA on oversight responsibilities. USDA had spent $4-5 million annually on the program. EPA regulates pesticide use on food to ensure safety standards under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The EPA sets maximum pesticide residue levels on food to ensure safety, with the FDA responsible for monitoring tolerance levels. EPA evaluates pesticide use for risks to human health and the environment, establishing safe residue levels called tolerances for food crops. The FDA, in cooperation with the EPA, determines safe pesticide residue levels on fruit and vegetable crops to protect human health. FDA regulations apply to countries exporting produce to the US, and the agency inspects imports for safety. The USDA's AMS administers a residue testing program for over 50 commodities to collect data on residual pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. The Pesticide Data Program (PDP) collects data on pesticide residues in various foods, including fruits, vegetables, juices, and nuts. The USDA's Market Access Program (MAP) supports export-oriented markets for specialty crops and organic agriculture. Other trade remedy programs are also available, mostly administered by FAS. The Market Access Program (MAP) uses CCC funds to finance promotional activities for U.S. agricultural products, encouraging the development of export markets through cost-share assistance. Administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), MAP supports brand-name and generic promotions, with mandatory funding of $200 million annually through FY2018. Specialty crop growers utilize MAP to boost domestic exports. The 2014 farm bill allocates $200 million annually through FY2018 for overseas agricultural promotion. About $60 million is allocated to specialty crop producer groups, with California receiving the most support. Other states like Florida, Texas, Hawaii, and Washington also receive support for specialty crops. National groups in the apple, cherry, cranberry, potato, and watermelon sectors, as well as the U.S. wine industry and the Organic Trade Association, also receive support under MAP. The Quality Samples Program (QSP) supports U.S. specialty crops by providing samples to foreign importers to boost export sales. In FY2010, $1.9 million in funding was allocated, with 40% directed towards specialty crop groups like cranberry, ginseng, potato, and walnut. The CCC export credit guarantee program promotes U.S. agricultural exports by offering competitive credit terms to foreign buyers. The CCC funds guarantee payments from approved foreign banks to U.S. exporters. Eligible U.S. agricultural commodities include fruits, vegetables, nuts, wine, and nursery products. FAS administers programs like the Foreign Market Development (FMD) and Food for Progress (FFP) programs. FMD provides cost-sharing for overseas marketing activities, while FFP allows for the donation of U.S. products. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program, administered by FAS, provides funds for projects addressing sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to U.S. specialty crop exports. SPS requirements can act as trade barriers. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program, administered by FAS, addresses sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to U.S. specialty crop exports. Concerns regarding SPS and TBT issues are outlined in annual reports by the USTR, focusing on potential trade barriers and reducing tariffs under trade agreements. Expenses reimbursed under TASC may include pre-clearance programs and export protocol support. The TASC program provides support for U.S. specialty crop exports through various initiatives such as pre-clearance programs, pest and disease research, and travel expenses. Eligible recipients include U.S. government agencies, trade associations, universities, agricultural cooperatives, private companies, and other organizations. Funding of $9 million annually through FY2018 is authorized by the CCC and administered by FAS. The TAA for Farmers program offers technical assistance and cash benefits to farmers and fishermen impacted by increased imports. The TAA for Farmers program provides technical assistance and cash benefits to eligible farmers and fishermen affected by import competition, with support in the form of enhanced technical assistance and seed money. The program, administered by FAS, offers cash benefits mainly to fish and seafood producers, with funding not exceeding $90 million annually. Fruit and vegetable growers, including producers of Concord grapes, lychees, olives, wild blueberries, fresh potatoes, Florida avocadoes, and asparagus, are also eligible for assistance. Funding is discretionary and currently capped at $90 million annually. The specialty crop industry can seek remedies for unfair competition from foreign imports through the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Tariff Act of 1930 allows for antidumping duties on imports sold below fair value and countervailing duties on subsidized imports. U.S. producers have petitioned for investigations into dumping, highlighting competitive pressures from foreign fruit and vegetable producers. Foreign fruit and vegetable producers from various countries, including China, Thailand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, have been accused of selling their products below fair market value in the United States. Dumping petitions filed by U.S. fruit and vegetable sectors have targeted imports such as fresh tomatoes, frozen raspberries, apple juice concentrate, frozen orange juice, lemon juice, fresh garlic, preserved mushrooms, canned pineapple, table grapes, and tart cherry juice. Many of these petitions have resulted in higher tariffs being imposed on imported products to protect domestic producers. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, facilitating agricultural trade, and regulating genetically engineered organisms. The Plant Protection Act (PPA) governs APHIS's responsibilities regarding plant health, including pest and disease exclusion and emergency response. The Plant Protection Act (PPA) authorizes APHIS to prevent the spread of invasive pests and diseases, restrict plant imports, inspect foreign plant imports, and quarantine infested areas. These regulations are administered by APHIS in collaboration with state departments of agriculture. The USDA implements a range of measures to exclude alien pests or prevent the spread of new pests. This includes inspections, surveillance, quarantines, treatments, and destruction. They can develop lists of organisms allowed into the US, certify agricultural exports, and enter agreements with other entities to implement pest control measures. APHIS assists state departments of agriculture in controlling and eradicating pests. The USDA has authority to transfer funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to APHIS for emergency control programs in response to sudden harmful disease or pest outbreaks. This authority dates back to 1948 and allows the USDA Secretary discretion in making transfers with limited review. Appropriators expect USDA to continue using this authority for activities related to pest eradication. In recent years, USDA redirected $65.9 million in emergency funding for plant-related concerns caused by pests like the Asian longhorned beetle and the European grapevine moth. The 2008 farm bill amended the Plant Protection Act to include early pest detection, threat mitigation, and technical assistance for plant pest risk management systems. Congress also established the National Clean Plant Network to provide pathogen-free planting sources. APHIS is implementing Section 10201 of the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) to provide pathogen-free planting stock for specialty crops. In FY2011, 312 projects were funded across six goal areas, with funds going to state departments of agriculture, universities, federal agencies, tribal organizations, and nonprofit entities. Projects focused on plant pest/disease survey, inspection activities, pest identification tools, nursery production safeguards, outreach, education, and mitigation capabilities. Detailed information is available in USDA's FY2013 budget. APHIS, ARS, and NIFA are developing the NCPN to provide clean plant material for specialty crops. APHIS has cooperative agreements with clean plant centers to diagnose and eliminate harmful pathogens, establish clean plant material, and educate growers. These activities aim to provide healthy planting stock for various crops. Funding for these programs is mandatory. The farm bill consolidated the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) with increased funding levels. It also established a Pest and Disease Revolving Loan Fund for monitoring and removing pest-infested trees. APHIS spends roughly $140 million on these programs. APHIS spends approximately $140-150 million annually to address specialty crop pests, cooperating with states to develop and implement action plans. This funding supports urgent plant pest and disease programs, including the Citrus Health Response Program, Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, and other pests. APHIS also receives appropriated funds for its Pest Detection program to detect new introductions of harmful plant pests and diseases. The program, funded through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program, works with state cooperators, the scientific community, and industry to detect harmful plant pests and diseases early. Information collected is compiled into detailed maps in the National Agricultural Pest Information System (NAPIS) database, allowing for early detection of significant pests and prompt action when quarantine pests are found. This helps identify pest-free regions and ensures continued export of commodities. The CAPS/NAPIS system aids in early detection of pests, supporting eradication efforts and inspections by CBP at ports and border crossings. APHIS spends $27 million annually on pest detection, which is 3% of its total budget. The program, administered by APHIS and CBP, protects the US from invasive agricultural pests through foreign plant quarantines. APHIS inspects passengers, cargo, and conveyances traveling from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other islands to the mainland to prevent the spread of pests and diseases. The program is funded through a combination of appropriations and user fees and is carried out under the agency's Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) program. The Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) in Beltsville, MD, plays a key role in detecting and identifying high-risk plant pathogens. The USDA's research campus in Beltsville, MD, is a key part of APHIS's NPPLAP. They develop proficiency tests for scientists using CPHST-validated methods. APHIS maintains the FAVIR database for import regulations and assists U.S. specialty crop growers in exporting crops. APHIS helps maintain and expand markets for U.S. exporters by resolving trade issues, building international support for trade agreements, and overseeing foreign-based inspection programs to ensure pest-free products for export to the United States. They also manage sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to U.S. exports and represent the United States in the World Trade Organization. APHIS, along with other U.S. agencies, represents the United States in the World Trade Organization and negotiates in WTO phytosanitary disputes related to U.S. agricultural trade. They intervene in cargo releases at foreign ports, preventing rejections worth millions, and resolve trade-related issues with a market value of billions. APHIS also certifies U.S. specialty crop exports to meet other countries' phytosanitary regulations before shipment. USDA's research and extension service support specialty crop and organic production through programs and research. The United States has a network of public agricultural laboratories and academic institutions funded by USDA. There are four USDA Research, Education, and Economics (REE) agencies that conduct research on specialty crops, including production, processing, and food safety. The USDA's Research, Education, and Economics (REE) agencies support specialty crop production, processing, and food safety. The agencies include ARS, NIFA, ERS, and NASS, which distribute federal funds for research and provide market analysis for specialty crops. NIFA funds research and extension programs at land grant colleges, while ERS covers economic research on agriculture, food, and rural development. NASS is the principal data collection agency for USDA. The USDA's NASS is the principal data collection agency for most commodities, including specialty crops. They conduct the U.S. Census of Agriculture every five years and the Census of Horticultural Specialties every 10 years, providing detailed data on U.S. fruit, vegetable, tree nut, floriculture, nursery, and other specialty crop operations. This report focuses on selected USDA research programs that directly support U.S. specialty crop growers, excluding other research and extension services that support all agricultural producers. NIFA is the federal partner in the Cooperative Extension System, providing funding for state, local, and regional offices at land-grant colleges and universities. NIFA provides practical information to agricultural producers, small business owners, and the public. Their website offers contact information for land-grant colleges and universities. Specialty crop producers benefit from programs like SARE grants and the SCRI, which prioritize multistate projects to address industry issues through research and extension activities. SCRI prioritizes multistate, multi-institutional, and trans-disciplinary projects in plant breeding, genetics, and genomics, pest and disease management, production efficiency, technology innovation, and food safety. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized SCRI with additional funds of $80 million annually. The 2014 farm bill allocated funds of $80 million annually and extended authority to appropriate funds of $25 million per fiscal year. It also established an Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program, with a citrus disease subcommittee advising USDA on research and development needs. The subcommittee is responsible for proposing research agendas, evaluating ongoing projects, setting priorities for grants, and providing feedback on awarded grants. The USDA established the Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension Program, with a subcommittee advising on research needs and grant priorities. The ARS conducts research on alternatives to methyl bromide, a pesticide gas used in crop production. The U.S. Clean Air Act phased out methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol by January 1, 2005. Exemptions include Quarantine and Preshipment (QPS) for quarantine pests and Critical Use Exemptions (CUEs) for agricultural production with no alternatives. Research on alternatives to methyl bromide is funded by ARS at universities in California and Florida. Specialty crop growers rely on pre-planting soil fumigation with MeBr for eggplant, cucurbits, and ornamental nursery crops. Some seek exemptions for critical use due to the lack of effective alternatives. The phase-out of MeBr by January 1, 2015, has no provision for critical uses. USDA's Food Nutrition Service administers various domestic nutrition and food assistance programs under specific laws. The Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 and Assistance Act fall under Congressional jurisdiction in the Senate and House of Representatives. Food distribution programs by FNS provide access to food for children and low-income individuals through funding and USDA-purchased commodity foods, supporting U.S. agricultural producers, including fruit and vegetable growers. The USDA Foods program, managed by FNS, AMS, and FSA, purchases commodities like fruits and vegetables for distribution to organizations, including schools. FNS oversees the program, while AMS and FSA handle purchasing and delivery. There are two types of USDA-purchased commodities: mandated purchases and entitlement commodities. The USDA purchases entitlement commodities based on recipient preferences, with bonus buys from the contingency reserve for emergency surplus removals. Bonus buys stabilize market conditions and include specialty crops like fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts not typically part of entitlement purchases. USDA also directly purchases and donates non-price-supported commodities, including specialty crops. The USDA purchases and donates non-price-supported commodities, including specialty crops, to feed nutritionally vulnerable recipients through various federal programs like CSFP, TEFAP, NSLP, and CACFP. These purchases help balance supply and demand while supporting organizations serving low-income individuals and households. The USDA purchases a variety of food items for programs like SFSP, CACFP, and NSIP, with fruit and vegetable purchases representing a significant portion. Fruit and vegetable purchases by AMS were valued between $530 million to $660 million annually from FY2009-FY2013. Bonus buys for fruits and vegetables totaled $1.3 billion from FY2000-FY2009. The USDA purchases various food items for programs like SFSP, CACFP, and NSIP, with fruits and vegetables accounting for 27% of purchases in FY2009. AMS provides purchasing services to FNS for nutrition assistance programs and is reimbursed for administrative costs. Funding for USDA commodity purchases is classified as mandatory or discretionary, with primary sources including Section 6 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, Section 32, and Section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949. Minimum levels of specialty crop purchases were established under Section 32 by the 2002 and 2008 farm bills. The 2002 and 2008 farm bills set minimum levels of specialty crop purchases under Section 32, totaling $406 million annually. Recent omnibus farm bills require $50 million worth of fresh fruits and vegetables to be provided annually through the Department of Defense Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. USDA also provides cash assistance based on per-meal reimbursements for domestic food assistance programs. The USDA provides cash assistance through per-meal reimbursements for child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. These programs offer subsidies for free, reduced-price, and paid meals. Additionally, the Child and Adult Care Food Program and Summer Food Service Program may provide free meals or snacks to children at eligible sites. Federal funds support institutional purchasing of all foods, including fruits and vegetables, benefiting over 30 million children daily. In FY2013, federal assistance for school food programs totaled $15.7 billion, with the National School Lunch Program receiving the bulk of $12.3 billion. Cash reimbursement to states is based on the number of meals served, with rates varying by household income. USDA studies show an increase in the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables. Congress has expanded support for fruits and vegetables in USDA's nutrition programs. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 required updated nutrition guidelines for schools, leading to increased demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides free snacks of fresh produce to elementary school children. Started as a pilot program in 2002, it was reauthorized to include both fresh and dried fruits and vegetables. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) was reauthorized and expanded in the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act to include more states and reservations, making it a permanent part of child nutrition law. The program is now nationwide with permanent funding of over $150 million per school year. Administered through FNS, it provides free snacks of fresh produce to elementary school children in most states, except for Texas and New Jersey. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) is administered by agriculture agencies in most states, except for Texas and New Jersey. Various FNS programs provide foods for individuals and families, including CSFP, TEFAP, FDPIR, WIC, and disaster feeding programs. SNAP is the largest nutrition assistance program, providing benefits on EBT cards for SNAP-eligible foods at authorized stores. SNAP benefits can be redeemed for SNAP-eligible foods, including fruits and vegetables. Federal initiatives aim to promote fruit and vegetable consumption through domestic nutrition assistance programs. Farmers' markets are increasingly accepting EBT benefits and becoming SNAP-licensed retailers. In FY2012, 3,214 farmers' markets or individual farmers redeemed $16.6 million in SNAP benefits, showing a significant increase in authorizations and benefits redeemed compared to previous years. Two FNS-administered programs, WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (WIC-FMNP) and Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP), provide redeemable benefits to low-income WIC applicants, recipients, and seniors at farmers' markets. These programs allow for purchases of fruits, vegetables, and tree nut products through redeemable coupons. Additionally, specialty crop producers can benefit from obtaining organic certification to sell their products as \"organic.\" The Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) of 1990 and USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations require that agricultural products labeled as \"organic\" originate from certified farms or handling operations. Organic agriculture is a small but growing sector in the U.S., with farm sales from organic fruit and vegetable operations totaling over $1 billion annually. The 2014 farm bill authorized nearly $80 million annually for certified organic agricultural production, an increase from previous years. The annual estimate of certified organic production includes fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, meat, and dairy foods. In 2008, there were approximately 3,900 vegetable farms, 3,300 fruit and tree nut farms, and 1,600 berry farms growing certified organic products. Organic fruit and vegetable production is concentrated in California, Washington, Oregon, Florida, and Colorado. Differences exist between U.S. specialty crop and organic producers in terms of farm bill priorities and programs supported. USDA programs for organic agricultural producers are spread across various titles of the farm bill. Organic agricultural producers are covered by programs in the farm bill, mainly administered by AMS and USDA's research and extension agencies. The National Organic Program (NOP) ensures the integrity of USDA organic products through national standards. NOP regulations, established in 2002, specify methods for certified organic production. The National Organic Program (NOP) oversees certified organic production, with products labeled as \"organic\" originating from certified farms or handling operations. Funding for the program covers regulatory enforcement, review of NOP regulations, and responding to international equivalency agreements. Annual authorizations for funding have increased over the years, with the 2014 farm bill authorizing $15 million annually. No user fees are charged for appropriated activities. The USDA Organic Certification Cost Share Program helps offset costs of NOP certification for producers through two programs: the National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program (NOCCSP) and the Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) Organic Certification Cost-Share Program. These programs allocate funds to state agencies to reimburse certified organic operators for a portion of their certification costs. The National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program (NOCCSP) and the Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) Organic Certification Cost-Share Program provide financial assistance to over 9,000 producers annually. Organic operators can receive reimbursement of 75% of their certification costs up to $750 per category. The program is administered on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are exhausted, and is available in all 50 states and territories. USDA pays out approximately $5-$6 million annually for reimbursements. The USDA pays out $5-$6 million annually to states and territories for farmer reimbursements. The AMA Organic Certification Cost-Share Program provides funds to organic producers in 16 states with low participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Eligible states include Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Funds must be used within the allocated fiscal year, with roughly $1.1-$1.3 million paid out annually. The program is authorized to receive $1.5 million in mandatory funds annually through FY2018. The USDA's Organic Production and Market Data Initiatives (ODI) program, authorized in the 2002 and expanded in the 2008 farm bill, requires segregated data on organic agricultural production. The 2008 farm bill provided one-time mandatory funding of $5 million and authorized annual appropriations of up to $5 million until FY2012. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized appropriations of $5 million annually for the USDA's Organic Production and Market Data Initiatives (ODI) program, with funds available until expended. The program covers various organic agricultural products and is administered by three USDA agencies. Additionally, the bill includes provisions to facilitate the development of an organic research and promotion program by U.S. certified organic producers. U.S. certified organic producers are encouraged to develop an organic research and promotion program for organic products. The enacted bill allows organic producers to withdraw from conventional agriculture check-off programs and exempts them from paying promotion order assessments. This exemption applies to various organic agricultural products, including specialty crops, meat, poultry, dairy foods, and processed foods. Each state reports some level of certified organic production and/or processing. The farm bill allows organic producers to withdraw from conventional agriculture check-off programs and exempts them from paying promotion order assessments. This exemption applies to various organic agricultural products, including specialty crops, meat, poultry, dairy foods, and processed foods. USDA is directed to publish regulations regarding compliance for an exemption and is authorized to issue an organic check-off program for domestic and imported certified organic products. Establishing an organic check-off program involves submitting a proposal that meets USDA's requirements, public meetings, board nominations, budget planning, and USDA approval. The Organic Trade Association promotes this initiative, while some groups like the Cornucopia Institute oppose it. After USDA review and public comment, a proposed check-off plan goes to a referendum vote for implementation. Establishing an organic check-off program involves submitting a proposal that meets USDA's requirements, public meetings, board nominations, budget planning, and USDA approval. A two-thirds majority of all industry stakeholders is required for the proposed check-off plan to be adopted. The farm bill conferees acknowledged that an organic check-off program would differ from existing check-offs and could be established based on specific production and processing practices. The law governing check-off programs prohibits advertising that may disparage another commodity and encourages USDA to review and revise its guidance for overseeing commodity research and promotion programs to address potential disparagement. The Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) provides grants for organic agriculture production, breeding, and processing methods. Priority concerns include projects in biological, physical, and social sciences. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized OREI with increased funding. The program is administered by NIFA and a list of funded projects is available on USDA's website. The Organic Transitions Program (ORG) funded by NIFA supports research, extension, and education programs to enhance the competitiveness of organic producers. It focuses on biologically based pest management practices and improving organic livestock and crop production. The program, part of the Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program, receives approximately $4.0 million annually through FY2018. Funding details and project listings are available on USDA's website. The EQIP Organic Initiative, part of the 2008 farm bill, provides financial and technical assistance to organic producers through NRCS. Eligible applicants include certified organic producers, those transitioning to organic production, or selling less than $5,000 organic products. Assistance is limited to $20,000 annually and $80,000 over six years. The initiative funded contracts totaling $23.8 million (FY2010) and $35.7 million (FY2011-FY2012). The initiative funded contracts totaling $23.8 million (FY2010) and $35.7 million (FY2011-FY2012) to producers across all states, with some states having obligations to producers totaling more than $1 million annually. Various farm bill programs assist specialty crop producers, including conservation programs that benefit all eligible U.S. agricultural producers. Recent farm bills have expanded incentives to encourage greater farmer participation through cost-sharing and technical assistance programs. The fruit and vegetable industry heavily relies on labor-intensive processes, with labor expenses totaling 48% and 36% of total variable expenses on fruit and vegetable farms. This is much higher compared to the average of 17% across all farms and 5%-6% on corn and soybean farms. The industry often depends on immigrant workers and faces labor shortages in some areas. Certain lower-skilled foreign workers can be admitted to the U.S. under temporary worker visas. The H-2A visa program allows agricultural employers in the United States to bring nonimmigrant foreign workers for temporary agricultural labor when domestic workers are not available. Administered by the Department of Labor, Homeland Security, and State, the program requires employers to demonstrate the unavailability of domestic workers. The H-2A visa program allows agricultural employers to bring in foreign workers when domestic workers are unavailable. Employers must show this to the Department of Labor (DOL) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DOL administers programs like the National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) to help domestic agricultural workers with training and employment services. Grantees provide job training and employment services to migrant and seasonal farmworkers to address unemployment and increase family income. DOL enforces protections for agricultural workers and monitors labor conditions. OSHA ensures workplace safety. Special education provisions exist for farmworkers' children under the No Child Left Behind Act."
