The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to establish a fee for administering the self-sufficiency program for families receiving voucher assistance through section 8(o). Public housing agencies serving 25 or more participants in the program will receive a fee to cover the costs. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to establish a fee for administering the self-sufficiency program for families receiving voucher assistance through section 8(o). Public housing agencies serving 25 or more participants in the program will receive a fee equal to the costs of employing one full-time family self-sufficiency coordinator. Agencies meeting performance standards will receive additional fees for employing more coordinators based on the number of participating families. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides funding for family self-sufficiency coordinators to public housing agencies. Agencies can receive funding for the highest number of coordinators funded in a single fiscal year between 1999 and 2008. In the initial year of developing a self-sufficiency program, agencies are entitled to funding for one coordinator. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides funding for family self-sufficiency coordinators to public housing agencies based on specified criteria. State and regional agencies are treated separately for funding calculations, and the number of coordinators funded depends on the agency's participant count. The average number of families enrolled in an agency's family self-sufficiency program during the most recent fiscal year will determine the number of coordinators funded. Priority is given to funding one coordinator at each agency with an existing program, with remaining funds prorated based on the number of coordinators needed. The Secretary will recapture any unspent fees allocated in a fiscal year and make them available for additional fees. Within six months of enactment, the Secretary will publish performance standards for funding under subparagraph (B), including requirements for clauses (ii) and (iii). The standards for family self-sufficiency programs include leveraging in-kind services and resources. Public housing agencies must collect and report program performance data to the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate program effectiveness through a formal process, including random participant assignment. The Secretary will submit interim and final evaluation reports to Congress within specified timeframes. $10,000,000 is authorized for the evaluation. Up to 10% of funds can be reserved for innovative or successful family self-sufficiency programs. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 29, 2009."
