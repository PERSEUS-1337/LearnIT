    "content": "The Act titled \"Judicial Powers Restoration Act of 2005\" aims to restore judicial powers. The \"Judicial Powers Restoration Act of 2005\" aims to restore judicial powers as outlined in the Constitution, specifically regarding the interpretation of Article III and the definition of \"judicial power\" by the Supreme Court in Muskrat v. United States. The plaintiff filed claims in a US district court against an alleged infringer based on US laws and treaties, including the Trademark Act of 1946 and the Inter-American Convention for Trademark and Commercial Protection. Just before the trial in October 1998, the alleged infringer obtained an amendment to the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, known as \"section 211,\" which has been advantageous to the defendant in court. Section 211(a)(2) and (b) prohibit US courts from recognizing or enforcing certain actions. Section 211 of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act prevents US courts from deciding ownership and enforceability of certain trademarks, stripping them of authority in such cases. This has hindered plaintiffs from asserting infringement claims by prohibiting payment of fees for trademark registration and renewal. Repeal of section 211 is necessary to restore courts' power in determining ownership and enforceability of trademarks, preserving registrations pending such determinations. The purpose of this Act is to restore the judiciary's power to decide trademark and trade name cases under US laws and treaties. The purpose of this Act is to restore the judiciary's power to decide trademark and trade name cases under US laws and treaties. SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF JUDICIAL POWERS.

US courts have the authority to recognize rights in trademarks or trade names based on common law or registration. The Trademark Act of 1946 allows for recognition of trademark rights based on common law, registration, or treaties the US is a party to."
