    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes California's vital freight transportation system, crucial for the state's economy and jobs. Investments in zero-emission technology at public seaports are essential to reduce costs and support infrastructure. A new section 6377.5 is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code. Section 6377.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts gross receipts from taxes for qualified tangible personal property used at California public ports for freight handling. \"Primarily\" means 50% or more of the time, and a \"qualified person\" includes stevedores and port operators. The exemption under Section 6377.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code applies to qualified tangible personal property used at California public ports for freight handling. This includes zero-emission equipment necessary for the movement of goods, such as computers and software. Special purpose buildings and foundations used as part of the process of utilizing zero-emission or near-zero-emission equipment qualify as tangible personal property subject to sales or use tax. Zero-emission or near-zero-emission equipment refers to off-road vehicles and related technologies used within specific boundaries. The California public seaport exempts zero-emission and near-zero-emission equipment from sales or use tax, provided the purchaser provides an exemption certificate to the retailer. This equipment includes advanced fuel engines, hybrid technologies, and other emission reduction technologies for seaport equipment. The exemption for zero-emission and near-zero-emission equipment from sales or use tax does not apply to taxes levied by counties, cities, or districts under specific laws or to certain taxes deposited in the State Treasury. The exemption provided by this section does not apply if the property is removed from California within one year of purchase or used in a manner not qualifying for exemption. This section also applies to leases of qualified tangible personal property, with the exemption applying if the lessee is a qualified person using the property for a qualified purpose. Upon the effective date of this section, the Department of Finance will estimate total exemptions for each calendar year. By March 1 of the following year, the board will report exemptions taken compared to the department's estimates. If exemptions taken are less than estimated, options for increasing exemptions will be identified. This act constitutes a tax levy under California law. This act constitutes a tax levy under California law and shall go into immediate effect."
