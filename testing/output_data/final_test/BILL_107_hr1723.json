    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act of 2001\". Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women, with more women in the United States living with breast cancer than any other cancer. Approximately 3 million women in the US have breast cancer, with 233,000 new cases estimated in 2001. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States, with approximately 40,000 deaths each year. It is the leading cause of cancer death for women aged 20-59 globally. A woman in the US has a 1 in 8 chance of developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. About 90% of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family history of the disease. The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer emphasizes the need for increased research on the role of the environment in breast cancer development. There is a call for expanded federal investment to study the effects of chemicals and radiation on cancer development. Prospective studies may be necessary to understand the impact of radiation on cancer development. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on research centers focusing on environmental factors related to breast cancer. The Director of the Institute will make grants to develop and operate Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Centers of Excellence for multidisciplinary research on environmental factors related to breast cancer. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Advisory Panel will oversee the grant process and make final recommendations on fund allocation. The Secretary will establish the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel with nine appointed members from various health disciplines and geographical regions to oversee the allocation of grant funds. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Panel will consist of individuals from practice, academia, and research settings, including three consumer representatives who have had breast cancer. The Panel will select a chairman from among the appointed members and meet at least once a year. Each center must collaborate with community organizations representing women with breast cancer in their geographic area. The Director of the Institute coordinates information among centers, ensures communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center must be formed from a consortium of cooperating institutions and collaborate among scientists, health professionals, and advocates. Support for a center may last up to 5 years. The Director of the Institute coordinates information among centers, ensures communication, and may require reports on center activities. Centers must use innovative approaches to study unexplored areas of the environment and breast cancer. The Director shall provide for an equitable geographical distribution of centers. $30,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2007 for this purpose. The authorization of $30,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2007 is in addition to any other available appropriations for the purpose mentioned."
