    "content": "The \"Mortgage Enhancement and Modification Act of 2008\" allows for safe harbor protection for qualified loan modifications or workout plans for certain residential mortgage loans. The duty of a servicer of pooled residential mortgage loans is to maximize recovery for all investors, not individual parties. Servicers must act in the best interest of all investors when dealing with loans in default or at risk of default. The loan servicer must make reasonable efforts to implement a modification or workout plan for loans in default or at risk of default. If unsuccessful, other loss mitigation actions can be taken to maximize the net present value of the loans. The servicer must act in the best interest of all investors by proactively contacting borrowers approaching interest rate changes on their loans. The servicer must assess the borrower's ability to make payments after interest rate changes and determine if default is likely. If necessary, a loan modification or mitigation effort should be considered. Servicers following these guidelines are protected from liability when offering qualified loan modifications. The servicer is protected from liability when offering qualified loan modifications to individuals with ownership or obligations related to residential mortgage loans or securities. This protection extends to those insuring loans under US or state regulations, as well as other entities with financial relationships. The section outlines rules for loan modifications, including the definition of a qualified loan modification or workout plan. It specifies that such plans must last until the borrower sells or refinances the property, or for at least 5 years, and must not result in negative amortization. The qualified loan modification or workout plan must not result in negative amortization, must not require additional points and fees, must improve the borrower's ability to prevent foreclosure and resume a reasonable repayment schedule, must reduce the likelihood of default or foreclosure, and may waive prepayment penalties that hinder the borrower's ability to pay down the principal or maintain regular payments. The term \"residential mortgage loan\" refers to a loan secured by a lien on an owner-occupied residential dwelling. A \"securitization vehicle\" is a structure like a trust or corporation used for securitizing loans. A liability entity, special purpose entity, or similar structure created by the issuer of mortgage-backed securities that holds residential mortgage loans. The safe harbor limitations do not affect other servicer liabilities to investors and holders of beneficial interests in pooled loans to a securitization vehicle. The section outlines the obligations under various laws and regulations for loan modification plans initiated before January 1, 2012."
