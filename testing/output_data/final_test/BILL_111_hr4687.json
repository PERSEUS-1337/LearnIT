    "content": "The Act titled \"Low Income Housing Tax Credit Exchange Expansion and Job Creation Act of 2010\" allows grants to states for low-income housing projects instead of low-income housing credit allocations for 2010. The Act provides grants to states for low-income housing projects in 2010, replacing low-income housing credit allocations. The Secretary of the Treasury grants each State an amount equal to its low-income housing credit allocation election amount, which is determined based on specific criteria. A State housing credit agency receiving a grant under this section shall use it to make subawards for the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of qualified low-income buildings, with or without an allocation under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The agency must determine that making subawards without an allocation will increase the total funds available for affordable housing. The State housing credit agency must establish a process for applicants to show efforts to secure investment commitments before receiving subawards. Subawards for low-income housing must adhere to the same requirements as housing credit allocations, including rent, income, and use restrictions. The State housing credit agency must perform asset management functions to ensure compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and the viability of buildings funded by subawards. The agency may collect fees from recipients to cover expenses and may hire private contractors for this purpose. The State housing credit agency must impose conditions on subawards to ensure low-income building compliance. Recapture may be required for noncompliance, with payments going to the Treasury. Enforcement methods include liens. The State housing credit agency can subordinate liens to third-party loans. Unused grant funds must be returned to the Treasury if not used by specific dates. Subawards not disbursed by certain dates must also be returned unless certain conditions are met. Any subawards returned to the State housing credit agency on or after January 1, 2012, must be promptly returned to the Secretary of the Treasury and deposited in the general fund. Definitions in this section align with those in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Appropriations are made to the Secretary of the Treasury as needed for implementation. SEC. 3. Grants to states for low-income housing projects instead of low-income housing credits for bond-subsidized housing projects. The Secretary of the Treasury will grant each State an amount equal to its low-income bond-subsidized housing election amount, which is determined by the State and cannot exceed 85% of the State's bond-subsidized credit amount. The bond-subsidized credit amount is the total low-income housing credits that would be awarded to the State without certain tax code provisions. Qualified residential rental project bonds are defined as bonds issued for low-income buildings, where 95% or more of the proceeds are used for qualified residential rental projects. These bonds are taken into account under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. A State receiving a grant under this section must use it to make subawards for the construction or rehabilitation of low-income buildings that have received qualified residential rental project bonds. Subawards must adhere to the same requirements as low-income housing credit allocations, including rent, income, and use restrictions. The State receiving a grant must use it to make subawards for low-income building construction or rehabilitation, ensuring compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and building viability. Fees can be collected from subaward recipients for administrative expenses. A State receiving a grant must impose conditions on subawards to ensure low-income building compliance. Recapture may be enforced for noncompliance, with amounts proportional to the violation period and basis out of compliance. Recaptured funds go to the Treasury and can be enforced through liens. A State housing credit agency may enforce liens or other methods determined by the Treasury. Subawardees must show efforts to sell allocated bonds, and reallocation may increase funds for affordable housing without affecting subawards. The State can reallocate bond authority for residential rental projects without affecting subawards. Reallocated bonds won't impact eligibility for low-income housing credits or grants. Unused grant funds must be returned by January 1, 2012, and any undispersed subaward portion will also be returned unless 30% of the subawardee's total adjusted basis has been paid or incurred by that date. The subaward portion not disbursed by January 1, 2013, must be returned to the Treasury. Any subawards returned to the State housing credit agency after January 1, 2012, will be promptly sent back to the Treasury. Amounts returned will go to the Treasury's general fund. Definitions in this section align with those in the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary of the Treasury or delegate is referenced. Appropriations are made to the Secretary. Appropriations are made to the Secretary of the Treasury as necessary to carry out this section. SEC. 4. COORDINATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT WITH LOW-INCOME HOUSING GRANTS.

The amendment to section 42(i) of the Internal Revenue Code reduces state housing credit ceiling for low-income housing grants received in 2010 and denies credit for bond-subsidized buildings receiving subawards with 2010 grant funds. Grants and loans do not reduce basis under certain conditions. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit Exchange Expansion and Job Creation Act of 2010 excludes grants from gross income for taxable years ending after December 31, 2009. The amendment excludes grants from gross income for taxable years ending after December 31, 2008."
