    "content": "The web is not the same as the Internet; it is a part of it where information can be accessed. The Surface Web is the content accessible through search engines, while the Deep Web includes unindexed content like private intranets and commercial databases. The Dark Web is intentionally hidden within the Deep Web. The Dark Web is a hidden segment of the Deep Web accessed with special software for sharing information and files with little risk of detection. The number of Internet users has grown significantly over the years, with over 46% of the world population connected to the Internet as of July 2016. Data on the various layers of the web are less clear, but the web's magnitude is expanding with millions of domain names registered globally. The global number of Internet top-level domain names registered during the second quarter of 2016 was 334.6 million, showing a 12.9% increase from 2015. There were over 1.154 billion websites estimated in February 2017. The Deep Web, inaccessible to traditional search engines, contains dynamic and unindexed content, making its size difficult to measure. Initial estimates suggest it could be 4,000-5,000 times larger than the Surface Web, with continuous growth due to changing information access methods. The Deep Web is growing exponentially, with the Dark Web also expanding as new tools make it easier to navigate. The Dark Web can be accessed through networks like Tor and I2P, allowing for anonymous communication online. The extent of legal versus illegal activities on the Dark Web is unclear. Tor is a software and network that allows users to connect to websites through virtual tunnels, concealing their identities. Traffic is routed through layers of relays around the world, with at least three relays used before reaching the destination. The final relay, known as the exit relay, is seen as the source of the IP address. The final relay in Tor, known as the \"exit relay,\" hides users' IP addresses. Data shows the number of daily Tor users in different countries, with the US having the highest. Communication about the Dark Web often happens on platforms like Reddit. Reddit is a platform where individuals discuss the Dark Web, with subreddits like DarkNetMarkets and DeepWeb. Users can find links to Dark Web sites on these forums. For more secure communication, users can use email, web chats, or messaging on Tor, which offers encrypted storage and anonymous messaging. Real-time chat rooms like The Hub and OnionChat are also available on Tor, organized by topic. Some sites require registration, while others allow participation without any user information. Some messaging options for Tor users include Tor Messenger, Bitmessage, and decentralized systems like Ricochet. The Deep (and Dark) Web may not be indexed by traditional search engines due to its unstructured or temporary content. The Deep Web, including the Dark Web, has different navigation mechanisms compared to the Surface Web. Users access Dark Web sites through directories like the \"Hidden Wiki\" or search engines like Ahmia and Grams. Websites on the Dark Web have URLs ending in \"onion\" suffix instead of traditional endings like .com or .org. When using Tor to access hidden services with \".onion\" domains, an onion icon appears in the browser. Tor's speed is slow due to traffic being routed through multiple relays, causing delays. Increasing the number of users as relays can improve speed. Other tools like Tor2web allow access to Tor-hosted content without installing Tor, but anonymity is compromised. Tor2web and other bridges offer access to Tor-hosted sites, but users may be more easily detected by law enforcement for illegal activities. Anonymity provided by Tor is not foolproof, as researchers are constantly working on ways to identify hidden services or individuals. In 2011, Anonymous crashed a Tor-hosted website called Freedom Hosting, which was home to numerous child pornography sites, including Lolita City. Anonymous matched digital fingerprints to uncover illegal content on these sites. In 2013, Anonymous targeted Freedom Hosting, leaking user data of Lolita City members and the FBI took control of the hosting service, infecting it with custom malware. In 2017, hackers affiliated with Anonymous took down Freedom Hosting II on the dark web. Freedom Hosting II, a dark web hosting provider, was shut down after hackers revealed that over 50% of its content was related to child pornography. The FBI conducted an investigation into a child pornography website called Playpen, which had nearly 215,000 members. Using a network investigative technique, the FBI uncovered about 1,300 IP addresses and filed criminal charges against individuals involved. Anonymizing services like Tor have been used for legal and illegal activities, with over 185 individuals facing criminal charges related to the use of 1,300 traced IP addresses. While there are legitimate uses for Tor, much of the focus is on its illegal activities, such as selling drugs. Privacy advocates support Tor for maintaining free speech and anonymity, especially in anti-censorship and political activism efforts. Tor is used for Anti-Censorship and Political Activism purposes, allowing users to bypass blocked content. Some governments have tried to regulate or block access to Tor. Political dissidents use Tor to secure communications, as seen in movements in Iran and Egypt. It is also used for sensitive communications in chat rooms for personal and business reasons, providing a safe space for discussing private issues and protecting children online. Tor is used for various purposes such as protecting children online, safeguarding projects for businesses, and enabling journalists to communicate safely with whistleblowers. Edward Snowden used Tor to leak classified information on U.S. mass surveillance programs. The NSA has made efforts to exploit the Tor browser to de-anonymize users. Just as nefarious activity can occur on the Surface Web, it can also happen on the Deep Web. Criminals operating in cyberspace rely on the Dark Web to carry out activities with reduced risk of detection. They use the Internet for traditional crimes like distributing drugs and sex trafficking, as well as technology-driven crimes such as identity theft and payment card fraud. Malicious actors, including terrorists and state-sponsored spies, leverage cyberspace for conversation, coordination, and action. The Dark Web facilitates a wide variety of crimes, including selling illicit goods like drugs, weapons, and stolen information. There are also gambling sites, assassins for hire, and child pornography. Data on the prevalence of these sites is lacking, with only about 1.5% of Tor users visiting hidden services. The actual percentage serving illicit markets is unclear, as is the amount of Tor traffic going to specific sites. Researchers ran 40 relay computers in the Tor network, gathering data on about 45,000 hidden services online. 2% of these sites were related to child abuse, but they received 83% of the visits. A study from King's College London identified 5,205 live websites on the Dark Web, with about half containing classified content. Researchers analyzed about 2,723 websites on Tor's hidden services, finding that 1,547 contained illicit content. The Dark Web hosts between 50,000 and 60,000 unique .onion addresses daily, with a small percentage of total Tor traffic. It can be used for malicious activities like coordinating crimes through chat rooms and communication services. The Dark Web facilitates various criminal activities, including tax-refund fraud and selling illegal goods. It plays a significant role in data breaches by providing a platform to purchase malware like RAM scrapers used in large-scale breaches. Stolen information, such as credit and debit card details, can be sold for profit on the Dark Web through specialty markets like \"card shops.\" Specialty markets on the Dark Web, like \"card shops,\" facilitate the sale of stolen data. In an experiment, fake data was planted on DropBox and black market sites, viewed over 1,100 times in 12 days across 22 countries. Cybercriminals exploit borders to victimize individuals and organizations without regard for jurisdictional boundaries. Criminals exploit the lack of consistent laws across jurisdictions to carry out fraud and schemes in the virtual realm. High-speed internet allows them to target victims globally without physically crossing borders, using tools like botnets to operate remotely. Cyber criminals exploit the lack of consistent laws across jurisdictions to target victims globally without physically crossing borders. Boundaries within cyberspace, such as jurisdictional and technological barriers, still exist, including country-specific web addresses and the division between the Surface Web and the Deep Web. Some websites require subscriptions or fee-based access, while others may only be accessed through invitations. The Dark Web offers added anonymity for criminals selling illicit goods, allowing them to evade detection more easily. The Dark Web provides added anonymity for sellers of illicit goods, but they may struggle to establish trust with customers due to the lack of reputation. Bitcoin is commonly used for transactions on the Dark Web, offering decentralized and anonymous peer-to-peer transactions. The transaction is recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain, containing bitcoin addresses of the sender and recipient. Addresses do not uniquely identify bitcoins but transactions. Users' addresses are stored in a wallet with a private key for spending bitcoins. Wallets can be hosted online, on software, or hardware devices. The Dark Web offers anonymity for illicit transactions using Bitcoin, but trust can be an issue due to lack of reputation. The Dark Web provides anonymity for illicit transactions using Bitcoin, but trust can be an issue due to lack of reputation. Law enforcement can leverage the anonymity of the Dark Web for online surveillance, sting operations, and maintaining anonymous tip lines. The FBI has developed malware to compromise servers and track users of Tor since 2002. Law enforcement uses the Computer Internet Protocol Address Verifier (CIPAV) to identify suspects hiding their location with proxy servers or anonymity services like Tor. They target hackers, online predators, and others, working with companies to develop technologies for investigating crimes on the Dark Web. In addition to infiltrating Tor, law enforcement relies on traditional crime-fighting techniques and criminals' mistakes. For example, the FBI took down the Silk Road in 2013 due to missteps by the site's operator. Federal agents exploited weaknesses in the computer code of the Silk Road website to hack the servers and seize their unique identifying addresses. They shut down Silk Road 2.0 after the site's proprietor made critical errors, such as using his personal email address to register the servers. Law enforcement can still use traditional crime-fighting means, like requesting information from entities that collect user data. In March 2015, federal investigators subpoenaed Reddit for information. In March 2015, federal investigators subpoenaed Reddit for personal data on five users of the r/darknetmarkets forum. Anonymity in the Dark Web can shield military systems from hacking and is used by groups like IS for activities beyond propaganda. The Department of Defense (DOD) can monitor and disrupt terrorist activities on the Dark Web, including using Bitcoin for funding. The military can utilize Tor software for covert operations like website takedowns or intercepting enemy communications. DARPA is developing a new search engine called Memex for these purposes. DARPA's Memex project aims to develop a new search engine to uncover patterns in online data for law enforcement to track illegal activity, including human trafficking. By accessing hidden sites on the Dark Web, the project seeks to create a more comprehensive map of Internet content. The Intelligence Community also utilizes the Dark Web for open intelligence purposes. The Intelligence Community uses the Deep Web and Dark Web for open intelligence purposes. Admiral Mike Rogers mentioned the NSA's efforts to locate individuals who try to remain hidden. The NSA's XKeyscore program can electronically fingerprint users attempting to download Tor. Some IC activities related to the Deep Web are classified, but programs like IARPA may involve searching data stored there. Signature-based detection tools are not effective in this environment. The Cyber-attack Automated Unconventional Sensor Environment (CAUSE) program aims to develop new automated methods to forecast and detect cyber-attacks earlier. It could utilize actor behavior models and black market sales data to anticipate cyber events on the Deep Web and Dark Web, which are of increasing interest to researchers and law enforcement. Anonymity provided by services like Tor contributes to the lack of clarity on these layers of the Internet. Researchers and law enforcement are concerned about the evolving technology of the Dark Web, including encryption and attribution challenges, to combat malicious actors exploiting cyberspace. There is debate on whether individuals will turn to anonymizing services like Tor for increased privacy and security online. The evolving technology of the Dark Web poses challenges for researchers and law enforcement in combating malicious actors who exploit cyberspace, including the use of anonymizing services like Tor for increased privacy and security online."
