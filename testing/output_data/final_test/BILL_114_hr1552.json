    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that all uses of antibiotics, including in food-producing animals, can lead to antibiotic resistance in humans. Despite FDA findings in 1977 and guidance in 2012, action was not taken to address this issue. The use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. Strategies for controlling antibiotic resistance, including limiting medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals, are necessary. The 2014 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Report also concludes that agricultural use of antibiotics can affect human health. Recently published scientific studies have shown that food-producing animals and animal production facilities are sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can infect humans and increase the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance is a crisis that threatens public health, the economy, and national security. In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that antibiotic-resistant infections cause at least 2 million infections, 23,000 deaths, 8 million additional hospital days, and $20 to $35 billion in excess direct healthcare costs each year in the United States. The 2014 World Health Organization report concluded that antimicrobial resistance is a current global issue. The 2014 report highlighted the serious threat of antimicrobial resistance, stating that without effective antibiotics, common infections could become untreatable and medical advances like joint replacements and chemotherapy could become nonviable. Antibiotic resistance may also impair the ability to respond to terrorist attacks involving bacterial infections. In 2010, 80% of antibacterial drugs in the US were sold for use on food animals, with 13.5 million kg sold for animals and 3.3 million kg for human health. From 2009 to 2012, the use of medically important antibiotics in food-producing animals increased by 16%. The FDA modified the antibiotic approval process in 2003 to consider resistant bacteria as a safety concern. Most antibiotics used in animal production were approved before this change. The FDA has not set a schedule for reviewing these existing approvals. FDA Guidance documents aim to reduce overall antibiotic consumption but still allow their use for routine disease prevention without specific evidence or mitigation requirements. The FDA's antibiotic approval process was modified in 2003 to address resistant bacteria. However, there is a lack of distinction on drug labels between disease prevention and growth promotion. The EU banned antibiotic use for growth promotion in 2006, leading to decreased usage without impacting livestock production. Denmark's ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in food-animal production also resulted in significant changes. The use of antibiotics in food-animal production led to a decrease in antimicrobial resistance in various bacterial species. In the Netherlands, the shift from growth promotion to disease prevention did not affect antibiotic consumption but improved surveillance led to a decline in usage. Without restrictions on antimicrobial drugs, export markets for livestock and poultry could be negatively impacted. Over 400 organizations support legislation to phase out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farm animals. The purpose of this Act is to preserve the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials used in the treatment of human and animal diseases by requiring proof of safety for these antimicrobials. The Act aims to ensure the safety of medically important antimicrobials by requiring proof of no harm to human health due to antimicrobial resistance from nontherapeutic use. The Act mandates the phased elimination of nontherapeutic use of medically important antimicrobials in animals, with specific criteria for applicability. The Act requires the withdrawal of approval for nontherapeutic use of certain drugs in food-producing animals unless the Secretary determines there is no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. The Act mandates withdrawal of approval for nontherapeutic use of certain drugs in food-producing animals unless the Secretary determines no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. If an exemption is granted for a medically important antimicrobial drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals must be rescinded. The Act mandates withdrawal of approval for nontherapeutic use of certain drugs in food-producing animals unless the Secretary determines no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. If an exemption is granted for a medically important antimicrobial drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals must be rescinded 2 years after the application submission. Exceptions apply if the Secretary makes a final determination of no harm before the approval rescission date. The Act requires withdrawal of approval for nontherapeutic use of certain drugs in food-producing animals unless the Secretary determines no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance. If an exemption is granted for a medically important antimicrobial drug, approvals for nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals must be rescinded 2 years after the application submission, unless the Secretary determines no harm before that date. The development of antimicrobial resistance linked to nontherapeutic use of medically important antimicrobials, defined as drugs intended for food-producing animals containing specific classes of antibiotics. The World Health Organization identifies antimicrobials as highly important, critically important, or important. Therapeutic use involves treating animals with documented diseases, while nontherapeutic use refers to continued use after the disease is resolved. The term 'nontherapeutic use' of antibiotics in animals refers to administering them for purposes like growth promotion or disease prevention, excluding therapeutic or nonroutine disease control. 'Noncustomary situation' does not include normal practices or conditions. The term 'nonroutine disease control' involves using antibiotics on animals not sick but at risk due to specific, noncustomary situations on the premises. SEC. 5 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the administration of medically important antimicrobials to food-producing animals for nonroutine disease control. This includes using antibiotics on animals not sick but at risk due to specific, noncustomary situations on the premises. It is illegal to give medically important antimicrobials to food-producing animals for nonroutine disease control unless there is a significant risk of disease transmission, the antimicrobial is necessary to prevent transmission, it is given for the shortest duration possible, and it is administered in a way to prevent disease transmission. The new regulations prohibit the use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals for nonroutine disease control unless there is a significant risk of disease transmission. The antimicrobial must be necessary to prevent transmission, given at the barn, house, or pen level, and to the fewest animals possible. The definitions of 'food-producing animal' and 'medically important antimicrobial' are provided in the section. These amendments will be effective six months after the enactment of the Act."
