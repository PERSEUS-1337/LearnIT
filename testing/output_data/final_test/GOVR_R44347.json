The legislation also included funds for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Zika virus, and flood relief. The bill was signed into law by the President on September 29, 2016. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released The 2016 Long-Term Budget Outlook on July 12, 2016. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Enzi filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record on April 18, 2016. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees began reporting appropriations bills in mid-April. CBO released Updated Budget Projections on March 24, 2016. The House Budget Committee voted to report a budget resolution for FY2017 on March 16, 2016. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submitted the President's Budget for FY2017 to Congress on February 9, 2016. CBO released The Budget and Economic Outlook on January 25, 2016. In 2016, the House passed the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015, which was vetoed by the President. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 modified FY2016 and FY2017 discretionary caps and suspended the statutory debt limit. Full-year appropriations for FY2016 were enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended 56 tax provisions that expired in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office releases projections of federal spending and receipts for the current year and the next 10 years, known as the baseline, which Congress uses for budget decisions. The Congressional Budget Office releases projections of federal spending and receipts for the current year and the next 10 years, known as the baseline. The baseline provides a benchmark for measuring the budgetary impact of legislative proposals and enforcing budgetary constraints. Changes in budget projections are categorized into legislative, economic, and technical changes. The Budget and Economic Outlook is typically released in January, with updates in March and August. The Budget and Economic Outlook : 2016 to 2026 projected federal budget deficits of $544 billion in FY2016 and $561 billion in FY2017. The Congressional Budget Office projected federal budget deficits of $544 billion in FY2016 and $561 billion in FY2017, increasing from $439 billion in FY2015. Deficits are expected to rise to $1,366 billion in FY2026. The cumulative deficit from FY2016 to FY2025 is projected to be $8.556 trillion, with most of the increase attributed to decreased federal revenues. About half of the adjustments were due to legislation enacted in late 2015. The Congressional Budget Office projected federal budget deficits to increase, with adjustments in late 2015 accounting for roughly half of the changes. Legislative adjustments mainly reduced federal revenues, while economic revisions and technical modeling adjustments also contributed to deficit projections. CBO's Updated Budget Projections for 2016 to 2026 forecast a $534 billion deficit for FY2016, a $10 billion decrease from the previous projection in January 2016. The Congressional Budget Office projected federal budget deficits to increase, with adjustments in late 2015 accounting for roughly half of the changes. The projected cumulative deficit from FY2017 to FY2026 was $9.283 trillion, $95 billion lower than the January 2016 projections. This reduction is due to higher revenue projections increasing by $79 billion and lower outlays decreasing by $15 billion. CBO released An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026 on Tuesday, August 23, forecasting a $590 billion deficit in FY2016, a $56 billion increase from the estimate in March. The cumulative deficit from FY2017 through FY2026 is projected to be $8.573 trillion, a $712 billion decline from the March estimate. The Congressional Budget Office projected federal budget deficits to increase, with adjustments in late 2015 accounting for roughly half of the changes. The projected cumulative deficit from FY2017 to FY2026 was $9.283 trillion, $95 billion lower than the January 2016 projections. Changes to the economic forecast, including revisions to interest rates, inflation, GDP, and unemployment rate, contributed to a $712 billion decline in the budget outlook. The CBO also releases a long-term budget outlook annually, projecting federal spending and revenue levels for at least 25 years beyond the current fiscal year. This outlook includes projections of publicly held debt and key macroeconomic indicators, informing Congress about long-term trends. The Congressional Budget Office released The 2016 Long-Term Budget Outlook on July 12, 2016, projecting budget and debt trends through FY2046. The forecast shows an increase in long-term publicly held debt to 122% of GDP by FY2040, attributed to reductions in economic output and increases in federal spending. Currently, publicly held debt is at 75% of GDP, well above the historical average of 39% of GDP. CBO suggests policy changes to increase revenues or decrease noninterest spending by 1.7% of GDP annually. Policy adjustments to increase revenues or decrease noninterest spending by 1.7% of GDP annually are needed to maintain current debt levels by 2046. Additionally, a 2.9% of GDP adjustment is required to reach the 50-year historical average. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 mandates the President to submit a budget request to Congress, including estimates of spending, revenues, borrowing, and debt, along with policy recommendations. The President's budget, submitted by the Office of Management and Budget, is required to be submitted between the first Monday in January and the first Monday in February. The budget for FY2017 was submitted on February 9, 2016, projecting deficits for FY2016 and FY2017. The proposed budget included estimates of the budgetary effects of policy and legislative recommendations. The President's Budget projected real deficits to remain relatively level, averaging 2.6% of GDP from FY2018 through FY2026. It forecasted increases in both revenues and spending over time, with receipts rising to 20.0% of GDP and outlays increasing to 22.8% of GDP by FY2026. The current baseline projections showed higher deficits than the proposed budget, with deficits increasing from 3.2% of GDP in FY2017 to 5.0% of GDP in FY2026. Revenues were projected to decrease by $3.4 trillion, while outlays were expected to increase by $0.3 trillion from FY2017 through FY2026. The President's Budget projected deficits to remain level, with revenues decreasing by $3.4 trillion and outlays increasing by $0.3 trillion from FY2017 through FY2026. A request for emergency supplemental appropriations of $1.9 billion was submitted to address the Zika virus. The mid-session review included a projected deficit of $600 billion in FY2016, $16 billion lower than previously forecasted. The revised forecast also showed lower deficits from FY2017 through FY2026 by $881 billion, mainly due to reduced net interest costs and noninterest spending. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the annual adoption of a budget resolution, which serves as a framework for the upcoming fiscal year. The resolution does not become law but helps Congress consider a budget plan. Once agreed upon by both chambers, certain levels in the resolution are enforceable. Each Appropriations Committee is responsible for dividing its spending limit. The Budget Act of 1974 mandates the annual adoption of a budget resolution to guide the upcoming fiscal year. Appropriations Committees allocate funds based on 302(a) allocations, which are further divided into 302(b) subdivisions for each of the 12 appropriations bills. Congress is directed to complete the budget resolution by April 15, but often does so later. In years of disagreement, alternative legislative tools are used as substitutes for the budget resolution. The House Budget Committee held a markup on a budget resolution for FY2017, voting to report the resolution. The budget resolution, H.Con.Res. 125, aimed to reduce projected deficits and included reconciliation instructions to 12 House committees to reduce the deficit. The House Budget Committee directed 12 House committees to report legislation reducing the deficit over FY2017-FY2026, totaling $8.315 billion in savings. A policy statement declared plans for mandatory spending savings of $30 billion over FY2017-FY2018 and $140 billion over FY2017-FY2026. No further action has been taken on the committee-reported budget resolution. Congress may use a deeming resolution as a substitute for a budget resolution. The Senate Budget Committee used a deeming resolution for FY2017, setting enforceable spending levels consistent with the Budget Control Act. The Senate Budget Committee used a deeming resolution for FY2017 to set enforceable spending levels consistent with the Budget Control Act. In contrast, the House Appropriations Committee adopted interim 302(b) sub-allocations for each appropriations bill without enforceable caps. The House adopted a cap on individual appropriations bills to limit spending increases. Budget reconciliation is a congressional process that allows for changes to mandatory spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Committees develop legislation under expedited procedures for consideration in both the House and Senate. Since 1980, Congress has passed 24 bills through reconciliation, with the House and Senate resolving any differences in the legislation. The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 was passed by both chambers but vetoed by the President. Budget reconciliation allows for changes to mandatory spending, revenue, or the debt limit through expedited procedures in Congress. The appropriations process involves annual enactment of 12 regular appropriations bills to fund federal programs. Each Appropriations Committee receives a spending limit known as \"302(a) allocations\" and subdivides it among its 12 subcommittees. These allocations, called 302(b) subdivisions, set the maximum amount each bill can spend and are enforced through points of order. Appropriations must be enacted by the start of the fiscal year to avoid a government shutdown. The appropriations process involves annual enactment of 12 regular appropriations bills to fund federal programs. Congress uses House and Senate rules, budget resolution amounts, the Budget Act, and statutory limits on discretionary spending to shape appropriations measures. Continuing resolutions (CRs) are often used to fund programs when regular appropriations bills are not enacted. Full-year appropriations for FY2016 were passed in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. A continuing resolution (CR) was passed in September 2016 to fund programs through December 9, 2016, including the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2017 and emergency funds for the Zika virus. The FY2017 Continuing Resolution (CR) was signed into law on September 29, 2016, providing funding at a level 0.496% below FY2016 levels until December 9. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for increases in FY2017 discretionary cap levels. Defense budget authority is set at $551.068 billion, while nondefense budget authority is at $518.531 billion. The CR expires on December 9, prompting Congress to take further action. Congress is expected to take legislative action on appropriations legislation around December 9, after the 2016 elections. House and Senate committees began hearings on FY2017 appropriations in February 2016, with bills being reported in March and April. Both chambers passed individual appropriations measures, but none were sent to the President. The House and Senate considered supplemental appropriations for the Zika virus. The Senate Budget Committee Chairman filed budgetary levels for appropriations, while the House has not established enforceable levels yet. The House Appropriations Committee has adopted \"interim 302(b) sub-allocations\" for some individual appropriations bills, which do not act as an enforceable cap on appropriations measures on the floor. A separate order prohibits floor amendments that increase spending in general appropriations bills, effectively creating a cap on individual appropriations bills. Mandatory spending programs are federal programs where beneficiaries meeting requirements are entitled to payments, continuing annually without congressional action. The House and Senate committees have jurisdiction over mandatory spending programs, shaped by rules and budget resolutions. Congress considers legislation affecting mandatory spending annually. Revenue legislation authorizes tax collection to fund the government, often under the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee. Congress passes revenue legislation annually under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. In late 2015, the PATH Act extended 56 expiring tax provisions, some made permanent. Congress can restrict federal debt under the Constitution's \"power of the purse.\" Congress exercises its power of the purse through the federal debt limit, which includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. When debt levels approach the limit, Congress can choose to increase it, implement extraordinary measures, or temporarily suspend or abolish the limit. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have jurisdiction over debt limit legislation. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 suspended the debt limit until March 15, 2017. Current law dictates that the debt limit be increased as needed to accommodate federal borrowing. Congress may consider legislation to create new budget enforcement methods. Congress has various ways to enforce budget restrictions, including internal rules, budget resolutions, and legislation like the Budget Control Act. Recent legislation, such as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, has adjusted discretionary spending limits. The House and Senate Budget Committees have been focusing on reforming the congressional budget process this year. The House Budget Committee released working papers on overhauling the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, while the Senate Budget Committee released Budget Bulletins related to budget process reform. More information can be found on their respective websites. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 made changes to discretionary spending caps for FY2017 and set spending targets for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism. It also amended limits for adjustments under discretionary spending limits for Program Integrity Initiatives.
