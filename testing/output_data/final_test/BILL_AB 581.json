    "title": "AB 581",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 79707.5 of the Water Code requires recipients of funding from Chapter 6 to post signs acknowledging the funding source. State funding must be listed first if it covers 50% or more of the project costs. Chapter 11.2 of the Government Code establishes the State Facilities Renewal Bond Act of 2016, including the creation of a finance committee. The \"Fund\" refers to the State Facilities Renewal Bond Fund, and a \"State agency\" includes various state entities. \"Deferred maintenance projects\" are projects to replace infrastructure and building components to maintain assets. The State Facilities Renewal Bond Fund is created to address deferred maintenance projects on state-owned property. The fund can only be used upon appropriation by the Legislature and is intended for projects with a useful life of at least 20 years. The Governor proposes appropriations from the fund as part of the January 10 budget proposal. The Department of Finance must report the methodology for allocating bond funds and criteria for funding priorities to the Legislature within 10 days of the budget proposal. State agencies must report their deferred maintenance backlog, expenditures, and proposed projects within 30 days of the budget proposal. The agency's current budget for maintenance is insufficient to prevent an increase in the deferred maintenance backlog. Bonds totaling $2 billion may be issued to fund purposes outlined in the chapter, with repayment within 20 years. The State Facilities Renewal Bond Finance Committee is created to authorize the issuance and sale of bonds for maintenance purposes. The committee includes the Controller, Director of Finance, and Treasurer. The bonds will be prepared, executed, issued, sold, paid, and redeemed as per the State General Obligation Bond Law. The Treasurer serves as chairperson of the State Facilities Renewal Bond Finance Committee, which determines the need for issuing bonds for maintenance purposes. The committee can authorize successive bond issues as needed. The State Treasurer chairs the State Facilities Renewal Bond Finance Committee, authorizing bond issues for maintenance. An additional sum is collected annually to pay bond principal and interest, with appropriations from the General Fund. The Director of Finance may authorize withdrawal from the General Fund for unsold bonds authorized by the committee. The withdrawn amounts are deposited in the fund and must be returned with interest from bond proceeds. Moneys from bond premiums and interest are reserved in the fund for transfer to the General Fund as a credit for bond interest expenditures. The cost of bond issuance under Chapter 4 of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 is paid from bond proceeds and shared proportionally among funded programs. The committee can request a loan from the Pooled Money Investment Board for interim financing, not exceeding the unsold bond amount authorized for this purpose. Loaned amounts are deposited in the fund for allocation according to the chapter. The bonds may be refunded under the State General Obligation Bond Law. Voter approval for issuance includes approval for refunding bonds. The Treasurer may maintain separate accounts for bond proceeds and earnings to ensure tax-exempt status and other advantages under federal law. The Legislature declares that bond proceeds are not subject to tax limitations. The act will take effect upon voter approval of the State Facilities Renewal Bond Act of 2016. The act will be submitted to voters at the June 7, 2016, statewide primary election."
