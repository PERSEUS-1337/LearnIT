    "content": "The Product Carbon Disclosure Program is outlined in Section 1. The EPA will conduct a study on establishing a national program for measuring and labeling products based on their carbon content. The report to Congress will include the effectiveness of such a program in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, criteria for sectors and products to be covered, and identification of relevant products and processes. The report to Congress will include criteria for sectors and products to be covered in a national program for measuring and labeling products based on their carbon content. This will prioritize industrial products such as iron and steel, aluminum, cement, chemicals, and paper products, as well as food, beverage, hygiene, cleaning, household cleaners, construction, metals, clothing, semiconductor, and consumer electronics. Additionally, the report will suggest methodologies for measuring the carbon content of products and review existing greenhouse gas product accounting standards and practices. The report will evaluate secondary databases like the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey for a product carbon disclosure program and labeling program, identify data gaps, assess product comparisons and standards, and determine necessary information for clear communication on labels. An evaluation of boundaries for carbon lifecycle analysis, development of default values for non-participating producers, recommendation of certification options to prevent greenwashing, and assessment of consumer education on product carbon content and labeling program. An analysis of costs and timelines for a national product carbon disclosure and labeling program, including options for phased implementation and ways to minimize associated costs. Evaluation of incentives to accelerate emission reductions through efficient manufacturing and preference for lower-emission products. The Administrator will establish a national product carbon disclosure program within 36 months of the Act, allowing voluntary participation and potentially including a product carbon label for wholesale and consumer markets. This program aims to increase awareness of carbon content and reduce energy consumption nationwide. The national product carbon disclosure program will consider measurement standards, compatibility with existing programs, utilize incentives for adoption, develop protocols for assessing greenhouse gas content, and document best practices. The program aims to document best practices, ensure clarity and consistency, work with stakeholders to encourage participation, maintain consistent protocols, evaluate effectiveness, provide transparency on product carbon content, conduct public outreach and consumer education, and offer training programs for businesses to measure and reduce their carbon footprint. The program aims to reduce cost and time to measure products' carbon lifecycle, consult with relevant federal agencies, gather input from stakeholders, utilize verification systems for product certification, create a process for reviewing product carbon label accuracy, and specify data update frequency. The Administrator will report to Congress on the program's effectiveness, voluntary participation, and recommendations after 5 years. Definitions include \"carbon content\" as greenhouse gas emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent and \"carbon footprint\" as emissions from an activity, service, or entity. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for the study and $25,000,000 annually from 2010 to 2025 for the program."
