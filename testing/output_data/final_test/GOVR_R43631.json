    "content": "Part C of IDEA authorizes grants for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families to receive early intervention services. Approximately 373,000 infants and toddlers benefited from these services in 2016. IDEA, originally enacted in 1975, ensures education for children and youth with disabilities from birth through age 21. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted in 1975 to provide free and appropriate public education for children with disabilities. Congress found that many children were not receiving proper educational services, leading to the exclusion of 1 million children from the public school system. Factors like constitutional requirements, lack of funding, and the benefits of educating children with disabilities contributed to the enactment of IDEA. Part B of IDEA is known as the nation's special education law. The IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides free education for children with disabilities. Part B focuses on special education for children aged 3-21. The IDEA consists of four parts, including provisions for infants and toddlers with disabilities in Part C. Part D outlines national activities to improve education for children with disabilities. The IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides free education for children with disabilities. Part B focuses on special education for children aged 3-21. The IDEA consists of four parts, including provisions for infants and toddlers with disabilities in Part C. Since 1975, the IDEA has undergone reauthorizations to extend services and rights for children with disabilities, with the most recent reauthorization being P.L. 108-446 in 2004. In 1986, a new part related to infants and toddlers with disabilities was added, extending IDEA programs to children from birth to their third birthdays. Congress recognized the need to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and minimize potential developmental delays. The IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides free education for children with disabilities, including infants and toddlers. Congress aims to minimize the need for special education services as children reach school age, prevent institutionalization, promote independent living, and support families in meeting the needs of children with disabilities. The recent authorization of the IDEA emphasizes the importance of early brain development and enhancing the capacity of agencies to serve all children, especially those from minority, low-income, inner city, rural, and foster care backgrounds. All states and eligible territories are participating in the Part C program for infants and toddlers with disabilities. States must meet requirements such as providing early intervention services, designating a lead agency, and appointing an Interagency Coordinating Council. Governors are responsible for ensuring the comprehensive statewide early intervention system is implemented. The lead agency for the statewide early intervention system is designated by each state's governor and is responsible for administering the Part C program, coordinating resources, and receiving the Part C grant from various agencies within the state. The state's lead agency administers the Part C program, coordinates resources, and receives grants from federal, state, local, and private sources. The governor appoints a state ICC to advise on financial responsibility, interagency agreements, and applications for Part C. The ICC also assists the state educational agency in transitioning toddlers with disabilities out of early intervention services. The State ICC advises the State Educational Agency on transitioning toddlers with disabilities from early intervention services to preschool programs or other services. The ICC is appointed by the Governor and must represent various stakeholder groups, including parents of children with disabilities and early intervention service providers. The council also prepares an annual report on the status of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities within the state. The State ICC advises the State Educational Agency on transitioning toddlers with disabilities from early intervention services to preschool programs or other services. The ICC is appointed by the Governor and must represent various stakeholder groups, including parents of children with disabilities and early intervention service providers. The council also prepares an annual report on the status of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities within the state. At least one member from each of the following groups is included in the ICC: state legislature, SEA responsible for preschool services to children with disabilities, agency involved in personnel preparation, state agencies involved in early intervention services, agency responsible for state Medicaid program, Head Start agency, state agency responsible for child care, agency responsible for state regulation of health insurance, representative designated by the Office of Coordinator for Education of Homeless Children and Youths, state child welfare agency responsible for foster care, and state agency responsible for children's mental health. Early intervention (EI) ensures that all infants and toddlers with diagnosed disabilities or developmental delays are identified, evaluated, and provided with necessary services. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for infants and toddlers to receive early intervention services under Part C of the IDEA, including how children are identified, evaluated, and provided with individualized plans. States must define \"developmental delay\" rigorously and conduct timely evaluations for children suspected of having delays. The curr_chunk discusses the comprehensive evaluation of children suspected of developmental delays in various areas like physical, cognitive, communication, social, and adaptive development. States have the flexibility to define developmental delay criteria and assessment procedures under Part C of the IDEA. The curr_chunk discusses the process of identifying and evaluating children with disabilities for early intervention services, including the requirement for states to develop public awareness programs. This is part of the overall system for early intervention services outlined in Part C of the IDEA. The public awareness program aims to inform parents about early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and services under Section 619 of the IDEA. Each state must operate a program to educate residents about available services, evaluation processes, and contacts for early intervention. The lead agency in each state is responsible for disseminating information to primary referral sources. The Part C regulations require the state's lead agency to inform primary referral sources, such as hospitals, physicians, parents, child care programs, and others, about the availability of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. The state's lead agency must inform primary referral sources about the availability of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities, including providing a central directory with accurate information about services and resources. The lead agency must ensure parents of toddlers with disabilities are informed about services under IDEA Section 619, and have policies for identifying and evaluating all children in need of early intervention or special education services, including those who are homeless or wards of the state. Children who are homeless, residing on reservations, suspected of having a disability, or highly mobile, including migrant children, must be evaluated for early intervention services. A comprehensive child find system is crucial for identifying infants and toddlers with disabilities, with specific requirements under Part C of the IDEA. Part C of the IDEA requires states to have an efficient child find system for making referrals to service providers and identifying infants and toddlers with disabilities. States have options for implementing their child find system, such as using screening procedures or relying on primary referral sources. Part C of the IDEA mandates states to have a child find system for referrals and identification of infants and toddlers with disabilities. Referrals can come from primary sources or screening procedures. Parents must be informed of their rights and provide consent before evaluations. If initial screening does not detect a disability, parents can request a full evaluation. The evaluation must be timely, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary. Parental consent is required for evaluations. A child's records can be used to establish eligibility for early intervention services without conducting an evaluation if they indicate a developmental delay or diagnosed condition. For example, infant medical records can establish eligibility for premature or disabled babies. Once deemed eligible, a multidisciplinary assessment is required to identify appropriate services for the child. The assessment of infants or toddlers with disabilities must be conducted by qualified personnel to identify their needs and appropriate early intervention services. Early intervention services can start with parental consent before the assessment is completed. The early intervention system also includes a family-directed assessment to identify resources, priorities, and concerns of the child's family. This focus on family needs differentiates the Part C early intervention system from the Part B special education system. The Part C early intervention system focuses on training family members to provide interventions and supports for their child in a natural environment. This differs from the Part B special education system, which mainly provides supports in a school setting. The family-directed assessment in Part C identifies family resources, priorities, and concerns to enhance their capacity to meet their child's developmental needs. Assessments can be conducted together or separately based on the family's needs. Assessments for children in the early intervention system must be non-discriminatory and in the family's native language. Eligible children receive an Individualized Family Services Plan (IFSP) outlining the services they will receive, developed by a multidisciplinary team including parents. IFSPs focus on the child's early intervention services, similar to IEPs for children with disabilities ages 3 to 21. The IFSP process focuses on the needs of infants or toddlers with disabilities and their families. It includes assessing the child's development levels, family resources, expected outcomes, specific services, and natural environments for service delivery. The Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) outlines the services for infants or toddlers with disabilities, including where and when services will be provided, the service coordinator's name, and steps for transitioning to preschool. Parents must understand and consent to each service, with the IFSP reviewed every six months and the child evaluated annually for continued eligibility. The IFSP for infants or toddlers with disabilities must be evaluated annually to determine continued eligibility and appropriateness. The timeline for IFSP procedures is short (45 days) to account for rapid growth and change in children. In comparison, the process for Part B special education services takes twice as long (90 days) from evaluation to initial IEP writing. The Part C 45-day clock starts when a referral is received for a child with suspected disabilities or delays. Transition services are provided to help toddlers with disabilities and their families transition from early intervention programs to the next program or services. The 45-day timeline for early intervention services includes child find, screening, evaluation, assessments, and IFSP writing. Exceptions to this timeline include children referred less than 45 days before their third birthday and parents who have not provided consent despite repeated attempts. Transition services are crucial for toddlers with disabilities transitioning from early intervention programs. A transition plan must be in place 9 to 90 days before their third birthday, outlining services to help them move to a Part B program, continue in Part C, or prepare for the end of services under IDEA. This plan is part of the child's IFSP and each state must have policies for a smooth transition to preschool or other services. States must outline transition plans for toddlers with disabilities, including steps to exit from Part C, involve families in the process, review program options post-third birthday, notify LEAs of preschool eligibility, and hold conferences with families and LEAs before preschool services begin. Figure 1 displays state-reported data on the transition of children receiving early intervention services to preschool services at age three. It shows the outcomes for children who continue to need IDEA intervention services and those who no longer qualify for services after receiving early intervention. Approximately 38% of children receiving early intervention services no longer required IDEA services by age three. In 2014-2015, around 326,400 children transitioned out of Part C, with approximately 115,500 no longer needing services. Including all categories, the percentage of children no longer requiring services by age three would be 25%. Procedural safeguards protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding early intervention services. Procedural safeguards ensure parental rights in early intervention services, including reviewing records, resolving complaints, maintaining confidentiality, receiving notice in native language, and resolving disputes through mediation. Family members have the right to accept or decline early intervention services without affecting other services. They must receive prior written notice of any changes to a child's services, and if a child is found ineligible, the lead agency must inform the parent. If a child is not eligible for early intervention services, the lead agency must provide the parent with written notice about disputing the eligibility determination through mediation, due process hearing, or filing a state complaint. Mediation is a voluntary process involving a qualified mediator to resolve disputes under the IDEA without a formal hearing, with the state covering the cost. The state cannot deny mediation to a family or service provider, but either party can refuse to participate. If a dispute is resolved through mediation, a legally binding agreement must be signed. The discussions during mediation are confidential and cannot be used in any legal proceeding. States can choose between IDEA Part B or Part C due process procedures for families of children served under Part C. The Part C due process complaint procedure involves filing a request for a due process hearing related to the identification, evaluation, or assessment of a child with a disability or the provision of early intervention services. Parents, service providers, or lead agencies can file a due process complaint alleging a violation within one year prior to the date. The due process complaint must allege a violation within one year prior to its receipt by the lead agency. A due process hearing must be completed within 30 days, with a written decision mailed to all parties. The hearing is conducted by an impartial officer, and any aggrieved party can bring a civil action. Additional steps and procedures are outlined in Part B due process regulations for states that choose to use them. States implementing Part B procedures for children under Part C must follow additional procedures. In 2013, 15 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Northern Marianas Islands adopted Part B due process procedures, while the remaining 35 states, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands adopted Part C due process procedures. In some states, the SEA administers both Parts B and C of the IDEA. Children in states using Part B procedures may also be entitled to some protections under state law, including the right to receive a free and appropriate public education. Part B and C of the IDEA provide parents with procedural protections for resolving complaints about violations. The State complaint procedures offer a less formal and cost-effective way for parents to resolve disputes with public agencies. The IDEA allows for state complaints to be filed by any organization or individual, including those from another state. Complaints must be resolved within 60 days unless an extension is permitted. The IDEA provides federal funding for early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities and imposes conditions for funding receipt. It consists of four parts addressing structure, funding, state allocations, expenditure requirements, and responsibilities of lead agencies, service providers, and parents for paying for services. The IDEA consists of four parts: Part A includes general provisions, Part B focuses on school-aged children, Part C authorizes grants for infants and toddlers with disabilities, and Part D covers national activities. Funding for Part B is permanently authorized, while Part C and Part D were authorized in the 2004 reauthorization. Funding for Part C, Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, was authorized through FY2010 and extended for an additional fiscal year by the General Education Provisions Act. In FY2017, $458.6 million was appropriated for Part C, representing 3.5% of total IDEA funding. Annual funding for each state is based on their share of the general population birth through two. The IDEA is administered by the Office of Special Education Programs in the Department of Education. The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) in the Department of Education allocates funds for Part C of the IDEA. The Secretary reserves a portion for outlying areas and tribes for early intervention services. The remaining funds are distributed to states based on the number of infants and toddlers. Each state receives a minimum allotment of $500,000 or one-half of 1% of the total funds. If the appropriation is insufficient, payments to states are ratably reduced. Part C of the IDEA allocates funds for early intervention services for children under three years old. States coordinate existing services into one accessible system using IDEA funds. The grants primarily finance administrative functions and do not directly provide services. The IDEA state expenditure requirements aim to increase overall early intervention spending, not substitute federal funds. Supplement, not supplant requirements prohibit using IDEA grants for services or equipment. The IDEA funds are meant to supplement, not supplant, state, local, and other federal funds for early intervention services. Parents may have to pay for some services based on income, but certain services must be provided at no cost to families, including evaluations, IFSP development, and service coordination. The state's payment system for early intervention services must be described in writing and provided to parents at the start of the process. Some services may be covered by parents' insurance or Medicaid. Parental consent is required to access insurance for payment. The Part C system cannot use insurance without written consent. IDEA Part A includes congressional findings, purposes, and definitions. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) includes definitions of key terms and provisions for the education of children with disabilities. Part B of IDEA authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children aged 3-21. School districts must identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities to determine eligibility for special education services. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children aged 3-21 with disabilities. It requires identification, evaluation, and creation of Individualized Education Programs (IEP) for eligible children. Section 619 of IDEA Part B provides grants for preschool programs serving children aged three to five with disabilities. Part C of IDEA focuses on providing early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families, emphasizing services for children from birth through age two who are experiencing developmental delays. Services are tailored for each child and their family, aiming to create a comprehensive system of support. Part D of IDEA authorizes competitive grants to improve the education of children with disabilities in three areas: state personnel development, personnel preparation, technical assistance, model demonstration projects, dissemination of information, and support to improve results for children. State personnel development grants are authorized under Subpart 1. State personnel development grants are authorized under Subpart 1 to assist SEAs in improving systems for personnel preparation. Subpart 2 authorizes competitive grants for personnel development to ensure an adequate number of skilled personnel for children with disabilities. Subpart 3 authorizes grants for parent training and information centers. Parent training and information centers provide needed training and information for parents of children with disabilities to work with professionals in meeting early intervention and special education needs. Competitive grants are authorized for entities to support research and development promoting technology in special education and early intervention services."
