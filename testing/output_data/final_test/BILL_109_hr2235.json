    "content": "The National Uniform Food Safety Labeling Act, also known as the Act, includes provisions for labeling raw or partially cooked foods, unpasteurized juice, frozen fish and shellfish, raw eggs, statement of origin, freshness date, natural food labeling, kosher and kosher-style foods labeling, unit pricing, grades for farm products, and regulations. SEC. 2. LABELING OF RAW OR PARTIALLY COOKED FOODS AND UNPASTEURIZED JUICE. Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended to require labeling of raw or partially cooked eggs, fish, milk, dairy products, shellfish, or unpasteurized juice in ready-to-eat foods. The label must disclose the increased risk associated with consuming these foods in raw or partially cooked form, especially for children, the elderly, pregnant women, or individuals with weakened immune systems. The Secretary will establish labeling requirements for certain foods to warn about the risk of foodborne illness, especially for vulnerable populations. SEC. 3. SALE AND LABELING OF FROZEN FISH AND SHELLFISH. This section amends labeling requirements for frozen fish and shellfish, stating that they must be labeled as frozen unless processed in specific ways. SEC. 4. SALE OF RAW EGGS. SEC. 4 amends labeling requirements for raw eggs, stating that labels must warn about potential severe illness for certain groups. The Secretary will establish labeling regulations. SEC. 5 addresses the statement of origin. SEC. 5 amends labeling requirements for perishable agricultural commodities and products derived from them to include country of origin information. The Secretary will establish labeling regulations. SEC. 6 amends Section 403 to require a freshness date on food labels indicating when the product should no longer be sold due to quality, nutrient availability, or safety concerns. The date format depends on the shelf life, with the phrase 'use by' preceding it. The Secretary will establish regulations for disclosing the freshness date. Food labeled as \"natural\" must not contain artificial ingredients or undergo extensive processing. The use of \"natural flavors\" and \"natural colors\" is exempt. The Secretary will establish labeling requirements for this provision. SEC. 8. LABELING OF KOSHER AND KOSHER-STYLE FOODS. Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended to address false representation of food as kosher, kosher for Passover, or prepared in accordance with orthodox Jewish religious standards on labels. The Secretary will establish regulations for this purpose. The National Uniform Food Safety Labeling Act will establish regulations to address false representation of food as kosher or prepared in accordance with orthodox Jewish religious standards on labels. SEC. 9. UNIT PRICING. Unit pricing is addressed in Section 403 of the U.S. Code, requiring food labels to include the unit price and total price. The unit price is defined as the price per measure, such as price per pound for weight-based items or price per pint/quart for fluid ounces. The Secretary will establish a national program of pricing as prescribed by this paragraph, including price per 100 for food expressed by count. SEC. 10 amends Section 403 to require grading for farm products where customary. The Secretary will establish a national grading program for food in accordance with the National Uniform Food Safety Labeling Act. SEC. 11 addresses regulations. Within 12 months of enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue proposed regulations for label statements required by sections (y) through (gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The statements must be in bold, easily legible print, with specific format requirements and type size. All required label statements will be placed on the information panel. The required label statements, except for those specified in paragraphs (bb) and (ff) of section 403, will be placed on the information panel. The Secretary must issue final regulations for sections 403(dd) and 403(ee) within 24 months of enactment. If final regulations are not issued within this timeframe, the proposed regulations will be considered final. Notice of the new status of the proposed regulations will be promptly published in the Federal Register."
