    "content": "The Act titled \"Flat Alternative Individual Return Tax Act of 1997\" introduces a new section called \"Flat Alternative Individual Return Tax\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Flat Alternative Individual Return Tax Act of 1997\" introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing individuals to elect a 20 percent tax on their FAIR taxable income, which is calculated as gross income minus specified deductions over the FAIR standard deduction. The basic standard deduction amounts are $21,400 for joint returns or surviving spouses, $14,000 for heads of households, and $10,700 for individuals who are not married or heads of households. An additional standard deduction of $5,000 is available. The additional standard deduction is $5,000 for each dependent who is not required to file a return for the taxable year. Dependent children under age 14 have no tax liability and are not required to file a return. Dollar amounts in subsection (d) are adjusted for inflation after 1998. The cost-of-living adjustment for subsection (d) is determined by the Secretary based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding calendar year compared to the CPI for 1997. The CPI is the average of the Consumer Price Index at the end of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the calendar year. The Consumer Price Index is used to determine cost-of-living adjustments, with rounding rules applied. Married couples must file joint returns unless living apart. The taxpayer and spouse must file a joint return for the election under subsection (a) to be valid. Marital status is determined under section 7703. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for part I of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. Sec. 5. Flat alternative individual return tax. Sec. 6. Cross references relating to tax on individuals. Effective Date: Amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997. SEC. 3. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED. SEC. 3. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED.
