    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening America's Bridges Act\" and establishes the Strengthening America's Bridges Fund. The \"Strengthening America's Bridges Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by appropriations and revenue increases. The Secretary of Transportation can use the fund for making grants. The \"Strengthening America's Bridges Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States allows the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for repairing deficient bridges in the National Bridge Inventory. Recipients are selected based on published criteria, with applications due within a specified timeline. The Secretary of Transportation will select projects for funding under the \"Strengthening America's Bridges Fund\" not earlier than 60 days after the submission deadline, ensuring an equitable distribution of funds. The \"Strengthening America's Bridges Fund\" ensures equitable distribution of funds by limiting awards to single states, allocating 20% to rural areas, increasing federal share for rural projects, and prioritizing projects needing federal funds. The Secretary can retain up to 10% of funds and transfer some to the Federal Highway Administration. The Federal Highway Administration administers grants with a federal share of up to 80%. A social security number is required to claim the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit. The taxpayer must include the name, social security number, and taxpayer identification number of the qualifying child on their tax return to claim the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit. The amendments made by this subsection apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
