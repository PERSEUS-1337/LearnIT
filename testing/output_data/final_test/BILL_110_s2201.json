    "content": "The \"Home Ownership Mortgage Emergency Act\" or the \"HOME Act\" allows tax-favored withdrawals from retirement plans for mortgage delinquency relief. The \"HOME Act\" exempts qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions from Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code. There is a $100,000 aggregate limit on such distributions per individual per taxable year. The \"HOME Act\" exempts qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions from violating the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The $100,000 limit applies to distributions from all employer-maintained plans to an individual. The term \"controlled group\" refers to a group treated as a single employer under specific sections of the Code. Individuals receiving such distributions have a 3-year period to repay them. During a 3-year period after receiving a distribution, individuals can contribute the same amount to an eligible retirement plan. Repayments of distributions from eligible retirement plans other than IRAs are also allowed under certain conditions. During a 3-year period after receiving a distribution, individuals can contribute the same amount to an eligible retirement plan. Repayments for distributions from IRAs are treated as qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions. The distribution of mortgage delinquency relief is treated as a distribution under section 408(d)(3) of the Code and must be transferred to an eligible retirement plan within 60 days. A qualified mortgage delinquency relief distribution is defined as a distribution made from an eligible retirement plan to an individual with acquisition indebtedness before January 1, 2010. Income Inclusion Spread Over 3 Year Period for Qualified Mortgage Delinquency Relief Distributions: A distribution from an eligible retirement plan to a taxpayer whose principal residence is in delinquency for at least 60 days, with adjusted gross income not exceeding $114,000 ($166,000 for joint returns), can have income inclusion spread over a 3-year period. Eligible retirement plan and principal residence have specific definitions as per the tax code. Special rules apply to qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions, where any required income inclusion is spread over a 3-year period. These distributions are exempt from certain transfer and withholding rules under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified mortgage delinquency relief distributions are treated as meeting plan distribution requirements under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code.
