    "content": "The Act titled \"Law Officer's Armor Vest Tax Credit Act of 1997\" provides a tax credit for law enforcement officers who purchase an armor vest. This amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a credit for the purchase of an armor vest by a law enforcement officer. The Law Officer's Armor Vest Tax Credit Act of 1997 allows a 100% tax credit for law enforcement officers who purchase an armor vest, up to $1,200 per officer every 3 years. Unused credits can be carried forward to future years. The Law Officer's Armor Vest Tax Credit Act of 1997 allows a 100% tax credit for law enforcement officers purchasing armor vests, up to $1,200 per officer every 3 years. Excess credits can be carried forward to the next taxable year, but not beyond the third year after purchase, following a first-in first-out basis. The term 'armor vest' refers to body armor, Type I or Type II-A, worn by law enforcement officers, correctional officers, and private campus security officers with special police powers. Law enforcement officers can wear body armor that protects against specific bullets at certain velocities, or armor that exceeds those specifications with permission from their agency. No credit is allowed if the officer has already been issued an armor vest by their department. Law enforcement officers can wear body armor provided by their agency for personal use. If the officer disposes of the armor within 36 months of acquiring it, the tax for that year will be increased. The tax for the year of disposal of body armor by a law enforcement officer within 36 months of acquisition will be increased, except in cases of death, loss of law enforcement status, or damage to the armor vest by a bullet. The tax consequences for disposing of body armor within 36 months of acquisition are outlined, including exceptions for damage by a bullet, theft, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion. A clerical amendment is also made to the tax code. Effective December 31, 1996, law enforcement officers can purchase armor vests with tax benefits."
