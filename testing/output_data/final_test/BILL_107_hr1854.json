    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Parental Freedom of Information Act\" and it pertains to information access and consent. The \"Parental Freedom of Information Act\" amends the General Education Provisions Act to ensure parents have the right to inspect and review instructional and testing materials used in their child's education. Educational agencies must establish procedures for granting access to these materials. The \"Parental Freedom of Information Act\" requires educational agencies to grant parents access to instructional and testing materials upon request within 30 days. Agencies must also establish procedures for resolving disputes through mediation or arbitration if necessary. The mediation process under the \"Parental Freedom of Information Act\" must meet specific requirements, including being conducted within 60 days of a parent's request denial, not used to deny rights, and facilitated by a qualified and impartial mediator chosen by mutual consent. The arbitration process aims for a prompt resolution if parties can't agree through mediation. Costs are covered by the educational agency. The arbitration process must meet specific requirements, including being conducted within 60 days after mediation fails, with an independent arbitrator chosen by all parties, allowing testimony and appropriate relief, and being scheduled promptly in a suitable location. The arbitration process must meet specific requirements, including being conducted within 60 days after mediation fails, with an independent arbitrator chosen by all parties, allowing testimony and appropriate relief, and being scheduled promptly in a suitable location. The arbitration costs are to be shared equally among all parties involved. Definitions in this subsection include 'instructional material' as various forms of educational content. The term 'testing material' refers to tests administered to students during the current school year, along with statistical comparison data. Parental consent is required for educational agencies to access funds under applicable programs. The parent of a student must give written consent for medical, psychological, or psychiatric examinations, testing, treatment, or immunization, except in cases of a medical emergency. There are exceptions for directory information and examinations allowed by State law without parental consent. The Individuals with Disabilities Act requirements for parental consent are not affected. Federal law restricts seeking information from minors. Federal law prohibits conducting programs or activities funded by the government from requiring minors to respond to surveys or questionnaires without parental or guardian consent. The information sought cannot relate to parental political affiliations, mental health, sexual behavior, illegal activities, or opinions of others. The amendment allows minors access to information about appraisals of individuals with familial relationships, privileged relationships, and religious affiliations. The amendment also reduces the time frame for parental consent from 45 to 30 days."
