    "content": "The Act titled \"Drought Information Act of 2012\" reauthorizes the National Integrated Drought Information System. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 is amended to support better decision-making to reduce drought impacts and costs. The system will provide an effective early warning system by collecting and integrating key indicators for timely drought forecasts. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 aims to provide reliable drought forecasts and assessments on national and regional levels, communicate drought information to decision-makers at various government levels, the private sector, and the public, offer timely data reflecting local differences in drought conditions, and coordinate federal research for a drought early warning system. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 aims to support a drought early warning system by building upon existing forecasting and assessment programs and partnerships with various federal agencies and departments. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 aims to support ongoing research activities related to drought, including length, severity, and impacts, as well as the role of extreme weather events and climate variability. Authorization of appropriations includes $14,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere must submit a report to the Committee on these matters within 540 days of the Act's enactment. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 requires a report from Oceans and Atmosphere to Senate and House committees on the system's implementation, future development plans, and research needs. The report required by the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 should include research, monitoring, and forecasting needs for drought early warnings, drought severity, and weather events' impact on drought conditions. It should also list private sector collaborators and describe outreach activities conducted by the Under Secretary. The Under Secretary must consult with various government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector while developing the report required by the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006."
