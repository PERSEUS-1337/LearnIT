    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The director is required to establish a statewide system for cancer information collection by modeling after Orange County's program. The statewide cancer reporting system must be fully operational by July 1, 1990, with county or regional registries implemented by July 1, 1988. Within 60 days, the director must submit an implementation and funding schedule to the Legislature. The department may designate regional cancer registries in demographic parts of the state to provide cancer incidence data to the state department. A competitive process may be established to award contracts or grants to agencies to operate the statewide cancer reporting system. The department may award contracts or grants to agencies in designated cancer reporting regions for collecting cancer incidence data. These awards are exempt from certain public contract code regulations and include terms for proper fund use, financial reporting, program performance, monitoring, record retention, auditing, termination, and asset disposition. The director designates cancer as a reportable disease in the state. All diagnosed or treated cancers in the reporting area must be reported to the authorized department representative. Any hospital or facility providing therapy to cancer patients in a designated cancer reporting area must report each case of cancer to the department in a prescribed format. Failure to report as required may result in the department accessing and reporting the information at the facility's expense. Any health care practitioner diagnosing or treating cancer patients must report each case to the department, using approved protocols. Pathologists must report cancer cases electronically using approved formats provided by the department. If unable to report electronically, they must reimburse the department for accessing and reporting the information. Pathologists are not responsible for acquiring missing patient demographic information beyond required data elements. The department prescribes data requirements for reports, collaborates on standardized electronic formats, and designates a web portal for submission. Pathologists are not required to submit the same pathology report more than once, if submitted electronically. Any hospital or facility must reimburse the department for accessing and reporting information within 60 days of demand. Failure to pay on time may result in a late fee of up to 1 1/2 percent. The hospital or facility must reimburse the department for accessing and reporting information within 60 days of demand. Failure to pay on time may result in a late fee of up to 1 1/2 percent per month of the outstanding balance. If legal action is taken and the department receives a judgment in its favor, the hospital or facility must also reimburse for additional costs incurred. Late fees and payments made shall be considered as reimbursements for additional costs. All healthcare facilities must provide access to cancer patient records to the department or its representative. Failure to do so may result in a fine of up to $500 per day. Information collected is confidential unless specified otherwise. The department and designated cancer registries use information to identify sources of malignant neoplasms and assess measures to address their impact. Qualified individuals conducting health-related studies can access confidential data with written consent for research purposes. The department and regional cancer registries can share confidential information with other states' registries, federal agencies, health officers, and researchers to identify cancer sources and evaluate measures. Requesting entities must agree to maintain confidentiality and researchers must obtain approval from a human subjects protection committee. Entities must provide documentation to the department showing their ability to maintain confidentiality of information. Any authorized disclosure should only include necessary information for the intended purpose, used as approved, and not further disclosed. Furnishing confidential information to the department does not expose the provider to liability or waive any privilege. The department must keep a record of those accessing confidential information, including authorizing person's details, dates of access, and purpose. This information is not available for subpoena or admissible in any legal proceedings. For statistical reports, individual cases are not identified. Access to personal information is allowed under Civil Code. \"Cancer\" includes all malignant neoplasms except skin carcinomas. The legislation covers all primary intracranial and central nervous system tumors in various sites. It does not override the authority of facilities to maintain their own cancer registries. The goal is to maximize the use of federal funds in establishing a system."
