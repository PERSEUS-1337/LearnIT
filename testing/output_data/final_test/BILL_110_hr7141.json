    "content": "The \"Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a section on human embryonic stem cell research. The Secretary is required to conduct and support research using human embryonic stem cells, regardless of when they were derived. Ethical requirements include using stem cells from embryos donated from fertility clinics and created for fertility treatment purposes. The embryos donated for fertility treatment were determined to never be implanted in a woman and would be discarded, with written informed consent and no financial inducements received. SEC. 498E. GUIDELINES ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN STEM CELLS. The Director of NIH is required to issue guidelines on research involving human embryonic stem cells and may issue guidelines on research involving other human stem cells as deemed scientifically necessary. Updates to these guidelines will be made as determined scientifically warranted, with the frequency of updates to be determined by the Director of NIH. The Director of NIH is mandated to issue guidelines for human stem cell research, considering guidelines from recognized scientific organizations. Updates to these guidelines will occur every three years, starting from the date of issuance. The Director of NIH is required to issue guidelines for human stem cell research, with updates every three years. Research conducted or supported by NIH must comply with these guidelines, and exceptions may apply for research using stem cells derived before the guidelines' effective date. The guidelines will be publicly disclosed on the NIH website. SEC. 4 amends the Public Health Service Act to include reporting requirements for human stem cells. SEC. 5 expresses the Sense of Congress. The Sense of Congress is that guidelines for human stem cell research should be consulted on by the Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. All research using human stem cells should comply with these guidelines, and the Commissioner should keep the Director informed of relevant research for evaluating drug safety and effectiveness."
