    "content": "U.S. employers argue they need foreign workers for low-skilled jobs, especially in seasonal agriculture, due to potential labor shortages. The question of whether domestic workers can fill these positions is debated during times of high U.S. unemployment. The issue of U.S. agricultural worker shortages raises questions about the impact of raising wages and changing work terms, potential competitiveness in the global marketplace, and the supply of authorized workers with new technologies. Historical programs like the Bracero program brought Mexican workers to address shortages during times of war. The United States imports guest workers in smaller numbers for temporary agricultural and nonagricultural labor. Guest worker programs are controversial, with some calling for reform and expansion while others see them as inherently abusive and in need of overhaul. The report discusses existing visa programs for temporary lower-skilled workers, legislative efforts to reform current programs, and key policy considerations for congressional action on guest worker programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 establishes nonimmigrant visa categories for temporary workers, including the H-2A and H-2B visas for guest workers. Foreign nationals can also perform lower-skilled temporary work on certain nonimmigrant visas. Congressional action on guest worker programs is informed by key policy considerations. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act amended the INA to create the H-2A agricultural worker program and H-2B nonagricultural worker program. These programs are administered by the Department of Labor and Department of Homeland Security. Employers must apply for labor certification before importing workers under either program. After receiving labor certification, a prospective H-2A or H-2B employer can submit a petition to DHS to bring in foreign workers. Approved workers can apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The H-2A and H-2B programs balance protections for U.S. and foreign workers with employer needs. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) administers the labor certification process for H-2A and H-2B programs. Employers must request certification for a specific number of positions and demonstrate a lack of available, qualified workers in the U.S. to hire foreign workers. This process aims to ensure that hiring foreign workers will not negatively impact wages and working conditions for U.S. workers. The H-2B program in the United States does not have a statutory labor certification requirement like the H-2A program. However, DHS regulations mandate that a labor certification must be obtained by the petitioner before filing an H-2B petition to protect job, wage, and working conditions for U.S. workers. The H-2A and H-2B programs in the United States require labor certification processes for employers to hire foreign workers. The H-2A program allows temporary admission for agricultural labor or seasonal work when U.S. workers are unavailable. Employers must offer minimum wages and benefits. An approved H-2A visa petition is generally valid for up to one year, with the possibility of extension for a total period of stay not exceeding three consecutive years. Employers must demonstrate the need for foreign workers due to a lack of qualified U.S. workers and ensure that their employment does not negatively impact American workers' wages and working conditions. Under the H-2A program, employers must recruit U.S. workers and cooperate with state employment agencies for recruitment. They must hire qualified U.S. workers during the first half of the work contract and provide a \"three-fourths guarantee\" of employment. Employers must pay H-2A workers and U.S. workers the highest wage rate, provide housing, transportation, and benefits, including workers' compensation insurance. The H-2A program does not require health insurance coverage. In FY2009, 86,014 H-2A positions were certified, and 79,011 were certified in FY2010. North Carolina had the most certifications, followed by Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana. The program has grown significantly in the last 20 years, with the number of H-2A visas issued increasing more than fourfold between FY1992 and FY2000. The H-2A program has seen significant growth in the last 20 years, with visa issuances increasing more than fourfold between FY1992 and FY2000. The number of visas peaked at over 64,000 in FY2008 but declined to around 55,000 in FY2011. Despite its growth, the program remains small compared to total farm employment, leading to debates about its effectiveness. Critics argue that low participation levels show the program's inadequacy, while others attribute this to the availability of unauthorized workers willing to work for lower wages. The George W. Bush Administration streamlined existing guest worker programs within current law in response to unsuccessful congressional efforts for comprehensive immigration legislation. In 2008, DHS and DOL amended their H-2A regulations, with the Obama Administration retaining the 2008 DHS rule. DOL issued a new final H-2A rule in 2010 to replace the 2008 rule, aiming to provide agricultural employers with legal workers while protecting laborers' rights. The 2010 DOL final rule on H-2A employment under the Obama Administration made changes to regulations to facilitate continued H-2A employment, including extending the period of stay for H-2A workers in the United States and limiting participation to designated countries. It also included regulations on labor certification and enforcement of contractual obligations. The 2008 DOL rule changed the H-2A labor certification process to an attestation-based system, replacing the previous supervised certification process. The Department believed that the 2008 rule did not provide adequate protection for program compliance. The 2010 DOL final rule reestablished the H-2A labor certification process, retaining some changes from the 2008 rule. Employers must submit a job order to the SWA before filing a labor certification application, which serves as the basis for recruiting U.S. workers. The 2010 DOL final rule for H-2A labor certification requires employers to offer and pay specified wages, including the federal or state minimum wage, prevailing wage rate, AEWR, or collective bargaining wage. It also includes post-certification audits and expanded debarment authority for non-compliant employers. Wage and Hour Division regulations address enforcement of contractual obligations under the program. The 2010 DOL final rule for H-2A labor certification revised provisions and increased penalties for violations. The H-2B program allows foreign workers for temporary nonagricultural services, excluding medical graduates. Employers must demonstrate a temporary need for workers under the H-2B program. The H-2B program allows foreign workers for temporary nonagricultural services, with a maximum stay of three consecutive years. Employers must apply for certification from the DOL to show the need for alien workers and ensure they are paid the prevailing wage rate or minimum wage. Unlike H-2A employers, H-2B employers are not subject to the AEWR. The H-2B program allows foreign workers for temporary nonagricultural services, with a maximum stay of three consecutive years. H-2B employers are not subject to the AEWR. DOL regulations in 2012 added new requirements to the H-2B labor certification process, but these regulations are not currently in effect. H-2B workers are largely low skilled, with top occupations including landscape laborer, forest worker, housekeeping cleaner, and amusement park worker. In FY2009, 154,489 H-2B positions were certified, with Texas receiving over 21,000 certifications. In FY2009, Texas received over 21,000 H-2B certifications, with other top states being Florida, Colorado, and Virginia. The H-2B visa is subject to a cap of 66,000 per fiscal year, but exemptions exist for certain cases. The number of H-2B visas issued by DOS fluctuated between FY1992 and FY2007, with some years exceeding the cap. The H-2B visa program saw regulatory changes under the George W. Bush Administration in December 2008. The Obama Administration initially kept these rules but later proposed new regulations in March 2011. A final rule was published in February 2012 but faced legal challenges and did not go into effect as planned in April 2012. The program is currently operating under the 2008 rules. The Department of Labor (DOL) published a final rule to revise prevailing wage rates under the H-2B program, effective from March 27, 2013. The 2008 rule by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) redefined \"temporary employment\" for H-2B purposes, requiring employers to show the need for the worker would end in the near future. The 2012 DOL final H-2B rule made changes to H-2B regulations, including limitations on worker's stay and participation, and reinstated a certification-based model for compliance with program requirements. The 2012 DOL final H-2B rule reinstated a certification-based model for compliance with program requirements due to concerns about noncompliance by employers. The 2012 final rule for H-2B labor certification process introduced changes such as bifurcating the process into registration and application phases, requiring employers to provide equal protections to all workers, and adding new benefit requirements like transportation and visa cost coverage. It also revised regulations on audits, debarment, and the ability to revoke certifications in certain circumstances. The 2012 DOL final H-2B rule included regulations by WHD for H-2B-related enforcement functions. WHD has the responsibility to enforce matters concerning the rights of H-2B workers, conduct investigations, inspections, impose penalties, debar employers for violations, and recommend revocation of certifications. The final rule gives WHD independent authority to debar employers for violations in the H-2B program. Employers must pay workers the highest of prevailing wage rate or federal, state, or local minimum wage. A 2011 DOL rule changed the methodology for determining prevailing wage rates, now based on four rates including collective bargaining agreements and average wages in the area. This change is expected to increase hourly wages for H-2B workers. The J-1 visa under the \"J\" nonimmigrant category covers temporary lower-skilled work for exchange visitors in various programs like au pairs, camp counselors, and students engaged in summer work and travel. The visa is not numerically limited by law and is overseen by DOS, with designated sponsor organizations. J-1 programs include work but are not categorized as temporary work programs under the INA, and are not subject to standard temporary work program requirements or nonimmigrant visa petitioning procedures. The J-1 visa covers temporary lower-skilled work for exchange visitors in various programs like au pairs, camp counselors, and students engaged in summer work and travel. The largest J-1 program is the Summer Work Travel (SWT) program, overseen by designated sponsors. Participants are issued a form to apply for a visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The Summer Work Travel (SWT) program allows college or university students to live and work in the United States during their summer vacation. Participants perform unskilled jobs at resorts and amusement parks, with regulations excluding certain types of work like domestic help in private homes. In 2011, the Department of State amended its regulations for the SWT program to better protect national security interests. The Department of State amended regulations for the Summer Work Travel program in 2011 to address concerns about fraudulent job offers, inappropriate jobs, and criminal activity. The new rules increased oversight by designated sponsors and added requirements for program participants. The 2011 rule for the Summer Work Travel program increased oversight by sponsors to address concerns about criminal activity and fraudulent job offers. Sponsors had to ensure job placements for participants from non-Visa Waiver countries, vet U.S. host employers, and monitor compliance with program obligations. Additionally, sponsors had to screen foreign entities assisting with program functions. The 2011 DOS rule for the Summer Work Travel program expanded monitoring responsibilities for sponsors and clarified prohibited work activities for participants. Prohibited positions include domestic help roles like child care and elder care, as well as sales positions requiring inventory purchases. Other prohibited work includes positions in adult entertainment and clinical care with patient contact. In November 2011, DOS announced additional limitations on the Summer Work Travel program due to complaints. The program was restricted to 103,000 participants in 2011, with no new sponsor organizations designated. In May 2012, a new rule was implemented to better regulate sponsors and protect participants and U.S. communities. The 2012 rule for the Summer Work Travel program expanded sponsors' obligations regarding cultural components, clarified job requirements, and placed new responsibilities on sponsors to protect U.S. workers. Participants must be placed in seasonal or temporary jobs with opportunities to interact with U.S. citizens and experience American culture. Sponsors must confirm that host employers will not displace U.S. workers each season. The 2012 rule for the Summer Work Travel program expanded sponsors' obligations regarding cultural components, clarified job requirements, and placed new responsibilities on sponsors to protect U.S. workers. Sponsors must confirm each season that prospective host employers will not displace U.S. workers at worksites where SWT participants will be placed. DOS stated that the SWT program would not exceed 109,000 participants annually. Over 100,000 foreign nationals have participated in the J-1 SWT program each year since 2005. Policy discussions about guest worker programs involve consideration of unauthorized workers who traditionally perform lower-skilled work in various industries. Unauthorized aliens enter and remain in the United States to work, with an estimated 8.0 million unauthorized workers in the U.S. civilian labor force in March 2010. To prevent unauthorized immigrants from getting jobs, employers must verify identity and work authorization through document checks, although this process is often undermined by fraudulent documents. Employers can also use E-Verify for verification. Some legislative efforts aim to make E-Verify mandatory for all employers, potentially causing labor shortages in industries with unauthorized workers. Various proposals for guest worker programs have been introduced in Congress over the years. Recently, congressional interest in guest worker programs has focused on temporary agricultural workers due to concerns about potential labor shortages if E-Verify becomes mandatory. The H-2A program has faced criticism from both growers and labor advocates for being cumbersome, expensive, and lacking worker protections. In the late 1990s, the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act (AgJOBS) was proposed to address issues with foreign agricultural workers. The AgJOBS legislation aimed to reform the H-2A program and legalize the status of farm workers through a two-stage process. It was the basis of a bipartisan compromise on foreign agricultural workers during the 106th Congress, but subsequent bills in the 109th and 110th Congresses were not enacted. Recent attention in Congress has focused on foreign agricultural workers, with legislative proposals on agricultural guest workers being put forward in the 112th Congress. Some proposals aim to amend H-2A visa provisions or establish new temporary agricultural worker programs. The H-2B program has faced criticism for its annual numerical cap of 66,000, leading to unsuccessful efforts to reinstate a returning worker exemption. Legislative efforts have been made to reinstate a returning worker exemption for the H-2B visa program and comprehensive immigration reform bills have included provisions for temporary nonagricultural workers. Various bills have proposed changes to the H-2B visa and the establishment of new guest worker programs for temporary nonagricultural workers, allowing employers to hire workers to meet ongoing labor needs on a temporary basis without demonstrating a seasonal or temporary need. Other bills have aimed to reform the H-2B visa by increasing labor. Other H-2B bills in recent Congresses have proposed to reform the visa by increasing labor protections, including federal law enforcement, recruitment of U.S. workers, and wages. The goal is to balance employer needs for labor with protections for temporary workers. The Department of Labor has aimed to strike a balance between reducing processing times and protecting U.S. worker access in its proposed rule on the H-2B visa. The new rule aims to balance reducing processing times and protecting U.S. worker access to job opportunities in the H-2A and H-2B programs. It includes provisions on program administration, labor market tests, and wages. The J-1 SWT program is also mentioned, providing seasonal labor but not classified as a temporary worker program under immigration law. The H-2A and H-2B programs are administered by DOL and DHS, with DOL handling labor certification and DHS adjudicating visa petitions. Prospective H-2A employers must apply to DOL for labor certification under the INA. Regulatory proposals have aimed to change the administration of guest worker programs, such as the H-2B visa. In 2005, DHS and DOL proposed rules that would have removed DOL's labor certification role for H-2B workers. Employers would have applied directly to DHS instead. In 2005, DHS proposed changes to the H-2B visa program to reduce burdens on employers and increase efficiency. This included removing DOL's labor certification role and allowing employers to apply directly to DHS. Other proposals suggested assigning administrative responsibility to the Secretary of State for a new guest worker program. A recent legislative proposal aims to establish a new temporary agricultural worker visa administered by the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with DHS. The key question for any guest worker program is how it tests the labor market to determine the availability of U.S. workers. Labor certification is required for employers interested in hiring foreign workers under the H-2A and H-2B programs, ensuring job opportunities for U.S. workers are protected. Recruitment is the primary method used to assess U.S. worker availability. The labor certification process for H-2A and H-2B programs has been criticized for being cumbersome and slow in protecting U.S. workers. The 2008 DOL rules changed the process to an attestation-based certification, aiming to simplify it. The Department of Labor aims to simplify the H-2A program processing for employers while ensuring access to agricultural job opportunities for U.S. workers. Recent legislative proposals have focused on labor attestation and worker protections, with a shift towards a certification-based model for labor certification. The primary concern is to restore necessary protections for both U.S. and foreign workers while addressing legitimate employer needs. The current attestation-based model lacks sufficient worker protections as employers only assert, without demonstrating, compliance with labor market tests. The 2012 H-2B rule included changes to the labor certification process, requiring U.S. worker recruitment and independent recruitment efforts by employers. Despite differences between administrations, the underlying requirements remain similar. The 2011 legislative proposal for a new temporary agricultural worker visa would require employers to post job opportunities on a DOL electronic job registry, including work period, wages, and terms of employment. DOL would not perform labor certification, and the program would be administered by USDA in consultation with DHS. Employers would submit information for USDA to determine the number of agricultural workers needed. The H-2A and H-2B programs require employers to offer wages at or above a specified level, with different wage rate requirements. The AEWR is a key area of controversy in the H-2A program, aimed at protecting U.S. agricultural workers from wage depression due to hiring foreign workers. The AEWR is a contentious issue in the H-2A program, with proposals to reform or redefine it. The 2011 DOL rule on H-2B wage rates has faced criticism for potentially making the program too expensive. Legislation has delayed the implementation of new wage requirements until March 27, 2013. The H-2A and H-2B programs are designed to meet employers' temporary labor needs when U.S. workers are unavailable. Special provisions exist for certain year-round activities, such as pressing apples for cider on a farm. Legislation has been proposed to include dairy industry activities in the H-2A program. The H-2A and H-2B visa programs cater to employers' temporary labor needs, with specific criteria for one-time, seasonal, peak load, or intermittent needs. Past proposals aimed to expand the H-2B visa to cover \"short-term\" labor, allowing for a wider range of job opportunities. Some comprehensive immigration reform proposals suggested new nonagricultural guest worker programs without the requirement of temporary need, potentially admitting workers for two years or more. Numerical caps are used to limit the annual admission of foreign workers in visa categories, with the H-2A and J-1 visas currently not being numerically limited by law. The J-1 visa program is not numerically limited by law, but the Department of State has restricted the J-1 SWT program to 109,000 annually. In contrast, the H-2B program is capped at 66,000 annually. Various guest worker proposals have suggested more flexible numerical caps, such as adjusting the number of guest workers based on regional unemployment rates. Former Senator Phil Gramm's guest worker program in the 107th Congress included a numerical cap that would vary annually based on economic conditions. A new nonimmigrant visa with numerical caps based on demand was proposed in the 110th Congress. Another bill in 2011 suggested an agricultural worker visa with monthly and annual limitations. The INA allows for the admission of spouses and minor children of alien workers on various visas. Some legislative proposals for new guest worker programs may prohibit family members from accompanying or joining principal aliens. The issue of adjusting status to legal permanent resident (LPR) status arises in connection with guest worker programs, with limited opportunities for legal lower-skilled guest workers to obtain LPR status. Various proposals have been suggested to enable guest workers to adjust their status. Some legislative proposals aim to enable guest workers to adjust their status to legal permanent resident (LPR) status, with different mechanisms proposed in past comprehensive immigration reform bills. Some past immigration reform bills proposed new guest worker visas with mechanisms for adjusting status, while a policy suggestion involves replacing nonimmigrant visas with provisional visas for nonagricultural work. Provisional visas could allow for a transition from temporary to permanent status for eligible workers. The Obama Administration's 2011 blueprint for immigration reform proposed a new temporary worker program for lower-skilled workers with important labor protections, portability, and a path to permanent residence. Enforcement measures for guest worker programs are also discussed, with the Secretary of Labor authorized to ensure employer compliance for the H-2A program, and the Secretary of Homeland Security for the H-2B program. The 2005 INA amendment allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to enforce H-2B petition conditions and delegate authority to the Secretary of Labor. The DOL's Wage and Hour Division now enforces H-2B labor certifications, with compliance measures including audits, penalties, and debarment as per the 2008 DOL final rules. The Obama Administration proposed reinstating a compliance-demonstration system for H-2A and H-2B programs due to concerns about employer noncompliance. The 2010 DOL final H-2A rule and the 2012 DOL final H-2B rule incorporate this system. The appropriateness of post-certification enforcement for temporary worker programs was questioned by DOL in 2011. Enforcement mechanisms for ensuring guest workers do not overstay in the U.S. remain a concern. The mechanism to ensure guest workers do not overstay in the U.S. includes notification requirements for H-2A and H-2B employers to report any worker absconding or termination. The DHS established notification requirements for H-2A and H-2B employers to track workers and enforce compliance. A pilot program called the Temporary Worker Visa Exit Program Pilot was also implemented to ensure workers departed the U.S. by recording biographic and biometric information. The Temporary Worker Visa Exit Program Pilot, designed to record workers' departure using biographic and biometric information, was discontinued in 2011. DHS gathered data to assess the pilot's technology and design, suggesting involving workers' home countries or creating incentives for them to leave the U.S. There has been dissatisfaction with existing guest worker programs and periodic activity to enact reform. Current discussions focus on the needs of employers and workers, with tension between these needs at the core of the debate. Different views on balancing employer and worker needs are reflected in regulations and legislative proposals. In the current environment, compromise on employer and worker needs is essential for significant guest worker reform legislatively. In FY2010, DOL approved 3,726 H-2B labor certification applications for a total of 86,596 H-2B positions, with a majority of requests certified for workers in a few occupations. The 2008 DHS final rule on the H-2A visa made changes to prior regulations, including reducing the waiting period for H-2A workers to return to the US from six months to three months. It also extended the time an H-2A worker could stay in the US after their petition expired to 30 days. The 2010 DHS rule allowed new employers to start a job before the extension of stay was granted if they were registered users of E-Verify. It also prohibited payments by H-2A workers to employers or recruiters and limited participation to nationals of designated countries. The 2010 DOL rule reversed some changes made by the 2008 rule on the H-2A visa labor certification process. The 2010 rule reinstated the supervised labor certification process for H-2A employers, requiring a job order submission to the state workforce agency between 60 and 75 days before the date of need for workers. The job order includes job qualifications, wage provisions, and may require documentation for job qualifications. Once cleared by the SWA, it serves as the basis for recruiting U.S. workers, followed by a labor certification application to the DOL at least 45 days before. The 2010 rule requires H-2A employers to file a labor certification application with DOL at least 45 days before the date of need. It also establishes an electronic registry of H-2A jobs and redefines corresponding employment for H-2A purposes. Additionally, H-2A employers must offer required wages and benefits to H-2A workers. The 2010 rule reinstated wage requirements including the state minimum wage, prevailing wage rate, AEWR, and collective bargaining wage. It also implemented the fifty-percent rule for H-2A employers to hire qualified U.S. workers until halfway through the work contract period. The 2008 rule for H-2B visas revised regulations to define temporary employment and set limits on employer's need for workers. The rule stated that employer's need is generally for one year or less, but could last up to three years for a one-time occurrence. The DOL final rule clarified that H-2B labor certification applications based on employer's need lasting more than 10 months would be denied, except in unusual circumstances. The 2008 H-2B rule amended regulations to require an approved labor certification before submitting a petition for H-2B workers. DOL established an appeals process for H-2B labor certification denials. Changes to DHS's H-2B regulations mirrored those of its H-2A regulations, including reducing the time a worker must stay outside the country before being granted H-2B status. The rule also prohibited payments from prospective H-2B workers to employers. The DHS H-2B rule prohibits payments from prospective H-2B workers to employers and limits program participation to designated countries. The 2012 DOL rule reversed changes made under the 2008 rule, reinstating a certification-based model with distinct registration and application phases. DOL assesses an employer's temporary need for H-2B workers in the registration phase. The H-2B registration phase requires employers to submit a registration 120-150 days before the initial date of need, with approval valid for up to three years. The labor market test is conducted by DOL in the subsequent application phase to determine U.S. worker availability. Under the 2012 rule, the labor certification application and job order must be filed 75-90 days before the date of need, with the SWA keeping the job order open until 21 days before the employer's need. Under the 2012 DOL H-2B rule, the electronic job registry was expanded to include H-2B job orders. Once DOL accepts the labor certification application, the job order is posted online. The 2012 rule shortened the maximum period of employer need to nine months to establish the temporariness of the position. Job contractors' participation in the H-2B program was also limited. The 2012 rule limited job contractors' participation in the H-2B program to demonstrate their own temporary need for workers. Employers were required to provide corresponding employment workers with the same protections, wages, and benefits as H-2B workers. Additionally, employers had to pay for transportation and visa costs and offer a three-fourths guarantee. The 2012 rule required employers to provide transportation and visa costs for H-2B workers and offer a three-fourths guarantee. DOL issued regulations to change the prevailing wage methodology for H-2B workers, with a final rule effective on September 30, 2011. The new wage methodology for H-2B workers was postponed until January 1, 2012, due to legislative actions preventing its implementation before that date. The new wage methodology for H-2B workers was postponed multiple times due to legislative actions preventing its implementation. The Department of Labor announced delays in the effective date until October 1, 2012, and then again until March 27, 2013. Comparison of wage methodology under current and new regulations shows potential changes affecting H-2B worker wages. The Department of Labor uses data from its OES survey to provide four wage levels for H-2B workers based on education, experience, and supervision requirements. These levels are labeled I, II, III, and IV, with Level I being the average wage for the bottom third of earners and Level IV for the top two-thirds. Wage differences are calculated between levels to determine hourly rates. The wage levels for H-2B workers are categorized as Level I, II, III, and IV based on education, experience, and supervision. The wage difference between Level IV and Level I is $12.00, with Level II at $14.00 and Level III at $18.00."
