This is reflected in two approaches: abstinence-only education funded by the Title V Abstinence Education block grant, and comprehensive sexual education programs that include prevention and support services for pregnant teens. Since 1991, teen pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates have significantly decreased. In 2002, the teen pregnancy rate for ages 15-19 was 75.4 per 1,000 females, down 35% from 1991. The teen birth rate declined annually from 1991 to 2005, with a record low of 40.4 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 in 2005. 421,123 births in 2005 were to teens, with 6,717 to girls under 15. Teen pregnancy rates in the U.S. remain higher than in most industrialized nations. In 2005, 6,717 births were to girls under age 15, with nearly 23% of nonmarital births to teens. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are higher than in most industrialized nations. In 2005, 34% of ninth graders reported sexual intercourse, with corresponding percentages increasing for older teens. About 30% of female teens who have had intercourse become pregnant before age 20. Adolescent childbearing cost U.S. taxpayers $9 billion in 2004. Teens who give birth are less likely to complete high school and college, impacting their economic self-sufficiency. The research shows that teenage pregnancy leads to economic challenges and negative outcomes for children. Preventing teen pregnancy is a national goal due to its long-term consequences. Well-designed studies with random assignment are considered the most reliable way to evaluate policy changes. Random assignment experimental studies assign participants to control and experimental groups to evaluate the impact of policy initiatives. The difference between the two groups is attributed to the policy being examined, ensuring that any observed impact is not due to chance. The impact of policy initiatives is determined by statistically significant differences between experimental and control groups. Random assignment experimental studies provide valid estimates of intervention impacts, showing whether interventions cause favorable impacts on a large scale. Funding was allocated for a scientific evaluation of the Title V Abstinence-Only Education block grant program under P.L. 105-33, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Title V Abstinence-Only Education block grant program, authorized by P.L. 104-193, was evaluated by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. Total abstinence-only education funding in FY2007 was $177 million, distributed among different programs including the Community-Based Abstinence Education program and the Adolescent Family Life program. Mathematica's April 2007 report presents final results from a multi-year impact study on abstinence-only block grants. The report presents results from a multi-year impact study on four Title V abstinence education programs for elementary and middle school students. Findings show that youth in the program group did not differ from the control group in terms of sexual abstinence, number of sexual partners, and age of sexual initiation. The study compared abstinence education programs for elementary and middle school students. Both program and control group youth had similar rates of unprotected sex and understanding of pregnancy risks. The programs improved STD identification but had no impact on knowledge of unprotected sex risks. HHS emphasized focusing abstinence-only education on high school students to prevent teen pregnancy. Advocates argue for comprehensive sex education for youth, providing information and decision-making skills to make informed choices about sexual activities. Recent studies show effectiveness in delaying sexual activity, improving contraceptive use, and preventing teen pregnancy. Effective teen pregnancy prevention programs aim to convince teens to abstain from sex or use contraception consistently, last a sufficient length of time, engage participants, address peer pressure, teach communication skills, and reflect the age and culture of young individuals. Despite numerous evaluations, some programs are not successful due to methodological limitations or complexity. Some teen pregnancy prevention programs face challenges due to methodological limitations or complexity. The effectiveness of abstinence-only interventions versus comprehensive sex education programs is debated, with some arguing for a more integrated approach. A recent survey found that 90% of adults and teens believe young people should wait until after high school to have sex, with 73% of adults and 56% of teens wanting more information on abstinence and contraception. The American public supports encouraging teens to delay sexual activity and providing information on contraception."
