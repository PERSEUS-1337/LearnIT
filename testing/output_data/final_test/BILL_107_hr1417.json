    "content": "The \"Technology Extension Act of 2001\" aims to establish a technology extension program to provide small and medium-sized businesses access to cutting-edge technology and help them transform innovations into jobs. This program builds upon the existing Manufacturing Extension Program to encourage the adoption of advanced technology. The Technology Extension Act of 2001 aims to encourage the use of advanced technologies by small and medium-sized businesses to boost productivity and economic growth. It also promotes partnerships between educational institutions and businesses to develop these technologies. The Secretary of Commerce will implement a grant program to support regional centers for the commercial use of advanced technologies by eligible entities. An entity eligible for a grant as a regional center under the Technology Extension Act must be affiliated with a US-based nonprofit institution, offer to function as a regional center for advanced technologies, and demonstrate the necessary capabilities. The Secretary will use a competitive process to select grant recipients. The Secretary will use a competitive process to award grants under this section based on merit, with priority for underserved areas. Applications for grants must follow the prescribed form. Regional centers can use grant funds to assist small and medium-sized businesses with technology, infrastructure, and best business practices, as well as collaborate with higher education institutions. The Secretary may require cost-sharing for grant recipients to cover operating expenses of regional centers. Grants may have additional terms and conditions imposed to protect US interests and achieve the section's purposes. The Secretary will define \"small business\" and \"medium-sized business\" for this section, following Small Business Act standards. Regulations will be prescribed for the grant program, and $125,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002 for the Department of Commerce."
