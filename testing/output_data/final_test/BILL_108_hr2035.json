    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Identity Theft and Financial Privacy Protection Act of 2003\". Congress finds that identity theft is a major law enforcement challenge in the new economy, facilitating international terrorism. Despite increased awareness, incidents continue to rise, with 1,000,000 consumers calling for assistance annually. Between January and December of 2002, the Federal Trade Commission received 380,103 consumer fraud and identity theft complaints, with reported losses exceeding $343 million. The Social Security Administration's fraud hotline saw identity theft reports rise from 11,058 in fiscal year 1998 to 46,480 in fiscal year 2000. The Postal Inspection Service noted in its fiscal year 2000 report that investigations into identity theft had increased by 67 percent since the previous year. Identity crimes often involve the interception of personal financial data or the fraudulent acquisition of credit cards and financial products in someone else's name. Identity theft violates privacy, ruins reputations, restricts credit access, and limits job opportunities. Victims struggle to repair credit damage for years. Resources for victims are insufficient, and better assistance is needed from private and Federal agencies. Credit reporting agencies and credit issuers should have consistent reporting requirements and effective fraud alerts to help victims protect and repair their credit. SEC. 3. IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION. Changes of Address under the Truth in Lending Act require card issuers to confirm address changes and notify cardholders of any requests for additional credit cards within 30 days. The issuer must notify the cardholder at both the new and former addresses and provide a way to report incorrect changes promptly. Consumer reporting agencies must notify requesters of any address discrepancies when a consumer report is requested. They are required to reconcile any substantial variations between the consumer's file address and the requested address according to established procedures. Enforcement of section 132(b) of the Truth in Lending Act is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, with the same authority as under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Compliance can also be enforced under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in certain cases. The Deposit Insurance Act oversees card issuers, including national banks, Federal branches, and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve Act authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to regulate banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Exceptions exist for resellers of information who merge data from other agencies. Consumer reporting agencies do not maintain a permanent database of merged information for new consumer reports. Resellers must preserve fraud alerts from other agencies. Exempt institutions include check services companies issuing authorizations for financial transactions. The Federal Trade Commission will establish rules on complaint referral, investigations, and inquiries within 365 days of the enactment of this Act. The Federal Trade Commission will prescribe rules for referral of consumer complaints about identity theft and fraud alerts, as well as develop a model form for victims of identity fraud to contact creditors and consumer reporting agencies. SEC. 4. TRUNCATION OF CREDIT CARD AND DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT NUMBERS. SEC. 4 prohibits printing more than the last 4 digits of credit card numbers on receipts, applies only to electronically printed receipts, and provides definitions for \"credit card\" and \"debit card.\" The term \"debit card\" refers to a card issued by a financial institution for electronic fund transfers from the consumer's account for transferring money or obtaining services. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2007, for machines in use before January 1, 2005, and on January 1, 2005, for machines first used after that date. SEC. 5. FREE REPORTS ANNUALLY. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow consumers to request free annual disclosures from consumer reporting agencies once every 12 months."
