    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Road Usage Charge Pilot Program Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges recommendations for transitioning away from the fuel tax to a more stable funding source, such as a mileage-based fee system, due to the loss of purchasing power in revenue raised from the gas tax since 1993. The gas tax has lost purchasing power due to fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, and inflation. By 2030, fuel economy standards will reduce Highway Trust Fund receipts by over 20%. Some industries pay more than their fair share in fuel tax revenue for road use. The gas tax has lost purchasing power due to fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, and inflation. By 2030, fuel economy standards will reduce Highway Trust Fund receipts by over 20%. Some industries pay more than their fair share in fuel tax revenue for road use. A Road Usage Charge Pilot Program is proposed. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish the Road Usage Charge Pilot Program to provide grants for pilot studies on mileage tracking, payment methods, and implementation of mileage-based fee systems in jurisdictions. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary to be considered for a grant. The Secretary will select pilot studies for the Road Usage Charge Pilot Program based on various concerns such as personal privacy, public compliance, acceptance, equity, integration with transportation revenue mechanisms, administrative issues, cost, enforcement, fraud potential, and feasibility. Priority will be given to studies that can serve as a model for broad implementation of a mileage-based fee system and address rural and urban user equity concerns. The Road Usage Charge Pilot Program aims to implement a mileage-based fee system that addresses rural and urban user equity concerns. It involves multistate projects with a high volume of enrolled vehicles, integration with State and local revenue systems, demand management plans, and other intelligent transportation system technologies. Pilot studies must reserve at least 10 percent of funds for metropolitan or regional planning organizations. Eligible entities receiving grants must cost-share in the program. Cost Sharing: Eligible entities receiving grants under this Act must provide 20 percent of the grant funds from non-Federal sources to support the activities. The working group is established. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, establishes a working group to evaluate technology platforms and standards for a road usage charge, develop national privacy standards, assess costs of collection, administration, and equity, and explore methods to manage demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The working group will consist of at least 10 members. The working group for evaluating technology platforms and standards for a road usage charge will have no fewer than 10 members, representing various sectors including the telecommunications industry, highway user groups, data security and privacy industry, privacy rights advocacy organizations, state or regional transportation agencies, and national research and policymaking bodies.
