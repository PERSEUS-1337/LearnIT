The Homeland Security Secretary will group agents to aid in assessing countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats, facilitating the evaluation by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This includes categorizing countermeasures that can address multiple agents. Countermeasures may address multiple agents for adverse health consequences, not requiring a specific grouping to assess different categories of countermeasures.

A report to Congress is also required. The Homeland Security Secretary must report to Congress within 30 days of completing threat or risk assessments.
