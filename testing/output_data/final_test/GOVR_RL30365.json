Interest in government corporations has increased among Members of Congress, the executive branch, and the scholarly community in recent decades. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to establish government corporations, such as H.R. 404 and S. 652 in the 112th Congress. This interest may be driven by the restrictive federal budget. The federal government utilizes government corporations to achieve policy goals. Interest in government corporations has grown in recent decades, driven by the restrictive federal budget. Government corporations seek new revenue sources and exemptions from general management laws, supporting the \"New Public Management\" approach. Questions remain about their legal character, utility compared to traditional agencies, and limitations as governmental units. A federal government corporation is an agency established by Congress to perform a public purpose, provide market-oriented products or services, and generate revenue to cover its expenses. There are 17 entities classified as government corporations, although the U.S. Code does not offer a single definition for this term. Understanding the unique characteristics of government management, guided by principles of public law, helps in evaluating the suitability of government corporations for achieving governance objectives. A \"government corporation\" is defined as a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of the United States, according to Title 5 of the U.S. Code and the Government Corporation Control Act. Various entities are classified as government corporations, ranging from large entities like the United States Postal Service to smaller ones. Government corporations in the United States range from large entities like the United States Postal Service to smaller bodies such as the Federal Financing Bank and Federal Prison Industries. These corporations are distinct from government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, which are privately owned financial institutions with federal charters and implicit federal guarantees. The federal government's involvement in commercial enterprises has been limited historically, with few instances of shared ownership with private entities. The creation of the United States Investigation Services Corporation as an employee stock-ownership plan in 1996 raised questions about its status and authority within the quasi government category. This contrasts with government corporations like the United States Postal Service and government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae, where legal and political lines of accountability can be ambiguous. The federal government has historically avoided sharing ownership with private entities. The first time it acquired a corporation outright was in 1903 with the purchase of the Panama Railroad Company. Corporate bodies have been established by the government in response to emergencies, such as World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. Many of these corporations were abolished or absorbed into permanent executive branch agencies after the emergencies passed. In 1945, Congress passed the Government Corporation Control Act (GCCA) to standardize budget, auditing, debt management, and depository practices for government corporations. These corporations are considered \"agencies\" of the United States and are subject to all laws governing agencies, except where exempted. Each federal government corporation has a separate enabling legislation passed by Congress, and the GCCA does not provide a general definition of government corporations. The Government Corporation Control Act (GCCA) standardizes practices for government corporations. It lists various organizations, from large ones like the United States Postal Service to smaller ones like the Federal Financing Bank. President Harry Truman provided criteria for when a government corporation is suitable. The corporate form of organization is well-suited for government programs with commercial characteristics, requiring flexibility in business operations. However, some government corporations like the Legal Services Corporation and Corporation for Public Broadcasting do not meet these criteria. Government corporations, such as the Legal Services Corporation and Corporation for Public Broadcasting, do not perform commercial functions and rely on annual appropriations. They are insulated from oversight by central management agencies and general management laws. Despite variations, government corporations share commonalities in authorities, organization, mission, and behavior, and are subject to constitutional limitations. The Supreme Court has ruled that government corporations cannot shed their inherent legal characteristics through legislative language or corporate fiat. The nature of the function performed does not affect the governmental character of government corporations. The distinctions between governmental and private sectors are based on legal theory, not economic theory. The government corporation remains governmental until Congress determines it should be fully private. The attorney general has central control over U.S. government litigation, although exceptions have been allowed over the years. The independent regulatory commissions have varying degrees of independence in their litigation authority. The Justice Department prefers central coordination of litigation but has limited staff and is reluctant to handle routine cases. Government corporations have a distinct legal personality from the United States and can initiate civil suits. Employees of government corporations have limited immunity under the Federal Tort. Government corporations, unlike regular government agencies, have their employees covered by the limited waiver of immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). These corporations have a separate legal identity from the United States, allowing them to sue and be sued in their own name. This enables private businesses to contract with government corporations with the assurance that legal recourse is available if needed. Government corporations simplify the process of settling contractual disputes, allowing contractors to obtain prompt settlements. Unlike regular government agencies, they are exempt from many executive branch rules and regulations regarding budgets, making them more efficient in managing financial matters. Government corporations, unlike regular government agencies, are exempt from many executive branch budgetary regulations. The GCCA requires wholly owned government corporations to submit a \"business-type budget\" to the President, detailing financial estimates for current and future fiscal years, as well as past operations. This budget program includes statements on financial condition, income and expenses, surplus and deficit analysis, and additional financial information. The budget program for government corporations includes financial estimates for current and future fiscal years, surplus and deficit analysis, and statements on financial condition. This information is submitted to Congress along with the executive branch budget. The budget program for government corporations includes financial estimates for current and future fiscal years, surplus and deficit analysis, and statements on financial condition. Government corporations receive most, if not all, of their funds from users of their services, leading to a business-like relationship where services are provided as long as buyers are willing to pay. This can result in fluctuating revenues, expenditures, and personnel based on consumer demand. Some Members of Congress are uneasy with these \"business type budgets,\" but have the ability to alter them if needed. Government corporations receive funds from users, leading to a business-like relationship. Congressional scrutiny of these corporations is minimal, except in times of political or financial threat. GAO was responsible for annual financial audits until 1975, when audits were reduced to once every three years. In 1990, GAO recommended annual audits be reinstated, which was accepted under the CFOA. The audit of government corporations is now conducted annually by the corporation's inspector general or an independent external auditor, as determined by government auditing standards. The Comptroller General can still review financial statements. Government corporations vary in location, structure, and governance, with some located in executive departments and others having independent status. Employees of government corporations may actually be employees of the parent agency. Government corporations can be managed in various ways, such as by a full-time board, a CEO selected by a part-time board, or a mixed board of governmental and private appointees. The governance structure varies, with positives and negatives to each option. A board of directors is a key feature of government corporations, according to many lawmakers. A board of directors is seen as a crucial element for a government corporation by many lawmakers and attorneys. Marshall Dimock argued in 1949 that it was essential for an \"authentic\" government corporation, while Harold Seidman later challenged this view, stating that it was not necessarily desirable. In government corporations, there may not be a need for a board of directors as ownership solely resides in the government. Ownership residing solely in the government means a board of directors may not be necessary for government corporations, although it can be useful in certain cases. Most federal government corporations have boards of directors, with exceptions like Ginnie Mae and the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. A 1981 study by the National Academy of Public Administration criticized the use of boards of directors in government corporations, suggesting that advisory boards may be more effective. In most cases, a governing board may be replaced by an advisory board for better management of government corporations. An advisory board ensures clear lines of authority from the President to the corporation's chief executive officer, without creating confusion. Some argue that a board of directors acts as a buffer between the corporation's top executive and political officials, but its necessity in the administrative system is debatable. The effectiveness of corporation boards depends on factors like legislation coherence, program integrity, and board size. Large boards may struggle with decision-making. Internal factors such as board size, member loyalties, and relationship with management also play a role. There is little central oversight of government corporations in the executive branch. Government corporations in the executive branch lack central oversight, with each entity having its own political and administrative requirements. Oversight typically occurs when financial risks or wrongdoing are suspected, but there is no systematic monitoring of corporations as a whole, contrary to the intentions of the Government Corporation Control Act (GCCA). The Bureau of the Budget (BOB), now the OMB, played a key role in the GCCA's passage. During the 1960s, the oversight of government corporations by the Bureau of the Budget (BOB) diminished, leading to a lack of central executive staff capacity for monitoring their operations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not consider government corporations as a collective category for supervision, and maintains that oversight responsibility was not changed by the OMB 2000 reorganization. The Resource Management Office (RMO) reviews government corporations related to the corporation's mission. OMB does not separately review government corporations, leading to additional burdens on Congress to ensure compliance with management laws. Limited central oversight raises questions on the creation and use of government corporations. Government corporations should be established with proper structure, authority, and financial systems. One school advocates for maximum policy and financial autonomy with appropriate oversight, while the other school believes in establishing government corporations based on specific criteria and standards. These corporations should be considered part of the executive branch but with recognition of their unique needs and oversight. The government corporation concept is seen as a useful alternative to privatization, serving as a transition step towards full privatization. An example is Conrail, created in 1976 as a government corporation to bring bankrupt railroads up to industry standards before eventual privatization. The federal government received approximately $2 billion from the sale of Conrail, which was necessary to bring the railroad up to industry standards before privatization. The northeastern region of the country was provided with a viable freight rail system. The U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) completed its transition to full privatization, with mixed results, after operating uranium enrichment plants in Kentucky and Ohio. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the U.S. Enrichment Corporation as a government corporation to privatize uranium enrichment plants. The privatization plan included an IPO, raising $1.9 billion for the government. The transition process highlighted challenges in privatization efforts. The U.S. Enrichment Corporation faced challenges in privatization efforts, including Congress wanting the corporation to implement a foreign policy objective by purchasing Russian enriched uranium. The corporation found the arrangement not viable and sought relief from Congress in October 1999. The USEC board of directors recently canceled the AVLIS program, a technology transferred from the DOE, citing lack of commercial viability. This decision highlighted the fiduciary differences between government and private corporations. The Department of Energy decided to divest the California fields of the Elk Hills National Petroleum Reserves, opting for a government corporation model. However, the definition of government corporations is not clearly defined in law, leading to inconsistencies in the enumeration of corporate bodies. Government corporations lack managerial oversight from the President or Congress, with oversight being corporation-specific. GAO recommends corporations have subject matter and management oversight, suggesting reconstitution of the GCCA. These corporations serve as permanent, temporary, or transition agencies for governmental functions. The flexibility of government corporations allows for divestment and transfer to the private sector, with potential models for other agencies like the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. Mint. The future of government corporations looks promising, but there is a need for new organizational structures that balance public law requirements with corporate flexibility. The success of government corporations depends on the quality of the law establishing them. If the law is flawed, like in the case of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, it can become a liability. However, if designed properly, government corporations can be a useful tool to achieve public policy objectives. Government corporations, like regular agencies, aim to implement laws passed by Congress. It is important to highlight their shared characteristics with other federal agencies."
