    "content": "The Act titled the \"Terry Peak Land Transfer Act of 1999\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. Congress finds that a portion of the National Forest System land in the Black Hills National Forest is currently permitted to the Terry Peak Ski Area. This land makes up only 10% of the Ski Area, with the remaining 90% being privately owned. Due to the land being encumbered by ski facilities and privately owned improvements, Congress believes it serves little purpose in public ownership and should be transferred to the Ski Area to streamline land management and reduce administrative costs. The Ski Area is interested in acquiring land from the United States to eliminate administrative costs. The Black Hills National Forest has small private inholdings complicating land management, which can be acquired by the United States with funding. Proceeds from the Terry Peak conveyance can fund the acquisition of inholdings in the National Forest. The Ski Area wants to acquire National Forest System land at Terry Peak to eliminate administrative costs. Proceeds from the conveyance will be used to acquire more desirable lands for permanent public use in the Black Hills National Forest. SEC. 3.
