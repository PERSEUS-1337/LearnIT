    "content": "The size of the Armed Forces is a key topic of congressional debate as Congress sets minimum and maximum strength levels for the active and reserve components each year. The number of military personnel directly impacts operational capabilities, costs, and veterans benefits. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017 authorized different levels of active duty personnel, particularly diverging with respect to the Army. The report provides an overview of active duty Army personnel strength changes in recent years, highlighting factors contributing to diverging approaches in the respective NDAAs. Congress regulates Armed Forces size by authorizing specific personnel levels each year, with Army end strength fluctuating over decades in response to global events. The Army's end strength fluctuated due to global events, with the FY2016 end strength set at 475,000 soldiers. The Administration proposed lowering it to 460,000 for FY2017, while the House approved 480,000 and the Senate matched the Administration's request. The divergence in numbers reflects differing assessments of factors like operational tempo, budget constraints, and readiness. The Department of Defense defines readiness as \"the ability of military forces to fight and meet the demands of assigned missions.\" Army readiness evaluations focus on personnel, equipment availability, equipment readiness, and training. The unit's overall readiness assessment is determined by the lowest rating of these four areas, with improvements in one area not necessarily impacting the overall rating. Individual factors can influence each other, making future readiness unpredictable. The Army determines unit readiness based on personnel, equipment availability, equipment readiness, and training ratings. Improvements in one area may not impact the overall readiness assessment. Congress debates the Army's size considering strategic environment, role, potential use of additional end strength, results of a study on the future of the Army, and Budget Control Act constraints. The appropriate end strength of the Army is influenced by the changing international security landscape and the perception of heightened threats to the United States. The National Military Strategy identifies \"revisionist\" states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China as posing challenges through boundary violations and military force. The National Military Strategy highlights Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism, North Korea's nuclear threat to its neighbors, and China's destabilizing activities in the South China Sea. Violent Extremist Organizations use a mix of weaponry and propaganda to spread influence, posing an immediate threat in the Middle East. The National Military Strategy discusses the growing probability of the United States being at war with another great power, mentioning hybrid warfare tactics used by state and non-state actors. Director for National Intelligence James Clapper highlighted the diverse array of challenges faced today. The global security environment is becoming more challenging, raising questions about the role of the U.S. military, especially the Army, in advancing U.S. interests. The debate over the role of the Army in advancing U.S. interests is ongoing. Ground forces are seen as increasingly important for various reasons such as bolstering deterrent postures, engaging in hybrid warfare, and seizing terrain in military campaigns. The presence of ground forces sends strong political-military signals, demonstrating a high level of commitment to national strategic objectives. The Cold War serves as a historical example of this dynamic. During the Cold War, the presence of U.S. troops in Europe was crucial for bolstering deterrent postures and demonstrating commitment to national strategic objectives. This was exemplified by the belief that American casualties in Europe would trigger a significant military response to repel a Soviet attack. Additionally, operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans highlighted the importance of engaging with local populations in various conflicts. Stability operations, counterinsurgencies, and \"hybrid\" conflicts require a significant ground presence for personnel-intensive techniques like patrolling and intelligence collection to create stability. Troop numbers for effective counterinsurgency operations are now suggested at 20 troops per 1,000 residents. This necessitates a large portion of U.S. ground forces to provide support. Large portions of U.S. ground forces play a key role in providing enabling and logistical support for combat and steady-state operations, including life support, headquarters staffing, and logistics. Even \"light footprint\" counterterrorism operations require personnel-intensive infrastructure, as highlighted by General McChrystal in a New York Times interview. The Army provides enablers for global operations, with executive agency for various tasks. Some argue the balance between logistical support and operational forces is skewed, while others highlight the complexity of expeditionary requirements. Ground forces are essential in military operations where terrain must be seized and held. The United States prefers to build the capacity of local forces to hold territory once cleared, requiring a sizable troop presence. Currently, the US has troops in Iraq and Afghanistan focused on training local security forces. The United States currently has 12,930 troops dedicated to training and equipping Afghan Security Forces. There is a growing concern about potential conflicts with major powers, leading to the need for more troops to confront adversaries like Russia. However, some argue that advancements in technology and military capabilities could allow for effective operations with fewer troops. Some argue for military transformation with special operations forces and precision munitions for battlefield impact. Concerns about Army overreacting to strategic threats, but others believe in joint warfare capabilities to prevent being outmatched. Doubts exist about U.S. political willingness for future ground-force-intensive operations. The 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance states that U.S. forces will no longer be sized for large-scale stability operations. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned against sending big American land armies into Asia, the Middle East, or Africa. Despite past unpredictability in military engagements, Congress should consider this when debating Army strength levels. When debating Army strength levels, Congress may consider how additional personnel would be utilized, potentially creating new units or enhancing existing ones. Army leadership has not provided specific details on the use of additional end strength, but it could improve air defense, tactical mobility, missile defense, and other areas identified by the National Commission on the Future of the Army. The Army plans to increase end strength to create new units like Train, Advise, and Assist Brigades. These brigades will serve to deploy overseas to advise, assist, and train partners and allies, while also expanding the Army in emergencies by adding soldiers to form a Brigade Combat Team. General Milley emphasized the need for a mix of Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve forces to accomplish national military goals. The Army plans to increase end strength to create new units like Train, Advise, and Assist Brigades, emphasizing the need for a mix of Regular Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve forces. General Milley suggests that additional end strength decisions should consider force mix and operational tempo, with additional funding needed to support readiness. General Milley believes that increasing end strength would improve readiness, but only if there is sufficient funding. The FY2015 NDAA established a commission to study Army strength and force structure to assess the size and force mixture of the Army and make recommendations for modifications based on mission requirements and available resources. The FY2015 NDAA established a commission to study Army strength and force structure, with the committee believing an independent review is necessary due to budget constraints. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) submitted a report with 63 recommendations to Congress and the Administration on January 28, 2016. The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA) submitted a 208-page report with 63 recommendations to Congress and the Administration on January 28, 2016. Key recommendations include maintaining an Army of 980,000 soldiers and retaining an 11th Regular Army Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) instead of reducing to 10 CABs as proposed. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommended maintaining an Army of 980,000 soldiers and addressing shortfalls in various areas such as tactical mobility, missile defense, CBRN defense, field artillery, and water purification. It suggested considering the elimination of two Regular Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams to create units to address these shortfalls and increasing Armored Brigade Combat Team capacity based on current threats. The Army should ensure Combatant Commands and Army Service Component Commands have operational mission command capabilities in proportion to unique missions. The National Commission on the Future of the Army recommended maintaining 24 manned AH-64 Apache battalions and adding 2 UH-60 Black Hawk transport helicopter battalions to the National Guard to reduce costs. Shortfalls in air defense, tactical mobility, missile defense, CBRN defense, field artillery, fuel distribution, water purification, Army watercraft, and military police could impact Army end strength. The Army may create new units of varying sizes to address capability shortfalls, such as an 11th CAB or increased ABCT capacity. This process would be gradual over several years, depending on urgency and availability of necessary equipment. The Army can create new units by converting existing ones, deactivating units to reallocate resources, or requesting additional end strength and funding. The Army can create new units by converting existing ones, deactivating units, or requesting additional funding and end strength. Converting existing units or deactivating units may prove impractical due to downsizing and operational needs. Army leadership finds it not practical to eliminate two Regular Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) as recommended by the NCFA. The Army's report to the Department of Defense on implementing NCFA recommendations, including potential end strength adjustments, is awaiting DOD's response. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes spending caps on defense, limiting DOD's military budget for FY2017 to $523.9 billion. The BCA cap on defense spending limits the DOD military budget to $523.9 billion, allocated across military departments. The Army's share is $123 billion, distributed across different appropriation titles. If Congress wants to increase the Army's size beyond the budget, additional funding or reductions from other accounts would be necessary. Options for funding the increased end strength are discussed. The Army's increased end strength may lead Congress to consider costs based on the type of unit personnel are assigned to, accounting for differences in organizational structure, training requirements, and equipment needs. For example, an active duty infantry brigade costs an average of $106,383 per troop annually, while an Aviation Brigade costs an average of $162,252 per troop annually. The Army's increased end strength may lead Congress to consider costs based on the type of unit personnel are assigned to. An Aviation Brigade costs an average of $162,252 per troop annually. Congress could raise or repeal the BCA caps to fund the increased force structure, or designate it as an \"emergency\" or for \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror\" requirements to exempt funding from the BCA limits. The measure allocated $18.0 billion in funding for DOD base requirements, designated as OCO/GWOT for BBEDCA exemption. H.R. 4909 increased Army funding for Military Personnel, procurement, O&M, and RDT&E. Criticized for using OCO funds, Secretary of Defense Carter warned against funding base requirements from OCO, citing risks to force readiness. Funding an Army end strength increase through other military departments' budget cuts is suggested as an alternative. The FY2017 Defense Budget Overview justifies the President's request for an Army of 980,000 soldiers amidst fiscal and strategic uncertainty. The budget prioritizes joint force technological superiority, stabilizing ground force end strength, and funding important reforms while making better use of defense resources through acquisition and management reform. The FY2017 Defense Budget prioritizes joint force technological superiority, stabilizing ground force end strength, and funding important reforms to make better use of defense resources. Congress may consider risks to the joint force's ability to meet mission requirements if increases to Army end strength are funded by reductions to other military departments. Reducing Army spending in other areas to pay for additional end strength could negatively impact Army readiness. In May 2011, concerns were raised about the potential for a \"hollow force\" if budget limitations are not balanced with force readiness. Secretary Gates warned against a \"salami-slicing\" approach that could lead to a lack of proper training, maintenance, and equipment, resulting in a hollowing-out of the force. This approach was seen in the 1970s and to a lesser extent in the late 1990s. General Dunford also highlighted the challenge of increasing the size of the Army while facing budget constraints that limit funds for training, equipping, and modernizing the force. General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized the need to equip, sustain, and modernize the force while balancing manpower numbers and force readiness. The National Commission on the Future Army also expressed concerns about the Army prioritizing manpower and force readiness over modernization in the face of budget constraints. The Army faces risks to modernization due to budget constraints. Congress may find savings in existing DOD activities to fund an increase in Army end strength. The Department of Defense plans to reduce the size of the Army to 450,000 in FY2018. Congress may gather additional information to determine the proper size of the Army. Congress may gather additional information from the Army and outside experts to determine the proper size of the Army and its role in meeting future security challenges. Key questions include the tasks the Army needs to accomplish, its role within a coalition, and what an agile Army force structure would look like. The Army's potential creation of new units with additional end strength raises questions about their purpose, types, capabilities, and funding requirements. Congressional priorities and existing capability gaps must be considered in aligning these plans. Creating new units or augmenting existing ones raises questions about required resources such as equipment, training, facilities, and funding. Considerations include the availability of excess equipment, the need to procure new equipment and major weapon systems, the time needed to equip and train new units, and the associated costs."
