The Act titled \"Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Designation of Responsibilities Act\" recognizes the sacrifices of workers in nuclear defense, who developed illnesses due to exposure to hazards. Many were not adequately protected or informed of these risks. Over the past 20 years, scientific findings have shown that Department of Energy workers at nuclear facilities face increased risks of cancer and nonmalignant diseases due to exposure to silica, radiation, and beryllium. Federal workers' compensation programs have not covered these workers, making it difficult for them to receive benefits. The Department of Energy and its predecessors have historically discouraged workers from seeking compensation for beryllium, radiation, and silica-related health conditions. The government should provide support to help these workers determine if their illnesses are linked to their nuclear weapons-related work. The Department of Energy's nuclear weapons production program should provide workers and their survivors with necessary information for processing claims and minimize administrative responsibilities. This situation warrants congressional action. SEC. 2. ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ADMINISTERING PROGRAM. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for administering the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, making decisions on eligibility and adjudicating claims for compensation and benefits under the 2000 Act. Regulations must be promulgated by May 31, 2001. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for administering the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, including developing regulations, forms, and informational materials to assist potential claimants. The Secretary of Health and Human Services also plays a role in the program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked with establishing guidelines and methods for assessing cancer likelihood and radiation doses for individuals applying for assistance under the Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for issuing determinations on petitions by employees to be part of the Special Exposure Cohort and estimating radiation doses for individuals seeking assistance. Additionally, they appoint members for a physician panel to consider workers' compensation claims and provide guidance to the Advisory Board. The Secretary of Energy provides administrative support to the Advisory Board and grants access to relevant information for worker exposures. The Secretary of Energy provides administrative support to the Advisory Board and grants access to relevant information for worker exposures. Responsibilities include requesting information from contractors, notifying eligible individuals of compensation availability, designating atomic weapons employers and beryllium vendors, and negotiating agreements with state executives. The Worker Assistance Program provides aid to Department of Energy contractor employees filing State workers' compensation claims related to nuclear weapons complex employment. Assistance includes submitting claims to a physician panel for determining illness or death causes. The Worker Assistance Program aids Department of Energy contractor employees in filing workers' compensation claims related to exposure to toxic substances at DOE facilities. The program includes assistance in filing claims and prohibits contesting valid claims. The Attorney General will notify claimants approved for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act about supplemental benefits available through the Worker Assistance Program. The Worker Assistance Program provides supplemental compensation and benefits to eligible covered uranium employees or their survivors. They must be identified and notified of the availability of this compensation. Information needed to adjudicate claims can be provided upon request by the Secretary of Labor. Establishment of Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, established by Public Law 106-398, consists of up to 20 members appointed by the President, including affected workers, scientific and medical representatives. The Board advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services on guidelines development, scientific validity of dose reconstruction efforts, and provides advice upon request. The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health advises the Secretary on identifying individuals or groups of employees at DOE facilities who were exposed to radiation without accurate dose estimates, potentially endangering their health. The Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy must report annually on their activities under the Program, including expenditures on benefits and administration. The Secretary of Labor must also report on the number and types of claims for compensation and other relevant data."
