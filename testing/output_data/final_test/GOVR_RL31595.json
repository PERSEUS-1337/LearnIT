    "content": "Organic farming, defined by the USDA National Organic Program, is a production system managed in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act to promote ecological balance and conserve biodiversity. Interest in organic farming began in Europe and migrated to the United States in the early 1900s, gaining popularity in the 1950s due to environmental concerns. Private research organizations began investigating non-chemical and non-intensive farming techniques in response to public concerns about environmental and health effects of agricultural chemicals. USDA did not support organic agriculture until the National Organic Program was established in 1990. The market growth for organic foods has remained steady at around 20% since 1990, with sales reaching $16.7 million in 2006. Sales of organic food products in 2006 were $16.7 million, accounting for 2.8% of total U.S. retail food sales. Organic foods are sold through various channels, with 38% through conventional retailers, 44% through natural food stores, and 16% through other outlets. U.S. exports of organic foods ranged from $125 million to $300 million in 2000-2002, with Canada being the largest export market. Nonfood organic product sales in 2006 totaled $938 million, with the fastest-growing categories being supplements, personal care products, flowers, pet foods, and fibers. All 50 states reported having certified organic farmland in 2005. In 2005, all 50 states reported certified organic farmland, with 4 million acres of organic cropland and pasture/rangeland. There were over 3,000 certified operations processing and distributing organic products in 2004. California leads in organic fruit and vegetable production, while other states like Washington, Oregon, and North Dakota also have significant organic crop acreage. Small-scale growers in the Northeast, Southeast, and Upper Midwest play a key role in organic agriculture. Organic pasture for livestock is prominent in California, Texas, Alaska, and Montana. The high growth in organic product sales is partly due to higher prices. The high growth rate in sales of organic products is attributed to the higher prices received by organic producers and processors. Price premiums for organic broccoli and carrots ranged from 75% to 133% above conventionally grown prices. However, the laws of supply and demand suggest that price premiums contributing to higher profits and market growth may not be sustainable in the long run. The organic industry faces challenges as market supply increases faster than demand, leading to a decline in price premiums and profits. Consumer studies show various factors influencing organic food purchases, including price, packaging, health concerns, and environmental impact. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 aimed to support the organic industry's growth. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 was drafted with support from industry groups and aimed to establish federal standards for organic products to reduce consumer confusion, promote confidence, facilitate labeling, expand product lines, increase marketing opportunities, and access international markets. The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 established federal standards for organic products, creating a National Organic Program administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service. Producers, processors, and handlers must follow detailed regulations to market their products as organic, with certification agents ensuring compliance through annual reviews. Using the term \"organic\" on a product without meeting these standards is illegal. The presence of the \"USDA Organic\" seal on a product indicates it is 95% or more organic. Products with 70% to 95% organic content can be labeled as \"made with organic (specified ingredients or food groups),\" but cannot carry the seal. Foreign organic producers can be certified by a USDA-accredited agent in their country or through an equivalency agreement with the US. States can add additional requirements for organic production after USDA approval. The USDA Organic seal indicates products are 95% or more organic. Private organic organizations can add their own labels alongside the USDA label. AMS reviews certification agents every five years and can revoke certification for violations. The NOP final rule was effective on February 21, 2001, with full implementation on October 21, 2002. USDA accredited private and state certification agents to certify organic producers according to standards in 7 CFR 205. After October 21, 2002, all organic products had to comply with regulations and carry the \"USDA Organic\" seal. A newspaper article in January 2005 highlighted a controversy within the organic industry regarding a 5,300-cow organic farm in Colorado. The farm fed animals mainly grain and housed them in a feedlot. The dispute centered around NOP regulation 7 CFR 205.239(a)(1-2), which requires livestock to have access to the outdoors, pasture for ruminants, and suitable living conditions. Organic dairy producers cited in the article argued against these practices. The news article highlighted a controversy within the organic industry regarding access to pasture for ruminants. Organic dairy producers argued that organic cattle must graze on pasture for nutrition, fresh air, and exercise. A Colorado operator mentioned that providing sufficient pasturage for all cows in an arid state like Colorado would be challenging. This issue reflects a tension in the organic industry over regulatory standards and the meaning of \"organic\" farming practices. Some stakeholders in the organic industry are concerned about regulations that may limit producers' ability to benefit from the growing market for organic products, especially organic dairy. The National Organic Standards Board recommended new language to allow cows to graze pasture at the appropriate stage of life, which was forwarded for approval. The National Organic Standards Board recommended new language to allow cows to graze pasture at the appropriate stage of life during the normal growing season. However, the NOP staff rejected the recommendation in August 2005, citing a lack of clear regulatory objective. The USDA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in April 2006, seeking stakeholder input on pasture access for organic milk production. Critics are concerned about delays in finalizing the rule, as large feedlot dairy operations are being certified organic in possible violation of the OFPA. The USDA proposed rule to amend the NOP livestock standards to clarify pasture requirements for organic ruminants, including defining \"growing season,\" mandating animals over six months be on pasture, and receiving 30% of DMI from pasture. The rule aims to prevent larger dairy operations from selling milk as organic without cows grazing on fresh grass. The comment period closes in December 2008. The NOSB is developing organic standards for aquaculture, with recommendations approved in November 2008. Critics fear the criteria may allow sub-par organic fish to be sold at a premium, undermining consumer confidence. Environmental groups criticize the recommendations for not requiring closed, controlled production systems for farmed fish. The NOSB has approved recommendations for organic standards in aquaculture, which critics fear may allow lower quality organic fish to be sold at a higher price. Environmental groups are concerned about the use of open net cages and fishmeal from wild fish in farmed fish production. Critics advocate for only fish fed 100% organic feed in closed production systems to be certified as organic. Aquaculture producers generally support the NOSB recommendations. Congress has allocated funds to support the organic certification program, including $639,000 in FY2001, $1 million in FY2002, and additional funds from the 2002 farm bill. The USDA was authorized to defray certification costs for producers and handlers through FY2007, with a one-time transfer of $5 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation for a national organic certification cost-share program. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) established a national organic certification cost-share program under the National Organic Program (NOP) in FY2002. Federal funds covered up to 75% ($500 maximum) of a producer's or handler's certification costs. The program remained available until fully expended in fall 2006. The 2002 farm bill renewed authority for a competitive grant program supporting research on organic production, processing, and marketing. It emphasized genetics research to improve organic crops, identified marketing and policy constraints, and expanded on-farm research. $3 million annually was authorized for USDA research from FY2003-FY2007. The research title requires ERS to gather and maintain data on organic agriculture production and marketing, as well as make it easier for U.S. organic producers to access research from foreign countries. ERS still relies on external data sources for information on the organic sector, as a comprehensive USDA survey authorized in the 2002 farm bill has not been conducted. USDA has not started providing market news on the organic sector, and separate export and import data for organic products are not being collected. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for organic agriculture, such as reauthorizing key programs and providing mandatory funds. This bill reauthorizes the National Organic Certification Cost-share Program with increased funding support. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for organic agriculture, such as reauthorizing key programs and providing mandatory funds. It designates $1.5 million in mandatory funds for certification cost-share assistance to organic producers in certain states and includes grants under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to help farmers convert to organic production. The 2008 farm bill extends the authority for the organic research and extension initiative, providing $78 million in mandatory funds for FY2009-FY2012 and authorizing $25 million annually in appropriations. It does not include a provision for funding organic research conducted by USDA's Agricultural Research Service based on the percentage of organic products in the U.S. food market. The bill also includes a provision to collect data on organic production and marketing. The 2008 farm bill extends funding for organic research and extension, providing $78 million in mandatory funds for FY2009-FY2012. It includes a provision for collecting data on organic production and marketing. Additionally, the bill addresses issues faced by organic farmers in the federal crop insurance program, such as higher premiums and claims based on conventional crop values. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions to review underwriting, risk, and loss experience of organic versus conventional crops for crop insurance. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation aims to reduce premium surcharges for organic producers unless significant variations in loss history are found. Organic producers can choose to be reimbursed based on actual prices received. Critics argue that the National Organic Program's funding of $2 million annually has led to insufficient oversight. The bill sets the NOP's annual authorization level at $6.5 million for FY2009, increasing to $11 million in FY2012. The 2008 farm bill sets the National Organic Program's annual authorization level at $6.5 million for FY2009, increasing to $11 million in FY2012. House and Senate appropriators will determine the actual funding available. The conservation, credit, and trade titles of the farm bills also include provisions to enhance the organic sector's access to programs in those areas."
