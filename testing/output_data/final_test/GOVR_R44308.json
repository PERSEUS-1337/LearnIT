    "content": "The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is a national network of centers that provide custom services to small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) to improve production processes, upgrade technological capabilities, and facilitate product innovation. The MEP program's mission is to enhance the productivity and technological performance of U.S. manufacturing through state and regional centers that partner with industry, universities, state governments, and federal research laboratories. Funding for MEP centers is provided on a cost-shared basis between the federal government and nonfederal sources. The MEP program received $140.0 million for FY2018, with President Trump requesting no funding for MEP centers in his FY2019 budget. Both the House and Senate committee-reported appropriations bills would provide $140.0 million for MEP in FY2019. MEP has a staff of 50 employees at NIST and over 1,300 field staff with technical and business expertise. NIST served more than 26,313 SMMs in FY2017, with companies reporting significant sales and investment savings. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act established the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership to assist small and medium-sized manufacturers in adopting new technologies. Small and medium-sized manufacturers are seen as key contributors to job creation, innovation, and manufacturing. Research shows that these manufacturers produce more innovations per employee than large firms. Other nations also provide assistance to their manufacturing communities. In 2015, there were 248,000 small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) in the United States, accounting for 98.5% of the nation's manufacturing enterprises and employing approximately 5.2 million people. The use of technology by SMMs is crucial for the competitiveness of American manufacturing firms. Lack of attention to process technologies may be due to various factors such as company finances and undervaluation of technology benefits. The MEP program aims to address these issues through outreach. The MEP program aims to address issues in technology adoption by SMMs through outreach and expertise. NIST reports that MEP has worked with 94,033 manufacturers, resulting in $111.3 billion in sales, $18.8 billion in cost savings, and over 985,317 jobs created. For every dollar of federal investment, MEP generates $27.30 in new client investment and $27.20 in sales growth for SMMs. Additionally, MEP creates or retains one manufacturing job for every $1,291 in federal investment, with a study estimating that MEP activities added over 219,000 jobs. The MEP program, established in 1988, has evolved over time and is now known as the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. It has added over 219,000 jobs to the U.S. economy and $22.0 billion to GDP, with a return of 14.5:1 to the U.S. Treasury. The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program was established in 1988 to help small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) by providing cutting-edge technology developed by NIST and other federal laboratories. The program initially had three centers in 1989, which grew to 70 centers by 1996. Despite evolving methods and tools, the focus on assisting SMMs has remained constant. The Manufacturing Technology Centers Program aimed to provide advanced technology to small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) but found that SMMs primarily needed basic technologies and business advice instead. A 1991 assessment by the General Accounting Office concluded that SMMs required proven technologies rather than cutting-edge ones. The Manufacturing Technology Centers Program initially aimed to provide advanced technology to small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) but found that most SMMs actually needed basic technologies and business advice. This led to a reorientation of the program to offer more practical and cost-effective solutions to help SMMs improve their productivity and competitiveness. By the mid-1990s, the program was providing a wide range of business services to assist companies in solving manufacturing problems, training workers, creating marketing plans, and upgrading equipment and computers. The MEP program initially focused on providing point solutions to manufacturing problems but has since shifted towards offering more strategic and integrated services. The current focus includes innovation strategies, commercialization, lean production, process improvements, workforce training, supply chain optimization, and exporting. Technology acceleration is a key aspect of the MEP strategy, aiming to integrate technology into products. Technology acceleration is a key aspect of the MEP strategy, integrating technology into products, processes, services, and business models of manufacturers to enhance competitiveness and manufacturing growth. MEP assists SMMs in improving existing products, developing new products, and enhancing manufacturing processes through various approaches such as technology scouting, supplier scouting, lean product development, and access to capital. MEP focuses on enhancing productivity and technological performance in U.S. manufacturing through technology transfer activities with NIST laboratories and federal programs like SBIR, AmTech, and NNMI. Targeted outreach is towards growth-oriented SMMs and small startups. The curr_chunk discusses cooperative technology transfer activities with federal agencies and NIST to make new manufacturing technology usable by small- and medium-sized U.S. companies. It also emphasizes disseminating information about manufacturing to industrial firms, promoting certification systems, and providing job skills information to community colleges and technical education schools. The curr_chunk discusses efforts to address workforce needs and skills gaps in small- and medium-sized manufacturing businesses, focusing on providing technical and managerial assistance through MEP Centers. The program does not offer direct financial support but aims to promote the growth of employment and wages at US-based small and medium-sized companies through activities such as technology transfer and research dissemination. The MEP program aims to support small and medium-sized manufacturers by facilitating collaborations with community colleges and technical education schools. NIST MEP includes an office, advisory board, and 51 centers. In FY2017, NIST MEP had 47 employees and received appropriations for 80 FTE. The program office was reorganized in FY2017 for better efficiency and collaboration. The NIST MEP program office, led by a Director and Deputy Director, consists of four Divisions with Groups and Teams for financial oversight, compliance, partnership development, and program creation. The NIST MEP program office consists of four Divisions with Groups and Teams for financial oversight, compliance, partnership development, and program creation. The External Affairs, Performance, and Support Division is responsible for stakeholder relations and customer service. The Marketing and Communications Group handles messaging, outreach, and branding efforts. The Manufacturing Research and Program Evaluation Group conducts evaluations and economic research for the MEP center system. The MEP program office consists of several divisions and teams. The System Learning and Management Division works directly with MEP centers, the Regional Management Group interacts with centers, ensures compliance, and develops partnerships. The Administrative Team manages administrative functions, the IT Team provides technology support, and the Manufacturing Research and Program Evaluation Group conducts economic research for MEP centers. The MEP Advisory Board was established by Congress to provide advice on MEP activities, plans, and policies. It consists of at least 10 members representing stakeholders in the manufacturing sector, including small businesses and community colleges. Federal employees are not allowed to serve on the board, and members serve staggered terms of three years. The MEP Advisory Board consists of at least 10 members representing stakeholders in the manufacturing sector, serving staggered terms of three years. Members may serve two consecutive terms and may be reappointed one year after the second term. The board acts in an advisory capacity, meeting at least twice a year and reporting annually to Congress through the Secretary of Commerce on the MEP program. The program is administered by NIST through partnerships with 51 centers nationwide, aiming to have service locations within two hours of all areas. MEP centers are operated by state governments, universities, or nonprofit organizations, not the federal government. Centers are selected based on merit using criteria such as technology transfer, training, and service quality. NIST MEP aims to have service locations within two hours of all potential clients. In 2017, NIST completed a recompetition of all its MEP centers to align funding levels with national manufacturing activity and have one center in each state and Puerto Rico. Center awards are made as cooperative agreements with an initial performance period of five years, extendable for an additional five years after an assessment. Funding for multiyear awards is usually provided for the first year, with subsequent years requiring detailed budget submissions. Funding after the first year is noncompetitive and contingent on satisfactory performance. Funding for MEP centers is provided on a cost-share basis by the federal government and nonfederal sources. The federal government may provide up to 50% of the funds required to establish and support a center. Centers must meet the required nonfederal cost-share to be eligible for federal funding. Eligible institutions include nonprofit institutions, institutions of higher education, states, and United States territories. The financial support system for MEP centers involves a cost-share basis between the federal government and nonfederal sources. Funding levels are set by NIST MEP for each state center, with federal funding amounts serving as the maximum available for the federal cost-share. Centers must meet the required nonfederal cost-share to receive full funding. ( Appendix B provides annual funding awarded centers in each state in the recompetition.) The Technology Competitiveness Act of 1987 directed that funding applicants' percentages be considered in selection. Cost-sharing strengthens ties between organizations in cooperative arrangements, with a focus on innovative collaboration between Federal laboratories, State agencies, and business groups. Matching provisions ensure centers meet manufacturing companies' needs, requiring applicants to provide over 50% of capital and operating costs. Prior to the American Competitiveness and Innovation Act, NIST could provide up to 50% of center costs in the first three years, decreasing in subsequent years. Calls were made to increase federal cost-share to 50% for centers in their fourth year due to economic challenges. Client fees for service decreased 13.4% between FY2008 and FY2009, prompting discussions on increasing federal support for the program. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 mandated a GAO report on cost-share provisions, highlighting the importance of federal, state, and local financial participation in the program's success. The GAO report identified factors to consider in modifying the cost-share structure of the MEP program to promote equity and align costs with benefits. NIST's study recommended consistency in cost-share requirements. The GAO report recommended consistent cost-share requirements for the MEP program, aligning with other economic development programs. However, the Congressional Budget Office proposed eliminating MEP due to questionable productivity enhancement. In 2014, bills were introduced to provide federal support for MEP centers up to 50% of annual costs. In 2014, bills were introduced to provide federal support for MEP centers of up to 50% of annual costs incurred. The MEP Advisory Board recommended readjusting the cost-share structure for long-term sustainability. In 2015, the Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the federal cost-share structure. The legislation directed NIST to provide a report detailing quantifiable metrics on total MEP center funding, including the type of contribution source across centers that have transitioned to a lower cost-share held by the Federal Government. Federal support beyond the sixth year of operation was considered necessary due to concerns about increasing service charges paid by SMMs. The legislation directed NIST to provide a report on MEP center funding, with concerns about service charges for small manufacturers. A 1998 NIST study showed that increased charges could make services unaffordable for many SMMs. To ensure high-quality assistance, stable federal funding for successful centers was recommended. Funding prohibition after the sixth year was temporarily suspended in FY1997 and FY1998, then eliminated by the Technology Administration Act of 1998. Centers could receive up to one-third federal funding under the act. The MEP program allows centers to receive federal funding of up to one-third of their costs after the sixth year, contingent on positive evaluations every two years. NIST supports various activities such as business-to-business networks and cooperative agreements. In 2014, $2.5 million was awarded to 10 MEP centers for pilot projects on B2B networks. The projects aim to develop scalable and interoperable B2B networks to match buyers and sellers of technologies or products. Additional work on these networks will be conducted under MEP's Competitive Awards Program, established in 2017. Awards are made on a competitive basis for up to three years without requiring matching funds, with proposals evaluated based on their potential to improve industry competitiveness and create jobs. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) made 14 two-year awards of approximately $1.2 million in three rounds of competitions to place MEP staff in Manufacturing USA institutes. The purpose of these awards is to promote the transfer and commercialization of research and technology, create jobs, and recruit a diverse manufacturing workforce. NIST encourages geographic diversity among selected proposals and enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized US manufacturers in the global marketplace. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) awarded grants to MEP centers to facilitate technology transfer from Manufacturing USA institutes to small and medium-sized manufacturers. The grants aim to develop innovative approaches, engage small manufacturers, test business models, and enhance partnerships among institutes and MEP centers. MEP centers across various states are partnering with different Manufacturing Innovation Institutes such as NextFlex, NIIMBL, DMDII, AFFOA, ARMI, LIFT, REMADE, AIM Photonics, Power America, and Rapid. Carolina MEP center partners with Power America, Oregon MEP center partners with RAPID Institute, Pennsylvania MEP center partners with America Makes and ARM Institute, Tennessee MEP center partners with IACMI. NIST awarded Georgia MEP center $346,000 for a project to support the machine shop industry and $35,000 for a separate initiative. NIST awarded funding to various MEP centers for projects promoting technology adoption and supply chain expansion. Georgia MEP received $35,000 for a Supplier Connectivity Forum, New Jersey MEP received $974,000 for FSMA capacity building, and Virginia MEP received $1.0 million for supply chain initiatives. NIST awarded funding to MEP centers to support projects addressing critical supply chain needs for small and medium-sized medical device manufacturers. Nevada MEP received $1.0 million for global competitiveness initiatives, North Carolina MEP received $1.0 million for rural manufacturers' innovation challenges, and Michigan MEP received funding for supply chain development. The Michigan MEP Center received a $785,000 award from NIST to develop a Network Cybersecurity Program in collaboration with five MEP centers. The program aims to enhance the value of suppliers to their customers and improve workforce skills. NIST also awarded grants to 10 winners in nine states as part of the Make it in America Challenge to promote job creation and business investment in the United States. The NIST MEP's MiiA Challenge grants aimed to support regional supply chain connectivity and assist small to medium manufacturers. NIST MEP centers participated in the AMJIAC to strengthen U.S. manufacturing, with 10 awards totaling $20 million. These grants facilitated innovation, worker training programs, and connections to resources like national labs and universities, ultimately expanding regional manufacturing activities. The NIST MEP's MiiA Challenge grants aimed to support regional supply chain connectivity and assist small to medium manufacturers. The grants provided opportunities for regions to expand activities and transform manufacturing support. MEP centers had varying roles in the awards, including management, partnerships, and participation in broad-based projects. In July 2013, NIST announced the Manufacturing Technology Acceleration Centers (M-TACs) pilot program under MEP to assist manufacturers with technology transition and commercialization. In October 2010, NIST announced $9.1 million in cooperative agreements for 22 projects to enhance U.S. manufacturers' productivity and competitiveness. The funding was provided by MEP to nonprofit organizations to address critical areas identified by NIST, such as evolving supply chains, technology adoption, sustainable processes, workforce development, and continuous improvement. The funding aimed to encourage the creation and adoption of improved technologies and new products to meet changing market needs. The MEP awards in 2010 aimed to enhance U.S. manufacturers' productivity by funding projects addressing critical areas like technology adoption and workforce development. In contrast to other MEP center activities, these awards supported research activities. The 2017 MEP National Network Strategic Plan outlined goals to empower manufacturers, champion manufacturing, and leverage partnerships to meet changing market needs. The 2017 MEP National Network Strategic Plan aims to increase market penetration through partnerships and transform the network into an integrated national platform for supporting manufacturing technology advances.

The NIST Three-Year Programmatic Plan requires submission to Congress concurrent with the President's budget request. Various organizations have reviewed and provided recommendations for improving the MEP program, including the FY2017 MEP Advisory Board annual report. The report discussed activities and feedback on streamlining permitting and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing. The MEP program has undergone significant changes, including the transition to a formalized integrated organization known as the MEP National Network. The Government Accountability Office has reviewed the program and recommended collaboration with other agencies participating in Manufacturing USA. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 directed the Secretary of Commerce to ensure coordination within the Network of Manufacturing Innovation. Innovation (now \"Manufacturing USA\") directed the Secretary of Commerce to incorporate MEP in Manufacturing USA institutes for research results to reach SMMs. NIST placed MEP staff in institutes through grants. GAO found that 81.4% of MEP funding supported center awards in FY2013. In 2010, Congress directed the GAO to report on the cost-share structure of the MEP program. GAO concluded that it could not provide recommendations for the optimal cost-share structure but identified factors to consider, such as promoting equity and aligning cost-shares with beneficiaries. In August 1995, the GAO explored how small and medium-sized firms benefited from manufacturing extension efforts, including the MEP program. 73% of firms reported positive effects on business performance, with improvements in technology use, product quality, and productivity. The study suggested that these activities were successful in helping manufacturers improve operations. The study found that companies using internal funding for extension program recommendations saw a positive impact on product quality and productivity. Approximately 97% of respondents believed the investment was worthwhile. Practical experience and affordability were key factors in success. Smaller and newer firms were more likely to benefit from the program. The study found that smaller and newer firms benefited the most from MEP assistance, with sales boosted by the program. Payment for services affected firms' perceptions of effectiveness, with those paying fees less likely to credit the assistance for a positive impact on their business performance. The CBO proposed eliminating the MEP program in 2009 and 2011, but recent editions of budget options have not included this proposal. The CBO proposed eliminating the MEP program in 2009 and 2011, but recent budget options have not included it. Supporters argue for the program's importance to small and medium-sized manufacturers in boosting output and employment. The MEP program faces barriers in obtaining information and its enhancement of U.S. productivity is questionable. Critics argue that federal spending on MEP may support inefficient companies, tying up resources that could be used more productively elsewhere. The National Academy of Public Administration recommended a fundamental change in the types of services provided by MEP in a 2004 report. The MEP developed a Next Generation Strategic Plan in 2006 to focus on the entire enterprise and its marketplace position. Current efforts include helping companies participate in supply chains and optimizing supply chain processes. President Trump sought to eliminate the MEP in his FY2018 budget, requesting $6.0 million for winding down the program. The House and Senate committee-reported bills for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, proposed different funding levels for the MEP program. The House bill allocated $100.0 million, a decrease from the previous year, while the Senate bill maintained funding at $130.0 million. Ultimately, Congress approved $140.0 million for MEP in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. President Trump's FY2019 budget once again proposed eliminating funding for MEP, but both the House and Senate committee-reported bills for FY2019 allocated $140.0 million for the program. The bill, S. 3072, would provide $140.0 million for the MEP program, maintaining the same funding level as FY2018. The history of presidential budget requests and congressional actions on MEP appropriations shows fluctuations in funding levels, with Congress generally providing steady funding except for cuts in FY2004 and FY2008. President George W. Bush's budget requests often called for reductions in MEP support, but Congress restored funding in subsequent years. In FY2008, MEP funding was cut to $89.6 million, down 14.4% from FY2007. President Bush's final budget proposed to end federal funding for MEP in FY2009, but Congress provided $110.0 million. President Obama's budget requests for MEP exceeded actual appropriations, with $124.7 million allocated in FY2010. President Trump proposed to eliminate federal support for MEP in FY2018, but Congress appropriated $140.0 million. President Trump proposed to eliminate federal support for the MEP centers in his FY2019 budget, requesting no funding for the program. GAO found that of the $608 million spent on the MEP program from FY2009 to FY2013, about $495 million (81.4%) went to center awards, with the remainder allocated to contracts, staff, overhead charges, and other items. NIST estimated that over 88.5% of federal MEP program spending in FY2013 was for direct support, while 11.5% was for administration. The MEP program has been a topic of debate among federal policymakers regarding the federal government's role in supporting U.S. industry. Proponents argue that MEP provides crucial assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs), while opponents claim that similar services are available elsewhere and shift costs to taxpayers. NIST MEP states that MEP activities yield positive returns for the U.S. Treasury, with no direct funding available to companies.

NIST MEP states that MEP activities yield positive returns for the U.S. Treasury, with no direct funding available to companies. Some opponents argue that MEP centers should be funded by state and local governments and companies, not the federal government. Congress has lifted restrictions on federal funding for MEP centers, allowing up to 50% of costs to be covered indefinitely. The debate over federal funding for MEP centers may be revisited by Congress, especially in light of the Trump Administration's proposal to defund the program in FY2019. These issues will be debated as Congress makes appropriation decisions regarding the federal government's role in facilitating research and technological advancement."
