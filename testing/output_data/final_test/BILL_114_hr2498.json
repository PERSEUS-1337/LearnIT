    "content": "The \"Budget Integrity Act\" is the short title of the Act. It requires the Congressional Budget Office to conduct long-term cost analyses of legislation. Section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include long-term cost estimates for bills or joint resolutions with significant fiscal impact. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office must provide requested information for at least the next two ten-fiscal-year periods. The term 'significant fiscal impact' is defined as any gross budgetary impact of at least 0.25 percent of gross domestic product for the two ten-fiscal-year periods mentioned in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Point of order against legislation increasing long-term deficits. Point of Order: Legislation in the House or Senate cannot increase on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion in consecutive 10-year periods. Waiver or suspension requires a three-fifths majority vote, and an appeal of the ruling needs the same majority. Budget deficit increases are determined based on specified criteria. The levels of net deficit increases are determined based on estimates provided by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate. SEC. 4. CBO AND OMB PROJECTIONS. The Congressional Budget Office is required to issue annual reports projecting spending, revenue, deficits, and debt for at least 40 years based on current law and policy levels. The reports must also analyze long-term projections of current and proposed policies in the budget. The President's budget proposal includes long-term projections of total spending over 40 years as a percentage of GDP annually and the impact of proposed policies over that period. SEC. 5. Establishment of Statutory Limit on the Public Debt. The Rules of the House of Representatives are amended to include a new rule titled \"Establishment of Statutory Limit on the Public Debt.\" Upon adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget by Congress, the Clerk prepares a joint resolution to adjust the statutory limit on the public debt. The House's vote on the budget resolution also counts as a vote on the joint resolution, which is then certified and sent to the Senate. The Clerk prepares a joint resolution to adjust the statutory limit on public debt after Congress adopts a concurrent resolution on the budget. The joint resolution is certified and sent to the Senate for further legislative action. The joint resolution includes a specific amendment to section 3101 of title 31, United States Code, with a dollar limitation based on the public debt level set forth in the relevant concurrent resolution. The report of the Committee on the Budget and the joint explanatory statement of the managers must clearly state the effect of the concurrent resolution. The House must have a clear statement on the impact of a joint resolution on the public debt limit. The House cannot consider a concurrent resolution or conference report unless it complies with the budget committee's requirements. This rule does not limit the House or Senate's power to pass bills changing the debt limit, nor does it affect members' rights regarding such bills. The term 'statutory limit on the public debt' refers to the maximum amount of obligations issued under US law that can be outstanding at any one time. The Government Accountability Office will study the impact of public debt on social service programs over a 75-year period and report findings to Congress annually. The Government Accountability Office will conduct a study on long-term debt."
