    "content": "In 2009, U.S. livestock and poultry exports were valued at over $10 billion, accounting for 12% of global meat trade. Some countries have implemented restrictions on imports of livestock and poultry products grown with antimicrobial drugs, potentially affecting U.S. exports. Legislation has been introduced in the United States to restrict the use of certain antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 965 and S. 1211 (Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011, PAMTA) aim to restrict the use of certain antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. U.S. livestock and poultry producers oppose these restrictions due to concerns about animal welfare, food safety, and potential production cost increases. The report discusses U.S. export markets for livestock and poultry products, foreign policies limiting antimicrobial drug use, and the implications for the U.S. livestock and poultry industry. The use of antimicrobials in U.S. livestock and poultry production is common, with data showing increasing usage in swine and poultry. Around 25%-30% of small cattle feedlots and 60%-70% of larger feedlots use antimicrobials, mainly through in-feed additives. The FDA reported sales and distribution of approved antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals in December 2010. The FDA reported sales and distribution of approved antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals for 2009, with some industry groups disputing the estimate. Antimicrobials are used for therapeutic, prophylactic, and subtherapeutic purposes in animal agriculture, improving growth rates, feed efficiency, and reducing mortality. Studies show that subtherapeutic antimicrobials have positively impacted producer incomes and per-animal net returns. The use of antimicrobial drugs in animal production has led to higher producer incomes and net returns. However, there is growing concern about antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, which can be transferred to humans through meat consumption. This issue is being actively reviewed by international organizations like the WHO, FAO, and OIE. The United States is involved in international efforts to address antimicrobial resistance in food-producing animals, working with organizations like the United Nations, OIE, and Codex Alimentarius Commission. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to phase out nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs. WHO has published global principles for containing antimicrobial resistance in animals. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 965 and S. 1211 (PAMTA) aim to restrict antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. Federal agencies support limiting nontherapeutic use. Policy options include user fees, bans, or restricting new antimicrobials for human use. U.S. authorities regulate antimicrobial use, similar to most trading partners. Policies on antimicrobials in food-producing animals are regulated by U.S. authorities and may also be regulated by trading partners. FDA oversees the use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock and poultry for meat consumption to prevent antibiotic resistance in humans. Regulations also cover residues of these drugs in meat tissues to ensure public health safety. The FDA and USDA regulate the use of antimicrobial drugs in meat and poultry products to prevent public health hazards for consumers. The focus is on setting tolerances, sampling products for compliance, and using antimicrobial washes and pathogen reduction treatments during packing and processing. Country restrictions on these processes are also considered. The report focuses on country restrictions on the use of certain antibiotics in feed for growth promotion in food-producing animals. The United States accounted for a significant portion of global trade in livestock and poultry products in 2009. U.S. beef exports have been variable since 2000, with a significant decline in 2003-2004 due to concerns about mad cow disease. By 2008, exports had recovered to nearly $3 billion worldwide, accounting for about 7% of total annual U.S. beef production. Mexico and Canada are the leading importers of U.S. beef. The total value of U.S. beef exports is significant, with Mexico and Canada being the top importers. Southeast Asian countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong also play a major role in U.S. beef exports. U.S. pork exports have shown steady growth, reaching nearly $4 billion in 2008. Japan is the largest importer of U.S. pork products, with Southeast Asian countries also contributing to the market. In 2008, U.S. pork exports accounted for nearly 40% of all exports annually, with leading markets including Hong Kong, Korea, China, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Mexico and Canada make up about one-fourth of annual exports, while the EU-27 nations account for about 3%. U.S. poultry exports doubled from $2.3 billion in 1998 to $4.6 billion in 2008, with Russia being the leading importer, followed by Ukraine. In 2008, U.S. pork exports were significant, accounting for nearly 40% of all exports annually, with top markets including Hong Kong, Korea, China, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Mexico and Canada make up about one-fourth of annual exports, while the EU-27 nations account for about 3%. U.S. poultry exports doubled from $2.3 billion in 1998 to $4.6 billion in 2008, with Russia being the leading importer, followed by Ukraine. Accounting for about 20% of annual exports, Ukraine imports another 3%. Southeast Asian countries like China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are also leading markets for U.S. poultry, making up about 20% of all exports. Mexico and Canada account for another one-fourth of exports, while exports to EU-27 nations total less than 4% annually. Growing concerns about antimicrobial resistance have led to restrictions and prohibitions on certain antimicrobials in animal production by some U.S. trading partners and competitors like the EU, New Zealand, and South Korea. The report focuses on country restrictions on certain antibiotics in feed for growth promotion in food-producing animals, particularly regarding antimicrobial washes and pathogen reduction treatments. The United States has had trade disputes with the EU over the use of these treatments, which are approved in the US but banned in the EU. Russia has also refused imports of meat due to concerns about antimicrobial residues. In 2008 and 2009, Russia refused imports of meat products from European countries and U.S. plants, including Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods, due to trace amounts of tetracycline and oxytetracycline found in pork. Different scenarios involving policies on antimicrobials and antibiotics in food animal production are highlighted, with the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue calling for a ban on non-therapeutic antibiotic use in food animals. The U.S. and its trading partners differ in their regulation of antimicrobials in food animal production. The U.S. and its trading partners have differences in policies regarding antimicrobial use in food animal production. The European Union prohibits the use of antibiotics for growth promotion to address antimicrobial resistance. The 2004 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office highlighted differences in specific drugs allowed for growth promotion and their availability to producers. These differences complicate comparisons between countries. The EU phased out antimicrobials for non-medicinal purposes as part of a broader regulation on feed additives in animal nutrition. The regulation covers various categories of additives and prohibited the use of antibiotics for growth promotion, with a resolution in 2011 calling for better control and an international ban on antimicrobials in animal feed. New Zealand has strict regulatory control over antimicrobials, similar to the EU's regulations. All antibiotics must be approved by the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and can only be used with a veterinary prescription. The country is working towards an international ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed. In New Zealand, antibiotics are strictly regulated and can only be used with a veterinary prescription. The country is moving towards an international ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed. In South Korea, restrictions on antibiotics in animal feed have been tightened, with the phasing out of certain drugs to reduce overall use. The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries has banned the addition of eight antibiotics and one antimicrobial agent in animal feed to enhance safety management of domestic livestock products. In the latter half of 2011, South Korea banned the use of certain antibiotics (tiamulin, apramycin, avilamycin, sulfathiazole) in animal feed as additives. This decision was notified to the WTO in August 2010 to protect trade in animal feed. Similar bans are being considered in other Southeast Asian countries like Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Comparisons with bans in the EU and New Zealand are complex. Some countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay may not use many antimicrobials in food-producing animals due to their livestock being mostly rangeland- or grass-fed. The United States, Canada, and Australia are actively reviewing and monitoring antimicrobial use in food animals. However, obtaining comprehensive information comparing policies across countries has been challenging for the GAO, with limited availability, reporting errors, and an inability to verify information independently. The GAO's report did not claim to provide a definitive summary on policies regarding antibiotics in animal feed across all selected countries. The GAO's 2004 report addressed the impact of antimicrobial use restrictions on U.S. trade. Key staff at USMEF and USDA confirmed the lack of consolidated information on country policies regarding antimicrobial use in animal feed. Additional country surveys were not conducted due to time constraints and procedural difficulties. The U.S. Trade Representative, USMEF, and U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council stated that antibiotic resistance from animal use has not significantly impacted U.S. meat trade. However, the GAO warned that future restrictions on these drugs in other countries like the EU, New Zealand, and South Korea could affect U.S. livestock and poultry exports. The potential trade implications of antimicrobial restrictions remain uncertain. The discussion focuses on potential trade implications of future restrictions on antimicrobial use in food animal production, specifically looking at two scenarios for U.S. livestock and poultry exports. Scenario 1 involves tightened restrictions in key export markets without changes in the U.S., while Scenario 2 considers tightened restrictions in key export markets with corresponding prohibitions in the U.S., potentially increasing meat exports. The potential impact of restrictions on antimicrobial use in food animal production in key U.S. export markets could lead to lower U.S. meat exports and reduced market share globally. Currently, few export markets have imposed such restrictions, with the EU and New Zealand having the strictest regulations. Despite this, industry-led quality assurance efforts allow for some U.S. meat exports to these markets, with only a small percentage of total exports going to the EU. Antimicrobials still allow for U.S. meat exports to some EU markets, but South Korea and other markets are considering restrictions. In U.S. beef markets, Korea is phasing in restrictions on antimicrobial use in feed. In U.S. pork and poultry export markets, none of the top five export markets in 2008 have restrictions in place or are actively considering prohibitions on antimicrobial use in feed for growth promotion. The top five U.S. pork export markets were Japan, Canada, Mexico, Russia, and Hong Kong, accounting for about 75% of all exports. The top five U.S. poultry export markets were Russia, China, Mexico, Canada, and the Ukraine, accounting for about 60% of all exports. Some countries like Canada, Japan, and Taiwan are reviewing their policies on antimicrobial use in feed, but no restrictions have been initiated yet. The U.S. Meat Export Federation has highlighted various technical and administrative issues regarding U.S. meat trade and the potential impact of future restrictions on antimicrobial use in feed on U.S. meat exports. Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical trade barriers pose challenges for U.S. meat exporters in global markets, including consumer concerns in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan about U.S. production practices. Issues include the use of antimicrobial drugs, growth hormones, GMOs, cloning, animal welfare, and environmental impact. Market access problems stem from restrictions like BSE, biotechnology, drug residues, labeling requirements, animal traceability, and food safety issues. USMEF's public comments address issues such as the H1N1 influenza virus and food safety. Uncertainty remains regarding the impact of South Korea's restrictions on future U.S. meat exports. Korea's restrictions may not ban all antibiotics, and it is unclear if imports from countries allowing prohibited animal drugs will be affected. Other trade issues between the U.S. and Korea could take precedence over antimicrobial drug use in feed. Korea's recent policy changes could impact trade in animal feed, with conflicting reports on the extent of these changes. Korea accounted for about 6% of trade based on 2008 data. Based on 2008 trade data, Korea accounted for about 6% of U.S. beef exports and 8% of U.S. pork exports. Higher-income Asian countries like Japan and Taiwan may follow South Korea's restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production, potentially impacting U.S. export markets. Consumers in these countries value premium quality meats and have heightened food safety concerns. The U.S. could lose export markets to these countries if antimicrobial drug use in food animal production is not restricted. In 2008, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan accounted for a significant share of U.S. beef and pork exports. Trade restrictions related to antimicrobial issues have been encountered in markets like Russia and the EU, affecting poultry exports. Russia banned poultry treated with chlorine rinses, while the EU restricts U.S. poultry exports due to the prohibition of antimicrobial rinses or pathogen reduction treatments. The EU is banning antimicrobial rinses on poultry, impacting U.S. exports. Other countries like New Zealand have similar restrictions. Competitors like Brazil and Argentina do not have these restrictions but may have animals less exposed to antimicrobials. This could give them an advantage in exports. Export competitors like the EU and major net-exporting countries are better positioned to capture a larger share of the global meat export market. Current production practices and regulations in these markets allow them to supply antibiotic-free meats, regardless of future policies. Some U.S. competitor markets may face capacity constraints, while countries like Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Uruguay, Brazil, and the EU have varying shares of the global meat export market. The EU and the United States were major players in global livestock and poultry exports in 2008. The U.S. accounted for 12% of global exports and had price-competitive meat exports. There were discussions about potential restrictions on antimicrobials in animal feed in the U.S. and its impact on global meat production and exports. If the U.S. restricts antimicrobials in animal feed for growth promotion, meat exports may increase due to rising consumer demand for antibiotic-free meats. The Non-Hormone-Treated Cattle (NHTC) Program certifies U.S. beef produced without growth hormones for export to the EU, initially facing low participation but gradually growing over time. The U.S. beef industry aims to increase market access under the EU quota limit despite lower exports compared to pre-ban levels. The industry believes that without the EU's hormone ban, exports to the EU would be higher. Additionally, the U.S. livestock and poultry industries have implemented quality assurance programs to address antimicrobial use. The Avian Pathologists, National Pork Board, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, American Feed Industry Association, and National Grain & Feed Association offer guidelines and programs for responsible antibiotic use in the poultry, pork, and beef industries to facilitate a transition to antimicrobial-free meat production in the United States. The transition to antimicrobial-free meat production in the United States could be accelerated if the use of antimicrobial drugs in feed for growth promotion is restricted. Livestock and poultry growers use these drugs to improve growth rates, feed efficiency, reduce mortality and morbidity, and enhance reproductive performance, leading to cost savings and increased producer incomes. Prohibiting the use of these drugs for growth promotion would likely increase costs for growers. Restricting the use of drugs for growth promotion in livestock could raise production costs for growers, potentially lowering U.S. meat production and reducing export supplies. This could lead to increased prices compared to competitors, eroding export market share. Transitioning to antibiotic-free meat production may initially decrease overall exports and market share in world markets. The potential impact of a worldwide ban on the use of drugs in animal feed for growth promotion on U.S. meat exports and market share is uncertain. The NHTC Program example may not accurately predict global market outcomes, as it only addresses U.S.-EU trade. Changes in import policies among key trading partners regarding antimicrobial use could affect trade flows, but the exact impact is difficult to quantify. Policy changes in some countries could impact U.S. meat trade, especially if they restrict livestock and poultry trade. Bills introduced in Congress aimed at limiting antibiotic use in agriculture have not been enacted. Top officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration support phasing out nontherapeutic uses of antimicrobials in food animal production, but industry groups oppose these bills due to concerns about animal welfare, food safety, and production costs. Some lawmakers question the scientific evidence supporting the claim that reducing antibiotic use in animal agriculture benefits public health. Lawmakers with poultry and meat industry constituents are likely to monitor import policy. Lawmakers are likely to monitor import policy changes regarding antimicrobial use in the poultry and meat industry, both internationally and domestically."
