    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10608.34 of the Water Code requires urban retail water suppliers to conduct standardized water loss audits following specific guidelines by the American Water Works Association. The process for validating a water loss audit report involves using a technical expert to confirm data entries and characterize data quality. Validation must adhere to AWWA guidelines and include the name and qualifications of the validator. Technical qualifications required for validation are also specified. The certification requirements for a person selected by an urban retail water supplier to validate its water loss audit report and the method of submitting the report to the department are outlined. The department will update rules based on the American Water Works Association's Manual M36 editions within six months. Urban retail water suppliers can use the Manual M36 or Free Water Audit Software until updated rules are adopted. Each urban retail water supplier must submit a water loss audit report annually by October 1, with the option for assistance in 2017. The board may provide funding for validation assistance. Reports must include steps taken to improve data validity and reduce water losses. The urban retail water supplier must have a chief financial officer, chief engineer, or general manager attest to each water loss audit report submitted to the department. Incomplete or unvalidated reports will be returned for resubmission within 90 days. Validated water loss audit reports will be posted on the department's website for public viewing. The department will provide technical assistance to urban retail water suppliers for water loss detection programs, including metering and pressure management techniques. The board will adopt rules by July 1, 2020, for urban water suppliers to meet performance standards for water loss, considering cost evaluations. A minimum allowable water loss threshold may exempt suppliers from further reduction requirements."
