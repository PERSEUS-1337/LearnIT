    "content": "Federal involvement in disaster housing dates back to the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927. Initially, federal assistance supported the American National Red Cross in providing housing and shelter. President Truman expanded this partnership in 1951 with Executive Order 10221, delegating disaster assistance to the Housing and Home Finance Administration. President Nixon later transferred emergency housing responsibilities to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which established the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration for disaster response and recovery programs. The FDAA was absorbed into FEMA in 1979. FEMA became part of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. The Robert T. Stafford Act authorizes temporary housing and disaster response activities. FEMA administers programs like the Individual and Households Program (IHP) to address unmet needs after disasters. FEMA utilizes Section 403 and Section 408 authorities to provide emergency sheltering and temporary housing assistance to disaster victims. These provisions are implemented by different units within FEMA, with Section 403 focusing on immediate threats to life and property. Emergency sheltering assistance provided by states and FEMA after a disaster includes debris removal, search and rescue services, emergency medical services, mass care, and various shelter options like mass shelters, cruise ships, emergency group sites, rental assistance, and supporting services. Emergency sheltering assistance under Section 403 of the Stafford Act is cost-shared between federal and state governments, with FEMA reimbursing states for services provided. This program is used for immediate housing of disaster victims without eligibility tests, typically in facilities near the affected area. Following Hurricane Katrina, Section 403 shelters were funded nationwide due to the extensive destruction and displacement of victims. FEMA issued specific guidance for states on eligibility for Section 403 assistance. After Hurricane Katrina, Section 403 sheltering aid was extended with a 100% federal share for emergency sheltering costs for states hosting FEMA evacuees for up to 12 months. FEMA and ANRC coordinated emergency mass care under a Memorandum of Understanding, previously responsible for ESF #6 - Mass Care in the National Response Plan. The NRP was the framework for federal disaster response, now expanded under the National Response Framework. Under the new National Response Framework, ESF #6 now includes housing and human services, with DHS/FEMA as the lead. The majority of shelters post-Katrina were managed by ANRC, along with state, local governments, and NGOs. The shared responsibility for mass care in the NRP was a change from the past FRP, where the Red Cross was the sole lead. The quantity and quality of emergency shelter space post-Katrina has been questioned. The availability and effectiveness of emergency shelter space post-Katrina have been criticized by various reports, including the House Select Bipartisan Committee's findings. The lack of a regional shelter database led to inefficient evacuation and sheltering processes. Despite detailed guidance from FEMA on eligible reimbursement costs, challenges in coordination were likened to building a Fortune 500 company in a short time frame. The Hurricane Katrina disaster strained the traditional shelter system, with emergency shelters intended to be temporary housing solutions. The Administration's decision to close shelters and move victims to more suitable housing by October 15, 2005, caused challenges for many families and individuals. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the mass shelter network housed over 273,000 evacuees, prompting the need for alternative housing options before FEMA registration. FEMA officials had considered using cruise ships as emergency shelters since 1989, but this had never been implemented. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA chose to use cruise ships as emergency shelters for victims and relief workers. The ships provided private rooms, feeding facilities, and the opportunity for victims to be involved in the rebuilding process. Despite some benefits, there were also disadvantages to housing victims and workers together. During Hurricane Katrina recovery, FEMA used cruise ships as emergency shelters for victims and workers. While providing housing and meals for over 8,000 people, critics questioned the cost and efficacy of the plan, highlighting competition for resources and concerns about the contract length and process. During Hurricane Katrina recovery, FEMA used cruise ships as emergency shelters for victims and workers. One notable step taken was the establishment of a child-care center on one of the Carnival ships, the Holiday, in collaboration with Save The Children and other corporate donors. The center served about 70 children daily, addressing the challenge of finding child care services as families sought to recover. During Hurricane Katrina recovery, FEMA used cruise ships as emergency shelters for victims and workers. A child-care center was established on one of the Carnival ships, serving about 70 children daily. Similar needs for child care services were seen at FEMA's emergency trailer parks on the Gulf Coast. The ANRC provides emergency housing, often reimbursed by FEMA, for disaster victims nationwide. During Hurricane Katrina recovery, FEMA utilized hotels and motels to provide short-term housing assistance to disaster evacuees and relief workers. Corporate Lodging Consultants managed the placement of victims in these facilities, working originally for the Red Cross and then FEMA. The process of finding suitable accommodations was less daunting compared to the Katrina experience due to the smaller scale of assistance provided. During Hurricane Katrina recovery, FEMA utilized hotels and motels to provide short-term housing assistance to disaster evacuees. Many residents self-evacuated to these establishments, resulting in a peak of 85,000 households housed across 48 states. This expanded program offered privacy and a chance for displaced victims to have their own space. The hotel/motel option provided displaced victims with private space and a discrete address. However, the deadline for moving out of shelters did not allow time to establish lodging cost protocols or explore alternative housing options. There is no evidence of previous state contracting for apartments for disaster victims under Section 403. FEMA's housing mission involves cooperation with states primarily for locating temporary housing sites and administering the Other Needs Assistance program for furniture, clothing, and related needs. Following the evacuation of Katrina victims to many states, some states rented apartments for evacuees, provided support like furnishings and food, and made rent payments reimbursed by FEMA under Section 403. Approximately 67,000 apartment leases were in 32 states at the peak of the operation. FEMA encouraged shorter leases if possible and solicited states to accept evacuees. States were asked to provide information on the number of evacuees they could accommodate, the start date, and location for receiving them. The potential hosting states were promised full reimbursement of their disaster related costs for accommodating Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Transitioning from shorter-term sheltering to longer-term housing assistance was challenging due to damage to housing stock. FEMA had to contact recipients of short-term assistance to determine eligibility for longer-term aid under Section 408, explaining the process and available housing options. Disaster victims had to be assured that the next form of housing assistance was available for those eligible, including rental assistance or manufactured housing. Eligibility for Section 408 assistance is determined by FEMA based on conditions like unlivable primary residence and financial hardship. Eligibility determinations are typically made by staff at FEMA's National Process Service Centers. The outreach mission after Hurricane Katrina involved coordinating with FEMA's on-site staff and housing inspectors to assist thousands of evacuees placed in hotel rooms and apartments across multiple states. Challenges included meeting shifting deadlines, conducting housing inspections in a timely manner, and organizing outreach teams to reach dispersed disaster victims. The outreach mission after Hurricane Katrina involved coordinating with FEMA's on-site staff and housing inspectors to assist evacuees. Teams were formed with personnel from CLC contractors, FEMA Community Relations staff, and regional FEMA offices. DHS/FEMA was contacted by the Refugee Council USA with a proposed plan to provide case management services to displaced residents from the Gulf Coast. Questions were raised about FEMA's authority to carry out such a program. The plan to transfer disaster victims from temporary housing to apartments paid with Section 408 rental assistance faced challenges and criticism. Reports of waste, fraud, and abuse within the program led to ongoing litigation involving FEMA, applicants, and public interest groups. Approximately 40,000 households had been moved from 403 to 408 funding by the end of 2006. FEMA's Section 408 housing program transfers disaster victims from temporary housing to apartments with rental assistance. Approximately 40,000 households were moved from 403 to 408 funding by the end of 2006. The program is federally funded and includes temporary housing and Other Needs Assistance. Rental/repair/replacement assistance and ONA costs are deducted from an overall cap of $28,800 per household. The Section 408 housing program provides rental assistance, repair assistance, and grants for replacement housing to disaster victims. The program has an overall cap of $28,800 per household, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Direct housing assistance for mobile homes and travel trailers is not deducted from this amount. The post-Katrina environment faced challenges due to a lack of available rental properties in the damaged area. Congress enacted a provision in the post-Katrina Reform Act to repair and improve multi-family rental properties in disaster areas. FEMA's definition of Fair Market Rent (FMR) includes the cost of utilities, but FEMA provides financial assistance based on FMR plus additional costs like transportation and utility hook-ups. FEMA's interpretation of utility costs for assistance has been amended by Congress, allowing utility costs to be eligible expenses. Federal aid is based on the assumption that temporary housing assistance recipients have not permanently lost employment or support. The Section 408 assistance provided is expected to be short-term, typically less than 18 months. Disasters are often localized within states and communities, with employment differences being the commuting distance from temporary housing locations. The challenge of maintaining employment is a key difference in disaster declarations like Hurricane Katrina. The unique circumstances of job loss on a large scale make it difficult to apply Section 408 authority to catastrophic disasters of this magnitude. Hurricane Katrina exceeded all previous experiences and statutory authority, especially considering the demographic profile of affected residents. The hurricane disproportionately impacted poor and minority communities, leading to more renters being affected. When Hurricane Katrina struck, Section 408 assistance provided up to $5,000 for housing repairs to make homes habitable for victims who were often poor and had little support. Homeowners could also receive up to $10,000 for a replacement home if their home was destroyed, particularly beneficial for mobile home owners without adequate insurance. FEMA traditionally uses mobile homes for temporary housing in such situations. FEMA uses mobile homes and travel trailers for disaster victims when home repair or rental units are not available. Mobile homes are larger and for longer-term housing needs, while travel trailers are smaller and used for shorter-term housing. Travel trailers are not classified as housing but as transportation. HUD does not have standards for trailers like it does for mobile homes, which are considered housing. FEMA regulations allow trailers to be placed in flood plains temporarily, while mobile homes cannot. Manufactured housing can become permanent for occupants based on the Stafford Act. During post-Katrina recovery, FEMA provided manufactured housing as a last resort for those with no other housing options. Approximately 80% of these dwellings were placed on private lots in the Gulf Coast, indicating widespread damage after the 2005 hurricanes. Despite FEMA's preference for home repairs or rental assistance, catastrophic disasters like Katrina limit options and slow down recovery efforts. Manufactured housing became the primary means of providing temporary housing in Gulf Coast communities after Hurricane Katrina and Rita. FEMA purchased a total of 145,699 travel trailers and mobile homes in response to Hurricane Katrina, costing a significant amount. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA purchased 145,699 travel trailers and mobile homes at a cost of $2.7 billion. Complaints about formaldehyde issues in the units arose early in the recovery period, with reports of irritating fumes causing health problems for residents. On July 19, 2007, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on formaldehyde issues in FEMA trailers. Witnesses testified about health problems experienced by residents in the manufactured housing provided by FEMA, highlighting disagreements within FEMA on how to address the health threats. FEMA field staff urged immediate action to address high levels of formaldehyde in trailers. FEMA officials refused to test occupied FEMA trailers despite evidence of high formaldehyde levels. FEMA Administrator David Paulison testified that an investigation was underway in June 2007 on the formaldehyde issue. The inquiry into formaldehyde involved various federal agencies and industry representatives. FEMA and CDC were set to begin a study in the Gulf Coast, but actual testing of trailer units by the CDC was delayed for five months. This delay raised concerns about the recognition of the need for testing and potential influence on results. The CDC found high levels of formaldehyde in FEMA trailers used as temporary housing for disaster victims, leading to accusations of downplaying health risks for liability concerns. Rep. Brad Miller accused FEMA of prioritizing public embarrassment and legal liability over residents' health. FEMA announced steps to relocate victims following the CDC's findings. FEMA is taking steps to relocate disaster victims from manufactured housing to rental units or alternative housing due to high formaldehyde levels in trailers. A master complaint has been filed against FEMA and manufacturers for health risks. FEMA will no longer use travel trailers in light of this information. FEMA will no longer use travel trailers due to high formaldehyde levels. Mobile homes regulated by HUD can still be used for disaster victims. Air quality will be tested independently. Assistance for rapid relocation will incur additional costs. Limited rental units in the disaster area pose a challenge. DHS Secretary Chertoff emphasized the need for families in travel trailers to move out due to housing shortages and health concerns like formaldehyde. The government will assist in facilitating relocation efforts. FEMA will facilitate relocation efforts for families in travel trailers, considering whether to compel people to move out. On-site inspections are crucial for determining housing assistance eligibility, but after Hurricane Katrina, geo-spatial mapping was used when inspections were not possible due to standing water. After Hurricane Katrina, geo-spatial mapping was used to determine likely damage in areas where on-site inspections were not possible due to standing water. This method was fast and practical but lacked detail for personal losses. The viability of neighborhoods could not be determined solely through on-site inspection reports, as they did not assess neighborhood-wide conditions such as accessibility to community resources and operational infrastructure components. In Public Law 109-295, the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 directed FEMA to develop a disaster housing strategy. Despite delays, a draft report was submitted to Congress in July 2008, with a 60-day public comment period initiated. The strategy defers decisions to a \"National Disaster Housing Task Force\" for implementation. The analysis of the draft strategy found that FEMA proposes creating a new entity to handle most disaster housing responsibilities instead of submitting plans for required improvements. The strategy emphasizes the roles of partners like state and local governments, NGOs, and the private sector, with less focus on the federal role in catastrophic events. It is suggested that the strategy should directly address how it would handle catastrophic events. The draft housing strategy by FEMA includes collaborations with HUD, temporary housing options, and the use of travel trailers as a last resort. FEMA has taken actions like establishing the Disaster Housing Assistance Program and reversing the decision on travel trailers due to safety concerns. The Louisiana state government requested FEMA to pay \"impact fees\" to encourage outer parishes to accept mobile homes or travel trailers after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA had previously supported the concept of temporary sites by providing assistance such as setting up laundry facilities and helping expand sewer capacity in trailer parks during disasters. These actions were ad hoc decisions made by field leadership, not official policy. In November 2005, FEMA housing staff in Louisiana created a \"supporting services\" listing to encourage local support for trailer parks. FEMA considered providing assistance to the hosting community, including road repair, traffic management, and public works. A proposal for this was not adopted, but FEMA continued to review suggestions. In mid-December 2005, FEMA sent out a two-page memo offering potential help for fire and safety forces in trailer parks. The delay in decision-making and limited reach of the final decision led to increased reluctance from local officials to host trailer parks. FEMA's leadership based its decision on the Stafford Act, which allows the President to provide temporary housing units. FEMA's interpretation of its limited authority to support temporary housing communities extends to services within the sites as well. Additional services like recreational facilities or educational opportunities are considered beyond Stafford Act authorities, as they are meant to be temporary sites. Providing amenities and services may lead to transforming a temporary site into something more permanent, hindering the transition process for residents. FEMA's limited support for temporary housing communities does not extend to helping residents transition to permanent housing. The agency provides basic necessities like trailers, water, and electricity for up to 18 months, expecting residents to obtain additional assistance from charities. FEMA's reluctance to partner with charitable groups hinders the provision of extra services at sites like Renaissance Village in Baker, Louisiana. Residents at temporary housing communities like Renaissance Village must now rely on themselves or charities for everything else as FEMA does not want them to get too comfortable. Concerns have been raised about the lack of community services for the nearly 370 children under 12 living there. Some argue that services like recreational opportunities and child care are essential, while others believe they contradict the goal of providing minimal or temporary housing. Representative Norton acknowledged the complexity of the issue in a hearing of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. Representative Norton emphasized that FEMA should provide transportation to connect temporary housing residents with surrounding communities where services exist, rather than creating isolated \"villages.\" Issues with utility restoration in New Orleans delayed the installation of temporary housing for Katrina victims, as Entergy, the city's last Fortune 500 company, faced financial difficulties. FEMA's contractors struggled to keep up with requests for housing units due to the lack of utilities, creating a \"chicken and egg\" situation. The lag time on utility restoration in post-Katrina communities created challenges in determining priorities for housing units and neighborhood schools. Local leadership and FEMA's partnerships are crucial in resolving these issues and ensuring an effective transition for the community. Placement of temporary manufactured housing is also a concern, with regulations prohibiting placement in flood plains. FEMA regulations prohibit mobile homes in flood plains, hindering housing for Katrina victims. Travel trailers are allowed in vulnerable areas but must be strapped down, limiting mobility. Balancing housing proximity and safety is a complex dilemma. The CDC found high formaldehyde levels in travel trailers and mobile homes, prompting FEMA to reconsider their use for disaster victims' housing. While FEMA may still use mobile homes meeting safety standards, travel trailers will no longer be utilized. Questions arise about the alternative housing options and the impact of FEMA's policies on resettlement decisions at state and local levels. FEMA plays a significant role in community rebuilding after disasters, but local decision-making is crucial for accelerating the process. Infrastructure repair, debris removal, and mitigation projects depend on choices made by state and local governments. Delays in key decisions, such as cost-share waivers, can hinder progress in rebuilding efforts. The experience of FEMA and its partners in disaster housing programs highlighted challenges in achieving equity among a diverse population receiving varying levels of assistance. Concerns included ensuring fairness in assistance distribution and managing resources effectively. Some individuals who applied for Section 408 aid through traditional FEMA processes were already using up funds, causing delays in processing. Suggestions to address equity issues in FEMA disaster housing include excluding initial housing costs from legislative caps. This change would ensure all applicants start with the same resources but may increase costs. Additionally, charitable groups also provided assistance to some families and individuals. The Stafford Act limits disaster victims' choice in housing assistance, requiring them to generally accept the first offer. FEMA regulations emphasize accepting aid or risking benefits forfeiture. Government officials face decisions on allocating over $10 billion for Katrina victims' human services. The Stafford Act limits disaster victims' housing choices, with government officials facing decisions on allocating funds for housing assistance. The goal of the housing mission is questioned, whether to place families close to their original residences or house as many people economically as possible in catastrophic situations. The aid offered may not always align with the needs of those affected by natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. After Hurricane Katrina, those stranded in New Orleans were treated like criminals, confined to shelters and transported to over forty states without choice. Housing vouchers may not facilitate a quick return or meet victims' desires, but they offer more options for better housing. After Hurricane Katrina, victims were provided rental assistance in the form of cash to meet housing needs and other disaster-related expenses. Housing vouchers issued by HUD offer choice, mobility, and accountability through relationships with landlords. After Hurricane Katrina, victims were provided rental assistance in the form of cash to meet housing needs and other disaster-related expenses. The distinction between cash grants and vouchers becomes more complicated in disaster situations, with cash grants providing ultimate discretion and vouchers being more directed towards housing resources. The speed of the evacuation after Katrina made choice a moot point, as there were no housing resources in the flooded city. The evacuation after Hurricane Katrina was swift, leaving evacuees with no choice in destination. However, transportation funds were provided for families to reunite at their chosen location. The issue of choice in disaster housing law and policy, including incentives for hosting temporary housing sites, remains a topic of consideration. Congress introduced flexibility by allowing for \"semi-permanent housing\" in the Post-Katrina Act. Hosting communities may already have incentives due to the economic benefits they receive. FEMA should have defined authority to make temporary housing sites more supportive of community spirit and recovery. There has been confusion post-Katrina on who can provide additional help for these communities. Support for group trailer sites could be a key contribution by state and local governments. FEMA had its own manufactured housing storage sites for two decades. In 1995, FEMA's Reinventing Government Committee recommended closing manufactured housing storage sites in Texas and Kentucky, selling units for local purchasing as needed. This was due to the challenges of maintaining units exposed to nature and age, as well as repeated travel to disaster sites. The committee noted that most temporary housing in the early 1990s was provided through home repairs and rental assistance, citing the Northridge earthquake as a costly disaster where these options were more useful. The recommendation to close manufactured housing storage sites in Texas and Kentucky was adopted, leading to the auctioning off and dispersal of remaining units. This decision resulted in FEMA officials having to make quick and costly purchases of housing units. Changes in disaster assistance programs, such as reducing home repair grants and eliminating the Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program, pushed FEMA towards providing direct housing assistance through manufactured housing. The cap on housing repair was a significant part of DMA2K, P.L. 106-390, leading to savings in temporary housing expenditures estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The $5,000 cap on housing repair was a point of contention since its imposition in 2000, but it has now been removed by the Post-Katrina Act. This cap was in place during Katrina and for a year after, leading to the priority use of manufactured housing due to the limited funds available for repairs. FEMA's original plan for housing strategy solutions after Hurricane Katrina included the concept of \"transitional communities\" to provide temporary housing for disaster victims. Vouchers offer some freedom of choice for displaced applicants, but may not fully reconstitute rental housing options in a heavily impacted area like southern Louisiana. The plan for transitional communities as temporary housing solutions for disaster victims post-Katrina was not acted upon by FEMA/DHS leadership. However, the concept was seen as a promising avenue to supplement housing needs by the Director of the Office of Recovery and Renewal for the State of Mississippi. Despite initial opposition, subsequent congressional action on \"Katrina Cottages\" and alternative housing indicates a policy shift towards considering semi-permanent housing developments. The concept of \"Katrina Cottages\" and alternative housing represents a policy shift towards viewing temporary housing as a precursor to semi-permanent or permanent housing. Following Hurricane Katrina, there were individuals ineligible for traditional federal assistance programs, leading to them becoming wards of the community that accepted them as evacuees. HUD did provide voucher assistance in some cases. HUD provided voucher assistance for individuals ineligible for traditional federal assistance programs after Hurricane Katrina. Congress may consider exploring the needs of these applicants in future disasters to determine appropriate assistance methods. Previously homeless individuals and families may return to their pre-disaster status, potentially becoming homeless again if not supported by local government and social services. The KDHAP-SN program provided resources for previously homeless families in disaster areas, highlighting the need for collaboration between FEMA and HUD to establish general policies for post-disaster assistance. The Administration announced the extension of disaster temporary housing assistance through March 2009, with HUD managing the new Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) using FEMA resources. Differences between the former FEMA program and the new HUD-managed program were noted, including requirements for evacuees continuing in the program. Evacuees in the program must sign up with a designated case manager and start paying $50 monthly towards rent in March 2008. The amount will increase monthly until the program ends in March 2009. The extension of the program beyond the Stafford Act limit has been justified as necessary due to \"extraordinary circumstances.\" DHAP program responsibility has been transferred to HUD as recommended in a White House report. The White House staff recommended that HUD be designated as the lead agency for temporary housing for disaster victims, while DHS should coordinate the overall disaster response. This decision may conflict with the congressional directive for FEMA to establish a pilot program for rental housing assistance. FEMA Administrator believes repairing rental units is appropriate. The FEMA Administrator contends that repairing rental units is HUD's responsibility, not FEMA's. The \"Road Home\" program in Louisiana aims to rebuild communities using various funding sources. FEMA has raised concerns about the program not aligning with the Stafford Act. The dispute between FEMA and the State of Louisiana revolves around the use of Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds in the \"Road Home\" program to ensure safer housing and reduce future disaster risks. FEMA emphasizes the preventive nature of these funds, but there is uncertainty about the extent of agreement on incorporating mitigation measures in home repairs. Louisiana seeks federal funding based on the number of homes damaged, while the federal government argues that assistance was intended for mitigation purposes. The federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina focused on providing help for flooding victims, not homeowners who lost their homes to hurricane force winds. Congress may review how mortgages were handled during the recovery phase. Lenders offered payment suspensions and other allowances to help homeowners keep their homes while funding interim housing needs. HUD's FHA issued a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for FHA-insured loans in hurricane-affected areas, extending it twice for FEMA-eligible areas due to the extensive storm damage. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina saw special steps taken by Fannie Mae to help homeowners affected by the storm. They authorized loan servicers to modify loan terms, placed a one-year moratorium on foreclosures in the most damaged areas, and asked credit agencies not to report mortgage payment delinquencies. Congress may evaluate the actions of FHA and Fannie Mae in response to the disaster. The MRA program under the Stafford Act, which assisted victims with mortgages and rents after disasters, was removed due to administrative complexities. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to restore this program. The \"Katrina Cottages\" program emerged from the creative response to the catastrophic event, offering alternative housing with more space, attractive design, and hurricane resistance. Congress authorized a trial program to evaluate different versions of these dwellings across the Gulf Coast, potentially replacing FEMA's current use of manufactured housing. The post-Katrina Act references \"semi-permanent\" housing, potentially allowing the use of cottages. The $400 million pilot program has faced controversy over the selection process. A report by the DHS Inspector General highlighted disparities in funding distribution. The Katrina Cottages program is being studied for its impact and potential replication in other disaster scenarios by the Joint Housing Solutions Group established by FEMA. The Joint Housing Solutions Group (JHSG) consists of building science experts from NIBS and FEMA specialists exploring innovative factory-built housing options. They are focusing on indoor air quality hazards in FEMA-provided temporary housing units and developing assessment tools for alternative housing. The JHSG's work may contribute to FEMA's promised Disaster Housing Strategy to be presented to Congress in April 2008. Congress has typically addressed disaster situations on an ad hoc basis due to unique requirements and the need for supplemental appropriations. This involves crafting legislation to fund specific programs and waiving certain provisions to aid in disaster response and recovery efforts. Options for incorporating disaster relief policies into standing law to expedite the recovery process are discussed. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina highlighted the challenges of implementing disaster relief programs on a national scale. A catastrophic disaster tier could be triggered by factors such as the number of potential applicants, estimated damage, disruptions to government continuity, and widespread population dispersal. This tier would address issues like the ability of residents to return, employment center destruction, and the time residents are away from their homes. Some states argue for waivers of cost-shares and regulations in non-catastrophic events, pointing to their limitations. The Stafford Act gives the President discretionary authority for disaster declarations, but additional guidance may be needed for catastrophic events. Policy areas for disaster relief programs could receive attention. One approach to disaster housing after \"worst case\" events is to implement an automatic FEMA sheltering/housing program for all victims, with assistance starting when the system can handle the influx. The program's duration could be extended to nine or 12 months, depending on government resources. Congress could also consider a special voucher program for catastrophic events, administered by HUD for six-to-18 months. A special six-to-18 month voucher program administered by HUD could be implemented for disaster victims, separate from HUD Section 8. This program would tap into existing resources like local public housing authorities to provide case management and longer-term housing aid for victims. The current FEMA temporary housing program has high costs and complications, making the HUD approach a potentially more efficient solution. FEMA and HUD should consider linking housing aid for major disaster declarations to address long-term challenges. The debate arises whether FEMA or individuals should handle long-term housing. Congress must weigh if disaster victims deserve more housing assistance than those waiting for help. The voucher approach raises fairness concerns due to long HUD voucher waiting lists. Specific language defining community housing is needed for FEMA or HUD based on the Katrina experience. FEMA and HUD require specific language defining community housing to provide necessary support services for temporary housing group sites. Congress may need to decide on prohibiting inducements. Clarification on responsibilities and contributions for quality temporary housing sites is essential to avoid confusion and expedite post-disaster actions. One difficulty in disaster recovery is that affected governments may struggle to provide supportive services. FEMA should have flexibility to address this issue case-by-case. Non-profits and charitable groups could be encouraged to help with disaster housing policies. The Mortgage and Rental Assistance program was missing in Katrina response, but alternatives like FHA and Fannie Mae could make it unnecessary. It is uncertain if similar actions can be expected for smaller disasters. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to restore a program within the Stafford Act that could be run cooperatively with FEMA by another department or agency. Congress could provide expanded authority for agency heads to issue automatic waivers following a catastrophic event, which could accelerate early response work and recovery operations. This could involve waivers or streamlining of regulations related to debris removal, environmental preservation, and historic preservation. The Stafford Act allows for waivers of cost-share commitments by state governments during disasters, with FEMA using its authority to waive administrative conditions. These waivers could be automatically triggered by catastrophic events to expedite recovery efforts. Sections 406 and 407 of Public Assistance can be adjusted to a 90/10 cost-share for large-impact disasters. The Stafford Act allows for waivers of cost-share commitments by state governments during disasters, with FEMA using its authority to waive administrative conditions. Large disasters with a per capita cost over $117 per state resident may qualify for a 90/10 cost-share. Debris removal costs are often waived for a 72-hour period after a disaster, but for Katrina, they were waived indefinitely. Congress may consider extending the 90/10 cost-share to Other Needs Assistance (ONA) and making ONA 100% federal assistance for events involving multiple states. Legislation has already been passed to provide this waiver for Gulf Coast states affected by Katrina. The state may administer a block-grant program for eligible disaster costs, even for non-catastrophic events. A cost-share requirement ensures responsible project selection and prioritization by the state, leading to better quality and quantity of projects submitted for supplemental help. The policy question of which federal agency should be responsible for catastrophic disaster housing arises. Should HUD manage the longer-term housing/sheltering program through state and local housing authorities and NGOs? This approach may work for large events but could be problematic for smaller disasters where resources are limited. Alternatively, HUD could leverage its relationships with PHAs. The Administration announced a plan for FEMA and HUD to collaborate on providing housing to Katrina victims beyond the August 2007 deadline. The housing strategy post-Katrina was driven by size, time, and circumstance, with decisions made by FEMA, DHS, and the Administration. The efficacy of transitioning the housing mission to HUD may be tested based on previous Katrina experience. The federal government's response to the largest natural disaster in U.S. history involved using traditional FEMA housing programs due to the lack of expanded authorities requested by the Administration. While some aspects of the plan, like rental housing, were successful, the reliance on mobile homes and travel trailers was not suitable for the scale and location of the disaster. FEMA's approach to disaster temporary housing has evolved over the years, influenced by the nature and location of large disasters. The federal government's response to the largest natural disaster in U.S. history involved using traditional FEMA housing programs. The shifting emphasis in temporary housing response to Katrina reflected a need for a more definitive approach. Despite challenges, thousands of families received significant aid for housing, with over $10 billion spent on housing for the Gulf Coast hurricane season of 2005. FEMA and other agencies struggled to address the unprecedented event. The response to Hurricane Katrina involved challenges in communicating housing policy decisions to a dispersed population. Various governmental and non-governmental staff provided assistance through temporary housing programs, but these programs were severely challenged by the unprecedented disaster. New partnerships were formed, and federal resources were provided, though not always effectively utilized. Different approaches were considered but often rejected in favor of familiar methods, highlighting the need for tailored responses to catastrophic events. Effective leadership and carefully drawn legislation can help distinguish between extraordinary and common events in housing policy decisions. Congress continues to debate long-term recovery roles post-Katrina, considering program adjustments and the appropriate governmental role in future disasters. Appendix A discusses the involvement of HUD and other federal agencies in providing housing aid post-Katrina. The Katrina Disaster Housing Assistance Program (KDHAP) was managed by HUD through an inter-agency agreement, assisting citizens who had previously received HUD housing assistance. Cooperation between FEMA and HUD was inconsistent, leading Congress to transfer funding to HUD for this purpose. The funding for housing aid post-Katrina was transferred to HUD, renaming the program to the Disaster Voucher Program (DVP). Cooperation between FEMA and HUD could improve awareness of housing options and reduce fraud. HUD Section 8 vouchers have been suggested as a solution for evacuees, with the Northridge earthquake response cited as an efficient example. FEMA provided over $140 million in immediate housing help to over 47,000 households after the earthquake. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) provides long-term housing assistance to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita victims, with $390 million in funding from Congress. Administered by local Public Housing Authorities, the program is set to conclude on September 30, 2007. The Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) was created in April 2007 to provide long-term housing assistance to Hurricane Katrina and Rita victims. HUD took over management of the rental program while FEMA continued to manage the manufactured housing program. The program was set to conclude on September 30, 2007, but may be extended depending on Congress's reaction to a proposed plan. The DHAP housing program, including rental and trailer/mobile home programs, provided information, services, and resources to prepare for the end of temporary housing. HUD, along with other federal entities like the Department of Agriculture and Fannie Mae, offered housing assistance through inter-agency agreements. Some available houses were beneficial, while others were too remote for disaster victims. Consideration of proximity to home or new opportunities is crucial for assessing housing resources. FEMA has been assigned the task of managing these housing resources. FEMA, along with HUD and other federal agencies, is working on a National Housing Strategy following P.L. 109-295. Fannie Mae, a private company with a mission to increase home ownership, provided 1,500 properties for temporary housing after Hurricane Katrina. Nearly 4,600 evacuees were housed in Fannie Mae properties for up to 18 months. Fannie Mae provided temporary housing for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina, offering rent-free properties in 20 states. They also offered $15,000 for down payment assistance to evacuee families interested in purchasing Fannie Mae-owned homes. 80 families have taken advantage of this assistance so far. The Legal Aid Society of Alameda County sued FEMA over eligibility for temporary housing assistance after the earthquake in the Bay Area. FEMA judged applicants living in SROs ineligible, but the lawsuit resulted in a settlement for financial resources to help restore housing stock. The settlement for $23 million funded 2,200 SRO units after a lawsuit over FEMA eligibility for temporary housing assistance. The funds were provided in a block grant fashion to local agencies, allowing them flexibility in deciding how to use the money. Around 1,200 to 1,500 units were rebuilt using lawsuit funds, with buildings sold to non-profit groups due to restrictions on FEMA funds for private developers. In south Florida, after Hurricane Andrew, many residents were deemed ineligible for FEMA housing assistance due to lack of proof of residency. FEMA collaborated with local agencies to address homelessness by establishing a tent city with various support services. However, the tent city was closed due to weather vulnerabilities. A plan to expand shelter bed availability was approved, with FEMA funds supporting continued services and new projects for post-Andrew recovery efforts. FEMA funds are being used to expand services and start new projects to address post-Andrew needs."
