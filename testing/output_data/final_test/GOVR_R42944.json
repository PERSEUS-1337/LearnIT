    "content": "The \"fiscal cliff\" in 2012 was averted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013. This Act prevented many of the impending spending cuts and revenue increases that could have led to a recession in 2013. Title VI of the Act extended provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, increasing provider payments and funding for expiring programs. Title VI of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, increasing provider payments and funding for expiring programs, including higher physician fee schedule payments, Medicare hospital payments, and Medicare managed care programs. Other health programs like the qualifying individual program were also extended. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, including higher physician fee schedule payments, Medicare hospital payments, and Medicare managed care programs. Other health programs extended by the ATRA include the QI program, TMA program, Medicaid and CHIP express lane option, family-to-family health information centers, and special diabetes programs. Changes were made to federal health programs resulting in savings to the federal budget, including modifications to documentation and coding for inpatient hospital services and changes in payment for certain radiology services. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, including adjustments to therapy service treatments, equipment utilization rate in advanced imaging services payments, coding intensity for Medicare managed care plans, revisions to ESRD bundled payment system, competitive prices for diabetic supplies, non-emergency ambulance transports for ESRD beneficiaries, and identification of overpayments to providers within five years. Other ATRA sections have minimal impact on direct spending, such as repealing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports program and establishing a Commission on Long-Term Care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the health provisions in H.R. 8 will increase direct spending by $800 million over ten years. This includes the \"doc fix\" and various health-related extensions totaling $29.3 billion in direct spending. The other health provisions result in offsets, leaving only $800 million in additional spending. The report provides descriptions of the health-related provisions in Title VI of the ATRA, including common acronyms for public laws. The Sustainable Growth Rate system determines annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system was established to control spending for physicians' services under the Medicare fee schedule. If expenditures exceed targets, future updates are reduced to align spending with the target. Actual expenditures began exceeding targets in 2002, leading to a growing discrepancy each year. Congress has enacted adjustments, except for a 4.8% decrease in 2002. The SGR system was established to control spending for physicians' services under the Medicare fee schedule. Congress has enacted laws to override reductions, except for a 4.8% decrease in 2002. A provision in 2013 averted a 26.5% reduction in Medicare physician fee schedule payments. The Physician Quality Reporting System rewards professionals for reporting quality data to CMS. The provision allows eligible professionals participating in a qualified clinical data registry to meet quality reporting requirements for PQRS. The Secretary must establish registry requirements, consult with stakeholders, and ensure transparency and quality improvement initiatives. Measures in the registry may be endorsed by NQF, not subject to multi-stakeholder group selection. GAO conducts a study on the registry requirements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to conduct a study on clinical data registries' potential to improve Medicare care quality and efficiency. The CBO scores for Medicare physician payment update override and qualified clinical data registries advancement are $21.1 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and $25.2 billion for FY2013-FY2022, and $100 million for both five- and ten-year periods, respectively. Geographic adjustments in the Medicare physician fee schedule reflect differences in physician service costs. The Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) are used in the Medicare physician fee schedule to adjust payment rates based on regional cost differences. A temporary floor value of 1.00 on the physician work index was set from January 2004 to December 31, 2012, and extended through December 31, 2013 by the ATRA provision. The CBO score is $500 million for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. BBA97 established annual per beneficiary payment limits for Medicare-covered outpatient therapy services. The BBA97 established annual per beneficiary payment limits for Medicare-covered outpatient therapy services, initially set at $1,500 and later increased to $1,880 in 2012. The DRA re-implemented the limits in 2006 with an exceptions process for medically necessary services. The MCTRJCA set the annual threshold at $3,700 for therapy services in 2012, applicable to services in physicians' offices and hospital outpatient departments. The ATRA provision extended the limits through December 31, 2013. The ATRA provision extends the exceptions process through December 31, 2013, applies the cap and threshold to therapy services in hospital outpatient departments and Critical Access Hospitals, and mandates manual medical review for therapy services exceeding a $3,700 threshold. The CBO score is $700 million for FY2013 and $300 million for FY2017, totaling $1 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Bonus payments are provided for ground ambulance services. The SSA provides bonus payments for ground ambulance services in qualified rural areas. Super rural areas with low population densities receive a 22.6% payment increase. Medicare rates for ground ambulance services were increased by 3% for rural areas and 2% for other areas from July 1, 2008, to January 1, 2013. Urban areas designated as rural on December 31, 2006, also receive rural payments for air ambulance services. ACA directed MedPAC to study temporary add-on payments' appropriateness. The Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) studied the appropriateness of temporary add-on payments for ambulance services, voted to let them expire, and proposed adjustments to the fee schedule to target payments in rural areas. The ATRA provision extended urban, rural, and super rural ambulance add-on payments until January 1, 2014. The air ambulance provision is extended until July 1, 2013. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on ambulance services cost reports by October 1, 2013, and feasibility of obtaining cost data from all ambulance providers by July 1, 2014. CBO score is $100 million for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. Low-volume adjustment for hospital payment was established in SSA \u00a71886(d)(12) starting FY2005. The low-volume hospital payment adjustment in SSA \u00a71886(d)(12) began in FY2005, allowing for up to a 25% increase based on cost per case and volume. Hospitals with fewer than 200 total discharges more than 25 road miles from another like hospital received the full adjustment. ACA \u00a73125 temporarily modified this adjustment for FY2011 and FY2012 for hospitals with fewer than 1,600 Medicare discharges more than 15 road miles away. The low-volume hospital payment adjustment in SSA \u00a71886(d)(12) began in FY2005, allowing for up to a 25% increase based on cost per case and volume. Hospitals with fewer than 1,600 Medicare discharges more than 15 road miles away received about $400 million for the low volume adjustment in FY2011. This adjustment is extended through September 30, 2013, with a CBO score of $300 million for FY2013-FY2017 and $300 million for FY2013-FY2022. The MDH designation for small rural hospitals with a high proportion of Medicare patients was extended through September 30, 2013, with higher payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system. The CBO score is $100 million for FY2013-FY2017 and $100 million for FY2013-FY2022. Additionally, the MMA established Special Needs Plans (SNPs) for individuals with special needs in Medicare Advantage coordinated care plans. The ACA and ATRA provisions extended Special Needs Plans (SNPs) authority through December 31, 2014, allowing SNPs to target enrollment for individuals with special needs. The CBO score is $300 million for FY2013-FY2017 and $300 million for FY2013-FY2022. Reasonable cost plans are Medicare managed care plans reimbursed by Medicare for actual costs. Cost plans are Medicare managed care plans reimbursed by Medicare for actual costs. The BBA97 included a provision to phase-out reasonable cost contracts, but the phase-out has been delayed through congressional action. The ATRA provision extended the length of time reasonable cost plans can operate until January 1, 2014, regardless of other MA plans in the area. The CBO score is between $50 million and \u2212 $50 million for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. MIPPA \u00a7183 requires this extension. The ATRA provision extends funding for a contract with a consensus-based entity through FY2013 and amends its duties. CMS has established value-based purchasing initiatives in Medicare to incentivize providers for meeting quality goals. The ATRA provision requires the Secretary to develop a strategy to provide performance improvement data to Medicare providers, including feedback on quality data and utilization data. The strategy must consider factors like provider type and risk adjustment methods. The Secretary must submit the strategy to Congress within one year and update it based on stakeholder feedback within 18 months. GAO is required to conduct a study on private benchmarks within eight months. The GAO is mandated to study private sector performance improvement data sharing activities, including how Medicare and private entities share data with providers. The CBO score for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022 is between $50 million and \u2212 $50 million. MIPPA \u00a7119 allocated $25 million for low-income Medicare beneficiary outreach and education activities for FY2008 and FY2009 through programs like SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and AoA. ACA \u00a73306 extended these programs and provided an additional $45 million for outreach programs like Medicare Part D low income subsidy and the Medicare Savings Program. The ATRA provision extends MIPPA \u00a7119 authorities through FY2013 and appropriates funds for low-income Medicare beneficiary outreach programs. This includes $7.5 million for SHIPs, $7.5 million for AAAs, $5 million for ADRCs, and $5 million for the National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment. The BBA97 required states to pay Medicare Part B premiums for Qualifying Individuals (QIs) with income between 120% and 135% of the Federal Poverty Limit, with Medicaid payment for QIs funded through an annual transfer from the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. States receive 100% federal funding to pay QIs. The ATRA provision reauthorizes the QI program through December 2013 with $485 million allocated for FY2013 and $300 million for FY2014. States receive 100% federal funding to pay QIs' Medicare premiums up to the federal allocation. The CBO score is $0.6 billion for FY2013 and $0.2 billion for FY2014. States are required to continue Medicaid benefits for certain low-income families through transitional medical assistance (TMA). The Family Support Act of 1988 expanded work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) to provide coverage for families losing Medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal support collections, earned income, or employment hours. The ATRA provision extends work-related TMA through December 31, 2013, with a CBO score of $0.6 billion. CHIPRA created an \"Express Lane\" eligibility option for states to rely on specified agencies for determining child eligibility. The ATRA provision allows states to use \"Express Lane\" eligibility determinations for Medicaid or CHIP until September 30, 2014. It also extends funding for Family-to-Family Health Information Centers through FY2013. The CBO score for these provisions ranges from $50 million to -$50 million for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. The ATRA provision extends funding for diabetes-related programs through FY2013, with annual appropriations of $150 million. The programs include research grants for Type I diabetes prevention and treatment services for American Indians and Alaska Natives at IHS-funded facilities. Funding for these programs has been extended and increased over the years through subsequent legislation. The ATRA provision extends annual funding of $150 million for diabetes-related programs until FY2014. CMS introduced MS-DRGs in FY2008, leading to budget neutrality adjustments in subsequent years. The TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007 reduced adjustments in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2011 and FY2012, CMS made adjustments to offset DCI increases in previous years, including retroactive recoupment adjustments and prospective reductions. In FY2013, CMS implemented a \u22121.9% prospective adjustment for future years to address DCI increases from FY2008 and FY2009. A +1.0% documentation and coding adjustment was made after reversing the prior year's adjustment. An ATRA provision allows for additional adjustments in FY2014 through FY2017 to recoup $11 billion in overpayments associated with DCI in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. The CBO score is estimated at \u2212 $10.2 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and \u2212 $10.5 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Medicare reimburses providers for dialysis treatments using a predetermined rate adjusted for patient characteristics and area wage differences. The MIPPA expanded the composite rate to include previously separately billable drugs starting in 2011. CMS calculated the bundled payment rate based on prices and utilization of dialysis-related services, tests, and drugs. The MIPPA expanded the composite rate to include previously separately billable drugs in 2011. A report found a 23% decrease in ESRD drug utilization in 2011 compared to 2007. The ATRA provision requires CMS to adjust the Medicare bundled payment rate for dialysis treatment in CY2014 based on CY2012 utilization rates. It also delays including oral-only ESRD-related drugs in the bundled payment rate until January 1, 2016. The CBO score estimates savings of -$1.5 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and -$4.9 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Medicare Part B pays for physician services based on the fee schedule, with over 7,400 covered services. CMS has implemented payment reduction policies to reflect efficiencies gained when certain services are provided together. The ACA \u00a73134 added a new MPPR to the PE component of payment for select therapy services under the MPFS, reducing payment for second and subsequent services by 25%. Starting April 1, 2013, this reduction will increase to 50%, resulting in estimated savings of -$700 million according to the CBO score. Starting April 1, 2013, the payment reduction for stereotactic radiosurgery services will increase from 25% to 50%, resulting in estimated savings of -$700 million for FY2013-FY2017 and -$1.8 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Medicare pays for various SRS services under its OPPS, with specific payment codes assigned to different types of treatments. The ATRA provision will equalize payment rates for Gamma Knife SRS and linear accelerator based SRS, effective April 1, 2013, except for hospitals in rural areas. Starting April 1, 2013, payment reductions for certain services will not apply to hospitals in rural areas, rural referral centers, or SCHs. The CBO score is \u2212 $0.1 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and \u2212 $0.4 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Medicare's fee schedule for physician services includes separate payments for technical and professional components. Imaging procedures, for example, have both components which are paid separately when provided by different providers. Medicare makes a single global payment when both components are furnished by one provider. CMS's original method for calculating reimbursement rates for advanced imaging services assumed imaging machines are operated 25. The reimbursement rate for advanced imaging services was based on a 50% utilization rate assumption, but evidence showed a 90% utilization rate. MedPAC recommended using the higher rate, which CMS adopted in 2010. The ACA changed the assumption to 75% for 2011 and subsequent years, overriding the 90% rate. A provision in ATRA requires a 75% utilization rate through 2013 and 90% for 2014 onwards. Medicare Part B has implemented changes in payment rates for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) through a Competitive Acquisition Program. The program uses competitive bidding to determine payment rates based on winning supplier bids in specific areas. The first round of competitive bidding began in 2011, with the second round set to take place in 91 metropolitan areas by July 2013. The changes in payment rates will not affect the Secretary's periodic review and adjustments in relative values. The second round of Medicare Part B Competitive Acquisition Program will include a national mail-order component for diabetic testing supplies in 91 metropolitan areas by July 2013. The program will also apply payment rates to non-mail-order diabetic supplies and recalculate rates with a 9.5% reduction in payment update for 2009. The CBO score is \u2212 $0.6 billion for both FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. MedPAC has found a higher increase in basic life support (BLS) nonemergency services, particularly transports to and from dialysis facilities. An ATRA provision will reduce payment by 10% for BLS nonemergency transports of beneficiaries with ESRD for dialysis services. The CBO score is \u2212 $0.2 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and \u2212 $0.4 billion for FY2013-FY2022. SSA \u00a71870 addresses return of beneficiary and provider overpayments, requiring providers to return incorrect payments within 60 days. This ATRA provision extends the period for identifying overpayments. The ATRA provision extends the period for identifying overpayments from three to five years. The CBO score is \u2212 $0.2 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and \u2212 $0.5 billion for FY2013-FY2022. Medicare Advantage plans are paid a monthly amount to provide Medicare-covered benefits, with payments adjusted for the cost of care. Risk adjustment aims to balance costs for treating different beneficiaries. The ACA and ATRA provisions require adjustments for coding differences between MA plans and providers under Medicare. Starting in 2014, minimum coding intensity adjustments are specified, with increases each year. ATRA increases the minimum adjustment from 1.3 to 1.5 percentage points above the 2010 adjustment. The ATRA increases the floor for the 2019 adjustment from 5.7% to 5.9%. The CBO score is -$1.1 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and -$2.5 billion FY2013-FY2022. The MIPPA established a Medicare Improvement Fund (MIF) for improvements under Medicare fee-for-service program. The MIF was initially set at $19.9 billion annually from FY2014 through FY2017 but was modified to $275 billion in FY2015. Funds in subsequent years are based on the Secretary's estimate of the reduction in Medicare expenditures. The ATRA provision eliminates remaining funds from the Medicare Improvement Fund (MIF) due to reduced payments for providers not meeting electronic health record criteria. CBO scores show reductions in Medicare expenditures. The ACA directs reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments by $500 million. The ATRA provision extends Medicaid DSH reductions to FY2022, with no changes for FY2023 funding. The CBO score is $0 for FY2013-FY2017 and $4.2 billion for FY2013-FY2022. ACA established the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program under Title VIII. The ATRA provision repeals PHSA Title XXXII, makes conforming changes to Title VIII of the ACA and the Medicaid statute, and rescinds unobligated funds for the National Clearinghouse for Long Term Care Information. It establishes a Congressional Long-Term Care Commission to develop a plan for long-term services and supports (LTSS) system. The CBO score is between $50 million and \u2212 $50 million for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022. The Congressional Long-Term Care Commission is tasked with developing a plan for the long-term services and supports (LTSS) system. The Commission, comprised of 15 members appointed by the President and Congressional leaders, will address the interaction of LTSS with existing programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It will vote on a report and any legislative proposals, known as the Commission bill, within six months of appointment. The Commission bill, if approved by a majority vote, will be transmitted to the President and Congressional leaders, publicly available. It must be introduced in the Senate and House, with the Commission terminating 30 days after the vote. The ACA established the CO-OP program to create non-profit health insurance cooperatives in each state, offering coverage with start-up and solvency loans. Loans began in January 2012, with $6 billion authorized for the program. The ACA established the CO-OP program in 2012 with $6 billion authorized for loans. A provision in ATRA directs the Secretary to create a fund for organizations awarded CO-OP loans, with 10% of unobligated funds. The CBO score is \u2212 $0.2 billion for FY2013-FY2017 and FY2013-FY2022."
