    "content": "The Senate's rules and practices on quorums and voting are based on Article I of the Constitution. A majority constitutes a quorum for business, and a smaller number can adjourn or compel absent members. Voting requires the Yeas and Nays to be recorded if desired by one fifth of those present. This report focuses on the interpretation and implementation of these provisions, covering important rules and common practices. The Senate operates on the presumption that a quorum is always present unless suggested otherwise, typically only a few Senators are present during debates, and a simple majority of 51 Senators is required for conducting business. The Senate operates on the presumption that a quorum is always present unless suggested otherwise. A Senator can suggest the absence of a quorum, and the presiding officer will then direct the clerk to call the roll to determine the presence of a quorum. The Senate uses quorum calls to temporarily suspend formal proceedings without debate. Senators can suggest the absence of a quorum, prompting a roll call to confirm attendance. No business can be conducted during a quorum call unless the Senate agrees to dispense with it. During a quorum call in the Senate, the clerk slowly calls Senators' names to suspend proceedings. If the Senate agrees by unanimous consent to end the call before completion, business can resume without demonstrating a quorum. The presumption of a majority presence remains until the roll call shows otherwise. During a quorum call in the Senate, if a Senator suggests the absence of a quorum and less than a majority respond, it is confirmed. Quorum calls are initiated for various reasons, such as when a Senator completes a statement and no one else seeks recognition. They also occur while waiting for a Senator to manage a bill or make a speech. Informal discussions and negotiations can take place during quorum calls. Quorum calls in the Senate provide opportunities for informal discussions and negotiations among Senators, incentivizing broad agreement on the Senate's schedule and policy decisions. Senators can filibuster any measure, encouraging consensus-seeking. Informal consultations during quorum calls facilitate convenient discussions off the Senate floor. During Senate quorum calls, informal discussions and negotiations among Senators can help resolve procedural problems or policy disagreements. These discussions often lead to unanimous consent requests to terminate the quorum call and resume formal proceedings. Quorum calls create an unpredictable \"stop-and-go\" character to Senate floor proceedings, with debates frequently interrupted by these calls. The Senate often experiences frequent quorum calls during debates, leading to interruptions in formal proceedings. Despite the appearance of inaction, Senators are likely discussing legislation informally on or off the Senate floor. Quorum calls can consume time, especially on contentious issues. Senators may not initiate a quorum call under cloture, as the presiding officer determines the presence of a quorum. During Senate debates, quorum calls can interrupt proceedings, but Senators may be informally discussing legislation. Under cloture, the presiding officer decides on a quorum's presence before allowing a roll call. Quorum calls are not allowed under time agreements unless a Senator controls debate time and must have at least 10 minutes remaining to initiate a call. Live quorum calls in the Senate are initiated under specific circumstances, such as when the majority leader wants to bring Senators to the floor for a particular reason, before cloture votes, or when setting a date for voting on a bill. A Senator must have at least 10 minutes of remaining time to start a quorum call. If a live quorum call in the Senate does not receive a majority response, the Senate cannot resume business or dispense with the call by unanimous consent. The options are to adjourn or take steps to establish a quorum, usually done by the majority leader directing the sergeant at arms to request absent Senators' attendance. The Senate can establish a quorum by a rollcall vote, where a majority of Senators come to vote. If a quorum fails to vote, the Senate can direct the sergeant at arms to compel attendance or even arrest absentees. Once a quorum is established, the Senate must transact business before another quorum call. There are three ways the Senate can conduct votes: by voice vote, by... The Senate conducts votes on the floor by voice vote, division vote, or rollcall vote. Contested questions are usually decided by rollcall votes, while uncontested questions are decided \"without objection.\" A question is first put to a voice vote, where Senators respond \"Aye\" or \"No.\" A division vote may be requested, where those in favor stand and are counted. Division votes are uncommon and not formally authorized by Senate rules. The Senate conducts votes by voice, division, or rollcall. A voice or division vote is valid unless challenged for violating the quorum requirement. The Senate assumes a quorum is present until proven otherwise, allowing actions to be final even with few Senators present. A rollcall vote can be requested after a voice or division vote. Rollcall votes in the Senate can be requested by at least 11 Senators, constituting one-fifth of the minimal quorum of 51 Senators. This vote can be asked for after a voice or division vote has been conducted. When at least 11 Senators support a request for a rollcall vote in the Senate, it determines how the vote will be conducted but does not immediately trigger the vote. The actual vote may occur later or not at all, depending on the Senate's decision. More than 11 Senators may sometimes be needed to order a roll call. When at least 11 Senators support a request for a roll call in the Senate, it determines how the vote will be conducted. If a roll call is ordered, the presiding officer states that \"the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\" The vote begins when a Senator actually votes when their name is called. During a roll call vote in the Senate, bells and lights are activated to inform Senators to come to the floor and vote within a 15-minute period. The clerk calls Senators' names in alphabetical order, and they vote in the affirmative or negative. Senators can come to the well to vote, and their vote is repeated by the clerk. Tally sheets are consulted for voting information. During a roll call vote in the Senate, Senators are expected to vote unless there is a conflict of interest. A majority of Senators must vote, answer \"Present,\" or have live pairs to make the vote valid. If a quorum is not present, a new vote is taken. The presiding officer announces the result. During a roll call vote in the Senate, Senators are expected to vote unless there is a conflict of interest. The presiding officer may announce the result of the vote after a 15-minute period, allowing Senators to reach the floor and vote. Votes can be left open longer to accommodate Senators rushing to Capitol Hill. A Senator cannot change their vote after it has been announced, but by unanimous consent, they may be allowed to do so. Rule XII of the Senate states that Senators cannot vote after the decision is announced, but may change their vote with unanimous consent. If the yeas and nays are not ordered, the presiding officer may state that the amendment is agreed to without objection. Any Senator can object, in which case the question is decided by voice, division, or roll call vote. After a vote in the Senate, a motion to reconsider is often made, followed by a motion to table it, which is usually agreed to without objection. This process allows for one opportunity to reconsider most votes, with the result becoming final if the motion is tabled. In some cases, a reconsideration motion may lead to another roll call vote. A simple majority vote is required for all questions on the Senate floor, except for specific cases where a two-thirds vote is needed as per the Constitution or Senate precedents. Cloture typically requires a three-fifths vote. Cloture in the Senate typically requires a three-fifths vote, but on measures to amend Senate rules, a two-thirds vote is needed. Post-cloture consideration time can be extended with a three-fifths vote. Setting aside budget process procedures requires a three-fifths vote, as well as waiving rules on conference committee reports. The Senate rules can be waived or overturned on appeal by a three-fifths Senate vote. Recent interest in voting and quorum procedures has arisen due to frustrations with filibustering and unanimous consent agreements. Senators can prevent a matter from coming to a vote by simply triggering a live quorum if 51 Senators are not present on the floor. If a quorum is not present on the Senate floor, the opponent can trigger a live quorum call to delay a final vote. The Senate can only adjourn or work to secure a quorum. To ensure a quorum, a majority supporting a proposal must remain on or near the floor. Opponents can filibuster by offering motions and forcing rollcall votes, making it unlikely for a majority to pass a measure easily. The Senate is unlikely to extend the effort to force opponents to physically filibuster due to high costs and uncertain benefits. Maintaining a quorum is necessary but not sufficient to defeat a filibuster, as opponents can delay a final vote by triggering a live quorum call. The costs of conducting a filibuster are manageable, with few opponents needed to delay a vote. Minority party has less influence on the agenda, leading to negotiation of compromises off the floor rather than exhausting opponents with multiple rollcall votes."
