    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Universal Student Nutrition Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the importance of national school lunch and breakfast programs in protecting children's health and combating hunger. These programs serve millions of children daily, but there are still eligible low-income students not participating. Federal subsidies have decreased, and bonus commodities have nearly disappeared in the last decade. Many schools are dropping out of the school lunch program due to decreased federal subsidies, vanishing bonus commodities, increased administrative complexity, and draining financial resources. Establishment of optional universal school lunch and breakfast program under the National School Lunch Act. The Secretary shall establish an optional universal school lunch and breakfast program (referred to as the \"universal program\") where all students in participating schools can receive free meals. Any school already in the school lunch or breakfast program may choose to join. The Secretary will establish universal payment rates for schools participating in the optional universal school lunch and breakfast program. These rates will be based on the national average cost of producing school lunches and breakfasts. The Secretary will establish universal payment rates for schools in the optional universal school lunch and breakfast program, including a maximum amount for indirect expenses. Schools will receive the same level of commodities as in the school lunch and breakfast programs. Schools in the universal program may sell competitive foods under Secretary's regulations. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue regulations for the effective implementation of the National School Lunch Act. The Secretary will establish universal payment rates for schools in the optional universal school lunch and breakfast program, including regulations for implementation by July 1, 2000. SEC. 4 amends the National School Lunch Act and Child Nutrition Act to align school meal programs with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. SEC. 5 updates the Child Nutrition Act to include fiscal years starting from October 1, 1995."
