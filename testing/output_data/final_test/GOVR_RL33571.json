    "content": "Background: 10 U.S.C. 619 currently requires a minimum of 18 months in grade before promotion to higher ranks. An exception was made for officers promoted before October 1, 2005 to support the Global War on Terror. Historically, time-in-grade requirements for promotion have varied from one to two years, with the total time from commissioning to promotion ranging from two to four years. Public Law 108-136 (sec. 527) added a section to 10 United States Code addressing sexual harassment and violence at the Service Academies. This requires the academies to enhance their policies, conduct annual assessments, and submit reports. Time-in-grade requirements for military promotions have historically ranged from two to four years, with flexibility during periods of conflict. Public Law 108-375 directed the Department of Defense to create a comprehensive policy on the prevention and response to sexual assaults involving members of the Armed Forces. The law also required military departments to submit reports on sexual assaults, including disciplinary actions taken in substantiated cases. Despite lower crime rates among the armed forces compared to the general public, high-profile assaults have led to increased congressional scrutiny. The Purple Heart medal is awarded to members of the armed forces for wounds or death as a result of conflicts. In 1962, Executive Order 11016 expanded the award criteria, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to include prisoners of war. Congressional oversight has increased due to high-profile assaults. Public Law 104-106 expanded Purple Heart eligibility to prisoners of war wounded before April 25, 1962. The House proposed extending eligibility to POWs who die in captivity or after release due to injuries or illnesses incurred while a POW. The Senate and conference seek a presidential report on the issue. In recent years, military chaplains have faced criticism for their allegedly sectarian public statements. Complaints have been made about their lack of inclusivity and offense towards individuals of other religions. The Navy and Air Force have implemented rules allowing chaplains to pray freely during worship services but to be nonsectarian during public events. Some religious groups, particularly evangelical Christians, view these rules as a violation of religious freedom and a form of political correctness. Any changes in this area could raise constitutional questions, especially regarding the First Amendment. The military chaplains' language restrictions are being debated, with concerns about sectarian comments during public meetings. The Air Force and Navy are reducing manpower while the Army is increasing its strength. Congress has provided tools for voluntary separations and transfers between services. The \"Blue to Green\" program encourages transfers from the Air Force and Navy to the Army through voluntary separation programs. VSI allows services to target overstrength ranks, years of service, and military specialties. Incentives include a maximum VSI payment of approximately $235,000 for eligible personnel. The program has prompted numerous officer and enlisted transfers since 2004. Background: Section 1482(a)(8) of the 10 United States Code covers expenses related to transportation of remains and allowances for an escort. This expands the military's role in delivering remains. References: CRS Report RL32769 and CRS Report RS21545 provide further information on military death benefits and funeral honors. The ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have brought attention to military pay issues. The raise for Fiscal Years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was approved as the Economic Cost Index (ECI) increase plus 0.5%, while the FY2007 President's Budget requested a 2.2% military pay raise. All servicemembers are automatically insured under SGLI for a maximum of $400,000 in coverage. Servicemembers are insured under SGLI for up to $400,000 in coverage, with the option to elect lesser coverage or cancel entirely. The cost is $26.00 per month, paid through payroll deduction. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act reimbursed the first $150,000 in coverage for servicemembers in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. SGLI pays benefits for combat-related deaths, unlike civilian providers. Under H.R. 5122, deployed servicemembers in OIF or OEF receive free coverage up to $400,000, with an estimated cost of $31M to be paid from Defense Supplementals. The military Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides annuities to survivors of military personnel and retirees. If a military retiree was eligible for disability payments from the VA, their surviving spouse could receive VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC), with a dollar-for-dollar offset to SBP for any DIC payments. Language in the Senate version of the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act aimed to eliminate this offset but was removed by the Conference. The Defense Authorization Act aimed to eliminate the offset between VA DIC benefits and military SBP payments for surviving spouses, but it was removed by the Conference Committee. Congress ordered a report on the actuarial soundness of the SBP instead. Critics argue that allowing concurrent payments is dual compensation, while supporters believe it is fair for surviving spouses to receive both benefits. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides annuities to survivors of military personnel and retirees, funded in part by deductions from retired pay. In 1999, Congress enacted a \"paid-up\" provision reducing costs for certain retirees, where reductions in retired pay cease when the retiree reaches age 70 and has participated in SBP for 360 months. Efforts to move the effective date of this provision to October 1, 2005 were dropped by the Conference Committee. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) was created on September 21, 1972. Military retirees who entered service before 1978 can participate in SBP for 360 months but may not benefit under the \"paid-up\" provision due to the October 1, 2008 effective date. Congress ordered a report on the actuarial soundness of SBP in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. Recent legislation (P.L. 107-107, 115 Stat. 1151 et seq.; December 28, 2001) expanded Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) coverage to survivors of active duty personnel who die while not retirement-eligible. Surviving spouses receive an annuity, and since 2003, benefits can also be paid to surviving children. This provision prevents offsets from Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) for the surviving spouse. Recent legislation expanded Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) coverage to survivors of active duty personnel who die while not retirement-eligible. Surviving spouses can designate their child as the SBP beneficiary to receive benefits without offsetting DIC. This designation can be made retroactively to October 7, 2001. Under the USFSPA, courts can divide military retired pay in divorce proceedings. Under the Uniformed Services' Former Spouse Protection Act (USFSPA), courts can divide military retired pay in divorce proceedings. If the marriage lasted 10 years during which the member served 10 years of creditable service, DFAS can directly mail the court-ordered division to the former spouse. This would eliminate the \"10 year rule\" and allow for direct payments for property division in compliance. Retroactive payments are not permitted. The proposed change allows courts to specify the division of retired pay in dollars, subject to cost of living adjustments, without automatic increases for the former spouse. This change would apply to court orders effective 90 days after enactment. Military members can waive notification of court orders regarding retired pay. The proposed change allows courts to specify the division of retired pay in dollars, subject to cost of living adjustments, without automatic increases for the former spouse. This language would allow the member to waive notification of court orders. Members may request a copy of the court order, effective with court orders received 90 or more days after enactment. The FY2005 NDAA did not address Individual Unemployability, focusing on military retirees with VA disability ratings. The FY2006 NDAA included full concurrent receipt for 100% unemployables starting in 2009, earlier than previous law. The Senate provision for retroactive authorization was not accepted. The report discusses legislative proposals addressing sexual assault and domestic violence concerns in the military. Tricare may contract with healthcare providers for forensic examinations for eligible spouses and children of military personnel, but reporting requirements for payment are unclear. Legislation is being considered to prevent increases in Tricare Prime enrollment fees for retired personnel under 65. Tricare Prime functions as an HMO for eligible beneficiaries with no enrollment fees currently. The Department of Defense proposed raising Tricare enrollment fees and copayments for retired beneficiaries to control healthcare spending, facing opposition due to significant fee increases. References: CRS Report RL33537, Military Medical Care: Questions and Answers, and CRS Report RS22402, Increases in Tricare Costs: Background and Options for Congress. The FY2005 Defense Authorization Act established Tricare Reserve Select (TRS) for reservists returning from active duty. The Senate bill would prevent TRS premium increases, while the House version would replace TRS with Tricare Standard for non-active duty drilling reservists. Reservists enrolling in Tricare Standard would pay a premium equal to 28 percent of the total reasonable Tricare coverage amount. The House's position was adopted. The DOD faces rising costs of defense health care, leading to proposals to increase copayments and premiums in 2006. However, this was met with opposition from retirees. Congress recognizes the budget implications and unpopularity of increased fees for beneficiaries, allowing a Task Force to develop recommendations on addressing these issues. The DOD is dealing with increasing costs of defense health care, prompting proposals to raise copayments and premiums in 2006. However, these proposals faced opposition from retirees. Congress is aware of the budget implications and public backlash, leading to the establishment of a Task Force to develop recommendations on how to address these issues. The DOD is facing rising costs in defense health care, leading to proposals to increase copayments and premiums in 2006. There is a dispute over federal pricing rules for pharmaceuticals dispensed by the Tricare retail network, with DOD arguing that the rules apply. This provision could potentially save $251 million in 2007, but some argue it unfairly restricts private enterprise. There is a pending court case regarding this issue. On September 7, 2006, the House voted on H.R. 5122, instructing conferees to agree to provisions in the Senate version. The conference committee did not include any provisions, stating that Tricare retail pharmacies already qualify for discounted drug prices. Military retirees are offered supplemental health care coverage if they use Tricare as their primary health care coverage, allowing employers to shift some health care costs to the federal government. The House voted on H.R. 5122, instructing conferees to agree to provisions in the Senate version. The conference committee did not include any provisions, stating that Tricare retail pharmacies already qualify for discounted drug prices. Employers are prohibited from shifting military retirees from their group health plans to Tricare, in line with other federal laws. Private employers can charge employee health care to the federal government as a cost of administering contracts. Incentives offered to military retiree employees have been traditionally allowed. The Department of Defense is concerned about civilian firms providing incentives for military retiree employees to use Tricare over their company's health care plan, driving up defense health care costs. A provision in H.R. 5122 would make such incentives unallowable as contract costs for federal contractors. The provision in H.R. 5122 would make incentives for military retiree employees to use Tricare unallowable as contract costs for federal contractors, which some may view as unfair. The Federal Acquisition Regulation already addresses circumstances for suspension or disbarment of contractors for repeated violations of law. DOD encourages the use of the National Mail-Order Pharmacy to save costs on maintenance medications. The DOD aims to promote the use of the National Mail-Order Pharmacy (NMOP) to control rising pharmacy costs. Both House and Senate bills propose incentives for beneficiaries to use the NMOP, including removing co-payments. The Senate bill goes further by mandating beneficiaries to obtain maintenance medications from the NMOP, which has faced criticism from the pharmacy industry. Some beneficiaries prefer retail pharmacies for convenience. There is concern about personnel who served in Afghanistan and Iraq developing mental disorders after being transferred or released from active duty. Efforts are being made to identify and provide early treatment for individuals at risk of PTSD. Congress is skeptical of replacing military medical personnel with civilian care providers, with current legislation requiring certification that quality of care will not decrease. Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams (WMD-CST) are units of full-time National Guard personnel established under 10 U.S.C. 12310(c) to respond to emergencies involving weapons of mass destruction or terrorist attacks in the United States. The Senate is considering establishing an ongoing requirement for annual certifications, which may complicate the judgment of senior defense officials. WMD-CSTs are meant to rapidly deploy and assist in assessing situations involving weapons of mass destruction or terrorist attacks. There is a debate about expanding their authority to respond to other emergencies, which could increase their workload and require modified training. Both the House and Senate bills agree on allowing WMD-CSTs to respond to manmade and natural disasters, as well as hazardous material releases with catastrophic consequences. The Senate provision to respond to events in Mexico and Canada is not matched by the House. The Presidential Reserve Call-up authority (PRC) allows the President to activate certain reservists for up to 270 days for specified purposes, but prohibits certain functions related to suppressing insurrection or providing assistance in disasters. The conference report extends the activation period for reservists. The conference report extends the activation period for reservists under the Presidential Reserve Call-up authority, allowing the President to call up reserves, including the National Guard, in situations of domestic violence where state authorities are unable to maintain public order. The Secretary of Defense may provide material support or services in such cases. The amount of disability retired pay is based on disability rating or years of service, with years of service calculated differently for regular and reserve component personnel. Reserve years of service are determined by a formula involving training assemblies and active duty days. This can result in fewer \"years of service\" for reserve personnel compared to their actual years of service. The calculation of disability retired pay for reserve component personnel is based on disability rating or years of service, with years of service determined by earning 50 points each year. This may result in a lower benefit compared to the disability rating calculation. The 108th Congress passed legislation allowing reservists who had served on active duty in support of a contingency operation since September 11, 2001, to enroll themselves and their families in Tricare Standard. The premium for this coverage was set at 28% of the cost. The 109th Congress established new eligibility tiers for Tricare coverage. The 109th Congress established new eligibility tiers for Tricare coverage for non-activated reservists, with premiums set at 28%, 50%, and 85%. The House provision aims to repeal the three-tier system and replace it with a single-tier system with premiums set at 28% for nearly all non-activated reservists by October 1, 2007. Eligibility for the benefit would no longer require reservists to continue serving in the Selected Reserves. The Senate provision would maintain the three-tier system for Tricare coverage for non-activated reservists but add employees of small businesses to the middle-tier and lower the premiums in the highest tier from 85% to 75% of cost. Eligibility for the benefit would simply terminate upon departure from the Selected Reserve. The Senate provision aims to reduce the age for receipt of retired pay for a specific group of reservists, while maintaining it at age 60 for others. It also keeps the age at 60 for access to retiree health care benefits. Various legislative proposals have been introduced to lower the minimum age for retired reservists to receive benefits, with some suggesting age 55 or based on active duty performed. The Senate provision aims to reduce the age for receipt of retired pay for reservists who have performed active duty since September 11, 2001. The age at which they can draw retired pay would drop by three months for each aggregate of 90 days of such service performed. There have been tensions between military leadership and reserve components over policy and resource allocation decisions, particularly affecting the Army and Air National Guard. The National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act (H.R. 5200 / S. 2658) aims to modify the role of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and the authority of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB) by changing the NGB to a \"joint activity of the Department of Defense\" and making other significant changes. This legislation is a response to the interest in revamping disaster response following Hurricane Katrina. The National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act aims to modify the role of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and the authority of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB) by changing the NGB to a \"joint activity of the Department of Defense\" and making other significant changes, including specifying the NGB as the channel of communications between the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, commanders of combatant commands, Departments of the Army and Air Force, and the states on National Guard matters. Additionally, the CNGB would serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on National Guard matters. The National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act proposes significant changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB). These changes include designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) with the ability to attend JCS meetings and provide advice, prescribing the grade of the CNGB as a four-star general, and modifying the authority for developing the NGB charter. The National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB). The CNGB would be designated as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and responsible for coordinating National Guard personnel and resources for contingency operations, natural disasters, and military assistance to civil authorities. The legislation would require the CNGB to identify gaps in federal and state capabilities for emergencies and make recommendations for National Guard programs to address these gaps. The legislation proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CNGB would coordinate National Guard resources for various operations, including MACA, and work with the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force. Budget justification documents would specify separate amounts for training and equipping the National Guard for MACA and other domestic operations. The legislation proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes requirements for developing doctrine, training, acquiring equipment, and supplies for MACA and domestic operations. The Secretary of Defense must prevent any increase in National Guard personnel for administrative purposes. The CNGB must submit an annual report to Congress on state and territory requirements related to MACA validated in the previous fiscal year. An Assistant to the Chairman of the JCS for Reserve Matters would be established within the Joint Staff. The legislation proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes requirements for developing doctrine, training, acquiring equipment, and supplies for MACA and domestic operations. An Assistant to the Chairman of the JCS for Reserve Matters would be established within the Joint Staff to advise on reserve component officer representation and promotions. The legislation proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes requirements for developing doctrine, training, acquiring equipment, and supplies for MACA and domestic operations. An Assistant to the Chairman of the JCS for Reserve Matters would be established within the Joint Staff to advise on reserve component officer representation and promotions. Supporters argue that this legislation will give the National Guard a greater role in national security decision-making, while Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England opposes it. The legislation proposes changes to the role of the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, designating the CNGB as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of the primary objections raised was that the legislation could damage the relationship between the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, leading to less integration with the Army and Air Force. The House version of the NDAA would have directed a study on the legislation, while the Senate version contained a scaled-back version omitting some controversial provisions. The Senate provisions proposed significant changes to the National Guard Bureau and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau's authority. The Conference decided to conduct further study on these issues through the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve, with a final report due by early 2008."
