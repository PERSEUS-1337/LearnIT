    "content": "The U.S. auto industry is a national priority with support from Congress and the federal government. Measures include financial aid for automakers, research support for new vehicles, and addressing foreign trade practices affecting U.S. automakers. The emergence of Japan's auto industry as a global competitor in the 1980s and 1990s led to conflict with the United States over trade policies. The rise of China's auto industry has raised similar concerns, with calls for tougher action against Chinese industrial policies. Congress has urged the Obama Administration to challenge Chinese trade practices through the WTO dispute settlement process. China's auto industry has seen significant growth in the past five years, becoming the world's largest auto market in terms of production and sales. With rising incomes and government stimulus, China's annual output of cars and light trucks has more than doubled, reaching over 19 million units in 2012. Sales are expected to continue increasing due to low ownership rates compared to the global average and the United States. This growth has led to concerns about Chinese industrial policies and calls for tougher action against them. China's auto industry in China has seen significant growth, becoming the world's largest market in terms of production and sales. With rising incomes and government stimulus, annual vehicle sales are forecasted to reach 30 million by 2020. The government has been working on a major project to build a network similar to the U.S. Interstate Highway system to support sales growth. Foreign automakers have played a key role in transforming China's auto industry since the 1980s, helping domestic manufacturers reach higher quality and technology standards. SAIC Motor Corp. and other Chinese partners have joint ventures with leading foreign automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. These partnerships account for about 70% of new passenger cars sold in China. GM and VW are the top non-Chinese automakers in China, with GM selling more cars in China than in the United States. Ford Motor Co. has a 3% market share, while Chrysler plans to start Jeep production in China. Chrysler plans to start Jeep production in China in the near future, joining other foreign-Chinese joint ventures like SAIC Motor Corp. and leading automakers such as Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. China became a net exporter of vehicles in 2005 but has been a net importer since 2009. Domestic Chinese companies like Geely and Chery, along with foreign-Chinese joint ventures, manufacture about 70% of vehicle exports, with the main destinations being developing markets in South America, Africa, and the Middle East. Chinese vehicle exports to developing markets in South America, Africa, and the Middle East accounted for about 4.5% of total output in 2011. The only Chinese-made vehicles exported to the United States are small trucks and off-road vans. Honda's Chinese-made FIT subcompact is exported to Canada but not sold in the United States. Chinese vehicle imports have also increased, with over a million units imported in 2011, mainly luxury SUVs. Germany, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom are the major countries of origin for Chinese vehicle imports. In the Chinese import market, Germany, Japan, United States, United Kingdom, and South Korea are key players. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are top luxury brands. European makers benefit from lower consumption tax on large engine cars compared to American-made vehicles. The United States exports more vehicles to China than it imports. China was the third largest export market for U.S. automotive vehicles in 2012. China's auto sector growth has led to increased demand for auto parts. The Chinese auto parts industry has seen a rise in demand due to the growth of the auto sector. Foreign investment trend in China has led to the expansion of U.S. and other international auto parts companies to supply international automakers in China, helping to lower costs and maintain competitiveness. The Chinese auto parts industry has expanded to supply international automakers in China and export globally, including to the United States. China's auto parts exports grew significantly from 2002 to 2011. Some U.S. producers and the government have raised concerns about alleged subsidies on Chinese auto parts exports violating WTO rules. The U.S. auto parts market includes parts for assembly plants and aftermarket sales, with sales to automakers being the larger market. About two-thirds of parts sold domestically are sourced from U.S. suppliers. It is unclear how many Chinese parts go to automakers versus the aftermarket. Some imports are for aftermarket use, while others are more sophisticated parts like transmission modules. China's focus on producing \"new energy vehicles\" like electric and fuel cell cars is highlighted in their recent Five Year Plan. This includes the development of electric vehicle batteries, motors, sensors, and fuel cells. China also imports a significant amount of auto parts, including transmissions, engine parts, car bodies, and electronics, totaling around $27 billion in 2010. If China starts exporting these products, they could directly compete with parts manufacturing in other industrialized countries. In 2012, U.S. parts plants exported about $1.6 billion in auto parts to China. The Chinese auto parts sector has seen significant growth, with over 10,000 registered companies in 2008. Foreign auto parts companies can own more than 50% of a Chinese parts maker, leading to many U.S.-based parts producers establishing operations in China. Producers have established operations in China, with seven of China's 10 largest parts manufacturers being foreign-based. U.S.-based companies like Delphi, Visteon, Johnson Controls, Lear, Arvin Meritor, and TRW manufacture in China, along with other leading producers such as Bosch, Denso, Magna, and Yazaki. Michigan-based Visteon has 23 centers in China for vehicle equipment, electronics, and interiors. TRW forecasts China to be its largest market by 2020. China's auto parts sector is growing through acquisitions of foreign assets. Chinese auto parts makers are acquiring foreign assets to enhance technology and product innovations for their operations. Recent investments include Beijing West Industries buying Delphi Corp's suspension and brake units in 2009, and Pacific Century Motors acquiring Nexteer Automotive from GM in 2010. These acquisitions aim to shift from low-margin parts to more profitable activities and integrate components for various automakers. Nexteer Automotive, acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang in 2010, has multiple facilities worldwide. Wanxiang also acquired A123 Systems after outbidding other companies, raising concerns due to A123's prior stimulus funding. Wanxiang had already purchased other U.S. auto parts companies and had thousands of U.S. employees. The Chinese government has ambitious plans to transform its auto manufacturing sector, designated a national \"pillar industry\" in China's Seventh Five-Year Plan in 1986. The State Council issued the \"Formal Policy on Development of Automotive Industry\" in 1994, imposing tariffs to restrict imports. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) targeted specific components for priority support, providing RMB 4.7 billion for research and development of energy-efficient vehicles through various incentives. In 2009, the Chinese government aimed to boost domestic vehicle consumption by expanding indigenous vehicle and parts production, especially hybrid and electric cars. The 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) outlined steps to consolidate the auto assembly and parts industry, focus on research and development for key auto parts, and provide incentives for energy-saving vehicles to reduce oil dependence and emissions. The Chinese government aims to boost the indigenous vehicle sector by promoting new-energy automobiles, one of the strategic and emerging industries highlighted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. This sector is expected to comprise 8% of GDP by 2015 and 15% by 2020, with support from treasury, tax, and financial policies. Some provinces and cities in China also offer incentives and support programs for the auto industry, although there are concerns about potential violations of WTO obligations. The Obama Administration has notified China of potential WTO violations in its support for the auto industry. China's energy-saving vehicle program is under scrutiny for new local content, technology transfer, and export requirements. Automakers now rely on parts suppliers for up to 70% of the value added in vehicle production, with a network of independent producers responsible for designing and producing these parts. Tier 1 manufacturers make components and systems for new vehicles, using parts from Tier 2 and 3 suppliers. These smaller companies focus on specific products like gaskets or valves, selling mainly to repair shops and auto supply stores. Tier 1 suppliers dominate the U.S. parts market, with an estimated 70% of the value originating from them. The industry is seeing a shift towards consolidation in manufacturing and design processes worldwide. The automotive industry is moving towards global platforms to streamline manufacturing processes and reduce costs. This shift is driving consolidation among vehicle suppliers as manufacturers prefer to use the same components worldwide. Ford, for example, plans to reduce its vehicle platforms from 15 to about five in the future. The automotive industry is transitioning to global platforms to streamline manufacturing and reduce costs. This shift is leading to consolidation among vehicle suppliers, with automakers requesting entire systems from Tier 1 suppliers. Chinese auto parts companies are aiming to improve quality and become system integrators to meet global automaker standards. The Chinese government is looking to develop vehicles for both domestic production and export to other markets. Volkswagen is developing vehicles in China for wider export markets, following the trend of global platforms in the automotive industry. Chinese auto parts quality is rising, leading to potential exports of parts and vehicles from China. Foreign-owned companies are increasingly prominent in the North American Tier 1 supplier base. In the past 20 years, 800 to 1,000 suppliers, mainly Asian and European, have built plants in the United States to sell parts to the Detroit 3 automakers. Foreign suppliers with U.S. plants operate more efficiently due to fewer legacy costs. U.S.-based parts makers are also expanding in growing Asian markets, especially China, to serve their Detroit 3 customers. In the past two decades, numerous foreign suppliers have established plants in the United States to supply parts to the Detroit 3 automakers. These suppliers were encouraged to do so by the Detroit 3, who advocated for production in lower-cost countries. General Motors, the largest non-Chinese automaker in China, relies heavily on local suppliers for its manufacturing there. The U.S. trade pattern in auto parts is shifting, with imports increasingly coming from Mexico, China, and Germany. The overall value of imported parts in the United States has risen significantly in the past decade. The overall value of imported auto parts in the United States has increased by 96% in the past decade. Import growth from Mexico, China, and Germany exceeds the average, with Chinese imports growing by over 700%. Chinese auto parts are also exported to Mexico, where they are used in autos made there or included in parts exported to the United States. U.S. parts exports to Mexico rose by 103% in the past decade, while exports to Canada and Germany also increased. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has led to increasing investment by foreign automakers in Mexico. U.S. parts exports to China have surged by over 400%, making China the fastest-growing market for U.S. parts exports. Trade disputes between the two countries have escalated since China joined the WTO in 2001. The U.S. vehicle parts sector has faced challenges, with employment declining every year from 2001 to 2009 due to the recession and import competition. Despite this, the industry has added 100,000 jobs since its low point. The U.S. vehicle parts sector has faced challenges with companies filing for bankruptcy and a decrease in jobs since the start of the century. China's auto trade liberalization was a major U.S. priority during WTO negotiations in the late 1990s, leading to lower tariffs on autos and auto parts by China. China agreed to eliminate nontariff barriers and maintain a tariff rate quota on autos and auto parts, which were gradually phased out after its WTO accession in December 2001. The U.S. raised concerns about China's quota system being protectionist due to delays in regulations and higher taxes on imported automobiles. The U.S.-China Business Council highlighted autos as one of the industries affected by investment restrictions in China. Export performance requirements in the automotive sector have been a source of tension, with companies like Cooper Tire & Rubber and Honda agreeing to export all or a significant portion of their production to gain approval for investments in China. These requirements can lead to trade frictions as companies may prioritize Chinese exports over U.S. production to meet investment conditions. The 2005 report by the American Chamber of Commerce in China highlighted China's compliance with WTO obligations in auto policy areas such as tariff reduction and quota elimination. However, it also noted ongoing issues like intellectual property violations and a regulation discouraging firms from importing auto parts. In March 2006, the United States, along with the European Union and Canada, initiated a WTO dispute settlement case against China's auto parts policies. China argued that its measures aimed to prevent firms from circumventing tariffs on fully assembled vehicles. The United States argued that China's regulations penalized manufacturers for using imported auto parts. China's auto parts policies penalize manufacturers for using imported parts in vehicles for sale in China. Imported parts are charged at the same rate as complete vehicles if they exceed specified thresholds, creating a tax on imported parts not imposed on domestic parts. This policy discourages importing and pressures foreign auto parts producers to relocate manufacturing. In July 2008, a WTO Panel found China's regulations on auto parts to be inconsistent with WTO rules. The ruling was upheld by a WTO Appellate Body in December 2008. China repealed the measures in September 2009 after the case concluded. Foreign automakers in China have largely stopped using imported auto parts due to high taxes and the relocation of international auto parts production. General Motors, the leading American automaker in China, now produces or sources most of its auto parts locally due to the shift of international auto parts manufacturing to China. This decision minimizes the impact of China's compliance with WTO rulings on imported products. The US initiated a case against Chinese tire imports in 2009 under a China-specific safeguard measure, which expires in December 2013. In April 2009, the USITC began investigating certain types of light vehicle passenger tires from China, following a petition by the USW. By June 2009, the USITC determined that these imports were causing market disruption and recommended additional tariffs over three years. The USW claimed that the surge in tire imports from China had harmed US producers. The USITC found that tire imports from China led to the loss of 5,100 U.S. tire-related jobs from 2004-2008, with 3,000 more jobs at risk in 2009. President Obama imposed tariffs on Chinese tires for three years, which expired in 2012. Industry representatives argued against the tariffs, stating they would harm U.S. consumers and not boost employment in the U.S. tire industry. The safeguard tariffs on Chinese tires expired in 2012, leading to a shift in import sources. While the tariffs were in effect, imports from China decreased, but rose again once the tariffs were removed. Other countries like Korea, Canada, Thailand, Mexico, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Chile saw an increase in tire imports to the U.S. China's share of tire sales in the U.S. dropped from 36% in 2009 to 20% in 2011, before rising to 25% in 2012 after the tariffs were lifted. China responded to increased U.S. tariffs on tires by initiating a WTO trade dispute. In return, the U.S. accused China of imposing unjustified anti-dumping and countervailing duties on American cars and SUVs. The U.S. launched a WTO dispute settlement case against China in July 2012. China has imposed duties on American-made automobiles, leading to a WTO dispute initiated by the United States. China's use of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, crucial for automotive manufacturing, has raised concerns. China's control over rare earth production and export has tightened in recent years, impacting the global supply chain. China's control over rare earth production and export has led to restrictions such as quotas, export taxes, and production limits. These policies have raised prices for rare earth users, particularly non-Chinese firms. In 2010, China imposed an embargo on rare earth exports, affecting companies like Toyota. China claims these policies are for environmental reasons and resource conservation. The United States, Japan, and the European Union have initiated a WTO dispute over China's rare earth export policies. The United States, Japan, and the European Union filed a WTO dispute against China's restrictive policies on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum. Concerns were raised by Members of Congress about China's trade practices in the auto parts sector, urging the Administration to address China's harmful policies. The United States urged the Administration to address China's harmful policies in the auto parts sector, leading to a WTO dispute over China's export subsidies to auto and auto parts manufacturers. China's alleged auto and auto parts \"export base\" subsidy program, totaling at least $1 billion from 2009-2011, is said to violate WTO rules. The Economic Policy Institute reported extensive Chinese subsidies to the auto parts sector, totaling $27.5 billion from 2001 to 2011. The United States and China have unresolved consultations regarding Chinese investment restrictions on new energy vehicles. USTR has raised concerns about joint venture agreements requiring a transfer of energy-saving technology. The Chinese government requires foreign auto companies in joint ventures to share energy-saving vehicle technology. U.S. companies like GM, Ford, and Daimler have agreed to share powertrain and battery technology with their Chinese partners. Chinese regulations mandate a high level of proficiency in key parts for manufacturing electric vehicles, with clear ownership of intellectual property rights required. This policy may compel U.S. companies to transfer their technology. Industry representatives argue that U.S. companies may be pressured to transfer their intellectual property to participate in China's NEV market. China aims to produce 1 million NEVs by 2015 and 5 million annually by 2020. During the 2011 U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, China assured that technology transfer is not mandated, and foreign-invested enterprises are eligible for subsidies and preferential policies on equal terms with Chinese companies. China aims to implement subsidies and preference programs for NEVs in line with WTO rules. Despite industry concerns over China's NEV policies, the country's auto industry has seen significant growth in production and sales compared to other regions during the recession. China's auto industry has seen significant growth in production and sales, especially in China where it more than doubled from 2009 to 2012. The country's growing middle class values car ownership, and there is room for further expansion in the Chinese auto market. Foreign automakers in China must have Chinese partners, while parts makers can own a majority share. China's Five-Year Plans prioritize building up the auto industry, with a long-term goal to leapfrog over other nations. China's auto industry in China has seen significant growth, with a focus on new energy vehicles like electric and fuel-cell-powered cars. Foreign automakers and parts makers are welcomed in the Chinese market, but Chinese state intervention could limit benefits for non-Chinese manufacturers. Joining the WTO in 2001, China's plan to consolidate auto and parts makers may lead to increased competition for U.S., European, and Japanese firms. Since joining the WTO in 2001, China's transition to a market economy has been hindered by increased state intervention, particularly in the auto sector. This has led to trade disputes with the U.S. and changes in Chinese laws affecting the motor vehicle industry. When Japanese auto companies faced pressure to limit exports to the US in the 1980s and 1990s, they responded by building US plants. Currently, China is exporting auto parts, not cars, to the US. Chinese investment in the US auto industry could ease concerns about increased imports, as long as it complies with trade laws. The growth of the Chinese auto industry will depend on its ability to innovate and develop technology. Consolidation and innovation are crucial for the growth of the Chinese auto industry, as reliance on foreign joint ventures may hinder home-grown technology applications."
