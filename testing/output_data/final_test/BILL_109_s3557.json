    "content": "The \"Drug Overdose Reduction Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to drug overdose. Congress finds that drug-induced deaths in the United States have been on the rise, with 28,723 deaths in 2003 and a 540% increase in drug overdoses between 1980 and 1999. Most drug-induced deaths involve multiple drugs, and there has been a documented increase in deaths from heroin mixed with fentanyl, a potent narcotic. An estimated 3,000,000 individuals in the US have serious drug problems, and drug abuse costs society over $60 billion in social costs. Community-based programs have successfully prevented drug overdose deaths through education and access to naloxone, saving society billions in costs. The Act defines key terms such as controlled substance, Director, drug, and eligible entity. It establishes an overdose prevention grant program. The Director will award grants to eligible entities to reduce deaths from drug overdoses. Entities must submit an application demonstrating their capacity to carry out prevention activities. The Director will prioritize public health agencies or community-based organizations with expertise in preventing drug overdose deaths in high-risk populations. Eligible entities must meet state licensure requirements and carry out training for first responders, individuals affected by drug abuse, and law enforcement officials. The program focuses on effective responses to drug overdoses, implementing prevention and treatment programs, and evaluating existing initiatives. Eligible entities must submit a report on program results within 90 days of the grant period. $25,000,000 is authorized for this section annually. The program focuses on effective responses to drug overdoses, prevention, and treatment programs. $25,000,000 is allocated annually for fiscal years 2007-2011. SEC. 5. REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS. The Director will compile and publish data on drug overdose deaths annually. A plan to reduce these deaths must be developed within 180 days of the Act's enactment, including identifying barriers to accurate data collection and effective prevention strategies, with recommendations for legislative or administrative action."
