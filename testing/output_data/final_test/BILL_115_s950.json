SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF SERVICE LIMITS FOR SEASONAL HIRES. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"covered Secretary,\" \"Director,\" and \"pilot program.\" The Director is tasked with establishing a pilot program for seasonal or temporary Federal employees, specifically firefighters. The program allows covered Secretaries to extend service year limitations for seasonal firefighters beyond 1,040 hours if necessary for fire crew scheduling during longer fire seasons. The Director will establish standards and guidelines for a pilot program to accommodate longer fire seasons. A report on the program's use and impact will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 2 years. The pilot program will terminate 5 years after its establishment. SEC. 5. CIVIL SERVICE RETENTION RIGHTS. Section 8151 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to define 'covered employee' as a wildland firefighter who sustained an injury preventing them from performing firefighter duties. The term 'covered employee' refers to a wildland firefighter who is injured and unable to perform firefighter duties. A covered employee in this position must receive the same retirement benefits as they would have in their former position, without requiring additional years of service. The term 'firefighter' is defined in section 8331. Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management, the last employer must offer the injured employee the right to resume their former position or an equivalent one if the injury or disability is overcome within 1 year of compensation commencement. This includes all attendant rights the employee would have had in their former position if not injured. The Wildland Firefighter Fairness Act ensures that if an employee is injured or disabled, the last employer must make efforts to place them back in their former position or an equivalent one within the department or agency. Additionally, employees injured within the 20-year period before the Act may not receive certain benefits. The Wildland Firefighter Fairness Act requires injured or disabled employees to make a payment to the Forest Service or Department of the Interior to receive retirement benefits. SEC. 6. COMPUTATION OF PAY. Section 8114 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to define 'covered overtime pay' for wildland firefighters and include it as part of their pay, along with other forms of remuneration. Overtime pay and additional pay outside the United States are not considered in this calculation. The amendment made by subsection (a) regarding overtime pay for wildland firefighters will take effect on October 1, 2019."
