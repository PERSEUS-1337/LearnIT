    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that pregnant and parenting pupils in California face obstacles to graduating and receiving equal education. These obstacles include inconsistent access to family leave absences. Pregnant and parenting pupils in California face obstacles such as involuntary pushout, rigid absence verification requirements, limited time to make up work, varying school support levels, inconsistent independent study options, and lack of awareness of educational rights under Title IX and California law. Young moms who have a child before 18 face educational challenges, with only 38% graduating high school, 19% getting a GED, and 2% going to college before 30. Nearly 60% of teen mothers live in poverty, impacting their children's education and future. Studies show pregnancy can motivate pupils to complete school and pursue higher education. California recognizes the importance of bonding time for infants and parents, offering up to six weeks of family leave since 2004. This support benefits working families, ensuring they do not have to choose between family and education. Additionally, a new section has been added to the Education Code to emphasize the significance of bonding time. A new section in the Education Code requires school districts to inform pregnant and parenting students about their rights under Title IX and related sections. Additionally, school districts may adopt policies allowing parenting students up to six weeks of parental leave after giving birth. Policies allowing parenting students parental leave must be filed by the school district to not affect average daily attendance calculations. One day of attendance is credited for each hour spent on instructional activities with the pupil during parental leave. An expectant and parenting pupil policy requires submission of a parental leave request form by the second trimester. The school must process the request within five days and provide makeup work guidelines. Section 48205 of the Education Code is amended to excuse pupils from school for illness, quarantine, or medical services. Students may be excused from school for various reasons, including medical appointments, funeral services for immediate family members, jury duty, and caring for a sick child. Students may be excused from school for various reasons, such as personal events like court appearances, funerals, religious observances, employment or educational conferences, or serving on a precinct board for an election. Students may be excused from school for personal events like court appearances, funerals, religious observances, employment, educational conferences, or serving on a precinct board for an election. Absences can also be granted for spending time with a family member in the military deployed to a combat zone, with assignments and tests to be completed upon return. Students may be excused from school for various reasons such as court appearances, funerals, religious observances, employment, educational conferences, or serving on a precinct board for an election. Absences for religious retreats are limited to four hours per semester and are not counted towards average daily attendance. Pupils with temporary disabilities preventing regular attendance can receive individual instruction from the district they reside in. Individual instruction is defined as teaching provided to a student in their home, a hospital, or other specified locations according to state regulations. Temporary disability, including pregnancy and recovery, incurred during regular day classes or alternative education programs, allowing the pupil to return without special intervention. Each clock hour of individual instruction counts as one day of attendance for computing average daily attendance. A pupil can only receive a maximum of five days of attendance per week or the total number of days regular classes are held in a fiscal year. Notice of individualized instruction availability must be provided. Parents of pupils with temporary disabilities must notify the school district of their presence in a qualifying hospital, with the district required to take specific actions upon notification. Within five working days of notification, determine if individualized instruction is possible for a pupil with a temporary disability due to pregnancy. If not available, provide guidelines for makeup work plan. The pupil must receive individualized instruction as per Section 48206.3, which can be provided by the previous school district. Within five working days of starting individualized instruction, notify the pupil's previous school district that the pupil will not be included in their attendance count. Reimbursement for any state-mandated costs will be provided to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
