    "content": "The sale of U.S-origin defense articles to foreign countries is governed by a broad set of statutes, laws, regulations, and policies. Presidents have historically used these sales to further foreign policy goals, from strategically important countries during the Cold War to building global counterterrorism capacity post-9/11. Legislative provisions related to these transfers can be found in National Defense Authorization Acts and State Department programs. The sale and export of defense articles to foreign countries are governed by laws such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. These laws outline the roles of the Department of State and the Department of Defense in administering these transfers. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) governs the sale and export of defense articles to foreign countries, including sales and grant transfers to entities. The report describes the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) programs, outlining the process for sales and exports. FMS involves the U.S. government acting as a broker for sales to eligible purchasers, while DCS requires licensing unless exempt under ITAR regulations. The President designates defense articles for export. The President designates defense articles for export via the U.S. Munitions List (USML). All persons engaging in manufacturing, brokering, exporting, or importing defense articles must register with the State Department according to ITAR procedures. Congress must be notified 15 to 30 days prior to planned FMS and DCS cases over a certain value threshold, and can restrict sales via a joint resolution. The report also lists legislative limitations on arms sales and end use monitoring requirements under the Arms Export Control Act. In FY2018, U.S. authorized arms sales to foreign governments and export licenses totaled $184.3 billion. Foreign entities spent $47.71 billion on FMS cases and $136.6 billion on DCS authorizations. The State Department requested $7.09 billion for security assistance, while DOD executed $4.42 billion for security cooperation. This amounted to 24.1% of FMS spending and 8.4% of DCS approved licenses. Transfers funded by U.S. security assistance to foreign security forces are considered foreign assistance and authorized by various U.S. laws. These transfers include defense articles under authorities like Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) executes security assistance and cooperation programs, including Title 10 grant-based authorities like the 333 authority, DIRI, MDOA program, and MSI. These programs involve training foreign forces and transferring U.S.-origin arms. The sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries is governed by various statutes, laws, regulations, policies, and agreements. The agreements governing the sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries include the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The FAA authorizes measures in defense against aggression and military assistance to friendly countries. The AECA requires sales to be consistent with U.S. foreign policy and foreign assistance program purposes. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, establishes U.S. policy for foreign assistance programs, including military and economic aid. It considers the recipient country's military needs, economic capability, and impact on social and economic development. Defense articles are provided for internal security, self-defense, regional cooperation, and nonproliferation efforts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the recipient country to participate in regional or collective arrangements consistent with the UN Charter. Section 22 of the AECA establishes the statutory basis for the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, enabling the U.S. government to act as a broker for defense articles sales to eligible purchasers. The AECA allows the U.S. government to sell defense articles or services to foreign countries or international organizations with a guarantee of full payment. The President designates items subject to Direct Commercial Sales licensing, outlined in the U.S. Munitions List. All individuals, except U.S. government personnel, involved in manufacturing, brokering, or exporting must comply with regulations in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. All individuals, except U.S. government personnel, engaged in manufacturing, brokering, exporting, or importing defense articles and services must register with the State Department under ITAR procedures. The President must review items on the USML and notify relevant committees if export controls are no longer necessary. In April 2018, the Trump Administration issued NSPM-10, outlining its policy on conventional arms transfers to enhance U.S. security and prevent proliferation. NSPM-10 outlines the U.S. government's commitment to nonproliferation arrangements and meeting statutory requirements, prioritizing trade opportunities for U.S. companies. It directs the executive branch to consider national security, economic security, innovation, and relationships with allies in arms transfer decisions. The AECA, Section 38, authorizes the President to regulate import and export of defense articles through the United States Munitions List (USML) found in federal regulations at 22 CFR 121. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) in Subchapter M, 22 CFR 120-130, further controls the import and export of defense articles. The USML categorizes defense articles and designates \"significant military equipment\" subject to AECA restrictions, with authority delegated to the Secretary of State for administration. The Department of Defense plays a significant role in the sale of defense articles to foreign countries through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which is administered in coordination with the Department of State. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency provides procedures for FMS and other transfers of defense articles and services to foreign entities in its Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM). The Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) is utilized by various military entities and U.S. embassies for coordinating Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases with the State Department. International agreements like the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement impact the transfer of U.S. defense articles. Other agreements such as the NPT, Chemical Weapons Convention, and Biological Weapons Convention may also restrict exports of defense-related material. The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is an informal association of countries aiming to reduce systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Established in 1987, it now includes 35 countries that agree on common export guidelines and a list of controlled items. The MTCR Equipment, Software, and Technology Annex contains a list of controlled items necessary for systems capable of delivering nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Partner countries exercise restraint in transfers on a case-by-case basis. The State Department administers the U.S. implementation of the MTCR, incorporating guidelines into regulations. The Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies aim to promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of weapons and dual-use technologies. It includes control lists for weapons and dual-use technologies, incorporating the Wassennar Arrangement into the ITAR and USML. The Department of Commerce is responsible for maintaining a list of controlled items, foreign persons, and end-uses under the Export Control Act of 2018. The legislation aims to establish and maintain a list of controlled items, foreign persons, and end-uses threatening U.S. national security. It directs the Commerce Department to require export licenses, monitor shipments, and prohibit unauthorized transfers. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program facilitates arms delivery to eligible foreign purchasers, authorized under the AECA and overseen by the State Department. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program facilitates arms delivery to eligible foreign purchasers through an annual Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ) for security assistance. DOD serves as an intermediary for foreign partners' acquisition of U.S. defense articles and services, following the Total Package Approach and DFARS regulations. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program allows eligible foreign purchasers to procure defense articles through DOD following U.S. government procedures. Purchasers must pay in U.S. dollars, with credit financing available under certain circumstances. DOS can fund FMS cases using Foreign Military Financing appropriations. When a country decides to purchase a U.S. defense article or service, they start by submitting a letter of request (LOR) to a U.S. security cooperation organization (SCO) or directly to DSCA or an implementing agency (IA). The IA is typically a military department or DOD agency. The LOR can be submitted in-country or through the country's military and diplomatic personnel in the United States. DOD remains neutral on whether a country buys U.S.-origin items. The President has discretion to designate military end-items for sale exclusively through FMS channels. The U.S. SCO transmits LORs to relevant agencies for consideration and export licensing. Responses include P&A data, LOAs, and other actions. If the IA recommends disapproval, DSCA coordinates with DOS and notifies the customer. The LOA is the legal instrument used by the USG to sell defense articles and services to eligible purchasers. It itemizes the offerings and becomes an official tender once implemented. Signed LOAs and their amendments are referred to as \"FMS cases.\" The State Department sends a report on LOAs offering major defense equipment valued at $1 million or more within 60 days after the end of a quarter. The Implementing Agency (IA) takes action to process FMS cases once the purchaser signs the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) and provides necessary documentation and initial deposit. FMS cases include defined order, blanket order, and cooperative logistics supply support arrangement (CLSSA) for sales of major defense articles. CLSSA provides repair parts and services after delivery, while defined order and blanket order cases differ in item security control and listing. The Implementing Agency (IA) processes FMS cases including defined order, blanket order, and CLSSA for sales of defense articles. Case execution involves acquisition, logistics, maintenance, training, financial management, and documentation. It is the longest phase of the FMS case life cycle. Case managers assigned to IAs track FMS delivery status and maintain records of case transactions. FMS records are typically unclassified and include various documents such as production schedules, shipping documents, and billing records. All financial and logistical transactions must be documented in the official case file. LOA requirements are met through existing U.S. military logistics systems, ensuring logistics support for the expected service life of items provided, including spare parts. The scope of FMS cases may be amended to accommodate changes in item service life and spare parts support. Amendments are necessary when changes require purchaser acceptance. Scope changes occur when the original purpose of a case line or note changes. In FMS cases, changes to the original purpose may require modifications without purchaser acceptance. Defense articles are shipped to foreign partners through third-party freight forwarding companies. The U.S. government and purchaser's advanced planning for transportation is crucial. Purchasers are responsible for transportation and delivery, with the option to use DOD distribution capabilities or employ a Foreign Military Sales freight forwarder. Purchasers can use a Foreign Military Sales freight forwarder to manage transportation from the continental United States to their desired destination. They are responsible for customs clearances and costs associated with deliveries of FMS materiel. Title is transferred upon release from the point of origin, but U.S. government security responsibility continues until the recipient's government representative assumes control. Export licenses are not required for FMS transfers, but U.S. firms can sell defense articles directly to foreign partners with State Department licenses. In DCS, U.S. firms can sell defense articles directly to foreign partners with State Department licenses, without U.S. government involvement in the sale or transfer process. The application for an export license undergoes a review process similar to FMS, assessing foreign policy, national security, human rights, and nonproliferation concerns. To export defense articles or services on the U.S. Munitions List, a U.S. firm must register with the State Department and obtain export licenses following ITAR regulations. The State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs oversees policy, licensing, and compliance to advance national security and foreign policy objectives. The defense firm must obtain an export license from DDTC for marketing efforts involving technical data or temporary export of defense articles. DTSA reviews export licenses for dual-use commodities and munitions items to mitigate national security risks. The ITAR includes exemptions from licensing requirements, some self-executing and others requested or directed. The DOD does not directly administer sales or facilitate transportation of items purchased under DCS, but may accommodate a U.S. defense firm's preference for DCS. DSCA considers various factors before approving DCS preference for a specific transaction. The DSCA considers factors for DCS preference in specific transactions, including restrictions on blanket orders and items sold with systems. FMS procedures may be necessary for sales to certain countries or financed with MAP or FMF funds. DCS preferences are valid for one year, and U.S. firms can request defense articles and services for DCS to foreign entities. Defense articles must be provided under statutory authority like 22 U.S.C. 2770. The SCO chief meets with U.S. defense industry representatives to discuss their experiences in the country and responds to inquiries about reactions from host country officials. The SCO chief alerts embassy staff to observe host country officials' reactions to U.S. defense industry marketing efforts and can pass on these reactions to U.S. industry representatives. The SCO chief's preference is for purchasers to \"buy American,\" but cannot work on behalf of any specific U.S. firm. The SCO chief communicates concerns about marketing efforts not aligning with U.S. defense interests and potential damage to relations. Partners can request Excess Defense Articles from DOD if unable to purchase new U.S. defense articles. EDA program offers excess equipment at reduced or no cost to eligible foreign recipients. The EDA program assists friends and allies by offering excess equipment at reduced or no cost. Requests must be justified to Congress and transfers are considered on a case-by-case basis. Congressional notification is required for significant equipment transfers. Title to EDA items transfers at the point of origin, except for items in Germany. The transfer of defense articles or services involves various stakeholders, from the President and Congress to Security Cooperation Organizations worldwide. Congress oversees arms sales and exports authorized by the President. The Secretaries of State and Defense carry out functions outlined in statutes, regulations, and executive orders under the supervision of the Secretary of State to align with U.S. foreign policy interests. The State Department, under the direction of the Secretary of State, ensures partner and purchaser eligibility for arms transfers and reviews export license requests for items on the United States Munitions List. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) administers arms transfers, providing policy direction for defense articles related to international security, military operations, and defense trade. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) oversees defense strategy, military operations, and defense trade. The Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers (RSAT) manages the sale of U.S. defense articles to foreign governments, ensuring consistency with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. PM/RSAT officers coordinate with other departments, provide recommendations on FMS sales, and work with DOD to make required notifications. U.S. embassy country teams prepare Integrated Country Strategies under the direction of the State Department. The U.S. Ambassador prepares an Integrated Country Strategy (ICS) detailing mission plans for engagements with the host country, including defense education, training, arms transfers, and other cooperation. The senior defense official (SDO) directs the preparation of the defense cooperation portion of ICS. The embassy's Chief of the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC Chief) forecasts and documents the budget for defense cooperation activities. The SDO and ODC Chief report to the geographic combatant command (COCOM) in the operational area where the host nation lies. They balance the COCOM's view of necessary security cooperation and capacity-building. The SDO and ODC Chief may submit recommendations directly to the Head of Mission and COCOM. Service representatives in large ODCs can submit service-specific forecasts and budgets. Countries receiving U.S. defense articles have similar organizations in their embassies. They interact with State Department, DOD officials, and defense contractors for pre-LOR or pre-DCS actions. DOD plays a central role in shaping arms sales policy and implementing arms transfers. DOD Directive 5132.03 outlines DOD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security Cooperation. The Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) within DOD security cooperation balances U.S. strategic imperatives with host nation military engagement. Regional COCOM's country cooperation plans drive specific transfers of defense articles and services. The COCOM's plans drive specific transfers of defense articles and services, considering the host nation's security environment, political will, and absorptive capacity. Recommendations for arms transfers are passed to the CJCS and USD(P) for inclusion in integrated country and regional strategies, identifying obstacles to execution such as security cooperation authorities or resource shortfalls. The CJCS provides military advice on security cooperation to the Secretary of Defense. The CJCS and USD(P) work on addressing obstacles to campaign plan execution identified by COCOMs. The USD(P) represents DOD in security assistance matters and sets priorities, while the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency leads security cooperation efforts. This officer provides guidance on executing security cooperation programs and manages Title 10 and 22 programs under DSCA's responsibility. DSCA manages Title 10 and 22 programs, coordinates foreign disclosure and sales policies, and implements security cooperation programs on behalf of the Department of State. The State Department arbitrates among stakeholders and interests to ensure end-use monitoring for defense articles under the Arms Export Control Act. The program provides end-use monitoring for defense articles and services sold, leased, or exported under the act to ensure compliance with U.S. government requirements. Blue Lantern is for Direct Commercial Sales, Golden Sentry is for Foreign Military Sales, and Enhanced EUM is conducted for specialized physical security. The State Department's Directorate for Defense Trade Controls administers the Blue Lantern program, which includes pre-license, post-license, and post-shipment checks. The Blue Lantern program, administered by the State Department's Directorate for Defense Trade Controls, conducts pre-license, post-license, and post-shipment checks to verify the legitimacy of defense export transactions. In FY2018, 466 Blue Lantern checks were initiated in over 70 countries, resulting in 168 cases labeled as \"unfavorable.\" The Defense Security Cooperation Agency administers DOD's Golden Sentry program, the FMS counterpart of State's Blue Lantern program. Golden Sentry ensures compliance with technology control requirements and monitors the use, transfer, and security of defense articles and services. DOD's Security Cooperation Organizations must observe and report any potential misuse or unauthorized transfer of FMS articles or services quarterly to relevant authorities. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency administers the Golden Sentry program to monitor the use and security of defense articles and services. SCOs must conduct quarterly checks and report to DSCA. Enhanced End-Use Monitoring is required for security-sensitive items, with SCOs verifying them annually. The ultimate goal of the United States, as stated in the AECA, is a world free from war. The United States aims for a world free from war and encourages regional arms control and disarmament agreements. Arms transfers are seen as necessary for international peace and security. The current Administration policy is focused on bolstering the security of the U.S. and its allies. The policy outlined in NSPM-10 aims to enhance security for the United States and its allies, prevent proliferation, and participate in nonproliferation agreements. It commits to meeting all relevant statutes, prioritizes increasing trade opportunities for US companies, emphasizes a strong defense industrial base, and links economic security to national security and defense. Congress may review current sales practices. Congress may consider reformulating the goals of the Arms Export Control Act to align with current national security needs, including the impact on the defense industrial base and national technical industrial base. Additionally, the value of U.S. arms production and exports should be assessed in relation to overall U.S. exports. In FY2018, foreign entities purchased $47.71 billion in FMS cases and privately contracted DCS authorizations totaled $136.6 billion. Congress may question if this level of arms sales aligns with statutory intent. The FAA and AECA emphasize promoting peace and security through self-help and mutual aid, ensuring sales are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and recipient country's capabilities. Section 1 of the AECA limits U.S. arms sales to levels existing when enacted, ensuring that the aggregate value of defense articles and services sold or licensed in any fiscal year does not exceed current levels. Congress may review the impact of arms sales on social and economic development and arms races. Some critics of current EUM programs point to a potential disparity between the number of defense articles exported and the number of EUM investigations completed. In FY2018, DDTC authorized 35,779 export license applications, while DOS initiated 466 Blue Lantern checks in over 70 countries, representing approximately 1.3 percent of adjudicated license applications. The State Department employed five full-time employees and six contractors to administer the program. The U.S. government has programs in place to ensure proper end use of exported defense articles, with defense manufacturers responsible for compliance. Congress has amended laws to limit the sale and export of U.S. defense articles to certain foreign countries. Additional limitations are enacted through annual appropriations acts. The U.S. government has programs to ensure proper end use of exported defense articles, with manufacturers responsible for compliance. Laws limit the sale and export of U.S. defense articles to certain countries, with additional restrictions in annual appropriations acts. Restrictions include prohibiting security assistance to countries with consistent human rights violations and to foreign security force units with evidence of gross human rights violations. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 prohibit assistance and licensing for military equipment sales to countries with human rights violations, including the use of child soldiers and trafficking in persons. These laws apply to U.S.-funded transactions and restrict security assistance to noncompliant countries. Restrictions on exporting munitions items to countries supporting terrorism and those not cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts. Prohibitions do not apply to transactions subject to reporting requirements. Section 830 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act required the Secretary of Defense to comply with restrictions on foreign military sales. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the use of firm fixed-price contracts for Foreign Military Sales. Restrictions on exporting goods to Libya, Middle East countries (excluding Israel), and West Bank/Gaza are outlined in various acts. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act mandated firm fixed-price contracts for Foreign Military Sales. Restrictions on exporting goods to Libya, Middle East countries (excluding Israel), and West Bank/Gaza are outlined in various acts, including prohibitions on selling defense articles or services to those who transfer proscribed weapons to Palestinian entities in the West Bank or Gaza. The United States Government is prohibited from selling defense articles or services to countries or organizations that support the Arab League boycott of Israel. Additionally, funds for defense sales to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were restricted until they paid their commitments from Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The AECA imposes restrictions on the export of defense items related to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. These controls are detailed in the CRS Report R41916 by Ian F. Fergusson and Paul K. Kerr."
