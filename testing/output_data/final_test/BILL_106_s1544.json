Total costs of capital projects for Recovery Implementation Programs are covered. The Recovery Implementation Programs under this Act have a funding limit of $100,000,000, with specific allocations for projects in the Upper Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River. The Secretary can adjust these amounts for inflation annually. Additionally, the Secretary can accept contributions from Upper Division States for capital projects. The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior may utilize non-Federal contributions for capital projects costs, with a limit of $17,000,000 each. Power revenues collected under the Colorado River Storage Project Act can also be used for these purposes, with an additional limit of $17,000,000. The additional funding from the Colorado Water Conservation Board Construction Fund may be provided to the Western Area Power Administration through loans instead of using power revenues for storage project repayments. Repayment of the loans will start in fiscal year 2012, subject to an agreement between the Colorado Water Conservation Board, Western Area Power Administration, and Bureau of Reclamation. Loan contracts will be negotiated in consultation with Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects Firm Power Contractors. The agreement and loan contracts aim to minimize impacts on power rates and ensure loan repayment to the Colorado Water Conservation Board by September 30, 2057. The Western Area Power Administration can adjust power rates to cover necessary expenses. Contributions will be additional to replacement power costs and water capital costs, not exceeding $20,000,000. Starting in the first fiscal year after the Act's enactment, the Secretary may use power revenues for the Colorado River Storage Project. The Bureau of Reclamation will use power revenues from the Colorado River Storage Project Act for annual base funding contributions to Recovery Implementation Programs. Contributions for Endangered Fish Species and San Juan River programs are capped at $4,000,000 and $2,000,000 per year respectively, adjusted for inflation. The use of power revenues for base funding will end after fiscal year 2011. The base funding from power revenues for Recovery Implementation Programs will cease after fiscal year 2011 unless reauthorized by Congress. The Secretary must submit a report on power revenue utilization by the end of fiscal year 2008 and make a recommendation for continued funding if needed. The Western Area Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation must maintain sufficient revenues in the Colorado River Basin Fund for base funding obligations. The Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation will request appropriations if the Colorado River Basin Fund is insufficient to meet obligations. Unexpended funds for capital projects will be retained for future use. The Secretary has the authority to enter into agreements.
