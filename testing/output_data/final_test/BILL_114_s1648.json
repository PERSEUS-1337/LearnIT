    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act\". Congress finds that 55 rural hospitals have closed in the US since January 2010, with 283 hospitals at risk of closure in 2014. Inpatient volume is a significant factor in the financial performance of rural hospitals, with many at-risk hospitals having low daily bed census. The closure of rural hospitals has adverse impacts on the local economy and access to emergency medical care. The closure of rural hospitals has significant economic and healthcare implications. A study in 2014 estimated that 283 at-risk hospitals could result in the loss of 36,000 health care jobs, 50,000 community jobs, and $10.6 billion in gross domestic product. Additionally, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the US occur in rural areas, where only 15 percent of the population resides. Time is crucial in emergency medicine, with the \"golden hour\" being a critical period for successful outcomes. The disproportionate percentage of trauma deaths in rural areas is likely due to response time and distance to emergency rooms. With more rural hospitals closing, access to emergency services is limited, increasing the need for patients to travel longer distances for care. The creation of a rural emergency hospital designation under Medicare allows rural facilities to provide emergency services without inpatient beds. Rural emergency hospitals can convert inpatient space for various medical services like observation care, skilled nursing, infusion services, and telemedicine. The Rural Emergency Hospital Program allows rural emergency hospitals to provide outpatient services in addition to inpatient care. The term 'rural emergency hospital' refers to a facility that was a critical access hospital or a hospital with not more than 50 beds located in a rural area as of December 31, 2014. The term 'rural emergency hospital' refers to a facility that provides 24-hour emergency medical care, does not have acute care inpatient beds, has protocols for patient transfers, is designated as a rural emergency hospital, has state approval, and is certified by the Secretary. The term 'rural emergency hospital outpatient services' refers to medical services provided on an outpatient basis by a rural emergency hospital. Payment for these services is addressed in Section 1833(a) of the Social Security Act. Payment for rural emergency hospital outpatient services is set at 110 percent of the amount described in section 1834(r) of the Social Security Act. Payment for rural emergency hospital outpatient services is set at 110 percent of the reasonable costs, including telehealth services. Payment for transportation services from a rural emergency hospital to a hospital is also set at 110 percent of the reasonable costs. No payment under this subsection for rural emergency hospitals unless state-approved designation and facility certification. The Secretary will certify a facility as a rural emergency hospital if it meets specific criteria and is verified by the American College of Surgeons as a level IV trauma center or higher. The facility must meet specific criteria to be certified as a rural emergency hospital, including employing healthcare professionals who completed the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course, having a transfer agreement with a level I or II trauma center, and meeting staff training and certification requirements set by the Secretary. Coinsurance may also apply. The amount of payment for rural emergency hospital services or transportation services may be reduced by coinsurance as calculated in a similar manner to outpatient critical access hospital services. The waiver of distance requirement for replacement CAHs and redesignation of rural emergency hospitals as CAHs allows states to waive the distance requirement for critical access hospitals certified as rural emergency hospitals. The Secretary may conduct studies to evaluate the impact of rural hospitals seeking redesignation as critical access hospitals. The Secretary shall conduct 3 studies to evaluate the impact of rural emergency hospitals on healthcare availability and outcomes in rural areas. The studies will be conducted 2, 5, and 10 years after the enactment of this Act, with reports submitted to Congress within 6 months of each study. The amendments made by this section will apply to items and services provided one year after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4 amends the Public Health Service Act to include emergency medicine provided by physicians in rural emergency hospitals. SEC. 5 permits hospitals with approved residency programs in emergency medicine to count time spent by interns and residents in the emergency department of a rural hospital in full-time equivalent count. Amendment to the Social Security Act allows interns and residents in emergency medicine from hospitals with approved residency programs to include time spent in patient care activities in rural hospitals for full-time equivalent count. Amendment to the Social Security Act allows interns and residents in emergency medicine from hospitals with approved residency programs to include time spent in the emergency department of rural hospitals for full-time equivalent count. Amendment to the Social Security Act allows interns and residents in emergency medicine from hospitals with approved residency programs to count time spent in the emergency department of rural hospitals towards full-time equivalency if the rural hospital covers the training costs."
