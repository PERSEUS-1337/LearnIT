Congress finds that the United States is falling behind in the global economy due to a lack of well-trained individuals in mathematics, science, and technology. The country is producing fewer graduates in these fields compared to other nations like China and Japan. In the United States, only 32 percent of undergraduates receive degrees in science and engineering. US students lag behind other countries in math and science assessments, ranking 21st out of 40 in general knowledge and 28th out of 40 in math literacy. Each state in the US has its own set of education standards. In the United States, each State has its own standards and curriculum for math and science education in K-12. Less than 40% of grade 4 students and only 17% of grade 12 students reach national math proficiency levels. About 1/3 of grade 4 and 8 students, and nearly 1/2 of grade 12 students, do not reach basic science levels according to recent assessments. The National Academy of Sciences recommends actions to improve America's economic future. The National Academy of Sciences recommends the Department of Education collect effective K-12 materials for a voluntary national curriculum to ensure students have the skills to compete in a global economy. Develop voluntary national expectations for mathematics and science education in kindergarten through grade 12. The Secretary of Education will contract the National Academy of Sciences to create national expectations for math and science education from kindergarten to grade 12. The panel overseeing this will consist of members with expertise in education policy, math, or science curriculum development. The National Academy of Sciences will ensure that the panel overseeing national expectations for math and science education is broadly representative of scientists, practitioners, educators, parents, and experts in education. A majority of the panel members must be parents involved in K-12 education, and educators and parents should proportionately represent different demographic areas. The panel overseeing national expectations for math and science education will identify core ideas common to all states and develop a set of voluntary national expectations based on effective state standards or national science education standards. The National Science Teacher Association and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics have developed standards for math education. The panel will develop voluntary national expectations based on effective state standards or national science education standards. They will also identify teaching materials and create sample assessment questions for teachers to use throughout the school year. The Secretary of Education will distribute voluntary national expectations, promising practices, and sample assessment questions to educational agencies and schools. They will also coordinate professional development criteria for teachers to incorporate these expectations into their classroom instruction. The contract for panel members specifies compensation based on level IV of the Executive Schedule under title 5, United States Code. Officers or employees of the United States serve without additional compensation. Members are also reimbursed for travel expenses. The panel members are compensated based on the Executive Schedule under title 5, United States Code, and are reimbursed for travel expenses. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. The Secretary of Education awards grants to State educational agencies to develop instructional materials for teaching mathematics and science based on national expectations. State agencies must ensure online access to these materials for teachers and school staff. The Secretary of Education awards grants to State educational agencies to train teachers in using instructional materials for math and science education. Grants are based on the number of students served by each agency. The Secretary of Education awards grants to State educational agencies based on student population. State agencies must submit applications detailing planned activities and submit a report on grant results within 60 days after the grant period. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for this program. SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\nThe Secretary of Education will study the impact of national expectations for math and science education on student achievement compared to State standards. A report will be submitted to Congress annually."
