TITLE III--ENHANCED RESCISSIONS\n\nSEC. 301. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN PROPOSED RESCISSIONS. Part B of title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended to include expedited consideration of certain proposed rescissions. Sec. 1013 allows the President to propose rescinding budget authority provided in an appropriations Act by transmitting a special message to Congress within 3 days of enactment. The proposed rescission can only be done once and cannot be repeated under this section or section 1012. The President can propose rescinding budget authority from multiple subcommittees in an appropriation Act by sending separate special messages. The proposed rescission cannot exceed 25% of the amount appropriated for a particular program, project, or activity. The President can propose rescinding budget authority from specific programs, projects, or activities in an appropriation Act, not exceeding 25% of the allocated amount. The limitation applies only to authorized programs. Procedures for expedited consideration require the introduction of a draft bill or joint resolution within two days of receiving a special message in Congress. On the third day of continuous session after receiving a special message, any Member of the House can introduce a bill or joint resolution. The bill will be referred to the Committee on Appropriations, which must report it without substantive revision within seven days. If the committee fails to do so, it will be discharged, and the bill will be placed on the calendar. The bill or joint resolution must be voted on within 10 days of introduction in the House, and if passed, it is engrossed, certified, and transmitted to the other House on the same day. A bill or joint resolution transmitted to the House of Representatives or the Senate must be referred to the Committee on Appropriations, which must report it without substantive revision within seven days. Failure to do so results in automatic discharge from consideration, and the bill is placed on the appropriate calendar for a vote on final passage. The House of Representatives or the Senate must refer a bill or joint resolution to the Committee on Appropriations, which must report it within seven days. If agreed upon, the engrossed bill is returned to the originating House. Motion to proceed with consideration is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and not debatable. Amendments to the motion are not allowed. Debate in the House of Representatives on a bill or joint resolution under this section shall not exceed 4 hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing the bill. Appeals from decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the Rules of the House of Representatives to the procedure are allowed. Consideration of a bill or joint resolution under this section shall be decided without debate in the House of Representatives.

Debate in the Senate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection with a bill or joint resolution under this section shall be limited to 1 hour, divided between the mover and the manager of the bill. Additional time can be allotted by the leaders. The Senate limits debate time on debatable motions or appeals for bills or joint resolutions. Amendments are prohibited, and any rescinded budget authority must be made available for obligation. The text chunk discusses the availability of funds for obligation after a bill is defeated in Congress. Definitions for \"appropriation Act\" and \"continuity of a session\" are provided.
