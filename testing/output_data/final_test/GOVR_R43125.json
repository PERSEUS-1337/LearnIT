    "content": "With the end of the Cold War and breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the United States focused on controlling surplus nuclear weapons material, particularly plutonium from Soviet warheads. Congress has been involved in formulating U.S. policy on surplus plutonium disposition and funding necessary facilities. The Obama Administration proposed ending construction of plutonium disposition facilities in South Carolina and pursuing a \"dilute and dispose\" option in its FY2017 budget request. The Trump Administration also proposed changes in this area. The United States and Russia agreed to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium under the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA) to prevent theft or diversion for nuclear weapons. Two disposal methods were available: converting to mixed oxide (MOX) fuel or immobilizing and disposing of it. Russia showed little interest in permanent immobilization or burning in reactors, preferring other options. The United States and Russia agreed to convert surplus weapons-grade plutonium under the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA). The Bush Administration decided to focus on converting almost all surplus plutonium to MOX fuel instead of pursuing both immobilization and MOX fuel. The PMDA Protocol, effective from July 13, 2011, renewed the commitment to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium. Both countries agreed to start plutonium disposition in 2018, with the United States pledging $400 million to support the Russian plutonium. The United States pledged $400 million to support Russian plutonium disposition in 2018. The program is administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and includes the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at DOE's Savannah River Site. The estimated cost of MFFF rose from $1 billion in 2002 to $7.78 billion by 2014. The cost of the MOX fuel program for plutonium disposition rose to $30 billion by 2015, leading DOE to deem the approach unviable within available resources. Construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was slowed down in FY2013 and FY2014 for evaluation of other options. DOE planned to put MFFF in \"cold standby\" in FY2015, reducing funding for the U.S. plutonium disposition program. Congress rejected this plan in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act and the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act required DOE to analyze alternative disposition approaches for the MOX fuel program. Aerospace Corporation was contracted to conduct the required analyses, revealing that the MOX approach would be significantly more expensive than anticipated, requiring $800 million to $1 billion annually for decades. The DOE budget justification states that the MOX project will be terminated due to its high cost of $800 million to $1 billion annually. Funding for the project will be reduced from $340.0 million to $270.0 million to develop a termination plan. Congress approved $15 million for planning the dilute and dispose option, while also allocating $335 million to continue MFFF construction in FY2017. The Trump Administration supported terminating the MOX project in favor of the dilute and dispose strategy in FY2018. The Defense Authorization Act requires DOE to continue MFFF construction unless a cheaper alternative for plutonium disposal is found. The House passed a bill providing $340 million for MFFF construction in FY2018 and prohibits using MOX funding to terminate the project. The Senate accepted $270 million for the project in FY2018. The Water Development Appropriations bill (S. 1609) accepted the Administration's request for $270 million to terminate MFFF construction and included $9 million for alternative plutonium disposal planning. The proposals by the Obama and Trump Administrations to cancel the MOX fuel disposition path have raised questions about the need for Russian government approval. Amendments to the PMDA in 2010 may allow for more flexibility in choosing disposition paths, but any future changes would still require a written agreement by both parties. Article 12 of the PMDA established a Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) to address implementation issues, with the Department of State chairing the U.S. side and DOE participating. The JCC is where any changes to the agreed methods would be decided. U.S. officials believe that a proposed change to a dilute and dispose method falls under the category of \"any other methods\" in Article 3.1. After a decision is made on the U.S. program, the proposal would be brought to the JCC for evaluation by both the U.S. and Russian sides. The Russian government would determine if a change falls within the current agreement, with the possibility of negotiating a new protocol to the PMDA if needed. Lieutenant General Klotz mentioned a conversation where the Russians acknowledged U.S. flexibility in the past regarding disposal method changes. The United States showed flexibility in 2010 when Russia wanted to change its disposal method. Russian officials, including President Putin, claim the U.S. is not upholding the agreement and suggest the dilute and dispose method may require Russian approval. Some U.S. experts argue that this method could meet nonproliferation goals. Senators Graham and Scott support the current MOX disposition path and believe Russian agreement may be necessary. The U.S. may need Russian agreement before changing the disposition plan, which could be challenging due to the poor political climate between the two countries. The DOE's Plutonium Disposition Red Team believes the U.S. has a reasonable position for negotiations with Russia. Lieutenant General Klotz mentioned the various political and strategic factors involved in discussions with Russia. The Russian president issued an executive order suspending Russian participation in the PMDA due to U.S. \"hostile actions\" and lack of assurance on plutonium disposition obligations. Conditions for Russia's return include changes to NATO force structure and compensation for economic sanctions. Russia's foreign minister's statement warns against using force, sanctions, and ultimatums, while keeping 34 metric tons of plutonium out of weapons use. Russia promised not to use its surplus plutonium for weapons and plans to use fast reactors for plutonium disposition. The BN-600 and BN-800 reactors are not configured to breed plutonium. Russia plans to use fast reactors for plutonium disposition, with the BN-800 reactor set to switch to 100% MOX fuel in 2019. Russia holds 52.8 tons of separated civilian plutonium, with negotiations ongoing between the United States, Russia, and the IAEA on verification and disposition of 34 metric tons of plutonium in each country. Discussions are led by the Department of State's Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. The Russian Surplus Fissile Materials Disposition program, led by NNSA, aims to provide $400 million to help Russia dispose of surplus weapons plutonium. However, no funds have been requested since FY2013. DOE requested $10.174 million for the program in FY2012, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1 million, which was enacted. The Committee specified that no funding should support research on the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor in Russia. The United States committed $400 million to help Russia dispose of excess weapon-grade plutonium, but funding is on hold until NNSA provides details on how the money will be spent and the milestones Russia must meet. The funds are intended for technical support, oversight of disposal work, and verification activities. No funds have been requested for the Russian plutonium disposition program since FY2013. The U.S. committed $400 million to assist Russia with disposing of excess weapon-grade plutonium. NNSA plans to use prior-year funds for support in FY2015. Russia is expected to fund the remaining $2 billion for the program. The U.S. Plutonium Disposition Program aims to blend surplus plutonium with uranium to create MOX fuel for commercial reactors, reducing its weapons usability. The U.S. Plutonium Disposition Program planned to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus weapons plutonium by making MOX fuel. An additional 7.1 metric tons of plutonium from retired nuclear weapons pits and 6 metric tons of non-pit plutonium were also proposed for disposal. The 6 metric tons of non-pit plutonium will be diluted and disposed of at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The process involves disassembling plutonium \"pits\" from nuclear weapons, converting the plutonium metal to plutonium oxide for use as nuclear reactor fuel. The NNSA produced 442 kilograms of plutonium oxide at Los Alamos National Laboratory and began production at the Savannah River Site. Plutonium oxide would be blended with uranium to create fuel rods for commercial power reactors at the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility. The facility, designed to convert up to 3.5 metric tons of plutonium per year into MOX fuel, received a construction permit in 2005 and began construction in 2007. The use of MOX fuel in U.S. nuclear plants has faced challenges in getting utilities to commit due to differences from conventional uranium fuel. Dominion and Duke are no longer involved, while TVA is evaluating the use of MOX fuel at Browns Ferry and Sequoyah Nuclear Plants without a commitment yet. Selection of reactors is crucial as MOX fuel assemblies must be tailored to fit specific reactors. The MOX fuel assemblies must be designed to fit specific reactors like Browns Ferry and Sequoyah. The construction cost estimate for the MOX plutonium disposition program's Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) increased from $1 billion in 2002 to $4.8 billion by 2007 due to management weaknesses and changes in project scope. The construction cost estimate for the MOX plutonium disposition program's Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) increased to $4.8 billion by 2007, with $100 million attributed to congressional funding delays. Congress required MFFF to produce 1 metric ton of MOX fuel by the end of 2008 and complete 34 metric tons of plutonium conversion by January 1, 2019. The deadline for starting MOX production was extended to January 1, 2014, and a reevaluation of the plutonium disposition program was announced in the FY2014 budget submission. The construction cost estimate for the MOX plutonium disposition program's Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) increased to $7.78 billion in the FY2014 budget submission to Congress. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) cited reasons for cost increases including DOE's approval of estimates when design was incomplete, equipment installation costs, supplier difficulties, staff turnover, and project scope changes. MFFF had consistent delays due to various issues. The Obama Administration slowed the MOX project in FY2013 and FY2014 due to cost increases and considered alternative plutonium disposition strategies. The total lifecycle cost of the MOX disposition option rose to $30 billion in FY2015, making the MOX fuel approach not viable within available resources. The project will be placed in cold stand-by while further studying implementation and costs of completing the plutonium disposition mission. The Plutonium Disposition Working Group's report in April 2014 outlined cost and schedule estimates for various options to complete the plutonium disposition mission more efficiently. Options included irradiation of MOX fuel in light water reactors, irradiation in fast reactors, immobilization with high-level waste, downblending and disposal, and deep borehole disposal. Construction funding for MFFF was proposed to be cut under the Administration's FY2015 request. The FY2015 request proposed cutting construction funding for the MFFF facility from $402.7 million to $196.0 million, placing it in \"cold standby.\" Congress rejected this and appropriated $345 million to continue construction at a reduced level. DOE requested $345 million for FY2016 to continue construction pending a decision based on a new study. The MFFF project currently employs about 1,700 workers. The Department of Energy proposed halting further construction of the MFFF project in FY2017 due to the conclusion that the dilute and dispose option would be faster and cheaper than the MOX fuel option. This decision would result in releasing about 500 craft personnel and 750 salaried personnel. DOE also planned to conduct pre-conceptual design work for diluting surplus plutonium and disposing of it during FY2016 and FY2017. The Department of Energy planned to conduct design work in FY2016 and FY2017 for diluting surplus plutonium and disposing of it in a deep geologic repository. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request endorsed the dilute and dispose option, but full-year appropriations were pending. The debate over the effectiveness of plutonium disposition programs in achieving nonproliferation goals continues. Some critics oppose the use of plutonium in power generation. The use of plutonium in power generation is a contentious issue, with concerns about its potential for nuclear weapons development. The debate also includes the effectiveness of the Russian disposition program for plutonium and the role of fast reactors in breeding or burning plutonium. The United States negotiated restrictions on producing new plutonium in fast reactors using plutonium fuel to prevent breeding new plutonium. Russia agreed to similar restrictions in the 2010 Protocol. Critics argue that the high cost of the plutonium disposition program is funded from the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation budget, diverting funds from other nonproliferation programs. Non-governmental nonproliferation experts, such as Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund, have raised concerns about funding for unnecessary programs like the MOX program, which diverts money from vital nonproliferation efforts. In June 2012, an amendment to redirect funds from the U.S. MOX program to the Global Threat Reduction Initiative was proposed but not enacted. This has sparked debate within the executive branch about the program's purpose. The U.S. plutonium disposition program aims to render weapons-grade plutonium unusable for nuclear weapons through mutual verification. The American Nuclear Society supports the program for nonproliferation reasons. Recent public debate has focused on budget trade-offs and concerns about economic losses and indefinite storage of plutonium. National concerns include the impact on Russian obligations to dispose of excess weapons plutonium if the U.S. program is halted or delayed. The Russian decision to suspend cooperation in October 2016 may impact U.S. implementation of the plutonium disposition program. Alternatives to MOX fuel production have been proposed due to cost and management challenges. The Obama and Trump administrations have both supported the dilute-and-dispose option for plutonium disposition. According to the 2010 Protocol amending the PMDA, the United States would need Russia's agreement to use an alternative method for plutonium disposition. The House Committee on Armed Services expressed concerns about the escalating costs of the MOX facility but suggested that budget cuts may not reduce costs and could delay the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium. The committee directed NNSA to study cost savings, consider international partners, and explore using surplus plutonium for disposition. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the FY2014 defense authorization bill, including a funding cut for construction. Congress appropriated $526.1 million for Fissile Materials Disposition in FY2014, with a $59.2 million reprogramming from the International Material Protection and Cooperation account. South Carolina filed a lawsuit to block DOE from placing MFFF in cold standby and to continue construction in FY2014. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314) was enacted to ensure that plutonium placed in South Carolina is not for long-term storage but for temporary storage for MOX processing. South Carolina lawmakers emphasize the need for a definite schedule for removing surplus plutonium from other weapons complex facilities. Plutonium made into MOX fuel would be sent to commercial nuclear power plants, while alternatives like immobilization in glass lack a clear removal plan due to the absence of a federal high-level waste storage facility. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314) mandates the temporary storage of plutonium in South Carolina for MOX processing. There are concerns about meeting MOX fuel fabrication deadlines and penalties for missing them, including potential fines if plutonium is not processed into MOX fuel by 2022. DOE has acknowledged that it will not meet the 2014 MOX production deadline as required by the act. The Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it will not meet the 2014 MOX production deadline in P.L. 112-239. As a result, DOE has suspended further transfers of defense plutonium to the MOX facility in South Carolina and will submit a report to Congress on options for removing an equal amount of defense plutonium from the state."
