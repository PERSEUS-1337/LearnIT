    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Heart Disease Education, Analysis and Research, and Treatment for Women Act\" or the \"HEART for Women Act\". Congress finds that heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death among women, with minority women at higher risk but less aware of it. There is a lack of awareness among healthcare providers about this issue, leading to women being less likely to receive certain treatments.

Drug effectiveness and metabolism differ between women and men, impacting successful treatment.
