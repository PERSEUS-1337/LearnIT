    "content": "The \"Instructional Leadership Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The Congress recognizes the importance of school principals being instructional leaders, as outlined in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Despite this, there is a lack of attention and resources dedicated to developing these skills. Despite the recognition of the importance of instructional leadership for school principals in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, there is a lack of commitment to training and supporting principals in this area. Licensure and certification processes do not adequately emphasize instructional leadership skills, and the term \"highly qualified principal\" should be redefined to include a strong focus on instructional leadership. SEC. 1851 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 introduces competitive grants for instructional leadership. The Secretary will provide competitive grants to eligible entities to develop innovative programs and sites for training school principals in instructional leadership skills, including effective instructional practices, school vision development, curriculum alignment, teacher evaluation, assessment integration, technology use, and data analysis for improving classroom instruction. The Secretary will provide grants for pilot programs to develop and implement instructional leadership standards for principal certification. Grants will be awarded for a 2-year period, with the possibility of a 2-year extension. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary for consideration. Eligible entities, including State educational agencies, local educational agencies, nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and partnerships/consortiums, must apply to the Secretary for grants to develop instructional leadership standards for principal certification. Recipients of grants must report results to the Secretary as required. The concept of a highly qualified principal will be revised based on these reports. The Secretary will establish a definition of a 'highly qualified principal' emphasizing instructional leadership standards, considering the need for principals to demonstrate knowledge, engage in professional development, and lead in establishing professional learning. The text chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for establishing and maintaining a professional learning community that uses data to improve instruction and student achievement. The text chunk focuses on \"Part I--Instructional Leadership\"."
