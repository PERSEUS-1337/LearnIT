The \"Military Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2013\" amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to provide victims of military crimes with specific rights, including the right to participate in court-martial proceedings, the right not to be excluded from public hearings, the right to be heard at public proceedings, the right to confer with trial counsel, the right to restitution, the right to proceedings free from delay, and the right to be treated fairly. The \"Military Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2013\" amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to provide victims of military crimes with specific rights, including the right to be treated with fairness, dignity, and privacy in court-martial proceedings. Military judges must ensure victims are afforded these rights and make every effort to allow their attendance at the proceedings.

Victims, their representatives, and trial counsel can assert these rights, and notice of release may be withheld if it endangers safety. The \"Military Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2013\" amends the Uniform Code of Military Justice to ensure victims of military crimes are notified of their rights. In cases with multiple victims, the military judge must establish a procedure to uphold victims' rights without complicating proceedings. Victims' rights must be asserted in the court-martial where the accused is being prosecuted, and any denial of relief can be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Criminal Appeals must decide on applications within 72 hours. Proceedings cannot be delayed for more than five days. The Government can appeal the denial of a victim's right in a case. Failure to provide a right does not warrant a new trial. Victims can request to re-open a plea or sentence if they have asserted their right to be heard. In cases where a victim's right to be heard is denied, they can petition the Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of mandamus within 14 days. This right is not applicable if the accused has already pled to the highest offense charged. The section does not allow for a cause of action for damages or impose any duty on the United States or its officers. Additionally, in cases involving victims under 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, special provisions apply. In cases involving victims under 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, legal guardians or representatives appointed by the military judge may assume the victim's rights. The accused cannot be named as a guardian or representative. The Secretary of Defense must modify the Manual for Courts-Martial within one year to enforce victims' rights of military crimes and ensure compliance with obligations specified in section 806b of title 10, United States Code. This includes appointing legal guardians for victims under 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, with the accused prohibited from being named as a guardian. The Secretary of Defense must designate an administrative authority to handle complaints regarding victims' rights of military crimes, implement training for personnel to comply with section 806b of title 10, United States Code, and enforce disciplinary sanctions. The Secretary of Defense must enforce disciplinary sanctions, including termination, for non-compliance with section 806b of title 10, United States Code. Additionally, mechanisms are in place for the Secretary to arbitrate complaints from victims of military crimes regarding their rights under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."
