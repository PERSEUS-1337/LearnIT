    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tamarisk Control and Riparian Restoration Act\". Congress acknowledges the severe drought in the western United States, leading to economic losses, wildlife impacts, and increased wildfire risks. Tamarisk, a non-native plant, occupies vast land and consumes a significant amount of water, surpassing the needs of valuable native vegetation. Scientists have established that tamarisk infestations can increase soil and water salinity, flood risks, wildfire potential, diminish human enjoyment of the river environment, and adversely affect wildlife habitat and biodiversity. Innovative approaches are needed to address increasing water demand amidst drought conditions and legal water supply requirements. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"program\" refers to the Tamarisk Assistance Program under section 5. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation. The term \"State\" includes specific states and any other state affected by tamarisk as determined by the assessment in section 4. The Secretary must assess tamarisk invasion in the western US within 180 days, including research on control methods, cost estimates, affected states, and infested acreage. The Secretary will establish the Tamarisk Assistance Program to provide grants to States for tamarisk control projects based on infested acreage. States receiving grants must designate a lead agency to administer the program and establish priorities for fund distribution. Entities involved in the Tamarisk Assistance Program include the National Invasive Species Council, Invasive Species Advisory Committee, Indian tribes with weed management entities, institutions of higher education, State agencies, nonprofit organizations, and soil and water conservation districts actively working on tamarisk control. Grant recipients must meet conditions set by the lead State agency. Grant recipients must provide necessary project information to the lead State agency. Not more than 10% of the grant amount can be used for administrative expenses. The Federal share of project costs should not exceed 75%, with the non-Federal share covered by various entities. A report on project purposes and results must be submitted to the Secretary within 180 days for eligibility for additional grants. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for subsequent years."
