    "title": "AB 1548",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Medical Marijuana Tax Law, known as Part 13.5, is added to Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. It includes definitions for terms like \"cultivator,\" \"distribution,\" \"licensed distributor,\" and \"sale.\" On and after the operative date set forth in Section 31030, a tax is imposed on cultivators for distributing marijuana flowers, leaves, and immature plants at specific rates per ounce. The licensed distributor collects the tax from the cultivator and states the amount separately on the purchase order. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office will review tax levels under this part every other year starting in 2018 and make recommendations to the Legislature on adjustments for public safety and environmental impacts. The board administers and collects the tax imposed by this part in accordance with the Fee Collection Procedures Law. The tax collected by the licensed distributor constitutes debts owed to the state. The board administers and collects the tax imposed by this part. A cultivator is liable for the tax until paid to the state, with payment to the licensed distributor relieving further liability. Any tax collected but not remitted to the board is a debt owed to the state by the distributor. The board may enforce regulations on implementation, administration, and enforcement, including applicant requirements, collections, reporting, refunds, and appeals. The board has the authority to enforce emergency regulations to implement the tax laws. These regulations must be adopted in accordance with the Government Code. The tax is due quarterly and must be paid by the last day of the following month. A return for each quarter must be filed with the board by the same deadline. The Marijuana Production and Environment Mitigation Fund is created in the State Treasury to receive taxes collected by the board. Returns must be authenticated as prescribed, and all funds deposited are continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years. The Marijuana Production and Environment Mitigation Fund receives taxes collected by the board, with 35% allocated to the Department of Food and Agriculture for local law enforcement activities related to illegal marijuana cultivation through a competitive grant process. Guidelines for the grant process must be established by April 1, 2017. The Natural Resources Agency receives 35% of the Marijuana Production and Environment Mitigation Fund to fund a grant program for environmental cleanup and restoration of lands damaged by illegal marijuana cultivation. Funds will be prioritized based on the level of damages, with at least 35% for public lands and 20% for private lands. The agency will partner with counties, cities, and nonprofit organizations for these projects. The Natural Resources Agency will partner with various entities, including nonprofit organizations and federal agencies, to award grants for environmental cleanup and restoration. Guidelines for the grant process will be established by April 1, 2017. The Department of Fish and Wildlife and State Water Resources Control Board pilot project receives thirty percent of revenue for addressing environmental impacts of marijuana cultivation. A report on total revenue collected must be submitted to the Legislature within 180 days after a two-year period. The part will become operative after adequate funding is received by the board. Funds for activities will be advanced as a loan and repaid from tax proceeds within six months. The board will notify when the condition is met. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
