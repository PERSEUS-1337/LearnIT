    "content": "Energy tax policy utilizes tax subsidies and increased taxes to influence energy resource allocation and achieve policy goals. Since the 1970s, energy tax policy has gained more attention due to recurring energy-related issues like oil embargoes, price shocks, and environmental concerns. Policymakers have increasingly turned to energy taxes and subsidies to address these challenges, with numerous bills introduced in Congress to amend energy tax policy. In the 108th Congress, over 200 bills were introduced to amend energy tax policy directly or indirectly affecting costs in the energy industry. Energy tax incentives and subsidies have been a dominant part of recent comprehensive energy policy legislation, with changes in taxes resulting from incentives having significant economic effects. The emergence of an \"energy crisis\" in the 107th and 108th Congresses led to proposed comprehensive energy policy reform bills in response to various challenges in the energy sector. Several comprehensive energy policy reform bills were proposed in response to an \"energy crisis\" in the 108th Congress. These bills aimed to stimulate oil and gas production, reduce petroleum import dependence, expand electricity supply, promote energy conservation, and increase the supply of alternative fuels. The failure of the legislation led to the expiration of energy tax incentives in 2003, prompting the enactment of retroactive extensions in 2004 through the Working Families Tax Relief Act. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included about $5 billion in energy tax incentives, while the failed comprehensive legislation H.R. 6 (108th Congress) had roughly $17 billion in tax breaks that were not enacted. Energy tax incentives from previous years were repackaged in H.R. 6 (109th Congress), providing $8.1 billion in energy tax cuts over ten years. The Senate is expected to vote on a bill that offers about $17 billion in energy tax subsidies. The Senate Finance Committee approved a bill providing $17 billion in energy tax subsidies, focusing more on energy conservation and alternative fuels. President Bush's FY2006 budget proposed a $6.7 billion energy tax incentives package. Recent actions in energy tax policy also involved taxation, such as proposals to suspend motor fuels excise taxes during price spikes. There are also bills to reinstate the crude oil windfall profit tax to reduce profits earned by oil companies. Proposals to amend federal tax treatment of the energy industry, impose energy taxes, or provide tax subsidies raise important economic and public policy issues regarding the nation's energy problems. These issues include excessive demand, insufficient supply, market failures, and barriers in petroleum, natural gas, and electricity markets. The text discusses problems in the energy markets, specifically petroleum, natural gas, and electricity. It raises questions about the seriousness of growing petroleum import dependence and suggests using tax policy instruments to address this issue. It also questions how changes in tax burdens should be achieved, whether through tax credits, deductions, exemptions, or reducing tax rates. Additionally, it explores the federal tax treatment of the energy industry, including investments in oil and gas wells, coal mines, and exploration costs, and examines the impact of federal tax subsidies on the industry. The text discusses federal tax subsidies for the energy industry, questioning their impact on production, consumption, and renewable energy development. It also explores tax code considerations for mineral reserves depletion and the potential effects of tax reform proposals on the energy sector. This report examines the economic effects of energy taxes and subsidies in the oil and gas sectors, focusing on promoting fossil fuel conservation through incentives for energy efficiency and alternative energy sources. It provides background on tax policy theory and market failure in the energy sector, offering insights for policymakers on improving energy tax interventions. The report discusses energy tax policy interventions to improve energy market functioning and economic efficiency. Table 1 summarizes energy market failures and tax policy remedies suggested by economists. It addresses the need for government intervention in energy markets through the tax code. Energy is a commodity produced to provide utility to consumers, derived from depletable mineral resources like crude oil and coal. This uniqueness requires selective conservation policies to address market failures and ensure economic efficiency. The competitive market system requires production decisions to be made in an inter-temporal framework, raising the question of optimal resource depletion over time. Energy production generates adverse environmental effects and pollution, leading to market failures in producing and using optimal energy quantities for maximizing social well-being. Energy is a major factor of production that impacts the macro-economy, with changes in energy prices having the potential to affect markets, GDP, employment, interest rates, and inflation. Historical examples include the 1973 oil embargo causing a recession and the 1970s oil price increase leading to stagflation. The tax system for producers of depletable resources should be aligned with non-energy producers to maximize profits over finite resources. This includes basing depreciation deductions on economic depreciation, capitalizing exploration and development drilling expenditures, and calculating depletion allowances based on the actual decline in economic value of the mineral deposit. The tax treatment of mineral producers includes deductions for drilling costs, depletion allowances, and tax subsidies for oil and gas production. This differs from a neutral income tax system that would not distort resource allocation. The tax treatment of mineral producers includes deductions for drilling costs and depletion allowances, with tax subsidies for oil and gas production. These subsidies can lead to increased investments in locating reserves, more profitable production, and accelerated depletion of resources, diverting resources from other economic activities. A shift to a neutral tax system could negatively impact smaller oil and gas companies focused on onshore exploration. The energy markets can experience market failure due to externalities, leading to a misallocation of resources. These externalities, such as non-market costs or benefits, are not accounted for in market prices, resulting in inefficient resource allocation. Without government intervention, there are no economic incentives to address these externalities, causing markets to fail in establishing energy prices equal to marginal costs. The presence of externalities in energy markets can lead to market failure and inefficient resource allocation. This can result in inaccurate cost/price signals, preventing the achievement of the socially optimal output mix. Externalities suggest the need for either an energy tax or subsidy to address negative or positive production externalities. Environmental damage, particularly air pollution from energy production and consumption activities, is a significant negative externality. Air pollution from energy production and consumption activities, including mining, transportation, refining, and industrial use of oil, gas, and coal, leads to environmental damages such as water pollution, landscape destruction, and health issues. Combustion of fossil fuels in power plants and by consumers also contributes to harmful emissions and health problems. These external costs impose uncompensated burdens on society. The text discusses air pollution caused by the combustion of fossil fuels in transportation, industrial, and residential sectors. It suggests implementing an emissions tax as a market-based instrument to address the external costs of pollution. The tax would reflect the damages caused by harmful emissions to third parties and the environment. The text discusses various pollution taxes, such as the tax on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the black-lung excise tax on coal. It also mentions proposed energy taxes based on the quantity of polluting fuel used, with rates varying based on the external cost generated by each fuel. Oil, gas, and renewable energy resources like hydropower could be taxed at low rates or exempt, based on environmental impact. Examples include carbon tax and Btu tax, with rates determined by carbon content of fossil fuels. An energy tax on vehicle fuel could serve as a proxy for a pure tailpipe emissions tax, in addition to existing motor fuel excise taxes. The Btu tax is an energy tax based on the heat content of fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. It is a flat excise tax on all forms of energy, with rates determined by the Btu content of each fuel type. The Btu tax is a flat excise tax based on the heat content of fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. A $1 million Btu tax would impose taxes on oil, natural gas, coal, and gasoline. Petroleum imports have increased to over 60% of U.S. consumption. The BTU tax is a flat excise tax based on the heat content of fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas. Petroleum imports have increased to over 60% of U.S. consumption. External costs associated with petroleum importation include weakened defense posture, military vulnerability, increased resources for national defense, and economic and social costs in the event of an oil embargo or price spikes. The text discusses the economic implications of oil embargoes and price spikes, suggesting a tax on imported petroleum to address distortions. Alternative policies like tax incentives for domestic production are considered due to potential trade agreement violations. The vulnerability to embargoes and price shocks, particularly from OPEC, is distinct from import dependence and could be mitigated by stockpiling oil. Some argue that oil price volatility may lead to market failure. Oil price volatility can lead to market failure by increasing investment risks in oil and gas extraction. Historical events like the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo and the 1978-79 Iranian turmoil caused significant oil price spikes and supply disruptions. These events highlight the potential impact of geopolitical factors on global oil markets. The 1978-79 Iranian turmoil led to a significant decrease in oil production, causing panic buying and substantial oil price hikes. Crude oil prices more than doubled from $10/barrel to over $24/barrel, reaching $36/barrel by 1980. This period saw a 2,200% increase in crude oil prices. From 1986-1999, oil prices declined, benefiting consumers and the economy but harming the domestic oil industry and producing regions in the US. Prices averaged $17/barrel, fluctuating between $12 and $20/barrel. In December 1998, prices hit a low of $8/barrel, one of the lowest in history after adjusting for inflation. By summer 1999, prices recovered to $20/barrel, peaking at over $30/barrel in summer 2000 due to OPEC output reductions and increased energy demand from growing economies, particularly in Asia. Prices remained high in November 2000 at $30.30/barrel but fell in December after OPEC, which produced 42% of the world's oil in 2004. During the winter of 2002-2003, crude oil prices increased due to anticipated war with Iraq, political upheaval in Venezuela and Nigeria, major oil producers. Prices have recently reached $60/barrel, remaining above $50 for months, increasing investor risk in the energy industry and inhibiting investments in alternative energy resources and energy efficiency. The fluctuation of energy prices in the market is a normal occurrence, with some resources being more volatile than others. To address excessive fluctuations that may pose risks to energy, economic, or national security, economists suggest stabilizing oil prices through measures like a variable oil import tax. Energy taxes can also serve as a user fee, charging taxpayers for the benefits they receive from public goods like highways. The tax on energy can be used as a user fee for the benefits received from highways, but it may not accurately reflect the true costs of using the infrastructure. Highway trust fund revenues are also allocated for mass transit, leading to motorists subsidizing other users. Pricing the use of roads to account for specific externalities like congestion may be a more efficient solution. Positive externalities, such as research and development (R&D) in energy technologies, lead to unpriced benefits for third parties. This results in underinvestment by individual firms as they do not capture the full returns, with some benefits going to free riders. Incentives for improving energy efficiency in building equipment may be lacking due to gains accruing to other firms. Research to improve building or equipment efficiency can lead to positive externalities, where social returns exceed private returns. Subsidies are warranted to align production costs with social benefits, resulting in innovations in energy efficiency and reductions in alternative energy prices. Tax subsidies and government expenditures for energy R&D support these technologies. The subsidy amount would be based on the benefits per unit of the commodity traded. The value of benefits per unit of commodity traded, proportional to spillover, is important in determining subsidies for energy R&D. There is no need for a differential subsidy for energy R&D compared to non-energy R&D. Proposals for incentives or subsidies for oil, gas, and alternative fuels are often based on the idea of government support during tough times, such as the drop in oil prices in the 1980s and 1998-99. The 1998-99 proposals focused on production tax credits for marginal oil, included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. A $500 million package of loan guarantees for small independent oil and gas producers was enacted in August 1999. There is no economic justification for using tax subsidies as an industrial policy to help distressed industries. The government may provide subsidies to industries facing economic hardships, market failures, or externalities. The crude oil markets, influenced by OPEC, are not perfectly competitive but are more competitive now than before. An industrial policy is not an efficient way to stimulate employment. Some argue that high interest rates may lead to excessive depletion of mineral resources, causing environmental damage and reducing future living standards. However, economic theory and evidence suggest that competitive markets do not lead to excessive exploitation of resources. The argument suggests policies to lower interest rates, eliminate federal tax subsidies for nonrenewable resources, and impose a federal severance tax. Energy taxes on producers and consumers factoring in external costs like air pollution would help conserve energy by raising prices and reducing demand. This would lead to a decline in energy consumption through direct responses like reducing miles driven and indoor temperatures. Energy conservation can be achieved by reducing miles driven and indoor temperatures, as well as using more energy-efficient technologies. Fossil fuels have higher external costs, making it crucial to shift towards energy-efficient options. Energy taxes may not be necessary in the long term as depletion of exhaustible resources will naturally increase conventional energy prices, making energy-efficient technologies more profitable. This would lead to increased investment in energy-efficient solutions like housing and automobiles. Economists argue that additional taxes or subsidies are not economically justified to promote energy conservation or efficiency, as the competitive market system already leads to optimal energy resource production and use. There is generally no market failure in energy use or investment in energy-using technologies that would require such interventions. Government intervention in energy conservation may be justified due to market failures, such as lack of financial incentives for tenants and landlords to invest in energy-efficient equipment. Tenants are unlikely to improve energy efficiency in rental housing without ownership. Tenants are unlikely to invest in energy efficiency in rental housing without ownership, as they may not stay long enough to benefit from the savings. Landlords may struggle to recover costs from energy conservation investments due to tenants' energy consumption habits. Individual metering may not incentivize landlords to make energy-efficient upgrades unless they can charge higher rents for lower utility costs. Market failures in rental housing may lead to underinvestment in conservation measures, prompting landlords to pass on energy costs as part of rents instead of making conservation investments. Individual metering can be costly and may not fully eliminate distortions, as landlords may struggle to recover costs. This economic rationale supports the Internal Revenue Code \u00a7136, which allows for energy conservation subsidies in rental housing. The Internal Revenue Code \u00a7136 allows energy conservation subsidies from electric utilities to be excluded from gross income, benefiting both owner-occupied and rental housing. Market failures in energy use may necessitate minimum efficiency standards or government-provided information to address the lack of knowledge on energy-efficiency investments, especially in older homes. Market failures in energy use may require government-provided information or efficiency standards to address asymmetric information between energy consumers and manufacturers of energy efficient equipment. This can lead to a lack of incentive for producers to create higher efficiency products, despite potential high returns. Low-income consumers may face challenges in accessing efficient products in competitive capital markets. Low-income consumers may struggle to obtain loans for profitable conservation investments, suggesting a need for low or zero-interest rate loans or weatherization grants. Higher energy prices from taxes on conventional energy could spur investment in alternative fuels, leading to reduced demand for conventional fuels. Alternative energy could gain a price advantage through technological advances, even without increases in conventional fuel prices. Energy conservation and alternative energy technologies do not face market failures, and the private market system efficiently develops energy solutions with sufficient profit incentives. The market ensures the commercialization of the most cost-effective alternatives first, adjusting quickly to market dynamics. Challenges for alternative fuels in the market stem from competitive pricing issues relative to conventional fuels, often due to low oil prices or high capital costs for alternative fuel technologies. The cost of alternative energy technologies is high compared to conventional fuels like coal and natural gas. For example, upgrading coal-fired units costs 2.0\u00c2\u00a2/kWh, while investing in advanced natural gas technology costs about 3.5\u00c2\u00a2/kWh. In contrast, alternative energy sources like photovoltaics, small hydroelectric, solar thermal power, wind power, and biomass have higher cost/KWh due to their significantly higher capital costs. The higher capital costs of alternative energy resources compared to conventional fuels can inhibit their development. Volatile oil prices increase investor risk, affecting profitability. Tax subsidies for alternative fuels are seen as a costly and inefficient policy to address these risks. Tax subsidies for alternative fuels, like solar and wind energy, are considered necessary to level the playing field with fossil fuels. However, past subsidies for oil and gas have kept prices low and discouraged alternative fuel development. Current oil and gas tax subsidies do not significantly impact the energy market's competitive structure. The structure of the energy market has changed since the 1970s, with oil prices being determined in a competitive world market. Current oil and gas tax subsidies are smaller than historical levels and have little impact on the competitiveness of alternative fuels. Energy taxes have been proposed for fiscal reasons. Energy taxes have been proposed for fiscal reasons, including generating revenues for deficit reduction. The first federal gasoline tax was enacted in 1932 to cushion federal deficits during the Great Depression. Energy tax proposals were common during the 1982-1993 period due to budget deficits from tax cuts and economic challenges. Various energy taxes were suggested, such as increasing excise taxes on fuels, imposing taxes on imported and domestically produced oil, and implementing a general energy tax. The federal gasoline tax was increased in 1982, 1990, and 1993. There is no distinct fiscal rationale for a federal energy tax as a source of general fund financing or deficit reduction. Federal programs should be financed by general income or consumption taxes, which are less distortive and more equitable. Income taxes distort the choice between work and leisure, as well as consuming and saving for the future. Efficiency enhancing taxes, like an externality correcting energy tax, could replace distortional taxes in a revenue neutral way, leading to gains in efficiency and potential revenue. For example, a carbon emissions tax or a gasoline tax could generate substantial revenue and improve environmental outcomes. A gasoline tax could address external costs of driving, reduce income tax distortions, promote efficiency, conserve petroleum, reduce pollution, and encourage alternative fuels. The development of alternative fuels without a large cost to the federal budget could be achieved through energy taxes and subsidies as efficient alternatives to regulations for environmental policy. Regulations, while ensuring environmental goals are met, can be more costly and less economically efficient than taxes or tradeable emissions permits. Regulations can be less economically efficient than taxes or tradeable emissions permits. For example, a regulation requiring electric utility generators to be at least 45% energy-efficient would lead most utilities to invest in the advanced combined-cycle natural gas system (ACCNG), which is the cheapest and most energy-efficient technology available. This standard would result in the same behavioral response regardless of differences in costs for reducing air emissions. While the ACCNG technology is the least costly option meeting the 45% energy efficiency standard, it may not be the most cost-effective strategy for every utility due to varying pollution control costs based on technology and pollutant type. Differences in site characteristics and design also impact the ease and cost of emissions reduction, leading to disparities in pollution abatement costs among firms. The varying pollution abatement costs among utilities lead to different strategies for reducing emissions from power plants. Market-based approaches may result in higher total costs compared to a tax system that incentivizes each polluter to reduce pollution in the most cost-effective way. The lower marginal abatement costs of reducing pollution would lead to more pollution abatement by utilities, minimizing total abatement costs. Tax revenues could compensate harmed parties. Using a tax allows utilities to choose cost-effective technologies for emissions control. Tradeable emission permits offer an efficient alternative to taxes for environmental protection. The tradeable emission permit system, also known as \"cap-and-trade,\" requires emitters to have permits to emit a fixed amount of pollutants. These permits can be traded among emitters in the marketplace, allowing for flexibility in meeting emission targets and reducing costs. The tradeable emission permit system, also known as \"cap-and-trade,\" allows firms to choose between abatement or purchasing permits based on their marginal abatement costs. This approach achieves pollution control at lower costs and is economically efficient. Tradable permits fix the level of aggregate pollution and let the price adjust, while an emissions tax fixes the price and lets the quantity of pollution vary. Tradeable permits may be more appealing in certain situations, while an emissions tax approach may be preferable in others. Tradeable permits provide authorities with greater control over pollution levels compared to emissions taxes. They are considered superior when pollution reaches critical levels and require no knowledge of external costs or abatement costs. Additionally, tradeable permits avoid the information problem associated with emissions taxes and are not affected by inflation. Tradeable permits offer more control over pollution levels compared to emissions taxes. They do not require knowledge of external costs or abatement costs, avoid the information problem, and are not affected by inflation. Monitoring emissions is simpler with a small number of polluters, like with SO2 emissions from electric utilities. However, as the number of polluters increases, the complexity and transaction costs also increase, making emissions taxes more appealing for cases like CO2 emissions with millions of sources. Market-based approaches to environmental protection show economic efficiency advantages. Market-based approaches to environmental protection, such as the tradeable permit system mandated by the Clean Air Act, have been successful in controlling emissions of sulfur dioxide by electric utilities. Tradable permits are also being considered for controlling greenhouse gases globally. Energy taxes and subsidies can impact energy prices, economic growth, income distribution, and international trade, making them powerful policy instruments. Energy taxes and subsidies are powerful policy instruments that can correct resource allocation distortions, generate tax revenues, and address external costs. Selective energy excise taxes can reduce economic efficiency, leading to lower output and living standards. Taxing energy at a higher rate than other commodities lacks a separate equity case. Nonrenewable resources create economic rents when produced due to their finite stock. Economic rents, also known as scarcity rents, are generated when resources are produced. These rents are expected to increase at the rate of interest to achieve market equilibrium. Energy taxes on consumers can have negative distributional consequences, disproportionately affecting lower incomes. Energy tax subsidies, like the \u00a729 tax credit for non-conventional energy resources, can distort resource allocation and have adverse distributional effects. Increases in energy taxes can reduce aggregate output and employment, leading to a temporary increase in inflation. Taxes on final energy demand, like gasoline tax hikes, are less contractionary than industry energy taxes. Taxes on oil can raise energy prices and result in cutbacks in industrial energy use. Increases in energy taxes, such as an oil import tax, can lead to significant cutbacks in industrial energy use and production inputs, causing a temporary slowdown in economic growth similar to an oil price shock."
