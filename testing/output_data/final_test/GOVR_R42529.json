    "content": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been crucial for transatlantic security since 1949. The 112th Congress could influence the alliance's future direction and U.S. policy. Key issues include NATO operations in Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and the Balkans, allied military capabilities, missile defense, nuclear force posture, relations with non-NATO members, and implementing the 2010 Strategic Concept. NATO has achieved strategic goals and faced challenges. Allies adopted a new Strategic Concept in Lisbon, outlining core tasks of collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. Issues include maintaining nuclear and conventional forces for defense, developing ballistic missile defense, and debates over U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe. NATO's ability to defend member states could be compromised by \"out-of-area\" operations and unconventional security threats. Operations in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Libya showed NATO's crisis management capacity but also revealed military capability shortfalls. Some allies want to transition from combat operations in Afghanistan faster, raising doubts about alliance solidarity for future missions. NATO aims to strengthen relations with non-member states and other multilateral institutions for cooperative security. NATO seeks to enhance relations with non-NATO states and multilateral institutions for regional cooperation. Disagreements with key partners like Russia persist, while budget constraints challenge alliance capabilities. European allies face budget cuts, potentially hindering their ability to meet security objectives and NATO's collective goals. The upcoming NATO summit in Chicago on May 20-21 will address concerns about the current transatlantic burden-sharing situation, with the United States contributing over two-thirds of alliance defense spending. Budget constraints and planned U.S. troop withdrawals from Europe raise questions about future U.S. commitments to European security. The upcoming NATO summit in Chicago will focus on defining the next phase of transition in Afghanistan, maintaining military capabilities through \"Smart Defense,\" enhancing partnerships with non-NATO states, and discussing the results of the Deterrence and Defense Posture Review. Membership invitations are not expected to be issued, but future commitments could be reaffirmed. Leaders will also work on transitioning security responsibility to Afghans by the end of 2014 and defining NATO's role in the process. The upcoming NATO summit in Chicago will focus on transitioning security responsibility to Afghans by the end of 2014 and defining NATO's role in the country post-changeover. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen mentioned that 22 non-NATO partners interested in stabilizing Afghanistan will attend the Summit. The absence of Pakistan, a significant regional actor, could pose challenges for NATO in securing cooperation from Afghanistan's neighbors. U.S. and NATO officials have outlined three priorities for Chicago: identifying milestones in 2013 for transitioning from combat to support, defining appropriate strategies for training Afghan forces, and assisting Afghan authorities. The upcoming NATO summit in Chicago will focus on transitioning security responsibility to Afghans by the end of 2014 and defining NATO's role in the country post-changeover. NATO officials emphasize the importance of maintaining some level of combat forces in Afghanistan throughout 2014, even after Afghan forces have taken lead responsibility for security. Statements by alliance leaders had led to speculation about an accelerated withdrawal, but NATO officials say that a further withdrawal of forces in 2013 is in line with existing transition plans. Afghan forces have taken lead security responsibility over half of the population, with plans to reach 75% by the end of Tranche 3. NATO forces will shift to a supporting role, focusing on training Afghan forces. Efforts are being made to raise funds to sustain the Afghan National Security Forces beyond 2014, estimated to cost $4.1 billion annually. The United States seeks $1.3 billion annually from allies for Afghan support, with the Afghan government expected to contribute $500 million. NATO's post-2014 involvement in Afghanistan is uncertain, with some member states signing agreements for future commitments. President Karzai has requested international support for a 10-year \"transformation\" period. NATO member states face public opposition to continued combat role in Afghanistan. 128,961 troops from 50 countries, with the US having the largest deployment. Concerns about European allies' ability to project power due to financial problems. US concerned about European defense spending and capabilities. European NATO members face challenges in defense capabilities, with 70% unable to deploy abroad. Only three allies meet NATO's defense spending goal. Shortfalls in key capabilities hinder European militaries, with analysts criticizing inefficiencies in defense spending and a fragmented defense industry. In Chicago, NATO allies are expected to commit to a \"Smart Defense\" initiative for cooperative defense efforts. Up to 20 multinational defense projects will be announced, focusing on pooling assets for acquisition, training, force protection, ISR, and logistics cooperation. This initiative aims to enhance defense capabilities, following previous post-Cold War NATO initiatives with mixed success. The Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system will be acquired by a group of 13 allies, providing five Global Hawk drones for joint use by the alliance starting in 2015. This acquisition, a priority for the U.S., will give European members a unique capability used in the Libya operation. Other projects to be highlighted in Chicago include NATO-wide missile defense and the Baltic Air Policing Mission. Allies may need to make bold spending decisions to prioritize collective alliance needs. The NATO alliance is prioritizing collective needs by disbanding legacy capabilities to fund alliance priorities. This includes investing in missile defense radars on Dutch frigates and implementing the Connected Forces Initiative to enhance military cooperation through education, training, joint exercises, and technology utilization. The initiative aims to increase joint exercises through the NATO Response Force, a multinational rapid reaction force. After the withdrawal of two Brigade Combat Teams from Europe, combat units from an American-based brigade will train with the NATO Response Force (NRF) in Europe. The Obama Administration and allied governments cite NATO's 2011 mission in Libya as a successful example of transatlantic defense cooperation, where European allies took the leading role. However, the Libya mission revealed shortcomings in allied capabilities, with the United States having to compensate for shortages in targeting specialists and key supplies. European allies also lacked critical enabling capabilities such as aerial refueling tankers. Despite lacking critical capabilities like aerial refueling tankers and ISR, European allies, with U.S. assistance, had only about 40% of the needed aircraft for intercepting electronic communications in Libya. Key European allies, particularly France and the UK, rank among the most capable militaries globally. Many European allies have undergone defense transformation initiatives, with the EU exploring greater defense integration and asset pooling as a solution to resource shortages. NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been involved in these efforts. NATO allies are considering European defense as a solution to resource constraints. A Deterrence and Defense Posture Review (DDPR) is underway to assess NATO's readiness. Disagreements exist within the alliance regarding the future role of nuclear weapons. Ellen Tauscher testified to Congress about these issues in November 2011. The State Department's Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security, Ellen Tauscher, reiterated NATO's commitment to remaining a nuclear alliance. Debates within the alliance are ongoing, with a focus on U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe. Despite discussions, significant changes in force posture are not expected at the upcoming Chicago Summit. NATO remains a nuclear alliance with non-strategic nuclear weapons deployed in five allied countries. Russia has around 3,800 operational non-strategic nuclear weapons. There are debates within the alliance about the need for these weapons in Europe, with some European leaders calling for their removal. Some German government members and NATO's Strategic Concept suggest reducing U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe, citing the expired rationale post-Warsaw Pact collapse. The goal is to seek Russian agreement for transparency and relocation of these weapons away from NATO territory. NATO's partnerships with non-NATO member states and other multilateral institutions are a key agenda item at the Chicago Summit. U.S. and NATO officials emphasize the importance of working with regional and international partners for shared security objectives. 22 non-NATO members are participating in NATO's Afghanistan mission, contributing militarily and financially. As NATO faces security challenges beyond Europe, it may increasingly rely on regional partners for assistance. NATO aims to enhance coordination with European partners like Sweden and Finland, who are significant contributors to NATO operations but not members due to political reasons. The ongoing reform of NATO's partnership programs seeks to streamline initiatives and engage with partners more flexibly. NATO's partnership programs include the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Partnership for Peace Program, Mediterranean Dialogue, Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and relations with global partners like Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. Reforms aim to provide all partners with access to 1,600 partnership activities through a streamlined \"Partnership and Cooperation Menu\" with a focus on training and security sector support. NATO is also developing flexible cooperation formats for addressing security issues beyond existing frameworks, such as counter-piracy operations and cybersecurity. Relations with Russia are a key focus. Relations with Russia are a central component of debates over NATO's future. NATO-Russia relations are not expected to figure prominently on the Chicago Summit's agenda, especially since Russian President Vladimir is not attending the meeting. Some observers view the diminished level of Russian participation in Chicago as a telling sign of ongoing disagreements between the two sides on issues such as NATO's planned territorial missile defense system for Europe and Georgia's territorial integrity. Russian leaders have engaged in hostile rhetoric toward NATO, and some NATO member states have criticized the Russian government's treatment of political protesters. Russian Chief of General Staff Nikolai Makarov suggested preemptive force against NATO missile defense installations if NATO proceeds without cooperation. NATO and U.S. officials emphasize successful cooperation in various areas, including Afghanistan. Russia allows NATO to use supply routes and agrees to enhance training for Afghan and regional forces. According to U.S. officials, Russia has allowed NATO to use supply routes on its territory and has agreed to increase training for Afghan and regional counter-narcotics officers. Over 42,000 cargo containers have transited Russia as a result of the agreement. Negotiations are ongoing to expand the transit arrangement for increased NATO supply transit out of Afghanistan. Russian helicopters with civilian crews are providing transport in Afghanistan, and a Helicopter Maintenance Trust Fund was established by the NATO-Russia Council in 2011. NATO and U.S. officials emphasize their opposition to Russian policies conflicting with alliance values, such as not recognizing a Russian sphere of influence outside its borders and rejecting Russia's recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions. There are concerns among some NATO allies about Russia's view of NATO as a security threat and unresolved issues affecting NATO-Russia relations. Baltic states and Poland worry that NATO's engagement with Russia may signal a lack of resolve against Russian behavior. NATO's open door policy on membership is based on Article 10 of the alliance's founding treaty. NATO enlargement is not a major focus at the Chicago Summit. NATO's post-Cold War enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe has been a key factor in their transition to democratic governance. Some allied governments argue that NATO has enlarged too quickly and should resolve issues before taking in new members. Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have joined NATO, while Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have been offered membership plans. Macedonia's NATO membership candidacy has been stalled due to a dispute with Greece over its name. Despite meeting qualifications, Greece has blocked its invitation. The issue remains unresolved despite U.N.-sponsored talks. Georgia and Ukraine's potential NATO membership has caused controversy, with no specified timeline for their inclusion. The conflict and renunciation of NATO membership aspirations by Ukraine's current government have reduced the membership prospects for Georgia and Ukraine in the short- and medium-term. The unresolved situation in South Ossetia and Abkhazia poses a major obstacle to Georgian membership. Congress has influenced U.S. policy towards NATO and members of the 112th Congress have shown interest in key agenda items for the NATO Summit in Chicago. Proposed legislation, The NATO Enhancement Act of 2012, endorses NATO. The NATO Enhancement Act of 2012 (S. 2177 and H.R. 4243) endorses NATO enlargement to the Balkans and Georgia, reaffirms NATO's role as a nuclear alliance, and calls for further allied contributions to NATO's missile defense capability. Members of Congress have urged the U.S. Administration and NATO to bring Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, and Montenegro into the alliance. In March 2012, a bipartisan group of 54 Members of the House signed a letter urging President Obama to ensure Macedonia receives a formal invitation to join NATO. Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced legislation cautioning against inviting Macedonia before resolving a dispute with Greece over its name (H.Res. 627). NATO's commitment to Afghanistan post-transition and the implications of accelerated troop withdrawal, as well as the importance of sustaining Afghan National Security Forces after 2014, are key considerations for Congress. Additionally, the extent of NATO's presence in Afghanistan post-2014 and burden-sharing among allied military capabilities are crucial for U.S. security interests. The NATO alliance faces challenges with European allies' defense spending and capabilities, impacting burden-sharing and alliance security. Concerns include commitment to pooling resources, consulting with allies on defense budget cuts, and U.S. perceptions of NATO's effectiveness in the future. The planned withdrawal of two U.S. Army Brigade Combat Teams from Europe may impact NATO's readiness and interoperability. Congress should consider future military operations and alliance readiness, as well as the ongoing debate within NATO allies on force posture. The ongoing debate within NATO includes considerations on the role of U.S. non-strategic nuclear weapons, NATO's evolving territorial missile defense capability, European allied commitment to defense, NATO's partnerships with non-member states and international organizations, and the potential implications of NATO's partnership policy evolution on decision-making procedures and force projection capabilities. Congress may need to assess the appropriate role of non-NATO members in the alliance. Congress may want to consider the appropriate role of non-NATO members in the alliance's political structures and operations, as well as the implications of further NATO enlargement for U.S. and NATO security interests. This includes assessing the costs and benefits of past enlargements and potential future ones, and whether there should be a limit to NATO's \"open door\" policy. Additionally, there is a question of whether the alliance should offer Russia the possibility of membership. The U.S. Administration and some Members of Congress view NATO as the world's preeminent military alliance. NATO has achieved important milestones but faces challenges due to budget constraints and public opposition in European countries. The participation of many European countries in military operations in Afghanistan could shape future NATO operations post-Chicago Summit, influencing the alliance's ability to meet strategic objectives."
