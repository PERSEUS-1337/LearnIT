    "content": "Thirty years after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remains in power through repression and economic prosperity. The CCP rejects reforms that threaten its power and closely monitors sensitive groups like religious congregations, ethnic minorities, and political dissidents using technological advances. The Chinese government closely monitors Tibetan Buddhists and Uyghur Muslims. Despite repressive policies, some reports suggest that many citizens are satisfied with the government's focus on stability and optimistic about the future. Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign has gained popular support. After consolidating power in 2013, Xi Jinping intensified party control over society, strengthened his own control over the party, and backed a constitutional amendment to potentially stay in power indefinitely. Xi has also cultivated a cult of personality through far-reaching campaigns. Since consolidating power in 2013, Xi Jinping has intensified party control over society and strengthened his own leadership. He has launched campaigns for Chinese citizens to study his political philosophy, reflecting a sense of insecurity rather than confidence in the CCP's ability to address threats. The government has introduced laws and policies to enhance party and state authority, including crackdowns on media, academics, and human rights activists. The government crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists, detaining many and convicting over a dozen for various crimes. Environmental activism faces increased constraints as a threat to social stability. New laws since 2015 restrict civil society in the name of national security, control minority and religious groups, and reduce citizen autonomy. Foreign NGOs are now under the Ministry of Public jurisdiction. The Chinese government has implemented new laws since 2015 to restrict civil society, control minority and religious groups, and reduce citizen autonomy. These laws include placing foreign NGOs under the Ministry of Public Security's jurisdiction, tightening registration requirements, and imposing greater controls on their activities, funding, and staffing. Additionally, a new Cybersecurity Law grants broad governmental powers to control online traffic for social order and national security purposes, while a National Intelligence Law obliges individuals and organizations to assist state intelligence efforts. President Xi's \"Sinicization\" policy further compels China's actions. The Chinese government has implemented new laws since 2015 to restrict civil society, control minority and religious groups, and reduce citizen autonomy. President Xi's \"Sinicization\" policy aims to compel China's religious practitioners and ethnic minorities to conform to Chinese culture and Communist Party policies. Xi emphasized the protection of religious rights while guarding against overseas infiltrations via religious means. At the 19th Party Congress in 2017, Xi emphasized the need for religions in China to be Chinese in orientation. The Revised Regulations on Religious Affairs, effective since February 2018, emphasize religious and social harmony, and the prevention of extremism and terrorism in China. Despite constitutional guarantees of freedoms like speech and religion, the government under Xi's leadership has tightened control, restricting free speech and targeting journalists and authors through various forms of intimidation and punishment. China has dropped in the World Press Freedom Index, with a recent clampdown on political speech and \"vulgar\" content. Over 60 journalists and bloggers are detained, including Huang Qi sentenced to 12 years for providing state secrets. The government operates extensive internet censorship, blocking access to over 20% of popular websites. Xi Jinping has also increased controls on censorship circumvention tools. Xi Jinping has tightened controls on censorship circumvention tools like VPNs, punishing unauthorized providers and users disseminating sensitive information. VPN use is limited due to slow browsing speeds or lack of interest. China's social and political control methods now include advanced surveillance and big data technologies, violating privacy and restricting freedoms. Chinese authorities have implemented extensive surveillance measures, including facial recognition technology, to monitor ethnic Tibetans, Uyghurs, and regime critics. The government is also developing a social credit system to assess individuals' compliance with rules and regulations. The Chinese government is developing a social credit system to assess individuals' compliance with rules and regulations, which includes measures to incentivize trustworthy conduct and penalize untrustworthy behavior. Untrustworthy citizens may face bans on purchases, travel, job applications, and educational opportunities. The government has been suppressing labor activism in Guangdong province and elsewhere, targeting labor organizers, activists, NGOs, social workers, and journalists. Labor activists, NGOs, social workers, and students in China have been advocating for workers' rights, protesting low pay and unsafe working conditions. In July 2018, workers at Jasic Technology Corporation in Shenzhen went on strike to form a union, leading to other labor unrest for fair wages and better working conditions. Authorities in Beijing have targeted student labor activists at Peking University, with at least 21 members of the Marxist Society under house arrest or missing. The Chinese government has placed members of the Marxist Society under house arrest or surveillance, fearing that student movements could lead to worker protests or social activism. China rejects universal human rights, prioritizing economic development over civil and political rights. China sponsored its first UNHRC in 2017-2019. China sponsored UNHRC resolutions in 2017-2019, emphasizing national sovereignty and the Chinese model of development. President Xi highlighted \"people-centered human rights\" and the right to subsistence. Religious freedom in China varies among its 350 million practitioners. Religious freedom in China varies among its estimated 350 million practitioners, influenced by the party's Sinicization policy and 2018 amendments to the Regulations on Religious Affairs. New policies restrict religious activities, including travel and contacts with foreign organizations, and require venues to promote Chinese culture and socialist values. Christianity is the second-largest religion in China and is steadily growing. China's Sinicization campaign has led to increased pressure on unregistered churches, with hundreds being shut down in recent years. Authorities have removed crosses from nearly 4,000 churches, particularly in provinces with large Christian populations. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that around 1,000 church leaders were briefly detained in 2018. Municipal authorities in Nanjing launched a five-year Sinicization campaign to incorporate Chinese elements into church worship services and architecture. In September 2018, the PRC government and the Vatican reached a breakthrough in negotiations on diplomatic relations. According to a 2018 provisional agreement, Beijing is to recognize the Pope as the head of the Catholic Church in China, the Vatican is to recognize seven excommunicated Chinese bishops appointed by PRC authorities, and China is to appoint future bishops, while the Pope has veto power over their nomination. Some observers have criticized the possible arrangement, which they believe would strengthen state control over Catholics in China. In June 2019, the Vatican asked the PRC government to refrain from harassing Catholic clergy who want to remain loyal to the Pope rather than pledge allegiance to the Chinese Patriotic. Falun Gong, a spiritual exercise with millions of adherents in China, has been harshly suppressed by authorities since 1999. Many practitioners have been sent to \"Legal Education Centers\" or mental health facilities for indoctrination. Authorities in China have arrested and harassed thousands of Falun Gong practitioners for refusing to renounce the spiritual exercise. Judiciary officials in Changsha suspended the licenses of two lawyers for defending Falun Gong. Overseas organizations claim over 4,300 adherents have died in government custody since 1999, with allegations of illegal organ harvesting from detainees. The claims of organ harvesting from Falun Gong detainees are based on circumstantial evidence and interviews. China has made efforts to reform its organ transplant system and outlaw organ trafficking. Overseas Falun Gong organizations allege that organ harvesting continues. The Tibetan Autonomous Region is home to about 2.7 million Tibetans out of China's total ethnic Tibetan population of 6 million. The Dalai Lama advocates for \"genuine autonomy\" without independence. The Dalai Lama advocates for \"genuine autonomy\" without independence in Tibet, but China's leaders view it as \"half independence\" or \"independence in disguise.\" Talks on Tibetan autonomy and the return of the Dalai Lama have been stalled since 2010. TAR authorities have imposed strict controls on Tibetan religious life and culture, including heightened police presence in monasteries and restrictions on the Tibetan language in schools to prevent \"separatist\" activities. Authorities in Tibetan areas have conducted inspections in private homes for Dalai Lama pictures, checked cell phones for Tibetan content, and monitored online posts for political speech. Religious structures and homes at monasteries have been destroyed, and monks and nuns evicted. The Chinese government asserts control over the reincarnation process of Tibetan lamas and the selection of the Dalai Lama's successor. U.S. officials support Tibetans' right to choose their religious leaders freely. 155 Tibetans in China have self-immolated since 2009 in protest against PRC policies. In Xinjiang, Uyghurs face severe restrictions on religious and cultural activities, leading to ethnic unrest and clashes with security personnel. Following the appointment of a new Communist Party Secretary and implementation of stricter security measures, Xinjiang officials intensified security measures. In response to restrictions on religious practice, Xinjiang officials increased security measures targeting the Uyghur population, including tighter movement restrictions, more police kiosks, and extensive surveillance. Biometric data like DNA, blood types, and fingerprints have been collected for identification. Policies aim to assimilate Uyghurs into Han Chinese society and suppress Uyghur, Islamic, and Arabic influences. Regulations prohibit \"extremification\" expressions such as face veils, \"irregular\" beards, and expanding halal practices. Authorities in Xinjiang have banned traditional Uyghur customs, Islamic names, and demolished thousands of mosques. They have also implemented mass internment of Turkic Muslims, detaining up to 1.5 million Uyghurs without formal charges. Additionally, PRC authorities have conscripted citizens to assess loyalty to the Communist Party. The Chinese government has detained up to 1.5 million Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs in re-education centers, where detainees are forced to renounce their religious beliefs, undergo psychological pressure, forced labor, beatings, and food deprivation. Officials claim these centers are for vocational education and training, focusing on Chinese language, PRC law, job skills, and \"de-extremization.\" Some Chinese officials claim most detainees have returned to society, while others state only 500,000 Uyghurs are held in 68 camps. Uyghurs abroad still have missing relatives in Xinjiang. Released individuals may be under house arrest or in state-run factories. The Hui, another Muslim minority, face less government interference. China's new religious policies impact Uyghurs more severely than the Hui. China's new religious policies have affected the Hui and other Muslims outside of Xinjiang, but less severely than the Uyghurs. Authorities in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have ordered mosques to be \"Sinicized\" by removing Islamic motifs and Arabic writings, cancelling Arabic classes, and banning calls to prayer. In Beijing, Arabic signage over Halal food shops has been mandated to be removed. In August 2018, Hui Muslims gathered to block the demolition of a mosque in Weizhou due to its Middle Eastern architectural style. The Chinese government has faced backlash for its religious policies affecting Hui Muslims, with investigations into local officials. Human rights issues in China have strained US-China relations since the Tiananmen Square crackdown, leading to mutual mistrust. US policymakers often view China's human rights violations and authoritarian system with suspicion, while Chinese officials see US concerns as attempts to undermine CCP rule. These tensions over human rights can impact various aspects of the bilateral relationship. Frictions over human rights impact US-China relations, including economics and security. US focuses on China's lack of civil rights, while China emphasizes economic progress and social rights. After Tiananmen Square, US linked human rights to trade status but later shifted to engagement for improved rights.

U.S. officials have also met with Chinese dissidents, the Dalai Lama, and exiled Tibetan officials. The Trump Administration has shifted towards viewing China as a strategic competitor or adversary, reducing government cooperation and emphasizing less on engagement. Critics argue about the effectiveness of this policy in promoting human rights and political freedoms in China. Some critics argue that U.S. credibility on human rights is strengthened when working with allies and international organizations to promote human rights globally and in China. The Trump Administration's efforts in this area have been criticized for inconsistency in its commitment to human rights issues while pursuing other priorities with China, particularly on trade. The Administration has placed less emphasis on existing multilateral institutions and diplomacy in its foreign policy, including human rights.
