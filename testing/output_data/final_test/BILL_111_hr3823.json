Effective October 1, 2010, states must provide alternative coverage options for these children. Effective October 1, 2010, State child health plans must offer any qualified alternative coverage that a qualified entity seeks to provide to targeted low-income children. The plans must establish a uniform financial limitation on the per capita monthly amount paid for alternative coverage, which must be at least 90 percent of the payment for non-alternative coverage under the plan. \"States are not required to fully pay premiums for qualified alternative coverage, can charge additional premiums to cover the cost difference, and can use their own funds to exceed federal financial participation limits. Qualified alternative coverage refers to health insurance that meets specific coverage requirements.\" In this section, a qualified insurer is defined as an entity licensed to offer health insurance coverage in a State. Federal financial participation for qualified alternative coverage includes payment of premiums for such coverage. Payment may be made to a State for the purchase of qualified alternative coverage without limitations on beneficiary cost-sharing. The amount of payment for coverage during a fiscal year is subject to a limitation on federal financial participation. The payment to a State for coverage under a State child health plan is limited based on national per capita expenditure, enhanced FMAP, and the number of targeted low-income children enrolled. States cannot require targeted low-income children to enroll in the plan. The plan may not require targeted low-income children to enroll in specific coverage to receive child health assistance. Before providing assistance, information on available coverage must be made accessible to parents or guardians. Beneficiaries have the option to switch coverage once per fiscal year. A State child health plan must provide information on coverage options, notify potential beneficiaries in writing during enrollment and redeterminations, and post descriptions for accessibility. The State child health plan must provide coverage options, notify beneficiaries in writing, and post descriptions on the official website. States can set limits on cost-sharing, pay part of the beneficiary's costs, and contribute to premiums exceeding set limits.
