Safety issues have been highlighted in both rail and pipeline shipments due to the variability in physical and chemical properties of crude oil. Lighter oils may pose a higher risk of ignition compared to heavier crude oils. Bakken crude oil, also known as North Dakota Light, is a light sweet crude oil high in light-end paraffinic range hydrocarbons. It is easier to process into gasoline and diesel compared to heavier crude oils. Recent incidents have shown that Bakken crude oil may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil, prompting safety alerts from PHMSA. PHMSA's \"Operation Classification\" involves tank car inspections to properly classify hazardous materials based on factors like volatility, corrosivity, and hydrogen sulfide content. The agency emphasizes the need to test, characterize, classify, and degasify materials before transportation. Ongoing efforts include sampling and measuring Bakken crude properties compared to other U.S. crude oils. The flammable range of crude oil mixed with air can lead to rapid combustion or explosion if ignited. It includes the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) and Upper Flammable Limit (UFL) which define the minimum and maximum concentrations of vapor in air for combustion to occur. The Upper Flammable Limit (UFL) is the maximum vapor proportion in air where flame propagation does not occur. Liquids with a flash point above 100\u00b0F are considered \"combustible,\" while those below are \"flammable.\" Crude oils' combustibility or flammability varies based on volatile components. OSHA and PHMSA require Material Safety Data Sheets to include fire and explosive properties. Bakken crude has a flash point of 95\u00b0F, making it flammable. Cenovus lists benzene in concentrations of 0.1% to 1% by volume, which is relatively high compared to other crudes. Benzene is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon in the gasoline range and suspected as a cause of Bakken crude's low flash point. The PHMSA alert reminds emergency responders that Bakken crude poses significant fire risk if released from the package in an incident. Crude oil falls into Department of Transportation (DOT) packing group I or II, with the recent Lac-Megantic train derailment involving mislabeled oil as a low hazard. The Association of American Railroads urged PHMSA to increase federal tank car safety standards. The AAR recommended increasing design standards for rail cars transporting flammable liquids and retrofitting existing cars to eliminate the classification of flammable liquids with a flash point between 100 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit as combustible. Vapor pressure testing is crucial for crude oil producers and refiners to determine handling and refinery treatment. Vapor pressure is important for crude oil producers and refiners to determine handling and refinery treatment. The New York Mercantile Exchange restricts Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) for crude oil futures contracts. Corrosivity in crude oil, measured as Total Acid Number (TAN), is a concern for refineries. Bakken crude oil has an RVP of at least 8.75 and a TAN greater than 0.5. The corrosivity of crude oils is determined by the Total Acid Number (TAN), with a TAN greater than 0.5 considered potentially corrosive. Bakken crude oil has a TAN of less than 0.1. Pipelines transporting hazardous liquids must use inhibitors to mitigate internal corrosion. The potential for corrosion in the Keystone XL pipeline is linked to the basic sediment and water entrained in the crude oil, as well as the free sulfur content indicating potential corrosiveness. Sulfur oxides released during combustion of refined petroleum products are a major air pollutant. Organic matter decomposition with hydrocarbons can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur can combine with hydrogen to form hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S), which is corrosive, flammable, and toxic. High concentrations of H2S in oil and gas reservoirs can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion, requiring costly stainless steel for construction. Detection of H2S during drilling may lead to well abandonment for worker safety. Total sulfur content in crude oils ranges from below 0.05% to 5%, with levels below 0.5% considered safe. Bakken crude oil is classified as sweet due to its low sulfur content, but it may still contain high levels of H2S. Enbridge Energy Partners detected H2S at 1,200 parts-per-million in a storage tank, leading to an emergency application to amend carriage conditions. The presence of H2S in crude oil can require personal protective equipment at exposure levels above 5 parts-per-million. The Bakken formation produces crude oil and natural gas, with the gas often being flared due to a lack of pipelines for transportation. The crude oil contains a range of hydrocarbons, from light methane to heavy asphaltenes, which are separated at the surface before transport to a refinery. Bakken crude oil is rich in condensates and has an API gravity ranging from 39.7 to 42.2. It is comparable to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in terms of API gravity and sulfur content. Bakken crude oil has an API gravity of 39.7 to 42.2 and sulfur content less than 0.25%. It is sweet crude with low TAN levels, making it non-corrosive. Bakken falls within the upper and lower range of Eagle Ford RVP, the lightest crude oil in the US. Non-pressure DOT-111 tank cars in the United States have a capacity limit of 34,500 gallons or 263,000 lbs. in gross weight on rail, but can be approved for up to 286,000 lbs. if certain conditions are met. Overloaded tank cars can lead to axle breakage or braking issues. Crude oil shippers must provide certified weight to meet rail carrier agreements. To comply with weight agreements with rail carriers, shippers must provide certified weight from a scale or estimate based on calculations. The weight limit considers the tank car's \"light weight\" and the crude oil's density (API gravity). As API gravity increases, the volume of crude oil that can be loaded decreases to avoid exceeding the gross rail weight limit. For example, at 50\"API, a tank car can hold 31,800 gallons without exceeding the 286,000 lb. limit. However, at 39.7\"API, the tank car can only hold 30,488 gallons, creating free space for entrained gases. Crude oil shipments by rail have increased due to the development of oil fields in North Dakota. Concerns have been raised about the volatility and flammability of Bakken crude oil. Rail is the primary mode of transportation for Bakken producers, supplying refineries on both the East and West Coasts. The U.S. Gulf Coast is the most prolific region for domestic crude oil production. The Gulf Coast is a major region for domestic crude oil production, with various types of crude oils like WTI, Eagle Ford, and Louisiana Light Sweet. Producers are using rail to access new markets, with concerns about the flammability and hazardous characteristics of crude oils. There is a debate about the safety of shipping Bakken crude oil by rail compared to other hazardous liquids transported by various means. The debate in Congress revolves around whether Bakken crude oil's hazardous characteristics warrant special attention compared to other crude oils. Policy questions also focus on whether standard safety practices are sufficient for Bakken crude oil and what steps should be taken to address safety concerns."
