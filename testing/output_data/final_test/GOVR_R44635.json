Congress is considering whether to expand the Navy's planned size, which could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industry. There have also been proposals for smaller Navy fleets in recent years. The Navy's current force-level goal is to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet, which may increase to over 308 ships based on a new force structure assessment. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to reach the 308-ship fleet target, although not necessarily with the exact mix of ships specified in the goal. The Navy's size has ranged from 270 to 290 ships in recent years, falling short of the 308-ship goal. Advocates for a larger Navy point to China's naval modernization, resurgent Russian naval activity, and challenges in meeting regional military commanders' requests for forward-deployed ships. To meet these demands, Navy officials have extended ship deployments beyond the standard seven months, raising concerns about crew fatigue and ship wear and tear. The Navy's size has fallen short of the 308-ship goal, with concerns about crew fatigue and ship wear and tear due to extended deployments. Navy officials have testified that meeting regional military commanders' requests for forward-deployed ships would require a fleet of more than 308 ships, with proposals for future fleets exceeding this number. During the Cold War, the Navy maintained substantial forward-deployed forces in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf, and Mediterranean hubs. The Navy reduced forward-deployed ships in the Mediterranean, shifting to two-hub operations from three-hub operations. This change led to lower Navy force-level goals. Increasing the Navy's size beyond 308 ships could help reestablish a larger presence in the European theater, particularly the Mediterranean, to counter Russian naval activity. The Navy reduced forward-deployed ships in the Mediterranean to shift to two-hub operations, lowering force-level goals. Increasing the Navy's size to about 350 ships could reestablish a larger presence in the Mediterranean to counter Russian naval activity. The advocate for a fleet of up to 346 ships is based on recommendations from various independent panels and reports dating back to 1993. The recommended fleet size ranges between 323 and 346 ships, with a potential need for even more ships in the event of increased conflict in the Western Pacific. The figure of 350 ships is not the only option, as fleets larger or smaller than 350 ships are also possible. In the past, the Navy had force structure goals of 375 ships and 325 ships, indicating flexibility in fleet size planning. Several proposals have been made for Navy fleet sizes, including a recommendation for a future fleet of 230 ships. The Navy's current goal is 308 ships, with other recommendations ranging from 323 to 346 ships. The table below outlines different fleet size recommendations, including a 346-ship fleet suggested in a 2010 report. The table shows Navy force structure plans for fleets of 300 to 400 ships, with a notional plan for a fleet of about 350 ships. This fleet is for illustration purposes and not based on new analysis of future Navy mission needs. It may serve as a starting point for discussions on Navy force structure plans for fleets larger than 308 ships. The Navy is considering various combinations of ships for future fleets of about 350 ships, which could include different emphasis on ship categories like attack submarines, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and amphibious ships. Section 1067 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct three independent studies on alternative future fleet platform architectures for the Navy in the 2030 timeframe. The Navy is exploring different ship combinations for a future fleet of around 350 ships, including aircraft carriers, submarines, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and amphibious ships. A study is required by the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act to assess alternative fleet architectures by April 1, 2016. The notional Navy plan includes 41 additional ships compared to the current 308-ship plan, with various ship types. Additional ships may be needed to achieve and maintain the 350-ship fleet due to retirements and gaps in the current 30-year shipbuilding plan. The Navy is considering a future fleet of around 350 ships, including aircraft carriers, submarines, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and amphibious ships. Achieving this fleet may require adding 45 to 58 ships to the 30-year shipbuilding plan, averaging 1.5 to 1.9 ships per year. Budget constraints pose challenges in reaching the current 308-ship goal, let alone exceeding it. The Navy's current 30-year shipbuilding plan may not fully support the planned 308-ship force structure, requiring an additional $4.5 billion per year. To achieve a fleet of more than 308 ships, an extra 45 to 58 ships would need to be included, costing roughly $3.5 to $4.0 billion per year in additional shipbuilding funding. The Navy's current shipbuilding plan may not fully support the planned 308-ship force structure, requiring an additional $4.5 billion per year. Achieving and maintaining a fleet of more than 308 ships could necessitate reducing funding for other defense programs. Forward homeporting Navy ships in the Mediterranean could reduce the number of additional ships needed to support a larger presence there. The Navy forward homeports ships in various operating areas, including Japan, Bahrain, Spain, and Italy. Increasing forward homeporting in the Mediterranean could reduce the number of additional ships needed to support a larger presence there. The Navy forward homeports ships in Japan, Bahrain, Spain, and Italy. Increasing homeporting in the Mediterranean could reduce the number of ships needed to support a larger presence there. Potential locations for homeporting in the Mediterranean include Spain, Italy, France, Greece, and possibly Haifa, Israel. The plan to homeport a carrier group in Greece was canceled due to a military coup. If not for the coup, the US might have had a carrier group homeported in Greece like in Japan. Forward homeporting is a strategy that could reduce the number of ships needed for deployment and enhance operational effectiveness by familiarizing crews with the region they are homeported in. It also signals commitment to the region, enhancing deterrence and reassurance to allies and partners. Potential locations for forward homeporting include Spain, Italy, France, Greece, and possibly Haifa, Israel. Forward homeporting can enhance operational effectiveness by familiarizing crews with the region they are homeported in, potentially reducing the number of ships needed for deployment. It also signals commitment to the region, strengthening deterrence and reassurance to allies and partners. This strategy can lead to increased engagement and training activities with allied and partner forces, improving interoperability and political bonds. However, it does not significantly change the number of ships needed for warfighting and poses challenges such as host nation access. The United States must gain permission from a foreign government to host forward-homeported Navy ships, which could cost millions or billions for facilities construction. Host nations may impose limits on ship usage, reducing U.S. naval forces' operational flexibility. Regional lock-in could occur if nations become accustomed to the presence of forward-homeported ships. The presence of forward-homeported Navy ships in a host nation could be seen as a sign of U.S. support for the host nation's policies. There is a risk of sudden eviction of homeported ships due to changes in the host nation's government or policies, which could disrupt force-structure plans. Congress may need to consider increasing the Navy's planned size beyond 308 ships. The Navy's future needs include determining the size and composition of the fleet to address challenges from China and Russia, potential use of unmanned vehicles, and reliance on allies. The cost implications and impact on defense spending must be considered in maintaining a fleet of over 308 ships. The Navy must consider the cost implications of maintaining a fleet of over 308 ships, including the impact on defense spending for other programs. Adjustments were made to force-level goals for certain ship types in converting the proportional 350-ship fleet to a notional 349-ship fleet. The Navy's 308-ship plan is being adjusted, with discussions focusing on general-purpose ships rather than strategic nuclear deterrent ships. The plan includes 0 SSGNs and 59 SSNs, with a shift towards building Virginia-class submarines with the Virginia Payload Module to compensate for the eventual retirement of SSGNs. The Navy's plan for a 308-ship fleet includes adjustments to the number of aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, LCSs, and amphibious ships. The number of carriers was reduced to 12, while the number of frigates and LCSs was reduced to 56. The plan also includes 38 amphibious ships. The Navy's plan for a 308-ship fleet includes adjustments to the number of ships, with a reduction in carriers, frigates, and LCSs. The number of amphibious ships was reduced to 38, with plans to use LCSs for mine warfare missions. Additional ships are discussed in the 30-year shipbuilding plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes a notional objective of 59 SSNs and 12 aircraft carriers. The plan could achieve a force of 59 SSNs by inserting 12 additional boats, reaching 63 boats by the end of the period. Older SSNs may need to be retired to maintain the force at 59. A total of 6 carriers could be procured from FY2018 through FY2034 to achieve and maintain a 12-ship carrier force. The carriers would be procured at three-year intervals, resulting in a continuous force. The Navy plans to maintain a 12-ship carrier force from FY2022 to FY2034, with fluctuations in ship numbers. The cruiser-destroyer force is projected to reach 100 ships by FY2024, dropping below 90 ships by FY2032 and to 80 ships by the end of the 30-year period. The Navy plans to increase the procurement of cruisers and destroyers to a total of 82 ships over 16 years, with a goal of reaching 100 ships by FY2024. The LCS/frigate program has been reduced to 40 ships, with a successor small surface combatant design scheduled for procurement in FY2029. The Navy plans to increase cruiser and destroyer procurement to 82 ships over 16 years, aiming for 100 ships by FY2024. The LCS/frigate program is reduced to 40 ships, with a successor design scheduled for procurement in FY2029. A notional plan suggests adding 17 ships by FY2025 and removing 5 by FY2035 to achieve a total procurement of 70 ships over 30 years. The Navy plans to increase cruiser and destroyer procurement to 82 ships over 16 years, aiming for 100 ships by FY2024. The LCS/frigate program is reduced to 40 ships, with a successor design scheduled for procurement in FY2029. A notional plan suggests adding 17 ships by FY2025 and removing 5 by FY2035 to achieve a total procurement of 70 ships over 30 years. Frigates and LCSs would be procured at a rate of four ships per year, with a force of at least 56 ships achieved by FY2029. The Navy's shipbuilding plan aims to increase cruiser and destroyer procurement to 82 ships by FY2024. The plan also includes reducing the LCS/frigate program to 40 ships and introducing a successor design in FY2029. Additionally, there is a proposal to add 17 ships by FY2025 and remove 5 by FY2035 to achieve a total procurement of 70 ships over 30 years. The amphibious force is projected to grow to 38 ships by FY2033 and decline to 32 or 33 ships by the end of the 30-year period. Adding 3 amphibious ships to the plan could accelerate the attainment of a 38-ship force by FY2025 and maintain it close to that level for most of the 30-year period. The current 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to maintain a CLF force of 29 or 30 ships, with a goal of reaching 33 ships by adding 3 or 4 ships at strategic times. Support ships, including EPFs, are projected to increase to 39 ships by FY2025, remain at or above 34 ships until FY2038, and then decline to 32 ships for the final seven years of the 30-year period.

Adding more support ships could accelerate reaching a force of at least 39 ships earlier and maintain the figure in the final years. It might be efficient to add additional ships directly after the funded ones to benefit from production learning-curve benefits."
