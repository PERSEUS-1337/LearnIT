    "content": "The Act titled \"Liquefied Natural Gas Safety and Security Act of 2005\" addresses the siting of liquefied natural gas import facilities. Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act is amended to require applicants for liquefied natural gas import facilities to develop a cost-sharing plan with the Coast Guard and relevant state and local agencies for safety and security measures. This includes direct cost reimbursements for security at the facility and nearby vessels. The Commission will review applications for liquefied natural gas import facilities in designated regions, consult with states to identify potential sites, and collaborate with the Coast Guard on offshore projects and sites. The Commission will determine the need for liquefied natural gas import facilities in regions and the number required, collaborating with the Coast Guard and states to ensure only necessary facilities are approved. The Commission collaborates with the Coast Guard and states to determine the need for liquefied natural gas import facilities, ensuring maximum safety and security to the public. The Commission is prohibited from issuing a final environmental impact statement for a proposed facility until the applicant completes a security assessment and plan, and the Coast Guard completes an incident action plan for security measures. The Commission collaborates with the Coast Guard and states to ensure safety and security during the transit and offload of liquefied natural gas vessels. The Commission must include safety and security requirements in the final environmental impact statement for proposed import facilities, consulting with states and complying with federal laws. The section outlines federal laws that must be considered when reviewing applications for liquefied natural gas import facilities, including the National Historic Preservation Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Clean Air Act. States also have the right to review applications under these laws. The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401, 7411(c), 7416) specifies that the Commission cannot preempt a State permitting decision for a liquefied natural gas import facility under Federal or State law. SEC. 3 amends Section 60103 of title 49, United States Code to establish standards for remote siting of liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities. SEC. 4 requires the Coast Guard to issue regulations for thermal and vapor dispersion exclusion zones for vessels transporting liquefied natural gas."
