The Congress finds that the San Francisco Old Mint, known as the Granite Lady, played a significant role in the nation's history. Established in 1852 to convert miners' gold into coins, the Mint survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, serving as the treasury for disaster relief funds. Coins minted there bear the \"S\" mark. The San Francisco Old Mint struck rare coins like the 1870-S $3 coin worth over $1,000,000 and the 1894-S dime. The San Francisco Old Mint Commemorative Coin will be the first to honor a U.S. mint.
