    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2009\". It includes findings and constitutional authority. The Congress finds that women have the same rights as men, and sex discrimination is prohibited in various areas such as employment, education, and healthcare. Sex is an identifiable characteristic from early stages of development through medical procedures. The sex-selection industry is growing, with commercial products available for determining the sex of an unborn child. This trend is predicted to continue in the United States, leading to an increase in sex-selection abortions. Sex-selection abortion is the act of eliminating an unborn child of an undesired sex, often motivated by gender bias. It is considered barbaric and a form of gender-based violence. The victims are overwhelmingly female, leading to female infanticide. \"Son preference is a form of gender discrimination that devalues female offspring, viewing them as financial burdens and less likely to carry on the family name, fueling the elimination of females' right to exist.\" Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by United States law and are performed in the country. A study by Columbia University economists found evidence of sex selection, indicating a son preference leading to unnatural sex-ratio imbalances in certain segments of the population. The evidence suggests that some Americans are practicing sex-selection abortion, consistent with discriminatory practices common in their country of origin. Female feticide is also occurring in the United States, despite being more common outside the country. The American public overwhelmingly supports a ban on sex-selection abortion, with 86 percent in favor according to a 2006 poll. Despite the majority of Americans supporting a ban on sex-selection abortion, only two states have actually prohibited it. The US Congress has condemned policies promoting sex-selection abortion in China and led a resolution at the UN calling for its elimination globally. The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women has urged all nations to prevent prenatal sex selection, which is believed to have caused the demographic imbalance of over 100 million women missing from the world as of 1990. Experts estimate that hundreds of millions of women are missing due to sex-selection abortion. Countries like India, the UK, and China have banned sex-selection abortion, while the US lacks such restrictions, providing less protection against sex-based feticide. The United States permits sex-selection abortion, which is banned in countries like India, the UK, and China. American physicians may provide this procedure as a \"safe haven\" for individuals seeking it, despite opposition from the medical community. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine both oppose sex-selection for family planning, citing ethical concerns and the potential for creating an unnatural sex-ratio imbalance. Sex-ratio imbalance can lead to increased violence and human trafficking. Sex-selection abortions reduce women's representation in the population and reinforce discrimination. Minorities are integral to American society and should not face racial discrimination. United States law prohibits discrimination based on race in various contexts, including employment, education, housing, health insurance, and athletics. Race-selection abortion, eliminating an unborn child because of undesired race, is considered barbaric and an act of race-based violence. Race-selection abortions are elective procedures motivated by race bias, reinforcing racial discrimination and diminishing the number of minorities in the American population. No State has enacted laws to prohibit these procedures, which have no place in a civilized society. The history of the United States includes examples of both sex and race discrimination. The United States has responded to discrimination by enacting constitutional amendments to correct it. Women now have suffrage guaranteed by the 19th amendment, and African-Americans have equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 14th amendment. Eliminating discriminatory practices is a top priority in American history. Implicitly approving discriminatory practices like sex-selection abortion and race-selection is unacceptable. The United States has a history of addressing discrimination through constitutional amendments. Approving sex-selection and race-selection abortions perpetuates discrimination and devalues human life based on sex or race. Congress must act to prohibit these practices to protect vulnerable and innocent lives. Congress enacts legislation to prohibit sex-selection and race-selection abortion under the authority of the 13th and 14th amendments to prevent discrimination and protect human life. The legislation prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on race or sex. The legislation prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on race or sex by imposing fines or imprisonment for performing, coercing, or financing abortions based on these factors. The legislation prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on race or sex by imposing fines or imprisonment for performing, coercing, or financing abortions based on these factors. The Attorney General can seek injunctive relief, loss of federal funding, and private civil actions for violations of the law. The legislation prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on race or sex by imposing fines or imprisonment for performing, coercing, or financing abortions based on these factors. The court may award attorney's fees and money damages for injuries caused by the violation. Reporting violations is mandatory for medical professionals, with penalties for non-compliance. The courts are required to expedite consideration of cases related to this legislation. The legislation prohibits sex-selection or race-selection abortions and exempts women from prosecution for such abortions. Abortion is defined as terminating a pregnancy with the intent to cause the death of the unborn child, except in certain circumstances. The legislation prohibits sex-selection or race-selection abortions and exempts women from prosecution for such abortions. It allows for the removal of a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy. The legislation prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on race or sex. If any part of the Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the parts that can still be enforced."
