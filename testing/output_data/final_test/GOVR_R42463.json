The selection process for a new president is under scrutiny due to criticisms of the current voting power distribution. Criticism is aimed at the voting power distribution and leadership selection process of the World Bank and IMF. Efforts to reform the selection process are discussed in a report on the 2019 World Bank selection process. The World Bank is a multilateral development bank that provides loans and grants to promote economic development in low- and middle-income countries. Membership in the World Bank is nearly universal, with 189 member nations. U.S. membership is authorized by the Bretton Woods Agreements Act. The World Bank, with nearly universal membership of 189 nations, provides loans and grants for economic development in low- and middle-income countries. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) lend directly to governments for development projects. IDA offers grants and concessional loans to low-income countries based on their relative poverty, determined by gross national income (GNI). The World Bank provides financial support for economic development in low- and middle-income countries through the IBRD and IDA. In 2018, IBRD commitments totaled $23.6 billion, while IDA commitments to low-income countries were $24 billion. Other World Bank-affiliated organizations like IFC, MIGA, and ICSID focus on promoting private sector finance and investment in developing countries. The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank, holding significant power in decision-making with the ability to veto major policy decisions. The U.S. also always holds the presidency of the World Bank, with the president being elected by the Board of Directors. The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, was reelected for a second term in 2016. The Trump Administration supports a capital increase for the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The Trump Administration supports a capital increase for the World Bank to address high levels of lending to upper-middle income countries, including China. The leadership at the IMF and World Bank traditionally reflects American and European influence, respectively. The tradition of American leadership at the World Bank and European leadership at the IMF dates back to the end of World War II, reflecting the political and economic balance of power at that time. Despite changes in global capital markets, this convention remains intact, with informal agreements allocating positions of authority in international organizations. International organizations have a tradition of assigning representation to certain states or groups of states, with tacit understandings guiding decision-making. The African Development Bank and Asian Development Bank require their presidents to be citizens of regional countries, while the Inter-American Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development only specify that the president must come from a member country. The selection process for presidents of these banks is influenced by tradition and competitive processes. The selection process for top positions at international financial institutions traditionally favored French, German, and U.S. citizens. However, efforts have been made to open up the selection process, as seen in the election of Akinwumi Adesina from Nigeria as the president of the AfDB in 2015. The 2012 World Bank election was the first to include multiple candidates, with Kim's nomination not being unanimous. The selection process yielded nominees from different countries, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Jose Antonio Ocampo. The guidelines for choosing the World Bank president are outlined in the Bank's Articles of Agreements and Bylaws, with the decision made by a simple majority of the Executive Board. The World Bank's selection process for the president lacks specific qualifications or a formal search process. Nominations can only be made by the 25 World Bank executive directors, with no concerted effort to identify and vet candidates. In 2000, internal working groups were created to review the selection procedure. The World Bank's selection process for the president lacks specific qualifications or a formal search process. In 2000, internal working groups were created to discuss the selection procedure. A joint draft report of the working groups was endorsed by the executive directors on April 26, 2001, but never formally implemented. The report emphasized transparency and accountability in the selection process. However, the Executive Board adopted a procedure in 2011 that critics argue is vague and nontransparent. Development expertise is not a qualification, and decisions are made by consensus rather than public vote, contradicting the call for an \"open, transparent, and merit-based\" process. This inconsistency has been criticized by former World Bank chief economists as hypocritical and damaging to trust. The World Bank's selection process for the president lacks specific qualifications or a formal search process. The decision is made by a majority vote of the Executive Board using a weighted voting system based on contributions to the Bank. The largest shareholders have their own seats on the board, while other countries form mixed-state groupings. Former World Bank chief economists criticize the process as hypocritical and damaging to trust. Countries at the World Bank are divided into constituencies, with some countries switching groups to gain more influence. Small countries in mixed-state constituencies can be overshadowed by larger ones, limiting their voting power. Executive directors must vote as a single unit, even if some countries they represent disagree. There is no provision for splitting a constituency's vote, and there is no formal congressional involvement in selecting Bank management. The U.S. has no formal congressional involvement in selecting Bank management. The President has ultimate authority to direct U.S. policy at the World Bank. The U.S. executive director position is vacant, with Erik Bethel as the alternate. The Executive Board approves all loan and policy decisions. The U.S. executive director is supported by Treasury Department staff. Congressional authorization is required for certain decisions under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act. The Woods Agreement Act requires congressional authorization for specific decisions at the IMF and World Bank, but not for individual loans or selecting the managing director. The European-U.S. leadership split at the IMF and World Bank has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that the current selection process is outdated due to the changing global economy. Developing and emerging market countries now contribute half of global output, shifting the balance of economic power away from the United States and Europe. In recent decades, global economic power has shifted from the United States and Europe to China and other fast-developing countries. This shift is driven by economic integration, interdependence, and the growth of trade among developing countries. China has also established institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and funding mechanisms like the Silk Road Fund and the New Development Bank. China is pursuing bilateral and regional trade agreements, including the RCEP. It also acts as a lender of last resort through monetary arrangements like the BRICs CRA and CMIM. Critics argue that leadership positions based on nationality limit potential candidates. According to experts, the Trump Administration's \"America First\" rhetoric may complicate U.S. support for the World Bank. However, there is confidence that the U.S. nominee will likely be approved, as the world has an interest in the U.S. staying engaged with the institution. Devesh Kapur, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, emphasizes the importance of powerful nations' relationships with the United States over the leadership of the World Bank. The Bank's Executive Board met on January 9, 2019, to discuss the selection process for the next president. President Trump nominated David Malpass for the position, with Ivanka Trump reportedly playing a role in the selection process. The nomination period ends on March 14, and the Executive Board aims to select the next president before the spring meetings in April 2019. Ivanka Trump, senior advisor to President Trump, was involved in selecting the U.S. nominee for the World Bank. She helped establish the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative in 2017. Other candidates considered by the White House included Indra Nooyi, Ray Washburne, Mark Green, and Robert Kimmitt."
