    "content": "The Intelligence Identities Protection Act was enacted in response to concerns about the disclosure of covert intelligence agents by individuals like Philip Agee and Lewis Wolf, leading to repercussions such as the death or attempted assassination of CIA officers and strained relations with foreign intelligence sources. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act was passed in response to disclosures by Philip Agee and Lewis Wolf, who revealed the identities of CIA officers, leading to strained relations with foreign intelligence sources. Wolf disclosed over 2,000 names and personal details of alleged intelligence agents, prompting the consideration and passage of the Act, which imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of covert agent information. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Covert agents are classified officers and employees serving outside the US, as well as informants or sources with classified relationships to the US government. Offenders face increasing punishments based on their access to classified information. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Offenders can face punishment if they participate in activities to reveal covert agents' identities and believe it will harm U.S. intelligence operations. The criminal provisions are defined in 50 U.S.C. Section 421, which outlines offenses based on how the offender acquired the information. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Offenders who intentionally disclose information identifying covert agents face fines or imprisonment under Title 18 for up to 15 years. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Offenders who disclose information identifying covert agents in a pattern of activities face fines or imprisonment under Title 18 for up to three years. Each offense is a felony with a maximum fine of $250,000. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Offenses under Section 421 may result in fines or imprisonment, with the fine potentially being twice the amount of loss or gain. The offenses involve intentional disclosure of a covert agent's identity to unauthorized individuals, knowing that the information disclosed identifies the agent and that the U.S. is taking measures to conceal the agent's intelligence relationship. Subsections (a) and (b) pertain to offenders with authorized access to classified information, while subsection (c) does not have this requirement. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. Offenses under Section 421 may result in fines or imprisonment, with the fine potentially being twice the amount of loss or gain. Subsection 421(b) applies to offenders with authorized access to classified information, while subsection 421(c) applies to those who disclose a covert agent's identity in a pattern of activities intended to expose agents, impairing U.S. foreign intelligence activities. Section 424 establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction for offenses committed overseas by U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act imposes penalties for disclosing covert agents' identities to protect their foreign intelligence relationship with the United States. It is a defense to a prosecution under this Act if the U.S. publicly acknowledged the intelligence relationship before the offense. Prosecution is limited to the person who disclosed the agent's identity, and not to recipients who publish the information without engaging in prohibited activities. Transmitting information to the House or Senate intelligence committees is not an offense. The Intelligence Identities Protection Act prohibits disclosing covert agents' identities to safeguard their foreign intelligence ties with the U.S. It is not an offense to transmit information to the House or Senate intelligence committees. The Act does not allow for withholding information from Congress. Concerns were raised about First Amendment implications if the Act were used to prosecute journalists or others who publish identities of covert agents obtained from public sources. The Senate Judiciary and Conference Committee determined that the Act's language would be constitutionally sound. The goal of the provision is to prevent harm resulting from the disclosure of covert agents' identities. The disclosure of covert agents' identities can result in harm and jeopardize national security. Identifying and exposing intelligence officers serves no legitimate purpose and can endanger lives. It does not contribute to public debate or civil liberties, but rather reflects a disregard for consequences. The standard adopted in section [421(c)] applies criminal penalties only in limited circumstances to deter those who disclose the identities of agents. It does not affect First Amendment rights for those who disclose identities as part of news reporting, academic studies, or internal organization rules. The Conference Committee distinguished between those exposing covert agents and critics of U.S. intelligence. \"Some commentators question the constitutionality of subsection 421(c) on First Amendment grounds, citing concerns about its broadness and lack of specific intent requirement. Section 423 mandates the President to report annually to intelligence committees on covert agent protection measures. No cases have interpreted the statute, but two convictions have resulted from guilty pleas.\" In 1985, Sharon Scranage, a former CIA clerk, pleaded guilty for providing classified information to a Ghanaian agent. She was sentenced to two years in prison. In 2012, John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, pleaded guilty to violating the IIPA by disclosing covert agents' names to journalists. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison. The disclosures of classified information by high-value detainees' defense team at Guantanamo Bay led to investigations. Some spies charged under the Espionage Act for causing deaths of covert agents, while others like Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen pleaded guilty to espionage for similar crimes. Ames was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Hanssen pleaded guilty to multiple counts of espionage in 2001. In 2003, an investigation was opened to determine if the Intelligence Identities Protection Act was violated after CIA officer Valerie Plame's name was published. I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was convicted of obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements in connection with the incident. He received a 30-month prison sentence, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine, which was later commuted by President George W. Bush. George W. Bush commuted I. Lewis Libby's prison sentence after he was denied release on bond pending his appeal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit interpreted the statute as not allowing a remedy for a covert agent whose identity is disclosed by a government employee, citing concerns about revealing classified information."
