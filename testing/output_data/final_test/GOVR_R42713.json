    "content": "The FLSA, passed in 1938, established federal minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor protections to protect workers and stimulate the economy. It created the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) within the Department of Labor (DOL) to enforce the act. Congress found that substandard wages led to decreased living standards for one-third of the U.S. population. The minimum wage started at $0.25 an hour and currently stands at $7.25 an hour. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) established federal minimum wage at $7.25 an hour and mandates overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 hours in a week. It also set conditions for child labor to prevent exploitation and maintain fair wages for adult workers. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) extends minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor protections to employees engaged in interstate commerce. Certain exemptions are provided for executive, administrative, or professional employees, retail store workers without interstate operations, and agricultural employees. The act also covers hospitals, institutions caring for the sick or disabled, and schools for disabled or gifted children. Employees of enterprises with less than $500,000 in annual sales may still be covered by the FLSA if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce, such as traveling to other states for work or handling records involved in interstate transactions. The $500,000 enterprise threshold has not been raised since 1989, and employers must conduct dual tests to determine coverage under the act. The FLSA covers most private and public sector employees, but exempts certain individuals such as elected officials, legislative staff, and family members engaged in agriculture. It also exempts volunteers for government agencies or nonprofit food banks. Certain employers and employees are exempt from minimum wage, overtime, or child labor standards under the FLSA. Certain employees, such as executive, administrative, and professional workers, as well as certain computer-related occupations, are exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements under the FLSA if they meet specific salary and job duties tests. Domestic service workers providing companionship services in private homes are also exempt. State laws that offer more protection to employees than the FLSA take precedence. Under the FLSA, employers must pay covered, nonexempt employees at least $7.25 an hour, with exceptions for certain groups like tipped employees and workers with disabilities. The basic minimum wage is periodically raised by Congress, with the current rate set at $7.25 since July 24, 2009. As of January 1, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wage rates higher than the federal rate. As of January 1, 2014, 21 states and the District of Columbia have minimum wage rates higher than the federal rate. Most employees earn more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Tipped employees must receive a cash wage of at least $2.13 per hour, with tips making up the rest to meet the minimum wage requirement. Tips can be shared among tipped employees, but employers must allow them to keep all tips. Employers can claim up to $5.12 in tips as a tip credit for tipped employees. If a tipped employee receives less than $5.12 an hour in tips, the employer must make up the difference with a higher cash wage. Some states have minimum cash wages for tipped employees higher than the federal minimum of $2.13. Seven states and Guam do not allow tip credits, requiring employers to pay all tipped employees at least the federal or state minimum wage. Under Section 14(c) of the FLSA, employers can pay special minimum wages to workers with disabilities, aiming to provide them with work opportunities. Disabilities can be physical, mental, age-related, or due to injury, including blindness, mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Employers need certificates from the Wage and Hour Division to pay these special wages, issued to work centers, hospitals, businesses, and School Work Exploration Programs. Work centers offer employment, training, and rehabilitation services. Under Section 14(c) of the FLSA, employers can pay special minimum wages to workers with disabilities, aiming to provide them with work opportunities. Businesses employing workers with disabilities at SMWs must obtain a certificate from WHD. Disabled workers' wages must be commensurate with their productivity, based on comparisons with non-disabled workers in the same job and area. Employers must review and adjust disabled workers' hourly wages based on productivity. Under Section 14(c) of the FLSA, employers can pay special minimum wages to workers with disabilities based on productivity. Wages must be adjusted every six months for all workers and annually for disabled workers. The \"youth opportunity wage\" allows a minimum wage of $4.25 for employees under 20 for the first 90 days. This wage cannot displace other workers and aims to provide employment opportunities for young persons. Under Section 14(b) of the FLSA, employers can pay full-time students 85% of the basic minimum wage in certain industries. The subminimum wage for full-time students aims to provide employment opportunities without an age limit. Additionally, under Section 14(a), \"student learners\" can be paid 75% of the basic minimum wage, including high school students aged 16 or older. The Fair Labor Standards Act allows employers to pay full-time students 85% of the minimum wage in specific industries. Student learners, including high school students aged 16 or older, can be paid 75% of the minimum wage while enrolled in vocational training programs. Employers must obtain certificates from the Department of Labor to pay subminimum wages to student learners. Minimum wage rates in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have varied over the years due to legislative changes. In 1989, Congress eliminated the SIC structure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, aligning their minimum wages with the continental United States. American Samoa and CNMI were not covered by the FLSA of 1938, but in 2007, the Fair Minimum Wage Act mandated annual increases in American Samoa until reaching the federal minimum wage. In 2012, the Insular Areas Act of 2011 delayed minimum wage increases in American Samoa until 2015. CNMI had a $0.50 increase in minimum wage in 2012. Congress canceled further increases in 2013. The minimum wage in CNMI increased by $0.50 to $5.55, with a scheduled rise to $6.05 on September 30, 2014. Employers must pay overtime at one-and-a-half times the regular hourly wage for hours over 40 a week. The FLSA allows flexibility in work hours, such as scheduling four 10-hour workdays without overtime. The FLSA allows covered state and local government employees to receive compensatory time off for working over 40 hours a week. Comp time is time off with pay in lieu of overtime pay, calculated at one-and-a-half times the overtime hours worked. Employees may accrue up to 240 hours of comp time, with exceptions for certain personnel who can accrue up to 480 hours. Employers can choose to pay employees for unused comp time instead of providing time off. Employees must be allowed to use comp time on the requested date. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act added new Section 7(r) to the FLSA, requiring employers to provide break time for nursing mothers for one year after the child's birth in a private, non-intrusive space. This section does not apply to exempt employees from overtime requirements. When the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted in 1938, Section 13 provided exemptions from minimum wage and overtime requirements for certain employers and employees. Employers with fewer than 50 employees may be exempt from providing break times for nursing mothers if compliance would impose an undue hardship. Nursing mothers are not entitled to compensation for breaks taken to express milk. Most wage and salary workers are covered by the FLSA, but some exemptions exist under Section 13 for certain employers and employees. Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, enacted in 1938, provided an exemption from minimum wage and overtime requirements for executive, administrative, and professional employees. The terms are defined by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor, requiring employees to meet specific duties tests and earn a salary of at least $455 per week. Job titles do not determine exemption status, as employees must meet job duties criteria for the executive exemption. To qualify for the exemption for administrative employees, the employee's primary duty must be office or nonmanual work related to management or business operations, including discretion and independent judgment. For professional employees, the primary duty must involve work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning. The Department of Labor periodically modifies regulations for the EAP exemption, last changed in 2004. The current minimum weekly salary of $455 is a concern, as it may lead to more employees being exempt from overtime pay over time. A higher threshold could make it harder for employers to administer overtime. Job duties tests are also a challenge in implementing the exemption. The job duties tests for the EAP exemption are complex and can lead to misclassification of workers. A higher salary threshold could make it easier to administer these tests. Outside salespersons are exempt under different criteria, not subject to the $455 salary test. They must meet specific job duties tests related to sales or obtaining orders. Outside salespersons are exempt from the EAP exemption criteria and are not subject to the $455 salary test. They must be engaged away from the employer's place of business and make sales at the customer's location. The exemption includes pharmaceutical sales representatives who promote prescription drugs to doctors. Regulations in 1990 exempted certain computer-related employees from overtime and minimum wage requirements. The exemption for learned professionals applied to those with advanced knowledge acquired through specialized instruction and study. The 1990 regulations exempted certain computer-related employees from overtime and minimum wage requirements based on advanced knowledge acquired through specialized instruction and study. Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations allowing computer systems analysts, programmers, and other skilled professionals to qualify as exempt executive or administrative workers. The 1990 legislation allowed computer employees to qualify as exempt professional workers under the FLSA. The 1992 regulations defined computer employees as highly skilled professionals exempt from overtime pay. The 1992 regulations exempted highly skilled computer employees from overtime pay if they performed tasks related to hardware, software, system specifications, design, development, testing, and modification of computer systems or programs. Academic degree not required for exemption. Minimum wage for exemption was $27.63 an hour. In 1996, Congress added Section 13(a)(17) to the FLSA, setting the minimum hourly wage for computer professionals at $27.63 an hour. In 2004, DOL issued new regulations simplifying the duties tests for computer professionals to reflect the 1996 amendments to the FLSA. Computer professionals are exempt from minimum wage and overtime standards if they meet the job duties test and are paid at least $27.63 an hour. Computer professionals must meet specific duties tests to be exempt from minimum wage and overtime regulations. They must be paid at least $27.63 an hour if they are paid hourly, or at least $455 a week if they are salaried. Skilled computer workers may not be exempt from these requirements. Employees engaged in manufacturing or repairing computer hardware are also not exempt. The FLSA originally did not cover domestic service workers in private households, but amendments in 1974 extended minimum wage protections. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 extended minimum wage and overtime coverage to domestic service workers in private households, including housekeepers, cooks, and babysitters. Two exemptions were added for companionship service providers and live-in domestic workers. Companionship service providers are exempt from minimum wage and overtime standards, while live-in domestic workers are exempt from overtime but not minimum wage. The new regulations published by the DOL in 2013 changed the definition of companionship services and limited minimum wage and overtime exemptions for domestic service workers in private homes. The regulations go into effect on January 1, 2015. Companionship services were previously defined as providing fellowship, care, and protection for individuals unable to care for themselves due to age or infirmity. This could include household work related to their care, such as preparing meals or housecleaning. The new regulations published by the DOL in 2013 changed the definition of companionship services. The definition now includes fellowship and protection, with care limited to 20% of total hours worked per person per week. Fellowship involves social, physical, and mental activities, while protection involves monitoring safety and well-being. Registered or practical nurses are not considered companions. The new regulations published by the DOL in 2013 expanded the definition of companionship services to include fellowship and protection, with care limited to 20% of total hours worked per person per week. Companionship services involve assisting with daily living activities and instrumental tasks for independent living. The regulations also extend minimum wage and overtime coverage to companions employed by third-party employers. Exemptions for companions employed directly by individuals or families, including live-in domestic workers, continue under the FLSA. The act sets minimum age requirements for youth in agricultural and nonagricultural occupations, with exceptions such as parental exemptions. Youth under 18 are restricted from employment in mining or manufacturing. The FLSA sets minimum age requirements for youth in hazardous occupations, with exemptions for certain agricultural activities. Youth under 18 are restricted from employment in mining or manufacturing. Youth ages 12 and 13 can work in agriculture with parental consent. The FLSA sets minimum age requirements for youth in hazardous occupations, with exemptions for certain agricultural activities. Youth ages 12 and 13 can work in agriculture with parental consent, and must be paid at least the minimum wage. The Department of Labor proposed changes to child labor provisions in agriculture, but stated that the parental exemption in agricultural employment would not be affected. The Department of Labor (DOL) proposed changes to child labor provisions in agriculture, including redefining the parental exemption to apply to farms where the parent holds a substantial ownership interest. However, on April 26, 2012, DOL announced the withdrawal of the proposed rule due to concerns raised by thousands of comments from small family-owned farms. The regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama Administration. The regulation changes to child labor provisions in agriculture were withdrawn by the Department of Labor during the Obama Administration. Major amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) have expanded coverage, created subminimum wage rates, and increased the basic minimum wage since 1938. The 1947 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act allowed for compensation for certain activities before or after the workday, settlement of wage disputes, and limited class action suits under the statute. In 1961 and 1966, Congress made amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regarding minimum wage and overtime rates for retail workers and expanded coverage to include workers in various industries. The 1966 amendments also introduced a \"tip credit\" for employers to include a portion of an employee's tips as part of the minimum wage. The 1974 FLSA amendments extended coverage to most government employees, with special exemptions for fire protection and law enforcement personnel. The 1985 amendments allowed state and local governments to... In 1985, Congress amended the FLSA to allow state and local governments to offer compensatory time off instead of overtime pay. In 1989, FLSA coverage was extended to enterprises with annual sales of at least $500,000, repealing the retail exemption. The 1996 Small Business Job Protection Act exempted certain computer professionals from minimum wage and overtime regulations. The 2007 Increases in the Basic Minimum Wage were signed into law by President George W. Bush. Title VIII of the Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 110-28) increased the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour by July 2009. The Equal Pay Act prohibits gender-based pay discrimination, and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the FLSA to provide break time for nursing mothers."
