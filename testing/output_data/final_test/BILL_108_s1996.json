    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oglala Sioux Tribe Angostura Irrigation Project Modernization and Development Act\". The Angostura Unit is part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin program approved by Congress in 1944 to promote economic development, provide irrigation, and protect areas from floods. It includes irrigation of farm land in South Dakota and offers recreation and fishing opportunities. The Angostura Unit provides substantial recreation, fish and wildlife benefits. The Commissioner of Reclamation determined that irrigation at the unit yields $3,410,000 annually, while recreation at Angostura Reservoir brings in $7,100,000 annually. The unit impounds the Cheyenne River upstream of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where there is a need for economic development due to high rates of unemployment and poverty. The Angostura Unit may have negative impacts on water quality and vegetation in the Cheyenne River on the Reservation. Modernizing irrigation facilities at the unit could enhance national economic development benefits and improve water efficiency and environmental restoration on the Reservation. Establishing a trust fund for the Oglala Sioux Tribe could generate economic development benefits comparable to those at the Angostura Unit. The Angostura Unit aims to provide resources for the restoration of the Cheyenne River corridor on the Reservation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The fund will also receive interest accrued on this amount from investments in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury invests a portion of the Fund not needed for current withdrawals in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. Interest earned from these investments is deposited back into the Fund. Starting from the 11th fiscal year after enactment, interest will be withdrawn annually for the Tribe.
