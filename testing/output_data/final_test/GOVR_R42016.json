    "content": "The Senate passed the STOCK Act in 2012, which included Title II, known as the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act. This title closely mirrored H.R. 2572, approved by the House Judiciary Committee. However, the House removed Title II from the final bill. The bills aim to expand federal anti-corruption statutes, increase penalties for corruption convictions, and amend procedures to ease prosecution. They merge two prior efforts addressing limitations on fraud prosecutions and general concerns about public corruption laws. The Senate Judiciary Committee previously reported a similar bill during the 110th Congress. The proposal aims to extend federal anti-corruption statutes, including outlawing undisclosed self-dealing as a form of mail and wire fraud. It represents a renovation of mail and wire fraud statutes in response to Supreme Court interpretations. Federal public corruption statutes have a long history, with bribery statutes dating back to the Republic's early days and the mail fraud statute originating in the mid-eighteenth century. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes were applied to public corruption based on the theory that they protected tangible and intangible property, including the right to honest services. Courts have prosecuted employees for breaching their allegiance by accepting bribes, defrauding their employers. The Supreme Court found this interpretation too broad in McNally, stating that the statutes should not be construed in such an open-ended manner. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in McNally, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1346 to define \"scheme to defraud\" in mail and wire fraud statutes. The lower federal courts created various standards to limit the scope of honest services fraud, but the Supreme Court in Skilling opted for a narrow construction of the offense. Congress intended to reach schemes to deprive others of the intangible right to honest services. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in McNally, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1346 to define \"scheme to defraud\" in mail and wire fraud statutes. The Court in Skilling urged Congress to speak clearly if expanding the reach of honest services fraud. H.R. 2572 and Title II propose expanding the definition to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials at federal, state, and local levels. Undisclosed self-dealing involves conflicts of interest and the obligation to disclose them. The proposal aims to expand the definition of honest services fraud to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials, involving conflicts of interest and failure to disclose material information. The second element of undisclosed self-dealing involves the official knowingly not disclosing required information related to financial matters. The terms \"material,\" \"things of value,\" and \"financial interest\" are not defined in the proposal, which may not pose an issue without statutory definitions. The absence of statutory definitions for terms like \"material,\" \"things of value,\" and \"financial interest\" in the proposal may not be problematic. Interpretation starts with the ordinary meaning of a term and considers how it is defined in similar contexts. For instance, \"material\" is described as having real importance or great consequences, and in the context of fraudulent conduct, something is considered material if it has a natural tendency to influence a decision. The bills suggest that a public official must have the intent to further or benefit a financial interest in performing an act. The terms \"thing of value\" and \"anything of value\" are commonly used in federal criminal law. The terms \"thing of value\" and \"anything of value\" in federal criminal law refer to a wide range of tangible and intangible items, including campaign contributions, employment, sex, expunged criminal records, and pretrial release supervision. The term \"financial interest\" draws from federal conflict of interest provisions and is not specifically defined in federal criminal law. It is related to improper self-dealing and is based on the well-established federal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208. The proposed undisclosed self-dealing section under statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7208 applies to financial interests that public officials are obligated to disclose. The Justice Department's endorsement requires proof of knowing concealment and specific intent to defraud to avoid unwitting conflicts of interest or mistakes. The criminal defense bar criticized the proposal as constitutionally suspect, duplicative, and overly simplistic, arguing it fails to heed Skilling Court's plea for clarity and could have First Amendment implications. The witness contended that the proposal is a classic example of overcriminalization and would intrude upon state prerogatives, especially for part-time legislators and other officials. The proposal would add unreported self-dealing in public corruption cases, expanding on existing laws governing bribery and kickbacks. The bills seek to address unreported self-dealing in public corruption cases and challenge judicial interpretations of federal bribery laws. The distinction between soliciting or offering something in exchange for an official act and in gratitude for the act is crucial in determining bribery. The Supreme Court's decision in Sun Diamond clarified the requirements for illegal gratuities convictions based on gifts given to public officials. The Supreme Court clarified that a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201(c)(1)(A) requires a link between a thing of value given to a public official and a specific official act. Justice Scalia emphasized that this interpretation prevents unintended application of the gratuities subsection, such as criminalizing token gifts to the President not linked to any identifiable act. The Supreme Court clarified that a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201(c)(1)(A) requires a link between a thing of value given to a public official and a specific official act. Examples provided include a high school principal's gift of a school baseball cap to the Secretary of Education and a group of farmers providing a complimentary lunch for the Secretary of Agriculture. The official act requirement is crucial to prevent unintended application of the gratuities subsection. The Secretary of Education's role in high schools is significant. The official act requirement is crucial to avoid unintended coverage of gifts given to public officials. The examples provided, such as receiving sports teams at the White House or speaking to farmers about USDA policy, may not necessarily constitute official acts as defined by the statute. The bills aim to expand the illegal gratuities prohibition and redefine \"official acts\" in bribery cases. This would prevent unintended consequences of prosecuting gifts given to public officials based solely on their tenure in office. The proposed amendments aim to broaden the scope of illegal gratuities by prohibiting gifts based on an official's position, not just for specific acts. This would cover status and goodwill gifts without needing proof of intent for a particular act. Additionally, a safe harbor provision for gifts and campaign contributions is suggested. The bills propose amendments to broaden the scope of illegal gratuities by prohibiting gifts based on an official's position, not just for specific acts. They would also establish a safe harbor for gifts and campaign contributions permitted by rule or regulation, with a $1,000 threshold for the offenses. The bills propose amendments to broaden the scope of illegal gratuities by prohibiting gifts based on an official's position, not just for specific acts. H.R. 2572 and Title II would apply a $1,000 threshold for the offenses in 18 U.S.C. 201, limiting cases involving bribery and illegal gratuities to $1,000 or more. The bills also aim to redefine \"official act\" to encompass activities within official duty, overturning a previous court ruling in the case of Valdes. The Court of Appeals reversed a ruling on illegal gratuities, stating that the definition of official act refers to questions determined by the government. Some federal appellate courts disagree with this interpretation and propose adding \"course of conduct\" to the definition to broaden the scope of bribery laws. The bills propose changes to bribery and illegal gratuity offenses, including a lower threshold for federal prosecution from $5,000 to $1,000. The defense bar argues that this modification could lead to federal over criminalization. The bills propose increasing the maximum term of imprisonment for bribery offenses from 10 to 20 years, aligning it with other statutes. The language of the bribery components would be adjusted to include \"any things of value\" instead of \"anything of value\" to cover cases involving a series of payments. The bills would also remove salaries and legitimate compensation from the list of tainted payments under Section 641, which outlaws theft from the United States or its agencies. The bills propose increasing the maximum term of imprisonment for theft offenses from 10 to 20 years, including the District of Columbia government and its agencies under Section 641. The bill also contains technical fixes to select statutes and targeted increases in penalties for public corruption cases. The proposed changes aim to include the District of Columbia government and its agencies in federal theft and bribery statutes, aligning with existing laws and addressing the need for prosecution in cases of significant fraud. The committee emphasizes the seriousness of public corruption offenses and the importance of harmonizing punishments with similar statutes. The committee proposed increasing penalties for public corruption offenses to send a strong message to potential criminals. However, a representative from the defense bar argued that the proposed expansion of prison sentences lacked evidence of necessity or cost considerations. The House and Senate bills would raise the maximum imprisonment term for existing federal corruption offenses. The bills aim to increase penalties for public corruption offenses, ensuring sentences are procedurally and substantively reasonable. The United States Sentencing Commission would review Guidelines for bribery and theft cases under specific statutes. The bills aim to increase penalties for public corruption offenses, with the United States Sentencing Commission instructed to amend Guidelines for bribery and theft cases. Certain offenses have no statute of limitations, while most federal crimes must be prosecuted within five years, with exceptions such as a six-year statute of limitations for certain securities fraud cases. Public corruption cases are noted to be difficult and time-consuming to investigate and prosecute, leading to the establishment of a six-year statute of limitations for related offenses. The curr_chunk discusses proposed changes to the statute of limitations for public corruption offenses, including bribery, theft, mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion, and RICO cases. The proposal includes a six-year statute of limitations for bribery offenses and certain fraud cases involving public officials. The proposed changes to the statute of limitations for public corruption offenses include a six-year statute for bribery and certain fraud cases involving public officials. It would apply to honest services mail and wire fraud, but not self-dealing mail and wire fraud. It would also apply to a more narrow money laundering statute, but not a more general one. The bills aim to set a six-year statute of limitations for both crime and noncrime attempts, although attempting to violate certain statutes is not considered a separate crime. The Supreme Court ruled that for crimes committed in multiple locations, the offense can be tried where any conduct element occurs. Congress allows offenses begun in one district and completed in another to be prosecuted in any relevant district. Crimes involving mail, interstate commerce, or importation into the US can be prosecuted in any district involved in the offense. The bills propose amending the venue statute to allow trial of offenses involving mail, interstate commerce, or entry into the US in any district where an act in furtherance of the offense is committed. This broadens the general venue statute for crimes like mail fraud that can occur in multiple districts. The proposed amendment to the venue statute would allow trials for offenses involving mail, interstate commerce, or entry into the US in any district where an act in furtherance of the offense is committed. This expands venue options for federal offenses, including public corruption, where any part of the offense occurred. The proposed amendment to the venue statute would expand venue options for federal offenses involving mail, interstate commerce, or entry into the US, allowing trials in any district where an act in furtherance of the offense is committed. The defense bar raised concerns about potential unfair hardship on the accused and forum shopping. The Constitution may limit the proposal's scope to acts that constitute conduct elements of the offense, as seen in a recent Second Circuit case. The government's venue in the Eastern District was based on Butler and Tzolov traveling through JFK airport, but there was insufficient proof that any fraudulent acts occurred there. No false information was transmitted in or out of the Eastern District. The government's venue in the Eastern District was based on Butler and Tzolov traveling through JFK airport, but there was insufficient proof that any fraudulent acts occurred there. None of the fraudulent activities took place in the Eastern District, and boarding flights from there was merely preparatory acts, not constitutive of the securities fraud offense. The government's reliance on past cases is deemed misplaced. The government's venue in the Eastern District was challenged in Butler's case. The court stated that preparatory acts alone could not establish venue, as seen in the Svoboda case. The Supreme Court in Rodriguez-Moreno also addressed venue proposals in federal public corruption cases. The bills propose amending the witness tampering statute to allow prosecution in the district where the official proceeding was intended to be affected or where the offense occurred. This would also apply to obstructions in violation of various statutes related to federal proceedings. The bills propose amending the witness tampering statute to allow prosecution in the district where the official proceeding was intended to be affected or where the offense occurred. This would also apply to obstructions in violation of various statutes related to federal proceedings, including perjury and false declarations before the grand jury. Federal courts are authorized to issue orders approving law enforcement installation and use of devices to intercept communications. The bills propose expanding the list of predicate offenses for intercepting communications to include theft of federal property, theft or bribery involving federal programs, and major fraud against the United States. The Justice Department supports the bills, stating that prosecutors often face limitations in using these tools. Additionally, the bills would allow disclosure of materials related to a federal judicial council's investigation to grand juries and law enforcement officials with certification from the United States Attorney. The bills propose expanding the list of predicate offenses for intercepting communications to include theft of federal property, theft or bribery involving federal programs, and major fraud against the United States. The proposal to permit certification by various officials for government appeals was not previously mentioned in the Senate Judiciary bill or hearings. It stemmed from a situation in the Weyhrauch case where the government appealed the exclusion of evidence, leading to Supreme Court intervention. The Ninth Circuit ordered the government to justify its appeal in the Weyhrauch case. The United States Attorney's Office for Alaska was recused, and the appeal certification was found insufficient. The Attorney General's certification was later accepted, prompting the need for alternative certification methods for cases involving Justice Department attorneys. H.R. 2572 and Title II are similar with some differences. H.R. 2572 proposes increased penalties for bribery and illegal gratuities. Status gifts are now excluded from illegal gratuities under subsection 201(c). Both bills would extend the offense to include status gifts valued at $1,000 or more. H.R. 2572 proposes changes to bribery and illegal gratuities offenses, including limiting them to gifts of $1,000 or more. It also expands Section 641 to cover property of the District of Columbia and includes provisions for additional RICO predicates and penalty increases for public corruption offenses. The proposed changes in H.R. 2572 include expanding the RICO predicate offense list to include violations of federal property theft and bribery laws. It also addresses mail and wire fraud statutes but excludes fraudulent schemes to induce states to issue licenses. The proposed changes in H.R. 2572 expand the RICO predicate offense list to include violations of federal property theft and bribery laws, as well as address mail and wire fraud statutes. Sections in H.R. 2572 and S. 401 aim to overcome limitations identified in Cleveland regarding unissued licenses not constituting money or property."
