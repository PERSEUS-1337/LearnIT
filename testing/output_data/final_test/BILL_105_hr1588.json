This certification is required for funds appropriated for contributions to international organizations or peacekeeping. The certification in section 2 requires the President to certify to Congress that the United Nations has implemented reforms including lowering the assessed payment of the US to 20% of the UN budget or reformulating each member state's assessed level based on their share of the world gross national product. Additionally, the UN must have a code of conduct for all employees. The Secretary General and other UN officials are prohibited from engaging in outside business activities, providing access to UN procurement contracts, or accepting bribes. The Office of Inspector General of the United Nations has been strengthened to conduct independent audits, inspections, and investigations. The United Nations has an inspector general appointed by the General Assembly for a 3-year term based on integrity and expertise in various fields. The inspector general can only be removed for cause by the Secretary General with the approval of the General Assembly, and is authorized to conduct investigations and reports. The United Nations inspector general is empowered to conduct investigations, access relevant records, and have direct access to officials. Procedures are in place to protect the identity of employees reporting complaints or disclosing information. The United Nations has fully implemented procedures to ensure compliance with recommendations of the inspector general, required annual reports to be issued, and committed to providing sufficient budgetary resources for the office of the inspector general. Employee protection within the United Nations grievance system has been reformed to allow for reporting complaints and disclosing information. The United Nations grievance system has been reformed to allow employees to hire outside counsel for grievances.

Additionally, procurement reforms now require 30 days prior notification. The United Nations procurement reforms now require at least 30 days prior notification for bid proposals over $100,000 and public announcements for contract awards over $100,000. Whistleblower protection is also provided, prohibiting punitive actions for contractors who challenge contract awards. The United Nations has implemented whistleblower protection for employees, ensuring safeguards against retaliation for reporting fraud or mismanagement. Additionally, a no-growth budget has been adopted for the 2000-2001 biennium, with no nominal increase in expenditures. The United Nations has downsized authorized employment positions by at least 10% and imposed a salary freeze with limited annual increases tied to the US consumer price index. The United Nations requires annual review and reauthorization of peacekeeping missions by the Security Council, and the US Department of Defense is reimbursed for peacekeeping expenditures. The United Nations reimburses the US Department of Defense for voluntary contributions to peacekeeping missions. An agreement between the UN and the US allows for reimbursement for future contributions. The US and the UN have resolved arrearages in assessed contributions.
