    "content": "The DREAM Act is a legislative proposal aimed at providing legal status to unauthorized childhood arrivals in the United States. It is a less controversial measure compared to broader legalization proposals in immigration reform. The DREAM Act legislation has been introduced in various Congresses to provide immigration relief to unauthorized students. It serves as a bridge between older and newer versions of the Act, focusing on enabling unauthorized immigrant children to receive free public education through high school. Unauthorized immigrants may face difficulties attending college due to their unlawful status. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) discourages states from granting them in-state tuition rates. Additionally, unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for federal student financial aid under the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965. The DREAM Act bills introduced in the 109th and 110th Congresses aimed to help unauthorized alien students by allowing them to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status through cancellation of removal, a form of relief in immigration law. Cancellation of removal is a discretionary relief that allows aliens in removal proceedings to become LPRs. The DREAM Act bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to enable unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status without first being placed in removal proceedings. The DREAM Act bills aimed to allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility requirements included being physically present in the US for at least five years, being of good moral character, and meeting education criteria. The eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status in the DREAM Act bills differed based on grounds of inadmissibility and deportability in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Foreign nationals must be found admissible to the US, with grounds including health, security, terrorism, illegal entry, public charge, and other issues. The bills specified which grounds would apply to aliens seeking to adjust status. The DREAM Act bills specified eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status based on grounds of inadmissibility and deportability in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under S. 2075, aliens seeking adjustment could not have been under a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. Those granted cancellation of removal would initially become conditional permanent residents for six years, subject to termination. To become full-fledged LPRs, they had to demonstrate good moral character, maintain U.S. residence, and meet additional requirements, including acquiring a college degree. The DREAM Act bills outlined eligibility requirements for adjustment of status, including having a U.S. residence, a college degree, or military service. Both S. 2075 and H.R. 5131 imposed restrictions on federal student financial aid eligibility for aliens who adjusted to LPR status, limiting access to Pell Grants and other grants under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The DREAM Act bills imposed restrictions on federal student financial aid eligibility for aliens adjusting to LPR status, limiting access to Pell Grants and other grants under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. S. 2075 was incorporated into the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, but no further action was taken. The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act passed by the House did not address unauthorized alien students. DREAM Act proposals were reintroduced in the 110th Congress. In the 110th Congress, various DREAM Act proposals were introduced but not passed, including S. 774 and H.R. 1275. These bills aimed to repeal IIRIRA \u00a7505 and had bipartisan support. The Senate attempted to invoke cloture on S. 1639 and S. 2205, which included a DREAM Act title. S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aimed to repeal IIRIRA \u00a7505, allowing states to provide postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens and granting eligible unauthorized students the opportunity to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required a continuous presence of at least five years, entry before age 16, and good moral character. No limit was set on the number of aliens who could be granted cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under the bills. The bills S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aimed to allow unauthorized aliens to receive postsecondary educational benefits and adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required a continuous presence of at least five years, entry before age 16, and good moral character. Additional requirements included demonstrating admission to an institution of higher education or earning a high school diploma in the US, and not being inadmissible or deportable on criminal, security, or smuggling grounds. S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aimed to allow unauthorized aliens to receive postsecondary educational benefits and adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required a continuous presence of at least five years, entry before age 16, and good moral character. Aliens granted cancellation of removal would be adjusted initially to conditional permanent resident status, subject to meeting additional requirements to become a full-fledged LPR. Both S. 774 and H.R. 1275 aimed to allow unauthorized aliens to receive postsecondary educational benefits and adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required a continuous presence of at least five years, entry before age 16, and good moral character. Aliens granted cancellation of removal would be adjusted initially to conditional permanent resident status, subject to meeting additional requirements to become a full-fledged LPR. The bills would have placed restrictions on the eligibility of aliens who adjusted to LPR status for federal student financial aid, limiting them to student loans, federal work-study programs, and services, excluding federal Pell Grants and federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. The STRIVE Act of 2007 and the EARN Act introduced provisions similar to the DREAM Act, with restrictions on federal student financial aid for aliens adjusting status. Once the conditional basis was removed, these restrictions would no longer apply. The EARN Act, similar to other bills, would allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal with no limit on the number of aliens eligible. Eligibility requirements include physical presence, good moral character, and educational criteria, but differences exist in grounds of inadmissibility and deportability. Aliens would have been ineligible for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under H.R. 1221 if they were inadmissible or deportable on various grounds, including criminal, security, or smuggling reasons. They would have initially been granted conditional permanent resident status valid for six years, with the opportunity to become a full-fledged LPR by meeting additional requirements. H.R. 1221 outlined requirements for aliens to obtain conditional permanent resident status, with provisions differing from other bills like S. 774 and H.R. 1275. It did not restrict eligibility for federal student financial aid or repeal IIRIRA \u00a7505. The DREAM Act was part of a comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced by Senators Kennedy and Specter. The DREAM Act provisions in S. 1639, introduced by Senator Arlen Specter, were tied to a new \"Z\" nonimmigrant visa category for certain unauthorized aliens in the US. Eligibility requirements included continuous physical presence since January 1, 2007, and not being lawfully present under any other immigration status. The bill failed to pass in June 2007. S. 1639's DREAM Act title aimed to establish a special adjustment of status mechanism for eligible aliens under age 30, who had acquired a college degree in the US or served in the military for at least two years. The Secretary of Homeland Security could adjust their status to LPR three years after enactment, without using the cancellation of removal procedure. The DREAM Act provisions in S. 1639 allowed for adjustment of status for eligible aliens under age 30 with a college degree or military service. There was no limit on the number of aliens who could adjust to LPR status. Beneficiaries would be eligible for student loans, work-study programs, and services, but not grants. The bill also addressed IIRIRA \u00a7505. S. 1639 proposed adjustments to IIRIRA \u00a7505 for aliens with probationary Z or Z status. Another version, S. 2205, allowed unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal, with no limit on the number of beneficiaries. The alien eligibility requirements for adjustment of status under S. 2205 included being physically present in the US for at least five years, under age 16 at initial entry, good moral character, admission to higher education or high school diploma, and under age 30 at enactment. Similar requirements were found in H.R. 1221. S. 2205, like H.R. 1221, proposed eligibility requirements for aliens seeking adjustment of status, including physical presence in the US for at least five years, being under age 16 at initial entry, good moral character, admission to higher education or high school diploma, and being under age 30 at enactment. Additionally, aliens granted cancellation of removal under S. 2205 would initially become conditional permanent residents, with the opportunity to become full-fledged LPRs by meeting further requirements such as obtaining a college degree or serving in the uniformed services for at least two years. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 2205, a bill related to postsecondary educational benefits for unauthorized aliens. The DREAM Act legislation was introduced in multiple Congresses but was not enacted into law. The House did not consider any DREAM Act bills in the 109th or 110th Congresses, with similar measures introduced in subsequent Congresses."
