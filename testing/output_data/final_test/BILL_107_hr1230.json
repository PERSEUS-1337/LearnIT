The Detroit River, created 14,000 years ago, is a connecting channel linking the Upper and Lower Great Lakes. The Lower Detroit River ecosystem is diverse, attracting numerous species of waterfowl and fish. It serves as a major migration corridor for various wildlife. The Detroit River is an important migration corridor for birds, with over 300 species documented in the area. The Canada-United States North American Waterfowl Management Plan recognizes the Detroit River as a crucial habitat area for waterfowl. Around 3 million ducks, geese, swans, and coots migrate through the Great Lakes region annually. Additionally, 300,000 diving ducks stop in the Lower Detroit River each year during their fall migration to rest and feed. The Lower Detroit River area is internationally important for waterfowl, with the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge in the US and the Canard River Marsh Complex in Canada serving as key resting and feeding areas for migrating birds. The ecosystem's diversity benefits over 5 million people living nearby, with the region also known for duck hunting and generating significant economic revenue from waterfowl hunting and birding activities. The Detroit River, designated as an American Heritage River in 1998, is also a Canadian Heritage River, making it the first international heritage river system in the world. The river supports a renowned sport fishery, with walleye migration attracting pleasure boats and contributing to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring. Nonconsumptive uses of waterfowl in Michigan also bring in significant economic benefits. The Detroit River has lost over 95 percent of its coastal wetland habitats despite increased awareness of their importance. Protection and enhancement of remaining wildlife habitats are essential for sustaining the quality of life along the Detroit River corridor. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Refuge\" refers to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the term \"Detroit River\" includes lands and waters within a specified area.
