Deficits have decreased from 9.8% of GDP in FY2009 to 3.8% in FY2018, but forecasts show deficits every year through FY2029. Federal debt reached $21.516 trillion in FY2018, the highest since FY1947, with $15.761 trillion held by the public. This report examines deficits, debt, and their impact on fiscal policy and the economy. The federal government incurs a deficit when outgoing payments exceed revenues, leading to a surplus when revenues are greater than outlays. A balanced budget occurs when receipts equal expenditures. Deficits are measured over a fiscal year and include on-budget and off-budget activities. Subsidy costs of government activities are included in deficit and surplus calculations. The federal budget is structured to have lower deficits in stronger economic conditions, with higher revenues and slightly lower spending. In FY2018, the government had a deficit of $779 billion, equivalent to 3.8% of GDP. From FY1969 to FY2018, the average deficit was 2.9% of GDP. The government had surpluses in five years and incurred deficits in all other years. The federal debt is the money owed to creditors, including private citizens, institutions, and foreign governments. Federal debt measurements represent the accumulation of government borrowing activity, increasing with net budget deficits, outflows for federal credit programs, and intragovernmental borrowing. Federal credit programs include loans for college tuition and small business programs. Intragovernmental debt is generated when trust funds receive surplus money used to finance government activities. GAS securities are issued in those cases. The Department of the Treasury manages federal debt through the issuance of Government Account Series (GAS) securities. These securities can be redeemed when trust fund expenditures exceed revenue levels. Treasury's debt management strategy aims to meet government borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time by issuing government-backed securities that generate interest payments. Treasury securities are sold through auctions with maturity periods ranging from several weeks to 30 years. Federal debt is divided into debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. The federal debt is managed by the Department of the Treasury through the issuance of Government Account Series (GAS) securities. These securities can be redeemed when trust fund expenditures exceed revenue levels. The total federal debt outstanding was $22.087 trillion as of February 28, 2019, with 73.6% held by the public and 26.4% as intragovernmental debt. Individuals, firms, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, and foreign governments can purchase publicly held debt through auctions or the secondary market. Publicly held debt was $16.251 trillion, with the majority being marketable Treasury securities. The federal debt managed by the Department of the Treasury includes marketable Treasury securities like Treasury Notes, Bonds, Bills, TIPS, and FRNs. Nonmarketable debt held by the public consists of U.S. Savings Bonds, SLGS, and other smaller issues. As of February 28, 2019, 96.8% of publicly held debt was marketable. Intragovernmental debt, where the federal government is both the creditor and borrower, is mostly nonmarketable, with the majority held by trust funds for Social Security and military and federal worker retirement. Marketable intragovernmental debt is mainly held by the Federal Financing Bank. The Federal Financing Bank holds primarily intragovernmental debt, which cannot be accessed by institutions outside the federal government. Public debt issues may compete for assets in private markets, with federal deficits increasing debt levels and future deficits due to higher interest payments. The relationship between deficits and debt varies depending on the type of debt considered. The relationship between federal deficits and debt is described, with budget deficits being the main contributor to publicly held debt. Treasury sells debt instruments to finance deficits, leading to an increase in total debt held by the public. Publicly held debt has been the primary factor in historical changes in federal debt levels. Figure 1 illustrates changes in federal debt from FY1969 to FY2018, showing a gradual increase in intragovernmental debt in recent decades. The government's borrowing outcomes impact future budgeting outcomes as interest payments on publicly held debt contribute directly to federal deficits. Interest payments on intragovernmental debt do not affect the deficit as they are made within the government. Net interest payments represent the amount paid to debt holders minus interest payments received for federal loan programs. Net interest payments on publicly held debt contribute to federal deficits, representing the amount paid to debt holders minus interest payments received for federal loan programs. From FY1969 to FY2018, net interest payments averaged 2.0% of annual GDP, peaking in the 1980s and 1990s due to high interest rates and increasing debt levels. In FY2018, net interest payments were $325 billion, or 1.6% of GDP, lower than their long-term averages. In FY2018, interest payments were $325 billion, or 1.6% of GDP, a result of low interest rates and high levels of debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects that net interest payments will increase to 3.0% of GDP by FY2029 if the federal debt is not reduced. The primary deficit averaged 0.9% of GDP from FY1969 to FY2018, compared to the total budget deficit of 2.9% of GDP. From FY1969 to FY2018, the federal government had a budget surplus five times and a primary surplus nine times. This section explains how government deficits and debt impact the economy in the short and long run. The interaction between fiscal outcomes and economic performance influences decisions on activity distribution during recessions or expansions. In the short run, economic output depends on private and public activity. Equation (1) illustrates the choices that can be made with all economic output in a given time. In a given economy, output (Y) is the sum of private consumption (C), private investment (I), net government investment (G), and net exports (X). Government borrowing to fund deficits reduces private investment. Increased government borrowing can lead to \"crowding out\" of private investment and a shift towards public investment. It can also reduce net exports, expanding the short-term money supply but driving up interest rates. Deficit financing can be used to stimulate the economy in the short term by increasing total spending. Deficit financing can be used to stimulate the economy in the short term by increasing total spending. However, it may lead to \"crowding out\" of private investment during periods of robust economic growth. Deficit reduction when the economy is near full potential can prevent overheating and promote intergenerational equity and long-term growth. A structurally balanced budget strategy smooths government tax and spending levels to reduce economic shocks. Governments use deficits or surpluses to spread payment burdens across generations. The impact of government borrowing on economic growth depends on how the borrowed amounts are used. The impact of government borrowing on economic growth depends on how the borrowed amounts are used, with factors such as the stock of labor, capital, and technological capability playing a crucial role in determining future economic growth potential. If government debt-financed spending contributes positively to these factors, it can have a beneficial effect on economic growth. Federal debt levels impact economic resources over time through intertemporal transfers. Debt issuances increase current federal resources but decrease future resources. Net interest payments represent expenses from past borrowing and limit total borrowing based on available investment. The trajectory of federal debt is considered unsustainable if it continuously rises relative to output (measured by GDP), leading to adverse outcomes like reduced output, increased unemployment, and currency devaluation. Recent international examples, such as Greece and Japan, show the complexity of borrowing capacity, with Greek debt rising from 115% to 189% of GDP from 2006 to 2017. Greek debt rose from 115% to 189% of GDP from 2006 to 2017, leading to a severe recession. Japanese debt also increased, reaching 234% of GDP. The United States had the fifth-largest level of government debt in 2017 at 136% of GDP. The deficit's cyclical pattern is influenced by \"automatic stabilizers.\" The budget deficit is influenced by automatic stabilizers, which adjust with the business cycle. During economic growth, deficits decrease due to higher tax revenues and lower expenditures, while in recessions, deficits increase as tax revenue falls and spending on income security programs rises. The share of the deficit attributed to automatic stabilizers decreased from 1.9% of GDP in FY2010 to 0.0% in FY2018. The FY2018 budget deficit of 3.8% of GDP is similar to the expected \"structural deficit\" without automatic stabilizer effects. The positive correlation between economic growth and federal budget outcomes is shown in Figure 3, with higher nominal GDP making debt repayment easier. In 1946, the federal debt was 118.9% of GDP, equivalent to 1.3% of GDP in 2018. Increases in nominal GDP can be due to productivity growth or economic inflation. In the long run, changes in economic productivity significantly impact the sustainability of the debt burden. From FY2009 to FY2018, federal deficits averaged 5.3% of GDP, increasing publicly held debt from 39% to 78% of GDP. Despite larger deficits in FY1943-FY1952, robust economic growth limited the debt increase to 45% to 60% of GDP. The FY2018 deficit was 3.8% of GDP, higher than the average from FY1969 to FY2018. The CBO projects an increase in real deficits and debt over the next 10 years, with U.S. debt held by the public expected to rise from 77.8% of GDP in FY2018 to 92.7% in FY2029. The forecasts assume current law will continue, including restrictions on discretionary budget authority and expiring tax policy changes. The CBO projects an increase in federal debt held by the public to 97% of GDP by FY2029 if discretionary spending increases with inflation and tax reductions are extended. In the long-term forecast, federal debt is projected to reach 147% of GDP by FY2049, exceeding previous levels. The CBO projects a significant rise in U.S. net interest payments over the next 10 years, with publicly held federal debt projected to increase to 92.7% of GDP by FY2029. International government debt trajectories are also considered for future interest rate and fiscal space considerations. The general government debt history and projections for G-7 countries and the European Area from FY2000 to FY2023 show increased debt levels post the Great Recession. U.S. debt rose by 40% of GDP, with projections indicating a further increase to 117% by 2023, diverging from other G-7 countries. Projections suggest a decrease in debt for G-7 governments and the European Area. Policy adjustments will be needed to reduce future budget deficits through tax increases, spending cuts, or a combination. Maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at 78% in FY2048 would require significant measures, such as spending cuts or revenue increases of 1.9% of GDP annually. Further reductions in debt levels would necessitate even larger adjustments. To bring down the debt to its historical average of 40% of GDP, measures like spending cuts or revenue increases totaling 3.0% of GDP annually are necessary, amounting to $630 billion in FY2018 alone."
