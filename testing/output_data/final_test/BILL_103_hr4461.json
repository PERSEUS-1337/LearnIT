    "content": "The \"Workforce Diversity Partnership Act of 1994\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to promote diversity in the workforce. The Congress finds that the workplace in the United States is becoming increasingly diverse, with people of color, Caucasian women, and immigrants driving the net growth in the labor force. This diversity brings new expectations, demands, and values to the workforce, but many individuals and leaders are not adequately prepared to handle it in the face of growing economic dissatisfaction and global competition. The Act aims to establish a grant program to study and address issues related to workforce and cultural diversity, focusing on economic competitiveness, employment opportunities, advancement, and retention. This initiative is crucial as the workforce in the United States is becoming increasingly diverse, posing challenges for leaders to effectively manage and motivate employees while balancing work and family demands. Emphasizing diversity can lead to improved working conditions and economic success for all individuals. The Act aims to establish a grant program to study and address issues related to workforce and cultural diversity, focusing on economic competitiveness, employment opportunities, advancement, and retention. It also aims to develop collaborative public and private sector education and training materials to address workforce and cultural diversity issues. Establishment of Workforce Diversity Grant Program. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide grants to eligible entities for workforce and cultural diversity initiatives, including developing education materials, fostering research, and establishing cooperative training programs. The Secretary of Labor provides grants to eligible entities, such as institutions of higher education and organizations with expertise in workforce diversity, for education and training programs addressing workforce and cultural diversity issues. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965. Payments under a grant shall not exceed 3 fiscal years and are subject to annual approval by the Secretary and availability of appropriations. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. The Secretary requires eligible entities to submit an application for a grant under section 3. Faculty participation in the application process is encouraged. SEC. 5. USE OF AMOUNTS. The Secretary can only grant funds to eligible entities if they agree to use the money for programs related to workforce and cultural diversity, such as developing instructional materials, education and training materials, and new approaches to diversity issues in various academic disciplines. The grant funds can be used for research on multicultural workplace interactions, faculty development programs focusing on multicultural management, and the development of models for summer precollege business internship programs. The curr_chunk discusses activities related to workforce diversity issues, including forums, workshops, and conferences involving representatives from various institutions. It also mentions any other activities deemed appropriate by the Secretary to meet the purposes of the Act. The curr_chunk discusses the selection process related to workforce diversity issues. The Secretary considers various criteria for selecting grants under section 3, including the potential to achieve guidelines, level of participation and financial commitment, fostering diversity awareness programs, developing best practices, and impacting the competitiveness of the US economy. The Secretary prioritizes eligible entities for grants based on their ability to demonstrate non-Federal contributions or resources from non-governmental entities. The Secretary establishes peer review panels to evaluate applications under section 4, seeking participation from qualified individuals. Each panel reports findings and recommendations to the Secretary. Federal and non-federal share requirements are outlined in section 8. SEC. 8 outlines the Federal and non-Federal share requirements for grants provided under section 3. The Federal share cannot exceed 50% of the total program cost, but exceptions can be made by the Secretary. The non-Federal share must come from non-Federal sources and can be in cash or in-kind. The Secretary may not provide a grant under section 3 to an eligible entity unless the entity agrees to submit an annual report including progress summary, expenditure details, fund use plan for the next fiscal year, program implementation success or failure, and any other relevant information. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the progress of achieving the purposes of the Act. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1995 and necessary sums for fiscal years 1996 through 1999."
