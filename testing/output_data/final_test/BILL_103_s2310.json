Payment for jointly furnished single case is amended to allow physicians to receive payment for anesthesia services furnished jointly with a certified registered nurse anesthetist. The carrier can determine if using both a physician and a certified registered nurse anesthetist is medically necessary. If not, the physician's fee for services will be a percentage of the fee for anesthesia services performed by the physician alone. The Secretary will establish procedures to ensure that the total fee for jointly furnished anesthesia services does not exceed 100 percent of the fee for anesthesia services personally performed by the physician alone. The fee schedule amount for certified registered nurse anesthetist services will be adjusted if jointly furnished with a physician and deemed medically unnecessary, equal to the fee for anesthesia services performed by the physician alone. The fee schedule amount for certified registered nurse anesthetist services will be adjusted if jointly furnished with a physician and deemed medically unnecessary, equal to the fee for anesthesia services performed by the physician alone. This change applies to services provided on or after January 1, 1995, ensuring uniform treatment of all multiple concurrent cases. The fee schedule for certified registered nurse anesthetist services will be adjusted if provided with a physician and deemed medically unnecessary, equal to the fee for anesthesia services by the physician alone. Amendments to certain sections of the Act will apply to services furnished on or after January 1, 1998."
