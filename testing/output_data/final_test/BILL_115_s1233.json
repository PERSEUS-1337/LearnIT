The \"Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017\" amends rail transportation policy to protect the shipping public by allowing shippers to obtain rates from multiple rail carriers and defining market dominance in terms of existing infrastructure. The Act also requires Class I rail carriers to enter into competitive switching agreements upon petition from shippers or receivers demonstrating the need. The Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017 allows shippers served by a single Class I rail carrier to request competitive switching with another carrier within a reasonable distance. Competitive switching may not be imposed if it is deemed infeasible or unsafe, or if it unduly restricts a rail carrier's ability to serve its own shippers.

The Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017 allows shippers to request competitive switching with another carrier within a reasonable distance, improving reasonable rate standards. The Board will develop a new methodology for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates based on competitive rate benchmarking, presuming rates above the benchmark level are unreasonable unless proven otherwise by the rail carrier. The Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017 introduces a new benchmarking method for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates. Relief under this method has no monetary limit, and any rate prescription set by the Board must remain in effect for at least 5 years. The Board's rulemaking will establish a standard procedural schedule for such cases, with a maximum duration of 365 days. Additionally, the Act prohibits rail carriers from changing challenged rates for transportation subject to the Board's jurisdiction.

The Act prohibits rail carriers from changing challenged rates for transportation subject to the Board's jurisdiction. The Board may not use qualitative analysis to identify feasible transportation alternatives for shippers. The Rail Shipper Fairness Act of 2017 prohibits rail carriers from using an index to establish fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges must be directly tied to actual fuel prices and cannot exceed incremental cost increases. Shippers can challenge unreasonable fuel surcharges under specified conditions. The Board is authorized to require carriers to report actual fuel prices. SEC. 6.
