This model architecture outperforms conventional neural networks on various datasets with structured smoothness, highlighting the importance of inductive bias in predictive models. The use of structured smoothness is motivated by domain knowledge and leads to improved performance, similar to the benefits seen with convolutional weights in practice. Our work proposes a feedforward layer for deep neural networks that is suitable for neuroimaging and other structured data. For example, the El Nino dataset consists of measurements by weather buoys in the ocean, where nearby buoys can be grouped together. This approach follows the philosophy of using structured smoothness in deep learning models for improved performance. The Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) is a technical contribution designed to extract features within grouped data, such as financial market data or brain parcellations. It ensures that each output vector is only influenced by input vectors, as demonstrated in the human connectome project resting state brain data. The Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) ensures that each output vector is only affected by input vectors related to the specified grouping. FGL is compared against other neural network methods on simulated and real brain imaging data, showing improved performance. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measures neuron activity through resting state and task data collection. Task data (tfMRI) is collected during a specific task, such as a motor task like moving fingers. fMRI data is represented as 3D images and has been extensively studied in the ML literature. Brain decoding in fMRI analysis involves predicting tasks or stimuli from brain images using different models, such as end-to-end models and dimensionality reduction models. End-to-end models do not consider brain spatial structure, while dimension reduction groups variables together. Our work is motivated by the lack of consideration for brain spatial structure in end-to-end models. Previous studies have used various methods for decoding fMRI data, such as logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, and dimensionality reduction. While some have explored grouping features for regularization, they have not incorporated this structure into deep models. In contrast, our results show the advantages of combining depth with spatial sparsity for brain image decoding. The curr_chunk discusses the concept of grouping variables in a set, where each variable is part of at least one group. These groups can be spatially smooth, like in image segmentation. An FGL layer processes input vectors grouped into output groups, with the option for mutually exclusive groups. The model architecture can utilize multiple groups for various benefits. The Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) allows for grouping variables into sets, with each variable belonging to at least one group. It can use multiple channels for processing input vectors grouped into output groups. The layer is represented mathematically by matrices and parameters for linear transformations and biases. FGL acts as a fully connected layer when there is only one group containing all variables. The Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) functions as a fully connected layer with all variables in one group. A deep neural network for classification is built using repeated FGL layers and activation functions, inspired by traditional CNN models. Weight normalization is applied to decouple the norm and direction of weights in the network. For FGL, weight normalization is applied to both u and v vectors. Weight norm is applied by treating u as c out different vectors and v as the weights of a fully connected layer. Pytorch is used to implement models, and nilearn for preprocessing fMRI images. Training was done using Adam on 4 K80 GPUs. Brain decoding is considered a classification task, with fully connected networks and CNNs as baselines. Baselines include state of the art approaches. Multinomial logistic regression is a standard model with bias b \u2208 R k. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are popular in deep learning for tasks with spatial inputs. They assume local and spatially invariant dependencies between pixels, making them suitable for natural images. However, in brain fMRI analysis, where features are position-dependent, CNNs may not be as effective. In brain fMRI analysis, CNNs may not work well due to position-dependent features. Liu et al. (2018) found that CNNs struggle with location-dependent spatial representations and propose the CoordConv layer as a solution. CoordConv includes coordinates as additional input channels, enabling CNNs to handle local dependencies that change across the image. Additionally, grouping via Voronoi Diagrams based on distance to sites is discussed. The text discusses using Voronoi diagrams for grouping based on distance to sites, creating spatially connected regions. It also mentions using Gaussian prior data and linear function labeling for datapoints. In the context of FGL, a generative model is analyzed where z follows a Gaussian distribution with a fixed covariance matrix \u03a3 and matrix F. The labels are assigned based on z, with implications explored for sparse F and identity matrix \u03a3. A dataset is created by sampling x from a Gaussian prior with S as an identity matrix, and F is constructed using a Voronoi diagram. The study involves creating a dataset using a Voronoi diagram with 512 points grouped into 32 regions. Points are sampled to generate a simulated dataset, and labels are assigned based on likelihood. The dataset's noise level is checked with a label probability histogram. Results show that FGL has better sample complexity and performance on the test set improves with more training data. The study compares different models for classification using a dataset created with a Voronoi diagram. The models include Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, CoordConv variant, and a model using a proposed layer - FGL. The FGL model is provided with Voronoi regions to improve classification accuracy. The dataset shows that misclassifications by CNN are not just on noisy data points but also on clear labels. The number of parameters in each model is roughly the same. The study compared different classification models using a dataset created with a Voronoi diagram. The models included Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, CoordConv variant, and a proposed FGL model. Misclassifications by CNN were observed on clear labels, not just noisy data points. The number of parameters in each model was roughly the same. Testing showed that maxpooling in CNN and CoordConv decreased performance. Results were aggregated over 10 runs, showing small standard deviation in accuracies, indicating differences in models rather than poor initialization or training. The experiment demonstrated failures in convolution-based and fully connected models. The study investigated failures in convolution-based and fully connected models, comparing them with a proposed FGL model. The analysis showed that FGL outperformed CNNs, CoordConv, and Logistic Regression across various datasets. The performance gain was not due to noisy labels or failures on specific classes, indicating the benefit of using a grouping of variables. The evaluation of fMRI decoding models on 5 datasets showed the importance of out-of-sample accuracy and avoiding common subjects between train and test datasets to prevent misleading results. Leave-one-out strategies for cross validation were found to be unstable, emphasizing the use of reasonable defaults. We evaluate models via out-of-sample accuracy by holding out some subjects for testing. Ward clustering is performed on a fraction of HCP resting state data, downsampling the data due to hardware constraints. Task datasets are not used for clustering to avoid exacerbating data scarcity. Resting state data is more easily acquired and shows strong correlations with task fMRI data. Using rfMRI instead of tfMRI can provide a better brain parcellation. To create a deep network with FGL, hierarchical clustering is needed. The ward tree is used for segmentation instead of the algorithm provided by nilearn. Parcellations with 32, 256, and 1024 regions are produced from the ward clustering. These groups are spatially connected. Fully Connected Models like FNN and LR were experimented with. We experimented with Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (LR) using Dimension Reduction with our brain parcellation. The best performing FNN models had intermediate layer sizes of 512 and 128. Linear activation was found to be more effective than non-linear activations for brain decoding. Feature Grouping suggested by Aydore et al. (2018) was also evaluated, utilizing a wide model approach. The study experimented with different neural network architectures for brain parcellation, including Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (LR). They found that linear activation was more effective than non-linear activations. The architecture for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) included 5 3-D convolution layers with specific dimensions and channel sizes. CoordConv was also used, with similar architecture to CNN. Non-linear activations and maxpooling were found to reduce performance. The study experimented with different neural network architectures for brain parcellation, including Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (LR). Linear activation was found to be more effective than non-linear activations. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and CoordConv (CC) were used with specific layer configurations. The input images were processed to reduce the number of parameters to roughly 2 million, similar to CNN and CC. Reducing the number of parameters by changing the number of features for each intermediate variable decreased performance for both convolution and FGL. Multiple datasets were split into train and test sets for evaluation. The study compared different neural network architectures for brain parcellation, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Feedforward Graph Learning (FGL). Experiments were conducted with multiple dataset splits for training and testing. Hyperparameters were selected to prevent overfitting. The study investigated the benefits of FGL with varying data sizes, depth, and vector length. Out-of-sample accuracy and p-values from Wilcoxon rank sum tests were reported for model comparisons. The study compared different neural network architectures for brain parcellation, including CNN and FGL. FGL outperformed baselines even with limited training data. Increasing FGL depth showed a significant improvement in test accuracy on the HCP dataset. The study compared neural network architectures for brain parcellation, with FGL showing significant test accuracy improvement on the HCP dataset. Increasing FGL depth vs. width proved beneficial, but code limitations prevented results on larger datasets. Training single layer FGL models with varying vector lengths showed improved test accuracy on most datasets. The study compared neural network architectures for brain parcellation, with FGL showing significant test accuracy improvement on the HCP dataset. FGL provides 2-6% improvement in test accuracy on 4 of 5 datasets when using 70% of data for training. On the Brainomics dataset, FGL performs on par with CNN based methods and better than Fully connected networks. Deeper models and an increase in c out also improve performance. The study introduced a new layer architecture called the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) for brain imaging, which extracts features within input groups. FGL showed significant test accuracy improvement on the HCP dataset and outperformed CNN and Fully connected networks on the Brainomics dataset. Increasing c out also enhances performance. The method aims to preserve spatial smoothness information encoded by hierarchical spatial clustering. Future work will focus on developing application-specific FGL architectures for various tasks. The study introduced the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) for brain imaging, showing improved test accuracy on datasets. FGL extracts features within input groups using a hierarchical structure. Future work will involve applying FGL to different tasks and domains. Input data is treated as variables with feature vectors, and groupings are based on hierarchical clustering. An experiment with a simulated dataset tested FGL's robustness. The study introduced the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL) for brain imaging, showing improved test accuracy on datasets. FGL extracts features within input groups using a hierarchical structure. We also ran FGL using clusters from K-Means clustering, with results showing FGL outperforming logistic regression and convolution. Multiple variants of FGL are possible, with the model involving linear transformation and rescaling operations. The curr_chunk discusses the transformation of data using linear transforms, rescaling with the Hadamard product, and aggregation with matrix multiplication. Different order of operations can create variants, such as aggregating first, then rescaling, and transforming. Parameters need to be adjusted accordingly. Another variant includes replacing aggregation with max operation within groups. This is similar to maxpool in CNNs and weighted-sum-pool depending on matrix values. The curr_chunk discusses the potential benefits of using multiple variable groupings in the transformation of data. By concatenating matrices representing different groupings, one can extract features within each group from the union of both groups. This allows for the utilization of various types of groupings, such as creating parcellations at different points of the accuracy-reproducibility tradeoff and using them simultaneously. In this section, the implementation challenges of using a single parcellation for significant performance gain are discussed. The implementation of FGL using PyTorch can be found at the provided GitHub link. Challenges include the high cost of matrix multiplication with a large number of input variables, suggesting ways to optimize the process. Prior literature has shown that the initialization of deep networks is crucial. Weights are randomly initialized by sampling from a uniform distribution. FGL extracts features for each segment of a square and passes the output to a fully connected network for label prediction. The fully connected network predicts labels using feature vectors of varying lengths. Convolution benefits from parameter sharing, unlike FGL which struggles with it. To reduce parameters, the operation is decomposed into multiplication by v and Hadamard product with u, making it more manageable. Further reduction through parameter sharing between groups is hindered by varying group sizes and variable ordering. The convolutional network architecture used repeated convolutional layers with a kernel size of 4 and a stride of 2, followed by a fully connected network. Maxpooling for downsampling and non-linear activation functions reduced performance. A visualization is provided in S1."
