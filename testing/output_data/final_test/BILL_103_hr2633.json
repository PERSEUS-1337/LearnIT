SEC. 3. TERMS amended to allow serving after term expiration until successor appointed. SEC. 4. REVISION OF PLAN. Section 6 of the Act allows for the revision of the Cultural Heritage and Land Management Plan within a year, addressing boundary changes and natural resource inventory. Any changes to the plan require approval from the Secretary. The Secretary must approve or disapprove any proposed changes to the plan, except for minor revisions. SEC. 5. Extension of Commission for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Sec. 7 of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor Amendments Act of 1993 states that the Commission will terminate 10 years after enactment unless extended for consecutive 10-year periods with approval from the appropriate committees, Secretary, and Governors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The Commission will be extended if the Governors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island provide assurances of continued support and the Commission effectively assists in preserving the resources of the Corridor. SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN. Subsection (c) of section 8 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to provide funds for projects in the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor that exhibit national significance or offer various opportunities, regardless of public or private ownership, to implement the Cultural Heritage and Land Management Plan. The Commission must submit a 10-year development plan to the Secretary to be eligible for funds under this section, with specific descriptions of annual work programs and cost-sharing details. Funds provided should not exceed 50% of total costs, with priority given to projects attracting non-Federal funding sources. Payments for conservation or restoration purposes are subject to conditions. Restoration of real property or structures must involve conveying a conservation easement to the Department of Environmental Management or the Historic Preservation Commission of the State, or paying back Federal funds if the resources are used contrary to the Act's purposes. The Secretary has the authority to determine if a conversion, use, or disposal of resources goes against the purposes of the Act and violates any agreements made. Authorization of appropriations for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is increased to $650,000 in subsection (a) and $5,000,000 for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996 in subsection (b), with additional funds as needed in subsequent years."
