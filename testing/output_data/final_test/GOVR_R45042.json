    "content": "Each year in October, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes the Short-Term Energy and Winter Fuels Outlook (STEWFO) to provide fuel-specific estimates of average annual heating expenditures. Individual expenses vary regionally based on factors like energy source, home size, energy efficiency, temperature preference, market size, and local weather conditions. Expenditures depend on fuel price, quantity used, and weather conditions measured by heating degree-days. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides winter heating degree-day estimates to the EIA for the STEWFO, which is a projection based on assumed values of key variables. NOAA forecasts a 10.6% increase in heating degree-days for the 2017-2018 heating season compared to 2016-2017 for the United States as a whole. Regional differences in weather and fuel usage patterns can cause expenditure projections to vary from the U.S. average, with the Northeast expecting a 3.5% increase and the West also expecting an increase. The EIA projects an increase in degree-days across different regions, with heating degree-days expected to rise by 23.6% in the South and 13% in the Midwest. U.S. household expenditures on heating fuel for the 2017-2018 season are predicted to increase due to higher prices and colder weather. Expenditures on natural gas are expected to rise the most in the Midwest at 16.9%, followed by increases in the South, Northeast, and West. Heating oil expenditures in the Northeast are projected to increase by 16.8%. Expenditures on heating oil, propane, and electricity are expected to increase in different regions due to changing market conditions and price volatility. Consumption levels are likely to be affected by variations in weather and consumer habits. The United States is self-sufficient in natural gas but participates in international trade, importing from Canada and Trinidad. It exports natural gas to Mexico, Canada, and liquefied natural gas to several countries including South Korea, Jordan, and Mexico. Natural gas is used by households, commercial customers for space heating, electric power generators, and industrial consumers for various purposes like fertilizer production. Consumers use natural gas as a raw material and heat source in industrial processes. Winter weather conditions affect households, commercial customers, and electric power generators the most. Average residential natural gas consumption and prices are presented for winter heating seasons 2013-2014 through projected values for 2017-2018. Winter consumption reflects the impact of recent warm winters, with the winter of 2017-2018 projected to have a 10.6% increase in heating degree-days. Approximately 48% of U.S. households heat with natural gas, and prices are expected to rise by about 2% compared to last year. The observed price-consumption relationship suggests that natural gas demand may be price inelastic due to home heating being a necessity. Lack of real-time information could lead to consumers making ill-informed decisions. Income levels and unemployment rate also play a role in natural gas consumption. EIA projects a 9.7% increase in expenditures for households heating with natural gas, driven by price and fuel consumption increases. Natural gas prices are expected to increase by 1.9%, with a 7.7% rise in fuel consumption. Heating expenditures will rise by 6.9% in the Northeast, 16.9% in the Midwest, 12.1% in the South, and 2.4% in the West. Average winter expenditures for 2017-2018 are projected to be $631 per household, compared to $575 in 2016-2017. Total natural gas consumption increased by 12% from 2011 to 2016, with the electric power sector seeing a 40% rise. Residential and commercial usage decreased, while industrial demand and vehicle consumption increased. The STEWFO projects a 2% increase in total natural gas consumption from 2016 to 2018, with a 9% increase in U.S. natural gas production. The U.S. is expected to become a net exporter of natural gas in the winter of 2017-2018 due to increased pipeline and LNG export capacity. Adequate natural gas storage is projected for the 2017-2018 heating season. The EIA projects a significant increase in home heating oil expenditures for the winter of 2017-2018, with an average increase of $209 per household. Heating oil is closely tied to crude oil and diesel fuel prices, with most consumers in the Northeast. Heating oil accounts for the highest average total expenditure among winter fuels, at $1,457 per household. The projected heating oil expenditure for winter 2017-2018 is $1,457 per household, more than double the cost of natural gas heating ($631) and two-thirds higher than electricity heating ($967). Diesel fuel has been more expensive than gasoline in 2017, with U.S. refiners focusing on gasoline production and high world demand for diesel fuel. Gasoline, diesel fuel, and home heating oil prices are all linked to crude oil prices on the world market. The EIA projects the refiner's acquisition cost of crude oil to average $48.75 per barrel in 2017, compared to $40.69 per barrel in 2016. Brent crude oil price was projected to be $54 per barrel during the winter heating season but averaged over $62 per barrel in November 2017. Changes in crude oil prices will likely affect home heating oil prices. Distillate inventories in the Northeast were lower than the previous year and the five-year average. The lower inventory levels are due to high global demand and the disruptive effects of Hurricane Harvey. Prices for home heating oil in the Northeast could rise rapidly if colder-than-expected weather occurs, leading to a need for more expensive imports. Cold weather in Europe could also increase pressure on prices. Propane consumers in the Northeast and Midwest are projected to experience cost increases, making propane the second most expensive fuel among those covered in the STEWFO. The EIA expects a decline in the number of households using propane in 2017-2018. Propane prices were higher in the Northeast compared to the Midwest, leading to higher heating season expenditures in the Northeast. Propane is a by-product of gasoline and natural gas production, so its supply is influenced by the supply of those fuels. Propane prices are indirectly influenced by factors affecting natural gas and home heating oil prices. Distribution costs are high due to the need for truck delivery of small quantities. Electricity prices are linked to natural gas, coal, and alternative fuel prices, with natural gas also competing as a home heating source. Approximately 40% of U.S. households use electricity as their primary heating source, with regional variations in usage. The number of households using electricity for space heating is expected to grow by 2% year-on-year, with the Midwest seeing the highest expansion at over 3%. Propane and heating oil customers are expected to decline by 1.3% and 3.5% respectively. Natural gas usage for space heating is expected to remain the same. Expenditures for households heating with electricity are projected to increase, with the Northeast seeing a 3.4% increase, the Midwest a 7.7% increase, the South an 8.6% increase, and the West a 3.8% increase. Wood and wood pellets are projected to provide primary home heating for approximately 2.3 million U.S. households in 2017-2018, with a year-on-year decline of 1.7% expected. The EIA does not track wood prices, making it difficult to calculate expected expenditure levels for the winter heating season. Wood prices are likely to be highly localized, with urban/rural and regional differences. Total household expenditures on home heating depend on the fuel price and quantity consumed, with weather and energy prices as primary risk factors. The 2017-2018 winter heating season is expected to be colder in all regions of the United States, with a range from 2.9% colder in the West to 23.6% colder in the South. The STEWFO includes heating expenditure scenarios estimates based on weather that is 10% warmer or 10% colder than the NOAA forecast. This weather variation affects the quantity demanded of heating fuel, which can impact the price. The quantity demanded of heating fuel is influenced by weather variations, impacting fuel prices. Factors like economic growth, unemployment, and crude oil prices also affect home heating costs. Natural gas prices are expected to rise despite increased production. Prices are expected to increase due to higher oil prices affecting heating oil and propane expenditures. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funding for block grants to states and emergency contingency funds, with a budget of $3.39 billion for FY2018. LIHEAP's ability to provide heating assistance depends on funding levels and energy costs. The level of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) depends on energy costs, weather severity, and the number of eligible households. Severe weather or volatile energy prices in the winter of 2017-2018 may result in smaller assistance payments or fewer families receiving help. U.S. households are expected to face increased heating costs due to higher fuel prices and colder weather. Changes in economic activity, fuel prices, and actual winter weather could impact expenditure projections."
