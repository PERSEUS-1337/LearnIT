The Act, known as the \"Federal Oil Royalty Protection Act of 1998,\" defines terms such as independent producer, integrated producer, commodity-based price, marker crude price, and affiliate. The Act defines terms related to ownership and gross proceeds from oil production contracts, including reimbursements and payments for services. It also clarifies the term \"transportation.\" The Act defines terms related to ownership and gross proceeds from oil production contracts, including reimbursements and payments for services. It also clarifies the term \"transportation\" as the movement of oil or gas from a central accumulation or treatment point to a point of sale or delivery. Additionally, it defines a \"concerned State\" as any State that shares in revenues received under Federal onshore or Outer Continental Shelf leases. SEC. 3. OIL VALUATION RULES. The Secretary may establish separate rules for calculating the value of crude oil for Federal royalty purposes, for independent and integrated producers on Federal leases. Rules for integrated producers must comply with specific provisions. Rules for independent producers may allow royalties based on gross proceeds from arm's-length contracts for true sales of crude oil. Rules under this subsection allow lessees to deduct transportation costs when valuing crude oil based on gross proceeds. Lessees must annually certify compliance with marketing duties, and breaching this duty incurs additional royalties and government costs. (iii) Violations of the certification required under this subparagraph will result in a penalty equal to the underpayment amount determined by the Secretary. For independent producers, rules not based on gross proceeds or for crude oil sold under non-arm's-length circumstances must use a market-based method, such as a commodity-based price or marker crude price. Rules will establish a single method for valuing crude oil, with the option to apply different methods as needed. The Secretary may apply different methods in various regions based on unique market characteristics and make necessary adjustments. If separate rules are not established, a single set of rules will govern calculations for both independent and integrated producers to determine the value of crude oil. Rules may vary by region based on market characteristics and adjustments may be made to commodity-based prices or marker crude prices. No other deductions, allowances, or adjustments to royalty payments are permitted. SEC. 4. ROYALTY RATE REDUCTIONS FOR STRIPPER AND HEAVY OIL. All royalty rate reductions for stripper and heavy oil granted by the Secretary on or before the date of enactment of this Act for oil produced from any Federal onshore lease are canceled, except for existing reductions applicable to leases held or operated by independent producers, which remain in effect until September 10, 1999 or cancellation by the Secretary. After canceling existing royalty rate reductions for oil production on Federal onshore leases, the Secretary may grant new reductions for a lease if certain conditions are met, including approval by the concerned State and a maximum duration of 3 years. SEC. 5. Transportation charge for Outer Continental Shelf production: The rate for transporting oil or gas from the Outer Continental Shelf to onshore sales points should not exceed actual costs plus a reasonable rate of return. SEC. 6. Review of compliance for pipeline right-of-way permittees. The Secretary will review compliance of holders of right-of-way permits under the Mineral Leasing Act, including requirements for publication of tariffs, access for unaffiliated shippers, and fair tariffs. Revocation of permits may occur if non-compliance is found. If the Secretary finds non-compliance with requirements for publication of tariffs and access for unaffiliated shippers, the right-of-way or permit may be revoked. Repeal of limitation on issuance of rules regarding valuation of crude oil for royalty purposes. Section 3009 of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, related to a restriction on using appropriations for issuing a final rule on crude oil valuation for royalty purposes, is removed."
