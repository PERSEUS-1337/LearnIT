    "content": "China is undergoing a significant political transition orchestrated by the Communist Party, set to conclude in 2014. The transition involves the selection of new national Communist Party leaders at the 18th Congress in November 2012, including a new General Secretary and Politburo Standing Committee. The military leadership is also expected to see changes. The upcoming political transition in China involves the selection of new national Communist Party leaders at the 18th Congress in November 2012. The transition includes appointing a new State President, Vice President, Premier, Vice Premiers, State Councilors, and government ministers at the 12th National People's Congress in March 2013. This marks the third orderly transfer of power since Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the second institutionalized transfer. The transitions have been overshadowed by a political scandal involving Bo Xilai, one of China's top officials. Bo Xilai, a top Chinese official, championed different priorities from Beijing, built a national following, and fell from grace due to his wife's alleged involvement in a murder. Lingering support for Bo at high levels in the Party and military complicated efforts to put the scandal behind. The uncertainty surrounding the leadership transition was heightened by Xi Jinping's disappearance in 2012, with speculation on his whereabouts ranging from a heart attack to political infighting. Xi Jinping's disappearance in 2012 raised speculation, with Chinese authorities yet to provide an explanation. The United States has a strong interest in China's political transitions due to economic interdependence and shared global responsibilities. China's military modernization also impacts U.S. strategic planning. The United States is interested in China's new leadership, their policy views, and how they can work with the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. is concerned about China's economic transition and the role of the state sector in driving growth. China's role in the global economy is a topic of debate, with questions about whether it should focus on domestic development or take a more assertive stance. The Chinese Communist Party faces challenges such as political corruption and calls for reform. The United States is also interested in China's new leadership and economic transition. The United States and Congress are interested in understanding China's political transitions, including the timing of top Party officials stepping down from their Party posts in November 2012 and their State posts in March 2013. Control of the Chinese military may not change hands until 2014. This understanding is crucial for evaluating progress towards participatory politics in China. The U.S. government emphasizes the importance of China's citizens having a lawful way to voice grievances and participate in their society's political development. The current political transition in China suggests that ordinary citizens have minimal role in the country's political development. The transition involves major political institutions like the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. For more information on China's political system and Xi Jinping, refer to CRS reports. The political transition in China involves key institutions like the Communist Party, People's Liberation Army, State, National People's Congress, and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The transitions span from local to national levels and are expected to take 18 months to three years. The first significant transition has already been completed with the selection of new Party Committees for provincial-level jurisdictions. The upcoming major transition in China involves the Party's 18th National Congress and the election of a new Central Committee and Central Discipline Inspection Commission. Delegates elected by Party members will participate in the Congress to select top officials and fight corruption within the Party. The upcoming Party Congress will elect a new Central Committee with slightly more candidates than positions. The Central Committee will then select members for elite governing bodies and approve the new Central Military Commission. No competition is expected in the selection process. The upcoming Party Congress will elect a new Central Committee with slightly more candidates than positions. This will lead to transitions in selecting provincial Governors and other provincial State leaders. China's political structure involves interlocking Party and State bureaucracies. The National People's Congress will elect the State President, Vice President, and Premier of the State Council in March 2013. Xi Jinping is expected to be named Party General Secretary and State President. The upcoming 12th National People's Congress will involve the election of key State personnel, including the State Councilor for foreign affairs and Vice Premier for foreign trade. Additionally, officials for the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, and a new Standing Committee for the National People's Congress will be elected. These changes are expected to impact U.S.-China dialogues and bilateral interactions. The upcoming 12th National People's Congress will involve the election of key State personnel, including the State Councilor for foreign affairs and Vice Premier for foreign trade. Top officials of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will also be selected. China's new Party leaders will take office between November 2012 and March 2013, with a four-month gap before the previous Party leaders step down from their State posts. This transition period differs from the quick agenda-setting of U.S. Presidents in their first 100 days in office. The four-month gap between appointments to Party and State posts in China may hinder new Party leaders from pushing through new policies immediately. There is uncertainty surrounding Hu Jintao's retirement from his post as head of China's Central Military Commission in November 2012, which could potentially be delayed for up to two more years. This contrasts with the U.S. system where older presidential candidates can replace younger incumbents due to strict age and term limits for senior positions in China. In China, younger leaders can replace older ones due to age and term limits set by the Party. Xi Jinping, at 59, is younger than his predecessor Hu Jintao, while Li Keqiang, at 57, is much younger than the outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao. This generational shift brings different life experiences, with the new leaders growing up under Communist Party rule and Deng's reform era. The Party's strict age and term limits are causing a significant turnover in senior leadership positions in China. The generational shift in Chinese leadership is driven by age and term limits set by the Party, with younger leaders replacing older ones. The rules for senior officials, although not publicly released, require candidates for elite governing bodies to be 67 or younger, and provincial Party Secretaries and Governors to be 62 or younger. This has led to a significant turnover in senior leadership positions, similar to the transitions during Hu Jintao's elevation in 2002-2004. Table 1 shows the expected personnel changes in China's top decision-making bodies in 2012 and 2013 due to age limits. The Communist Party's selection process for top leadership positions remains opaque, with straw polls among senior officials used to gauge support for candidates. Other factors like age, work experience, education, and patron-client ties also play a role in determining final candidate lists. The selection process for China's top leadership positions remains opaque, with factors like age, work experience, education, and patron-client ties playing a role. Former leaders like Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong are believed to have considerable influence over the process, aiming to fill the Politburo Standing Committee with loyalists. Other former leaders may also have a role in the decision-making process. It is unclear when and where final candidate lists are decided. Some analysts believe Party leaders make important decisions at Beidaihe beach resort. The Party introduces Politburo Standing Committee members without disclosing portfolios. Portfolios may not be clear until March 2013. The current collective leadership includes portfolios in foreign relations, military affairs, legislative affairs, government administration, and relations with non-Communists. The Party's Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) manages various portfolios including military affairs, government administration, ideology, finance, and internal security. Major decisions are made by consensus or super-majority vote among the nine members. Reports suggest the PSC may be reduced to seven members to facilitate decision-making. The primary goal of making the PSC smaller is to reach consensus on contentious issues. This could involve merging internal security and propaganda portfolios into other PSC members' roles or downgrading them to officials in the larger Politburo. Supporters of political reform hope this will reduce bureaucratic clout associated with repression in China. Others argue it may have little impact on the power of these bureaucracies. The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) is a recent innovation introduced in 2002. Only two current members are expected to retain their seats, with Xi Jinping likely to become the top-ranked member and Li Keqiang moving up in rank. The identities of other members are uncertain. Overseas scholars and media reports have identified potential candidates for the PSC. The upcoming Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) membership is crucial, with potential candidates linked to influential retired leaders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. The divide between their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s could impact the collective leadership's effectiveness. Xi Jinping is expected to lead the Chinese Communist Party and become State president in 2013, but it's uncertain if he will immediately replace Hu in the third top position. Hu may retain his position as chairman of the Party Central Military Commission to assist Xi in consolidating power. This role is seen as crucial in overseeing China's military, especially during high tensions with Japan and Southeast Asian countries. The East China Sea tensions, South China Sea disputes, potential North Korea nuclear test, and U.S. rebalancing towards Asia are key challenges. Analysts suggest Hu Jintao should retire completely during the political transition to allow his successor to take over all top posts. Hu's limited control over the military is contrasted with Xi's strong ties to the military. Xi Jinping, a former military officer with ties to the military, is married to a folk singer who heads the PLA's song and dance troupe. His connections to the military raise questions about his ability to control it and his support for its growing budgets. The political transition process in 2012 was complicated by the scandal involving Bo Xilai. The Party leadership announced Bo's expulsion, barring him from public office and ordering him into the judicial system for investigation. Bo's immunity as an NPC delegate will likely be revoked, leading to formal charges and trial. The case has damaged the Party's image and poses a challenge for new leaders and the Party as an institution. The Party leadership expelled Bo from the Party, holding him responsible for various crimes including his wife's murder of a British businessman and his vice mayor's defection. Bo was found to have violated Party rules for 20 years, abusing power, taking bribes, and engaging in improper sexual conduct. Bo, a charismatic figure in Chinese politics, was expelled from the Party for abusing power, taking bribes, and engaging in improper conduct. His loyal supporters pose a risk to Party unity and leader authority. Bo had high-level allies, but their current stance is uncertain. Bo's most vocal supporters are politically marginalized Marxists who embraced his \"Chongqing model\" for greater egalitarianism and state-owned industry, combined with a crackdown on organized crime. The Bo saga has exposed flaws in the Chinese political system, highlighting the lack of accountability for senior Party officials and a cavalier attitude toward the law. This could fuel calls for political and economic change that the Party is unprepared for. Bo's alleged misconduct over 20 years went unnoticed by Party authorities until a vice mayor reported him to U.S. diplomats. Despite this, Bo rose through high-profile positions, eventually reaching the Politburo. Calls for officials to be more accountable include allowing the media to expose misconduct and ending the practice of giving special treatment. Critics suggest reducing the state's role in the economy to prevent officials from enriching themselves. The Party's decision to subject Bo to the judicial process was to convince his supporters of his criminal behavior. However, China's judiciary is not independent, as Party committees oversee the State's police. China's judiciary in China is not independent, as Party committees oversee the State's police, prosecutors, and courts. The trials of other major figures in the Bo affair were criticized for procedural and evidentiary flaws. The upcoming \"Report on the Work of the 17th Central Committee\" at the 18th Party Congress will be presented by outgoing top leader Hu Jintao, with input from across the Party, including incoming top leader Xi Jinping. The upcoming report at the 18th Party Congress will outline the Party's priorities for the next five years, likely using coded language. It will argue for the continuation of Hu's \"Scientific Concept of Development\" and contrast his approach with Jiang Zemin's policies that led to social inequities and environmental degradation. Hu introduced the \"scientific concept of development\" to balance urban and rural development, economic growth, and ecological stewardship. Criticism of his tenure includes failure to address economic inequality and support the private sector. State-owned industries and political reform are key areas of scrutiny. In 2007, the Chinese Communist Party reaffirmed its commitment to the state sector and private sector development. The Party also made modest commitments to political reform, such as holding more public hearings for laws and regulations. Hu Jintao spent a decade as heir apparent before assuming top leadership roles. Hu Jintao spent a decade as heir apparent before assuming top leadership roles. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang have been apprenticing for their upcoming leadership positions. A new generation of officials born in the 1960s is being groomed for national leadership roles. This leadership transition has brought younger officials to national prominence, with some potentially being appointed to the Party Politburo in the future. If Xi Jinping serves two terms as China's top leader, a new generation of officials born in the 1960s is being groomed for national leadership roles. Thirteen officials born in 1965 or later, who sit on provincial Communist Party committees, are likely to rise to national prominence if the political system remains unchanged. In 2002-2004, Jiang Zemin yielded power to Hu Jintao in an orderly transition. The current challenge for China's new leaders is to undertake a second transition. Unlike the previous transition, Xi Jinping, Hu's successor, lacks insulation from criticism. In 2002-2004, Hu and his colleagues managed the influence of retired Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Now, Xi Jinping and his colleagues face the challenge of managing the influence of both Jiang and Hu, along with a new cohort of retired leaders. If Hu remains as Central Military Commission chairman, the new leadership will have to handle his influence on the national stage. The rise of micro-blogging in China has made political gossip spread faster than the Party can censor it. The rise of micro-blogging in China has enabled real-time reporting on various events, including industrial accidents and protests, holding corrupt officials accountable. China's new leaders will face the challenge of shifting the economic growth model and determining the role of state-owned industries, as the traditional export markets struggle with global financial crises. China's working age population is predicted to shrink after 2015 due to the global financial crisis and European debt crisis. In response, China's leadership outlined a new growth model in its 12th Five Year Plan, focusing on higher value manufacturing, an expanded service sector, green industries, and domestic consumption. The World Bank and China's State Council Research Development Center emphasized the need to reduce the state's role for a successful economic transition. The World Bank and China's State Council Research Development Center recommended reducing the state's role in the economy, breaking up state monopolies, strengthening the private sector, and providing equal access to social services and employment opportunities for all citizens. This poses a challenge to powerful interest groups and current Communist doctrine, as state-owned corporations and Communist Party families have benefited from their monopolies and control over key economic levers. Wealthy regions have exploited cheap labor from rural migrants without offering them the same social services and opportunities as others. Chinese critics of the World Bank/DRC report argue that heavy state involvement in the economy has benefited China, with state-owned enterprises responsible for over half of economic output and employment. They believe the private sector-led approach advocated in the report is discredited due to global financial crisis and slow growth in the US. The US is interested in China's economic direction, as it looks to China for global growth. China's foreign policy has been guided by Deng Xiaoping's precepts for the last two decades, but some in China believe it may be time for a more assertive approach. As China's economy and military have grown, there is debate on whether to move away from Deng's counsel of \"Hide one's capabilities and bide one's time.\" China has moved away from Deng's dictums, actively participating in global efforts such as managing the European debt crisis and containing nuclear programs. Its military has been involved in anti-piracy missions since 2008. In territorial disputes, China now asserts sovereignty more forcefully and takes unilateral actions. The new leaders will decide whether to go beyond Deng's principles as a status quo or revisionist power, which the US closely watches. The United States closely watches China's new leadership as they face challenges in responding to calls for political reform and addressing corruption cases within the Party. The spotlight on unchecked power of senior Party officials has led to renewed calls for accountability and strengthening the rule of law. The Party investigated 640,000 corruption cases from 2007 to 2012, reflecting the need for reform. From November 2007 to June 2012, the Party referred only 24,000 out of 640,000 corruption cases to judicial authorities for prosecution, reflecting reluctance to prosecute its cadres. A Pew Research Center poll showed 50% of Chinese view corrupt officials as a major issue, up from 39% in 2008. The Party acknowledges public concern over corruption and power abuse, stating that these issues are damaging to the Party and the State. The commentary highlighted the need for the Party to address corruption and power abuse, emphasizing the importance of checking officials' power. It rejected the idea of adopting Western political systems and stressed the leadership of the Communist Party of China."
