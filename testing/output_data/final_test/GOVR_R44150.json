    "content": "The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement proposed a Stream Protection Rule to update regulations for coal mining operations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The revisions aim to reflect current science, technology, and mining practices, addressing the need for improved implementation of SMCRA provisions related to stream protection, data evaluation for coal mining impacts, and objective compliance standards. The proposed Stream Protection Rule aims to update regulations for coal mining operations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the need for new federal rules and whether the proposed approach will strengthen implementation of the law. Critics argue that the revisions are unnecessary and will negatively impact the coal mining industry, labeling it as a \"war on coal\" by the Obama Administration. Environmental advocacy groups have generally supported the efforts of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The report discusses the proposed Stream Protection Rule under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. It outlines key elements of the 2015 proposal, reactions from stakeholders, and the final rule released by OSM in December 2016. Congress enacted SMCRA in 1977, establishing OSM within the Department of the Interior. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established OSM within the Department of the Interior, with the Secretary responsible for carrying out its requirements. The statute aims to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations while balancing environmental protection with the nation's need for coal as an energy source. Congress identified stream protection as a fundamental purpose of SMCRA, making it a complex program in environmental law. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) aims to protect society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations. Section 515 of the act establishes minimum performance standards for environmental protection and public health and safety in surface coal mining and reclamation operations. These standards address disturbances to surface areas that burden commerce and the public welfare, including erosion, landslides, floods, water pollution, habitat destruction, property damage, and hazards to life and property. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) requires mining operators to obtain permits for surface coal mining operations, including special circumstances like mountaintop removal mining. The permit covers the entire mining lifecycle, from siting to reclamation after extraction is complete. The act aims to restore land to its original contour, prevent acid mine drainage, control erosion, and reclaim affected lands and waters. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) mandates obtaining permits for surface coal mining operations, ensuring compliance with regulations. Applicants must submit mining operation proposals, obtain performance bonds, and adhere to reclamation obligations. States can regulate mining activities on non-federal lands by submitting programs for approval. States can regulate surface coal mining on non-federal and non-Indian lands by submitting programs for approval by OSM. Once approved, the state has primary responsibility for enforcing the act, issuing permits, and making amendments to their programs. OSM evaluates state performance and provides backup enforcement if needed. Currently, coal mining is happening in 26 states, with all but Tennessee and Washington having achieved program primacy. Tribes do not currently have primacy, and the permit is essential under SMCRA. The permit is crucial under SMCRA, allowing regulatory authorities to determine mining feasibility and establish terms. It aims to protect public health, safety, and the environment by requiring detailed operation planning to avoid adverse impacts and facilitate reclamation. Permits are typically issued for five-year terms and carry the right of renewal. Regulatory authorities have enforcement powers over mining operations, evaluating reclamation feasibility and risks to water supplies and other resources. Permits issued under the Clean Water Act (CWA) aim to maintain water quality by regulating pollutant discharges from coal mining activities. Section 404 allows for dredged or fill material discharges, while Section 402 governs other pollutants. Permits are typically valid for five years with the option for renewal, contingent on compliance with regulations and adequate bonding. Permits under the Clean Water Act regulate pollutant discharges from coal mining activities. Section 404 permits dredged or fill material discharges, while Section 402 governs other pollutants. NPDES permits limit specified pollutants. EPA sets technology-based effluent limits for coal mining operations. Section 401 requires state certification for federal licenses. The Clean Water Act and SMCRA have separate regulatory programs for coal mining activities. The CWA focuses on regulating pollutant discharges into waters of the United States, while SMCRA regulates environmental impacts of surface coal mining operations. Compliance with federal and state water quality requirements is necessary for permits under both laws. SMCRA regulates environmental impacts of mining operations, including hydrologic impacts, while the CWA focuses on pollutant discharges into water. SMCRA requires comprehensive preplanning for mine operations, unlike the CWA. The Office of Surface Mining (OSM) established permanent program performance standards in 1979 to implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), including the stream buffer zone rule for coal mining operations. This rule prohibits surface disturbance within 100 feet of perennial streams unless the original stream channel is restored and the activities do not harm the stream's quantity and quality. In 1983, OSM revised the stream buffer zone rules to protect perennial and intermittent streams from disturbance by coal mining activities. The rules stated that no land within 100 feet of a stream shall be disturbed unless a variance is granted by the regulatory authority. The variance must ensure that the mining activity will not harm water quality. The 1983 rules revised stream buffer zone rules to protect streams from coal mining activities. A draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement was developed in 2003 to address mountaintop removal mining effects. OSM proposed changes to the rules in 2004 to improve consistency with the Clean Water Act. The 2004 proposal for revised buffer zone rules was not finalized, leading to the release of a new PEIS and draft rules in 2007. Final revised buffer zone rules were issued by OSM in December 2008, focusing on minimizing land disturbance and avoiding disturbance of streams and surrounding lands. Permit applicants were required to analyze alternatives to minimize adverse impacts on the environment. The final rules issued by OSM in December 2008 did not mandate avoiding placement of coal mine waste in or within 100 feet of streams in all cases, citing lack of viable alternatives. Restoration of stream ecological functions was not required, and the rules replaced previous language to align more closely with SMCRA than the Clean Water Act. The 2008 rules issued by OSM did not require avoiding disturbance of streams or land within 100 feet of streams in all cases, aligning more with SMCRA than the Clean Water Act. The rules aimed to reduce confusion and conform to historical practices, but both industry and environmental groups felt they did little to change the existing practice of disposing excess spoil into valleys and streams. Environmental groups expressed concerns that the final rules would actually reduce environmental protection for streams. The final rules issued in 2008 by OSM were criticized by environmental groups for potentially reducing environmental protection for streams by making it easier for coal mine operators to obtain exemptions from the stream buffer zone requirement. The Obama Administration sought to vacate these rules in 2009, arguing that they did not adequately protect water quality and stream habitat, but the court rejected this request, leaving the 2008 rules in place. In 2014, a federal court ruled that the 2008 rules for coal mining were issued without necessary consultation with wildlife agencies, vacating them and reinstating the 1983 stream buffer zone rule. OSM formally withdrew the 2008 rules in December 2014. In 2009, an interagency plan was implemented to reduce environmental impacts of surface coal mining in Appalachian states. In 2009, an interagency plan was implemented to reduce environmental impacts of surface coal mining in Appalachian states. One of the actions included revising the 2008 stream buffer zone rule. OSM officials began working on a new rule and draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to apply nationwide. Critics raised concerns about economic impacts and EIS quality, while advocates argued for the need to protect the environment. OSM officials and environmental advocacy groups pushed for a new rule, the Stream Protection Rule, to safeguard waterways from surface mining nationwide. Despite delays, draft rules and an EIS were released in July 2015. The proposed rule expanded beyond the stream buffer zone to cover the entire mine permit area. The comment period was extended in September 2015 in response to requests for more time to review and provide feedback. The 2015 proposed rule by OSM extended the comment period until October 26, 2015, allowing over 100 days for comments. The rule was complex, with 262 pages in the Federal Register, proposing new stream protection regulations and revising existing SMCRA rules for clarity. The Draft EIS highlighted the need for regulatory improvements in surface coal mining. Surface coal mining operations continued to have negative effects on streams, fish, and wildlife, prompting OSM to consider a different approach to implementing SMCRA. OSM concluded that existing regulations were inadequate to protect society and the environment, leading to the development of a proposed rule with nine regulatory alternatives. The preferred alternative aimed to be more environmentally protective than existing rules. The preferred alternative for the proposed rule aimed to be more environmentally protective by including new requirements for baseline data collection, specificity on reclamation plans, and measures to protect fish and wildlife from mining impacts. The proposed rule includes requirements for baseline data collection, expanded water sample analysis, and documentation of stream conditions and sediment load. The proposed rule mandates quarterly monitoring of surface water and groundwater during mining and reclamation. Permit holders must analyze samples for specified parameters and designate monitoring sites in the permit. Additionally, they must annually assess the biological condition of streams. The permit requires annual monitoring of stream biological condition until full restoration is achieved. Monitoring data must be reviewed annually for adverse trends, and on-site precipitation measurements collected. Inspection of surface water runoff control structures is required after each storm event. The regulatory authority must ensure proposed operations prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The proposed rule redefined \"material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area\" as any adverse impact from mining operations on surface or groundwater that would affect water quality or quantity, or the biological condition of streams. This definition includes impacts from both surface and underground mining activities. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) rules apply to underground coal mines, addressing adverse impacts like subsidence and toxic mine discharge. Mining near streams involves activities within a stream or buffer zone, with restrictions on disturbing land within 100 feet of a stream. Regulatory authorities can authorize activities closer to streams if water quality standards are met and water quantity and quality are not adversely affected. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) rules do not specifically mention restrictions on construction activities near streams, but most state regulatory authorities allow activities like excess spoil fills, refuse piles, and sedimentation ponds in stream buffer zones. While excess spoil minimization is not required by rule, states have policies to reduce excess spoil generation and comply with Clean Water Act regulations. The 1983 SMCRA rules did not provide specific protections for ephemeral streams. The proposed rule aims to protect perennial and intermittent streams with significant environmental-resource value, including some protections for ephemeral streams. It would prohibit mining activities near these streams unless certain conditions are met. The proposed rule prohibits mining activities near perennial and intermittent streams unless specific conditions are met, including the establishment of a 100-foot-wide riparian corridor on each side of the streams. The proposed rule requires the establishment of a riparian corridor with native trees and shrubs along streams after mining activities. Applicants must demonstrate no alternative to placing excess spoil or coal mine waste in streams, with a focus on minimizing impact on fish, wildlife, and the environment. The proposed rule aims to ensure stability and safety of excess spoil fills, with added requirements for environmental protection. This includes minimizing adverse effects on streams, preventing water quality violations, and promoting revegetation. Permittees must obtain Clean Water Act authorizations before starting work, with enforcement action for non-compliance. The proposed rule aims to prohibit construction of durable rock fills using end-dumping, which can lead to structural instability and impair drainage. Mining through streams involves diverting stream channels to extract coal, with no requirement to reconstruct the original stream location. Other types of fills like valley fills would still be allowed under the new rules. The proposed rule would allow mining through any type of stream, requiring the applicant to show no reasonable alternative to avoid mining or diverting the stream. The design must minimize the extent of stream mined and restore the stream channels to their pre-mining characteristics. The proposed rule allows mining through streams if no reasonable alternative exists, with designs to minimize mining extent and restore stream channels to pre-mining conditions. Permittees must establish riparian corridors post-mining. After mining activities, streams must be restored with native trees and shrubs. Restoring the original contour after mining can be challenging, especially in mountaintop removal and steep slope mining where rock swells and cannot be fully replaced. Mountaintop removal mining operations may be exempt from AOC restoration requirements if post-mining land use and surface topography requirements are met. Proposed post-mining land use must be commercial, industrial, residential, agricultural, or public facility. Regulatory authority must ensure it meets all requirements and is an equal or better economic use of the land. Proposed rule is similar to existing rules for mountaintop removal. The proposed rule for mountaintop removal mining operations would require applicants to demonstrate no damage to natural watercourses, no adverse changes in discharges, and no increase in peak flows compared to restoring the site to AOC. Reforestation with native species may be required unless it conflicts with post-mining land use. The proposed rule allows surface coal mining operations in steep slope areas to apply for variances from the AOC requirement in exchange for specific post-mining land use. The post-mining use must be industrial, commercial, residential, or public in nature and must improve the watershed compared to pre-mining conditions. The requirements for AOC variances in steep slope operations are generally similar to existing rules. Under the proposal, permit applicants for steep slope variances must meet criteria to minimize adverse impacts on aquatic ecology and improve surface water flow. The variance cannot involve excess spoil fill in streams and any surface deviations must be necessary for post-mining land use. Restoration of disturbed areas to their pre-mining capability is required under existing rules. The proposed rule emphasizes restoring the site's ability to support its previous uses before mining, with a focus on revegetation using native species and salvaging topsoil for vegetation support. The proposed rule requires salvage and redistribution of organic matter from native species for reclamation, prohibits burning and burial of debris, and mandates the use of materials for fish and wildlife enhancement measures. Mine operators must minimize disturbances to fish, wildlife, and environmental values and enhance resources where possible. The proposed rule mandates that surface mining activities must not harm endangered species or critical habitats. Disturbances to wetlands, riparian vegetation, and habitats of high value for fish and wildlife must be avoided. Restoration or enhancement of resources is required where possible. Reclaimed areas must have plant species selected for their nutritional value and ability to support fish and wildlife habitat. The proposal for surface mining activities includes establishing a 100-foot-wide riparian corridor with native trees and shrubs along streams post-mining. Mandatory fish and wildlife enhancement measures are required for long-term loss of native forest. The proposed rule would require mandatory measures for long-term loss of native forest, other plant communities, and filling of intermittent streams. It would allow regulatory authorities to prohibit mining in high-value habitats within permit areas. The final Stream Protection Rule would take effect in states with federal programs and on Indian lands 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. Permit applications approved after that date must comply with the rule, and existing mining operations must comply within five years. Implementation in primacy states with approved programs may take up to 42 months. OSM estimates coal industry will incur $52 million in annual compliance costs under the proposed rule, with variations by mine type and region. Compliance deadline for existing mining operations is within five years of permit renewal. Forecast compliance costs vary by mine type and region. The $52 million total includes $45 million annually for surface coal mining and $7 million annually for underground mining. In Appalachia, 46% of the costs are due to new regulatory requirements, with 72% of the increased costs for surface mining operations. Surface mines in certain regions may see a $0.60 per ton cost increase, while underground mines in those regions will not see an increase. Compliance costs for surface mines in Appalachia are estimated to increase operational costs by $0.40 per ton, while underground mines will see a $0.01 increase. OSM estimated that administrative costs of the proposed rule for industry and government will be small, adding on average about $0.01 per ton of coal mined for industry. Costs in Appalachia will be slightly higher, with surface mining operations expected to increase by $0.03 per ton and underground mines by $0.04 per ton. Government administrative costs are estimated to range from $1,830 to $2,546 per mine annually, with an average of $46,000 annually. The government estimates that administrative costs for regulating agencies in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains region will be $24,200 annually. Of the 382 small mines affected by the proposed rule, 91% are in Appalachia. 76% of these mines in Appalachia would have compliance costs of less than 5% of their revenues, while nearly 11% would incur costs of 10% or more. The Small Operator Assistance Program could provide training and financial support to some small operators. The Small Operator Assistance Program could help small operators with training and financial assistance for permit applications. Compliance costs for SBA small entities in Appalachia are estimated to be 4.7% for surface mines and 2.5% for underground mines. The total annual compliance costs for the proposed rule would not exceed $60 million. The rule is not considered economically significant by the Office of Management and Budget. Without the proposed rule, U.S. coal production is forecasted to decrease. The proposed rule by OSM is expected to decrease U.S. coal production by about 1.9 million tons annually, primarily due to increased coal production costs leading to a shift towards natural gas among power plants, especially in Appalachia. The proposed rule by OSM is expected to decrease U.S. coal production in specific regions, with no increase in stranded reserves. Coal industry employment is projected to decrease by over 15,000 full-time equivalents. The proposed rule by OSM is expected to decrease U.S. coal production in specific regions, leading to a projected decrease of over 15,000 full-time equivalents in coal industry employment by 2040. The rule will result in a reduction of 260 jobs on average each year, with some new highly skilled jobs being created while others will require similar skills as currently used in the industry. The proposed rule by OSM is expected to reduce coal-related employment by 260 jobs annually, with an additional 250 jobs created from increased compliance activity. Severance tax revenue for states is directly linked to coal mining activity, with an estimated annual decline of $2.5 million in revenue across all coal-producing states. West Virginia and Kentucky are projected to bear over 80% of the lost severance tax revenues. OSM estimated that changes in mining practices due to the Stream Protection Rule will reduce adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The proposed rule is projected to improve water quality and result in stream restoration and reforestation, with benefits quantified in terms of biophysical changes such as acres of forest improved annually. However, data limitations prevented OSM from fully assessing all impacts. The proposed rule aims to improve water quality, stream restoration, and reforestation, with benefits including increased carbon storage, reduced emissions, and decreased human health risks. OSM acknowledged limitations in quantifying all benefits due to data constraints. OSM's analyses of the proposed rule acknowledge uncertainties in compliance costs, industry changes, coal supply and demand, permitting delays, and future regulatory impacts. Administrative costs estimates may differ from actual expenses, and limitations exist in accurately monetizing benefits associated with water quality. Public comment is sought on these costs. The National Mining Association and West Virginia Coal Association criticized the proposed rule for lack of evidence justifying more regulations and potential job losses in the mining industry. They called on Congress to block the rule, stating it interferes with state agencies' laws. The National Mining Association and West Virginia Coal Association criticized a proposed rule for potential job losses in the mining industry. They disagreed with a report estimating job losses and raised concerns about increased costs and state primacy under SMCRA. State regulators also worry about changes in practices and administrative costs resulting from the rule. Some states and mining industry groups criticize OSM for lack of consultation during the development of a proposed rule. States dropped out of the process due to concerns about the rule's substance and lack of access to relevant documents. Congress directed OSM to provide states with necessary materials before finalizing the rule, but there is disagreement on OSM's responsiveness. Environmental advocacy groups initially supported OSM's efforts for a more environmentally protective rule, but now criticize the proposed rule for not doing enough to protect. Some critics argue that the proposed rule by OSM is not stringent enough to protect streams. They suggest that a rule prohibiting all mining activities within the buffer zone would be more preferable. Regulatory Alternative 2, not chosen by OSM, would have imposed stricter regulations, including prohibiting mining near perennial streams and requiring restoration of mined lands to their original contour. This alternative would require an amendment to SMCRA to eliminate exceptions for mountaintop removal and steep slope mining operations. Alternative 2, not chosen by OSM, would impose stricter regulations on mining activities, including prohibiting mining near perennial streams and requiring restoration of mined lands to their original contour. This alternative would have greater environmental benefits but also higher compliance costs and reduced coal production. Congressional interest in OSM's efforts to develop new SMCRA implementing rules has been strong, with concerns raised about enforcement, transparency, coordination with state regulators, and potential economic impacts. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to halt or redirect OSM's activities regarding the Stream Protection Rule. The Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act (STREAM Act, H.R. 1644) was passed by the House on January 12, 2016. It would have authorized a study on the regulatory effectiveness of the 1983 Stream Buffer Zone rule and required the Secretary of the Interior to make scientific data publicly available. A similar Senate bill, S. 1458, also known as the STREAM Act, would have required amendments to SMCRA. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 2822, aimed to prevent OSM from using FY2016 funds to change the 1983 stream buffer zone rule. However, the FY2016 appropriations act did not include provisions to stop OSM's rule development. The final Stream Protection Rule released by OSM on December 19, 2016, closely resembles the 2015 proposed rule with revisions. Changes include revised requirements for water quality monitoring data and stream definitions aligned with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers definitions. The definition of \"material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area\" is revised by providing a list of factors for regulatory authorities to identify thresholds. Post-mining requirements for mountaintop removal mining operations are updated, including the need for partially implemented post-mining land use before bond release. Clarifications were made in response to industry criticism. The final Stream Protection Rule clarifies that longwall mining can temporarily impact streams as long as it does not cause material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. Streamside vegetative corridors must be at least 100-feet wide on each side of a restored stream. OSM's Final Regulatory Impact Analysis forecasts lower coal production and increased industry compliance costs compared to the draft RIA due to regulatory changes in the final rule. OSM's analysis changed due to regulatory changes in the final rule and revised estimates based on public comments. The coal industry faces a 10% decrease in national production between 2020 and 2040. Compliance costs of the final rule for the coal industry increased to $81.5 million annually, compared to $52 million in the proposal. The Proposed Rule led to increased industry and regulatory costs, particularly in bonding and administrative expenses. Despite higher compliance costs, OSM predicts minimal employment impacts, with a net gain of 156 full-time jobs. Critics dispute OSM's estimates and argue that adverse effects on coal production will be greater. The final rule does not adopt more stringent regulatory approaches favored by some advocacy groups. In the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the rule, OSM believes that prohibiting all surface coal mining near streams would negatively impact energy production. The coal industry and some Members of Congress opposed the final rule, introducing legislation to overturn it. Legal challenges were also filed against the rule. If the final rule is overturned by legislative, presidential action, or court in the 115th Congress, existing rules like the 1983 stream buffer zone rule will remain until new rules or guidance are issued."
