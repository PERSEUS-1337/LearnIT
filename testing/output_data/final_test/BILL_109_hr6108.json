    "content": "The Act titled \"Flood Insurance Community Outreach Grant Program Act of 2006\" is established for the purpose of providing outreach grants for flood insurance. Following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, the Federal Government and State and local governments have increased resources for flood protection measures in communities across the United States. $7 billion in emergency spending has been directed towards restoring hurricane protection in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, along with $1.9 billion from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control nationwide. Improving infrastructure is crucial for comprehensive flood protection efforts. To enhance flood protection, communities need to assess flood risk and educate the public on the importance of flood insurance. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) must be financially stable and efficient to reduce flood risk. FEMA, which oversees the NFIP, should collaborate with communities to educate residents in flood-prone areas. Over 20,000 communities participate in the NFIP, with properties in special flood hazard areas. Despite the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance in special flood hazard areas, a significant percentage of property owners with mortgages from federally regulated lenders do not have a policy. The number of communities participating in the NFIP will increase as FEMA's flood map modernization program reassesses flood risk nationwide, bringing new communities under the mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA partners with communities to educate property owners about flood risk and insurance importance. Outreach activities can lead to reduced premiums under NFIP. Properties outside special flood hazard areas are still at risk, especially in levee-protected areas. FEMA estimates 20-25% of properties are at risk of flooding. In communities where properties are released from the Federal flood insurance purchase requirement, outreach activities can educate the public about maintaining flood insurance coverage. Many property owners in moderate-to-low risk flood areas may qualify for low-cost preferred risk policies. The purpose of this Act is to establish a flood insurance outreach and education grants program to provide resources for educating property owners and renters on flood insurance options, while strengthening the national flood insurance program. By partnering with local flood control authorities, FEMA aims to promote flood safety and insurance, retain NFIP policies in communities no longer subject to mandatory purchase requirements, and reduce the number of uninsured property owners in flood-risk areas to lessen the fiscal impact of flood disasters. SEC. 1325. GRANTS FOR OUTREACH TO PROPERTY OWNERS AND RENTERS. The Director may make grants to local governmental agencies for floodplain management activities in communities participating in the national flood insurance program to encourage the purchase of flood insurance and increase awareness of flood risk reduction through outreach and educational activities. The Director is responsible for identifying owners and renters in communities participating in the national flood insurance program, notifying them of changes in flood hazard areas, educating them on flood risk reduction, and the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement. The Director educates owners and renters on the benefits of flood insurance, including lower-cost policies, and encourages them to acquire coverage. Local governmental agencies must contribute non-Federal funds for activities related to flood risk reduction. The term 'non-Federal funds' for this subsection includes State or local government agency amounts, in-kind contributions, staff salaries, volunteer services, donated materials, and building leases. The Director can use up to 5% of funds for administrative costs. Application and selection processes are overseen by the Director. The Director oversees the application and selection processes for local governmental agencies to receive grants under this section. Selection considerations include cooperative agreements with FEMA and history of flood losses in the area. In each fiscal year, the Director may use up to 50 percent of available grants to carry out activities in areas determined to have high-risk properties not covered by flood insurance. This includes assessing success in generating voluntary insurance purchases and technical outreach capacity of local agencies. The Director may allocate grants to high-risk properties without flood insurance coverage. Local agencies must report on activities funded by grants, and $50,000,000 is authorized for grants annually from 2007 to 2011."
