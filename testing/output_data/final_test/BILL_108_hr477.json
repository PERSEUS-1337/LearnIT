    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Duwamish Tribal Recognition Act, also known as the Treaty of Point Elliott, was signed in 1855 by Chief Si'ahl of the Duwamish Tribe. Despite promises made in the treaty, the United States failed to fulfill obligations to the tribe. In 1925, the Duwamish Tribe adopted its constitution and bylaws and later received a $62,000 settlement for lands taken without compensation. In 2001, the Duwamish Tribe received federal recognition, but it was later reversed in September of the same year. The Duwamish Tribe's federal recognition was reversed in 2001, and subsequent appeals to reconsider the decision were denied by the Secretary of the Interior in 2002. Despite signing the Point Elliott Treaty nearly 150 years ago, the Duwamish people continue to seek the recognition promised by the treaty. Federal recognition is extended to the Duwamish Tribe, with all applicable laws and regulations for Indians now applying to the Tribe and its members. The Duwamish Tribe and its members are eligible for Federal services and benefits, regardless of reservation status or residence location. The Tribe's service area includes King, Kitsap, Pierce, Lewis, and Mason Counties. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 9 months of the Act's enactment, based on qualifications in the governing document. The Secretary will publish the roll in the Federal Register, and the Tribe must maintain it. The Tribe must conduct an election to adopt a constitution within 9 months of the Act's enactment. Until then, the interim governing documents will be in effect. After adopting a constitution, the Tribe must elect a governing body within 6 months. The governing body of the Tribe will be selected according to the election procedures specified in the interim governing documents. SEC. 7. LAND IN TRUST. The Secretary will take land into trust for the Tribe if they transfer their rights to specified lands within 10 years. The Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture will identify the Tribe's aboriginal homelands. The United States will not be liable for any conditions on the land taken into trust."
