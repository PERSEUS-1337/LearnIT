    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress found that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered Government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis. Their failures led to the deepest economic decline since World War II, resulting in the Bush Administration placing them in conservatorship in September 2008. In September 2008, the Bush Administration established a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In February 2009, the Obama Administration raised the stock purchase commitment to $400 billion. By Christmas Eve 2009, the Obama Administration removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in taxpayers owning nearly 80% of the two GSEs. The Congressional Budget Office concluded that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have effectively become Government-owned entities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, now government entities, are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Despite this, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved excessive compensation packages for their CEOs in 2009-2011. The FHFA approved multi-million dollar cash compensation packages for top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, excluding bonuses and long-term incentives for 2008. The Strategic Plan includes a commitment to operate the GSEs safely and soundly. The FHFA can withhold executive compensation payments for review under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.
