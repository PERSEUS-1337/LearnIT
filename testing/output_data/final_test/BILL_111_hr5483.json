The United States Cadet Nurse Corps was established during World War II to address the extreme shortage of nurses and medical personnel. It was under the jurisdiction of the Public Health Service and provided opportunities for young women to serve the country by filling the nursing shortage. During World War II, the United States Cadet Nurse Corps addressed the nursing shortage by training members with 12-hour days in hospitals and classes. Members pledged to be available for military or essential civilian services, wore uniforms certified by the Secretary of the Army, and cared for sick and wounded Armed Forces members. The United States Cadet Nurse Corps played a crucial role in saving civilian hospital nursing services during World War II by providing 80 percent of the nursing staff. Members served across the nation, occasionally substituting for doctors, and their legacy includes maintaining a strong healthcare system, professionalizing nursing education, and increasing public recognition of nurses. The United States Cadet Nurse Corps made significant contributions during World War II, providing 80% of nursing staff and helping to maintain a strong healthcare system. Despite their historic role, they are not recognized as a military organization or veterans of the United States Army.

The President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the award of a single gold medal to honor the United States Cadet Nurse Corps for their patriotism and civic activism during World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the gold medal, and the Smithsonian Institution will be involved in the process. Following the award of the gold medal to honor the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the Smithsonian make the gold medal available for display at other locations associated with the Cadet Nurse Corps. The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates of the gold medal in bronze under this Act. Medals struck are considered national medals. An amount not exceeding $30,000 is authorized for the cost of the medal, with proceeds from bronze medal sales deposited in the Mint Public Enterprise Fund."
