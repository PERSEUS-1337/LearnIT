    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps Designation Implementation Act.\" It includes findings related to the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a political and ideological military organization separate from the Iranian military. It spreads Iran's ideology globally to terrorist groups and deployed fighters abroad during the Iran-Iraq War to spread the Iranian Revolution in the Middle East. The Qods Force, a paramilitary arm of the IRGC, conducts foreign operations and formed relationships with Shiite and Kurdish groups, including Hizballah in Lebanon. The IRGC was designated as an entity of proliferation concern in 2007. The IRGC and Qods Force, designated as terrorism supporting entities, raise funds through front businesses and affiliate groups, playing a significant role in the Iranian economy. Notably, Khatam-ol-Anbia (Ghorb) received multi-billion dollar contracts for gas pipeline construction and oil development projects. In 2008, IRGC naval ships approached US vessels aggressively in the Strait of Hormuz. In 2007, IRGC members captured 15 British sailors in the Persian Gulf. Iranian surrogates increased attacks in 2006 and 2007. The Qazali network, part of the Special Groups, intensified attacks on Iraqi and Coalition forces, including kidnapping and killing five US soldiers. The Qods Force provided support to various militant groups, including Shiite militias in Iraq, supplying weapons and funding for attacks using improvised explosive devices and explosively formed projectiles. Iran's Qods Force has been supplying weapons and training to Taliban militants in Afghanistan since at least 2006, including small arms, explosives, and rockets. This support has resulted in the deaths of over 150 US service personnel. Sanctions will be imposed on affiliates of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps.
