Congress makes findings related to the discriminatory treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, including their discharge from military service, segregation, and forced relocation to assembly centers. During World War II, Japanese-Americans faced discriminatory treatment, including discharge from military service, segregation, and forced relocation to assembly centers. The Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion, made up of Americans of Japanese ancestry, was shipped to Oakland, CA, where the 100th Infantry Battalion was activated in June 1942. The battalion trained at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, and later the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was formed in February 1943 with Nisei volunteers. The 100th Infantry Battalion was transferred to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, for further training but was refused deployment by General Eisenhower. The 100th Infantry Battalion, composed of Japanese-Americans, trained at Camp Shelby in May 1943 and deployed to combat in Italy on September 26, 1943. Their bravery led to 6 Distinguished Service Cross awards in the first 8 weeks of combat. They fought at Cassino and Anzio, while the 442nd Regimental Combat Team joined them in Civitavecchia, Italy in June 1944. The 100th Infantry Battalion became part of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and fought in Italy, southern France, and Germany for 11 months. They were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions in battle. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team became the most decorated unit in US military history, receiving numerous awards including 7 Presidential Unit Citations, 21 Medals of Honor, and over 4,000 Purple Hearts. The United States is grateful for the bravery and sacrifice of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, who faced discrimination at home and fought fascism abroad with uncommon patriotism and honor. The United States honors the bravery and sacrifice of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team with a Congressional Gold Medal. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for a single gold medal to be awarded to the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team for their service in World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, and it will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution after the award ceremony. The gold medal awarded to the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other locations associated with the units. The Secretary is authorized to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal awarded under section 2. Medals struck under this Act are considered national medals. An amount not exceeding $30,000 is authorized to be charged for the cost of the medal, with proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 14, 2009."
