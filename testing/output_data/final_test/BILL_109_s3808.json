    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act\" and includes a comprehensive program for suicide prevention among veterans. The \"Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act\" mandates the development of a program by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reduce veteran suicide rates. This program includes a national mental health campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health and promoting awareness of effective treatments. Activities target veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as well as their families. Monthly messages on the VA website emphasize the importance of mental health for overall well-being. The program mandated by the \"Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act\" includes mandatory training on suicide prevention for Department of Veterans Affairs employees and contractors. Training covers recognizing risk factors and crisis response protocols. The program includes protocols for responding to crisis situations involving veterans at high risk for suicide, best practices for suicide prevention, family education on readjustment issues and mental health problems, and a peer support program for veterans to serve as counselors for others with mental health issues. The program supported by subparagraph (A) offers peer support counseling as a supplemental service in addition to other mental health services provided by the Department. It encourages veterans to undergo mental health assessments and provides referrals to counseling and treatment programs for those showing signs of mental health problems. The program supports suicide prevention counselors at VA medical facilities to engage in outreach to veterans and improve mental health care coordination. It also ensures access to quality mental health care for veterans in rural areas. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs collaborates with various agencies for quality mental health care for veterans, including research on best practices for suicide prevention. The program includes a steering committee for research on mental health care for veterans who experience sexual trauma while in service, with representatives from the National Institute of Mental Health, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also ensures 24-hour mental health care services availability. The program for mental health care for veterans ensures 24-hour availability of services, including a toll-free hotline for information and referrals. Other elements may include activities to reduce suicide rates among veterans. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a report to Congress within 90 days of this Act's enactment on programs to reduce veteran suicide. The report will detail program implementation status, costs, future plans, and recommendations for legislative or administrative action. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must consult with key organizations to develop a plan to enhance suicide prevention programs. Sense of Congress: Suicide among veterans with PTSD is a serious issue, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should consider their special needs in developing a comprehensive program."
