    "content": "The \"Energy-Efficient Cool Roof Jobs Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a provision for the depreciation recovery period for certain roof systems. The \"Energy-Efficient Cool Roof Jobs Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a 20-year recovery period for certain property, specifically initial clearing and grading land improvements for electric utility transmission and distribution plants, and qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property. Qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property refers to a roof system with specific criteria placed in service on eligible commercial buildings between the enactment date and December 31, 2013. Qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property must have insulation meeting or exceeding ASHRAE Standard 189.1-2009 requirements and a cool roof surface for eligible commercial buildings in specific climate zones. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for a surface to be considered a 'cool roof', including specific requirements for solar reflectance and thermal emittance. This is in line with the context of the prev_chunk, which mentions the need for energy-efficient cool roof replacement property with insulation meeting certain standards. The curr_chunk defines aged solar reflectance and thermal emittance for cool roofs, and explains the term 'roof system' and 'eligible commercial building'. The curr_chunk introduces requirements for qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property, including location in the US, allowable depreciation, and placement in service before December 31, 2009. Additionally, it defines ASHRAE as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Amendment to 168(g)(3)(B) of the Code includes new items being inserted. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
