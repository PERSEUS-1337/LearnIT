The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to renumber paragraphs, adjust dates, and ensure compliance by States and Indian tribes for grants. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to ensure strict compliance by States and Indian tribes with set priorities until certification is made. Amendments include renumbering paragraphs, adjusting dates, and authorizing expenditures for reclamation or drainage abatement of lands affected by coal mining processes. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to prioritize reclamation of coal mining sites left in inadequate status before State program approval. Priority is given based on set criteria to ensure proper reclamation or abatement of affected lands. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 prioritizes reclamation of coal mining sites near residential areas or with adverse economic impact. States with approved programs can retain up to 10% of grants for reclamation efforts. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 allows states to retain up to 10% of grants for reclamation efforts, including the establishment of an acid mine drainage abatement and treatment fund. This fund is used for comprehensive abatement and treatment of acid mine drainage in hydrologic units affected by coal mining practices. Qualified hydrologic units are those significantly impacted by acid mine drainage and contain eligible lands and waters. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 allows states to use grants for reclamation efforts, including acid mine drainage abatement. States can retain up to 10% of grants for this purpose. Qualified hydrologic units impacted by acid mine drainage are eligible for funding. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 allows states to use grants for reclamation efforts on eligible lands and waters. Funding can also be used in conjunction with addressing priorities set forth in the Act or for remining operations. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to adjust the allocation of funds for reclamation efforts on eligible lands and waters. This includes striking certain paragraphs and revising the use of funds for health and safety purposes. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended by striking paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), adjusting fund allocations for reclamation efforts, and authorizing appropriations for water supply restoration. Section 408(a) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended by removing ownership criteria prior to May 2, 1977. Section 409 is amended to streamline state and tribal requests and clarify fund allocation references.

No expenditures allowed in certified States or tribes until eligible lands and waters are reclaimed.\" The Governor of a State or head of an Indian tribe may seek certification for completion of high priority coal reclamation projects. The Secretary must concur with the certification after public notice and comment. The Secretary may also initiate certification independently. The Secretary may independently initiate certification for completion of high priority coal reclamation projects in a State or tribe after public notice and comment. Residents of the State or tribe can also petition the Secretary for certification by providing evidence of completed reclamation projects. After completion of high priority coal reclamation projects, the Secretary may certify lands and waters under section 404. Upon receiving a petition, the Secretary will publish a notice and make a certification if deemed necessary. Eligible lands and waters for annual grants under section 402(g)(1) will be those eligible under section 404 but not under section 403(a) priorities. Upon completion of these projects, additional lands and waters may become eligible. Expenditures for eligible lands and waters affected by mining or processing before August 3, 1977, with no ongoing reclamation responsibility, must prioritize restoration objectives as outlined in subsection (b)(1). The restoration of land and water resources previously degraded by adverse effects of coal mining practices and mineral mining and processing practices is prioritized for public health, safety, and property protection. Specific sites designated for remedial action under Uranium Mill Tailings are not eligible for these restoration efforts. Designated sites for remedial action under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act or the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act are not eligible for funding from the Fund. Reclamation projects for water supply restoration and public facilities may be undertaken for lands affected by past mineral mining practices. The Governor of a State or head of an Indian tribe can certify a need for construction of public facilities related to coal or minerals industry, or for protection, repair, and enhancement of public facilities affected by mining practices. Annual grants under section 402(g)(1) can be used for these activities. All provisions of this title apply, with adjustments for references to 'coal'. Section 413 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to update references to 'coal' to 'minerals'.
