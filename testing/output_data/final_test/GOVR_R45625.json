    "content": "The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment in 2018 emphasized the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. There are differing views among federal policymakers and stakeholders on how to address climate change, with some seeing it as an existential threat requiring significant emission reductions. Proponents of climate change mitigation cite authoritative reports like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program to emphasize the dire effects of climate change. Some question the need for federal programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that a unilateral approach by the United States could harm domestic industries with minimal global impact. One proposed solution is to implement a tax or fee on greenhouse gas emissions. This report focuses on the policy considerations and potential impacts of using a carbon tax or GHG emissions fee to control GHG emissions, particularly CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. A carbon tax could apply directly to emissions or to materials based on their carbon contents. A carbon price on emissions or fossil fuels could drive innovation in cleaner technologies like renewable energy and nuclear power, as well as encourage efficiency improvements. This approach has been debated in Congress, with various carbon tax proposals introduced. The Climate Leadership Council also proposed a carbon tax approach in 2017, sparking interest among policymakers and industry leaders. In 2017, a conceptual carbon tax approach generated interest among industry leaders. Some Members expressed opposition to a carbon tax, with resolutions introduced in Congress. The House passed a resolution stating a carbon tax would harm the US economy. The report examines carbon tax design issues and revenue distribution. The second section discusses carbon tax revenue distribution, additional considerations, and concluding observations. Key design decisions for Congress include the point, rate, and scope of taxation, as well as addressing imported carbon-intensive materials. Alternatively, federal agencies could determine these features through a rulemaking procedure. The EPA proposals in the 111th Congress included design details for a carbon tax system, determining taxation points and entities responsible for payments, monitoring, and record-keeping. Policymakers must consider which GHG emissions and sources to cover, with potential administrative challenges for a broader scope. A carbon tax could target CO2 emissions, the majority of U.S. GHG emissions. A carbon tax may apply to CO2 emissions alone or multiple GHGs, with a price attached to a metric ton of CO2 emissions. Some sources emit non-CO2 GHGs, which could be addressed by pricing emissions-equivalent to CO2. Policymakers may limit the tax to sectors emitting above a certain percentage of total U.S. GHG emissions. Monitoring devices in large facilities report emissions data to the government. The EPA collects emissions data from large facilities, and policymakers could implement a carbon tax at the point of emission release. This tax could be applied to emission inputs like fossil fuels, allowing for taxation at different stages of the process. The EPA collects emissions data from large facilities to potentially implement a carbon tax at different stages of the process, such as refineries. Table A-1 lists top GHG emission sources in the US, accounting for 95% of emissions in 2016. Fossil fuel combustion contributed 76% of total emissions, offering options for segmenting sources for policymakers. Policymakers have options for segmenting sources for a carbon tax, including fossil fuel combustion emissions from entities like petroleum refineries, coal mines, and natural gas suppliers. Administrative frameworks for federal excise taxes could be utilized for some points of taxation. A carbon tax rate is a central policy choice when pricing GHG emissions, with various approaches available. One approach involves setting the tax rate based on modeling estimates to achieve specific emission reduction targets, such as those outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Studies have estimated that a constant tax rate of $43/ton starting in 2019 could meet the U.S. GHG emission reduction targets for 2025. Emission reduction estimates from carbon tax programs rely on various assumptions. Emission reduction estimates from carbon tax programs are based on assumptions and provide different tax rates needed to meet specific targets. Policymakers could use social cost of carbon measurements to set the rate of a carbon tax or emissions fee. One challenge of using social cost of carbon estimates to set a carbon fee is the wide range of existing estimates in peer-reviewed research and concerns about the simulation models used. Estimating the impacts of climate change, such as temperature increase and precipitation patterns, is complex and uncertain. Valuing the social cost of carbon involves varying methods and assumptions, making it difficult to establish study parameters and estimate the monetary values of climate change impacts. Estimating the social cost of carbon involves challenges such as valuing impacts of climate change, including global vs. domestic impacts, and the element of time. Economists use discount rates to calculate present values, but there is disagreement on the appropriate rates for a multi-generational issue like climate change, which can significantly affect the values. High discount rates can devalue future climate change impacts significantly. Federal agencies have used SC-CO2 estimates to assess the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions in rulemakings since 2008. Despite the withdrawal of federal SC-CO2 estimates by President Trump in 2017, interim values from the EPA have been utilized in regulatory decisions. Legislation could set a carbon price using SC-CO2 values from technical support documents or other sources. Using these estimates for the tax rate would involve a cost-benefit framework, but some economists argue against this approach for climate change policy due to the potential for nonmarginal changes and tipping points in ecosystems. Climate change impacts are expected to be multi-generational, leading to uncertainty in assigning present value to social costs. Some impacts from climate change may be irreversible on the timescale of human civilizations, such as melting of major ice sheets in Antarctica or Greenland. Policymakers might consider a phased-in carbon tax approach to help reduce the federal deficit, reduce other taxes, or pay for specific programs. This approach allows consumers and investors to adjust their behavior before higher tax rates go into effect, but it could also delay climate-related benefits. Phasing in a carbon tax could delay climate-related benefits as Congress considers implementing carbon pricing. Stakeholders are concerned about how a U.S. carbon price system would interact with other nations' policies, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for domestic businesses. Certain emission-intensive, trade-exposed industries in the U.S. may face challenges under a carbon tax, leading to reduced profitability, market share loss, and job cuts. These industries, with high CO2 emissions from manufacturing processes, could struggle to pass on the tax through higher prices due to international competition. One approach to mitigate economic impacts of a carbon tax on emission-intensive industries is through a border adjustment mechanism, like a border carbon adjustment (BCA). This would involve applying a tariff to imported emission-intensive goods to prevent job losses and market share decline. BCAs could also incentivize other nations to adopt similar carbon pricing policies. Establishing an economically efficient Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) presents challenges such as determining covered goods/industries, assessing comparability of other nations' climate policies, and verifying GHG emissions in imported products. Simplified approaches may lead to less accurate import price adjustments, impacting GHG emission reductions. The potential challenges of implementing a Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) include concerns about the accuracy of import price adjustments affecting GHG emission reductions achieved by the carbon tax program. One option is to allow companies to provide independently verified emissions data as an alternative. However, there are also worries about violating international trade rules and unintended consequences, such as lower net exports due to the adjustment's impact on currency. These issues may be mitigated if more nations establish comparable emission reduction policies as outlined in the Paris Agreement. A Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) can help address emissions leakage concerns by reducing the incentive to shift economic activity to nations without a comparable carbon tax. However, recent studies question the extent of emissions leakage under a unilateral U.S. carbon tax. The carbon tax impacts may be felt in various parts of the economy, and policymakers have options to address these impacts. They must decide how to distribute the tax revenues, which could support deficit reduction, be used as general fund revenue, or be recycled back into the economy. Carbon tax revenues can be used to support various policy goals, including reducing economy-wide costs, alleviating costs for low-income households, and supporting specific objectives like domestic employment, climate change adaptation, and energy efficiency. Policymakers face trade-offs when deciding how to allocate the revenue. Economic studies on carbon tax revenue recycling options show a trade-off between mitigating economy-wide impacts and distributional impacts. Various revenue application options have been discussed, with many studies conducted before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a central policy option in carbon tax economic literature. Concerns about economy-wide costs from a carbon tax include increased energy prices and prices of goods and services using fossil fuels. This outcome is inherent to the carbon tax's purpose of increasing the relative price of carbon-intensive materials. The carbon tax aims to increase the price of carbon-intensive energy sources, promote innovation in less carbon-intensive technologies, and encourage activities like energy efficiency to reduce emissions. The economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax depend on factors such as the tax's magnitude, scope, and use of revenues. The debate among policymakers and stakeholders revolves around the macroeconomic costs, measured in terms of changes in GDP or economic welfare. Comparisons of impacts are not included in the analysis of economy-wide effects. The economy-wide impacts of a carbon tax depend on factors like the tax's magnitude, scope, and revenue use. Policymakers can reduce the economic cost by using tax revenue to cut existing taxes or address the national debt. Few studies have examined deficit reduction scenarios due to the complexity of modeling budget deficits. Some studies suggest using tax revenues from a carbon tax to reduce the need for future distortionary taxes, benefiting the economy in the long term. Legislative proposals often involve distributing carbon tax revenue back to households through lump-sum payments to address distribution impacts. Payments can be equal for all or targeted to different population segments. Economic studies suggest using carbon tax revenues to offset existing distortionary taxes, known as a \"tax swap,\" which can lead to a \"double-dividend\" effect by reducing GHG emissions and market distortions. Different models show that certain revenue recycling options can lessen the impact of a carbon tax on the economy but may not eliminate it entirely. Some economic studies show that using carbon tax revenues to offset existing taxes can lead to a net increase in GDP compared to baseline conditions. Certain revenue recycling options can mitigate the economic impacts of a carbon tax program. The studies suggest that using carbon tax revenue to lower existing tax rates can help mitigate economy-wide impacts more effectively than providing a lump-sum distribution to individuals or households. Various factors influence the estimated GDP impacts of a carbon tax, such as the scope of the tax, assumptions in the analytical model, and measurement terms. A 2018 analysis illustrated the GDP results of a $50/mtCO2e carbon tax starting in 2020, showing the impacts under the changes made by the TCJA. A $50/mtCO2e carbon tax starting in 2020, increasing by 2% annually, would apply to CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and methane emissions from fossil fuel production. The projected GDP impacts under different revenue applications include a payroll tax rate reduction, lump-sum distribution to households, and deficit reduction. The payroll tax scenario shows a 0.1% GDP loss in 2020 but gains in subsequent years. The lump-sum distribution approach results in GDP losses each year, while the deficit reduction approach yields a range of GDP losses. The deficit reduction approach for a carbon tax would result in a range of GDP losses in the first 10 years, but a GDP gain in 2039 compared to baseline. Opponents highlight the GDP losses from a carbon tax, with differing perspectives on the significance of the impacts. GDP impact estimates can be presented in various ways, such as comparing GDP values between scenarios or using a cumulative measure of annual losses over a period. The GDP impact estimates for a carbon tax scenario compared to the baseline scenario would be much larger, requiring assumptions about annual GDP growth rates. Some argue that the estimates should consider environmental and public health benefits, as well as the costs of taking no action. Economic analyses show that a carbon tax could disproportionately burden low-income households. The burden on low-income households from a carbon tax varies based on how costs are passed on. If costs are passed on to consumers, lower-income households would be disproportionately impacted due to higher prices for energy needs. Economic analyses often assume that most of the tax impact is passed on to consumers, leading to a regressive outcome. Alternatively, if costs are passed back to producers, the tax impacts would affect labor or capital returns. Economic models suggest that the distributional effects of a carbon tax program on households depend on how the tax revenues are used. Various studies have analyzed the impacts of a carbon tax on household income under different scenarios, showing differing results due to varying factors such as tax rates, modeling frameworks, and revenue distribution methods. For instance, a 2018 study examined the effects of a $50/mtCO2e carbon tax on household income across different income quintiles. This study analyzed the impacts of a $50/mtCO2e carbon tax on household income across different quintiles. Four revenue distribution scenarios were examined, including reducing the federal deficit, corporate income tax rate, payroll tax rate, and providing a per-capita rebate to households. The per-capita rebate approach was found to be the most progressive, benefiting the bottom three quintiles but resulting in a net loss for the top quintile. Other approaches showed varying degrees of regressive outcomes. The payroll tax rate reduction approach shows the smallest variance between income quintiles, with a 0.5% loss for the lowest quintile and a 0.2% gain for the fourth quintile. The rankings for progressivity and mitigating economy-wide impacts differ, highlighting a tradeoff policymakers face in allocating carbon tax revenues. Policymakers could allocate revenues to support both objectives, as shown in a 2018 carbon tax study. The study assessed using a portion of carbon tax revenue to offset welfare impacts for the lowest-income households and reduce capital tax rates. Approximately 10% of the revenue could counteract impacts on the lowest-income quintile, allowing 90% to address economy-wide impacts. Recent legislative proposals include mechanisms like Border Carbon Adjustments to address competitiveness concerns for industries affected by the carbon tax. One approach to addressing competitiveness concerns for industries affected by the carbon tax is to distribute a portion of the tax revenues as rebates based on output. This output-based pricing system, scheduled to take effect in Canada in 2019, aims to reduce emissions intensity. However, implementing such a program may require significant data and administrative resources. Additionally, the carbon tax is expected to disproportionately impact fossil fuel industries and communities reliant on them for employment. Coal-mining communities are expected to be heavily impacted by carbon tax analyses, with a potential 80% decline in U.S. coal production by 2030 under a $50/mtCO2e carbon tax. Policymakers may need to provide worker and community transition assistance to mitigate economic impacts, with some proposals suggesting using carbon tax revenues for this purpose. Additionally, carbon tax revenues could be used to support various objectives beyond climate change, such as technology development and deployment efforts. State GHG mitigation programs that raise revenues focus on technology development, energy efficiency, and biological sequestration. Efforts include reducing costs of emission mitigation technologies, promoting energy efficiency, and supporting carbon sequestration through trees, plants, and soils. Revenues could be used to incentivize households and small businesses to increase efficiency and promote carbon sequestration. Revenues from a carbon tax could be used for promoting carbon sequestration efforts, climate change adaptation, deficit reduction, and infrastructure funding. The 2018 Stanford Energy Modeling Forum study (\"EMF 32\") gathered 11 modeling teams to analyze the economic impacts of four carbon tax scenarios starting in 2020, including a $25/metric ton and $50/metric ton carbon tax increasing annually by 1%. Comparing results from different economic studies on emission reductions from carbon tax designs is challenging due to varying scenarios and assumptions. The 2018 Stanford Energy Modeling Forum study analyzed the economic impacts of carbon tax scenarios starting in 2020, with tax rates increasing annually. Different revenue distribution scenarios were considered, and the study concluded that each tax rate scenario could likely achieve U.S. CO2 emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement. The uncertainty in resulting emissions levels was highlighted. The uncertainty of emissions from a carbon tax may deter some stakeholders. Congress could use GHG emission data to monitor and adjust the carbon price if needed. However, adjusting the price based on actual emissions could undermine price certainty and face political challenges. Some suggest creating an independent agency to adjust the tax rate for emission reduction goals. While this may improve emission certainty, it could sacrifice long-term price stability. Annual emission fluctuations under a carbon tax may not hinder climate change control as long as long-term goals are met. Price control is favored over emissions cap programs to avoid price volatility. The transportation sector contributes 36% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, with electric power at 35%. Carbon tax programs are projected to have a greater impact on emissions in the electricity sector compared to the transportation sector due to fewer opportunities to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels in the transportation sector. Some may argue that to achieve long-term reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions, policymakers should complement a carbon tax with other programs like vehicle technology standards or fuel performance standards. The revenue generated from a carbon tax system depends on its design features and how covered emission sources respond to the carbon price. From a public finance perspective, a carbon tax may not be a reliable source of long-term funding as its primary goal is to reduce GHG emissions. Studies project carbon tax revenue values in 2020 and beyond, with estimates ranging from $250 billion to $475 billion in annual revenue by 2040 under certain scenarios. The CO2 emission intensity of different fossil fuels varies, with coal emitting 30% more than oil and 80% more than natural gas. This leads to different tax rates per unit of energy in a carbon tax regime. The impact of carbon taxes on fuel prices can be complex, depending on factors like where the tax is applied in the production process and how price impacts are passed on to consumers. A carbon tax can impact energy prices, with coal being the most affected due to its high CO2 emissions. Other fuels like gasoline may see an 8% price increase. Market participants can adjust by switching fuels or technologies, while consumers can conserve energy to mitigate cost impacts. The 2018 EMF 32 study assessed the impact of carbon tax scenarios on energy consumption. Coal consumption could decline significantly, natural gas consumption estimates vary, oil consumption could decline by 4% by 2030, and wind energy consumption could increase by 48% to 300% under a $50/mtCO2 carbon tax. Wind energy consumption could increase by 48% to 300% by 2030 under a $50/mtCO2 carbon tax scenario, which is one policy option to address U.S. GHG emission levels. Economic modeling indicates that a carbon tax would achieve emission reductions and generate a new revenue stream, with estimates of approximately $100 billion in the first year. The potential economy-wide costs of a carbon tax would depend on various factors, with total federal revenue projected to be $3.5 trillion in FY2019. Policymakers would need to make challenging decisions on how to distribute the tax revenues to support different policy objectives, while also considering trade-offs among objectives such as minimizing costs, supporting low-income households, and achieving specific policy goals. Some economic analyses suggest that the distribution of tax revenue could have greater economic impacts than the direct effects of the tax, especially in the early years of implementation. The potential costs of a carbon tax depend on factors like magnitude, design, and revenue use. Economic literature suggests that some revenue applications could reduce economy-wide costs but not eliminate them entirely. Policymakers and stakeholders may differ on whether these costs are significant, with some arguing they should be compared to not having a carbon tax. Some studies show scenarios where a carbon tax and revenue recycling could increase GDP or economic welfare. A carbon tax and revenue recycling could potentially increase GDP or economic welfare. However, lower-income households may be disproportionately impacted if revenues are not recycled back to them. Using carbon tax revenues to offset reductions in existing taxes could benefit the economy overall, but may limit support for other objectives. A carbon tax may disproportionately impact emission-intensive industries and fossil fuel sectors, potentially affecting communities reliant on these industries. Policymakers could address these concerns by implementing a border carbon adjustment program or allocating tax revenues to support affected employees or communities. If other nations adopt similar carbon pricing policies, the impact may be mitigated to some extent. The curr_chunk discusses GHG emissions in the U.S., specifically focusing on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. It highlights potential points in the economy for applying a carbon tax and the number of entities involved. The table also includes comments on emission sources, discussing opportunities for additional coverage or limitations. The comments address limitations in covering emissions from a specific source."
