    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Affordable Food and Fuel for America Act\". Congress acknowledges the impact of the Volumetric Excise Tax Credit and the temporary tariff on imported ethanol in promoting domestic corn ethanol production, which has significantly increased since 2000. The production is expected to surpass 12 billion gallons, leading to concerns about the diversion of corn from food and feed to fuel. Federal mandates require blending 15 billion gallons of ethanol into gasoline supplies by 2015. The United States is the world's largest producer of ethanol, with the domestic corn ethanol industry no longer needing tax subsidies or tariffs. Federal resources should focus on developing new renewable energy sources like biomass fuels to meet environmental goals. The income tax credit for alcohol used as fuel is reduced according to the table in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The reduction in credits starts from 28 cents in 2009 and gradually decreases to 0 cents in 2014. The reduction of excise tax credit for alcohol fuel mixtures is amended to extend the credit until 2013 and 2014, and a delayed reduction clause is repealed. These amendments apply to alcohol produced and used in taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The excise tax credit for alcohol fuel mixtures is amended to reduce the credit gradually from 28 cents in 2009 to zero cents in 2014 and beyond. This applies to alcohol produced and used in taxable years after the Act's enactment. The amendments made by this section will apply to fuel sold or used after the enactment of the Act, including changes to tax credits for alcohol fuel mixtures. Reduction and elimination of tariffs on ethanol will apply to fuel sold or used after the enactment of the Act, including changes to tax credits for alcohol fuel mixtures. Reduction of temporary tariff duty on imported ethanol from 14.27 cents to 8 cents for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010, with retroactive application upon proper request filed within 90 days of enactment. The Act reduces the temporary tariff duty on imported ethanol from 14.27 cents to 8 cents for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010. Any entry made during this period can be liquidated or reliquidated with the lower duty rate if requested within 90 days of enactment. Additionally, for calendar year 2010, the duty rate is further reduced to 6 cents. For calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012, the tariff duty on imported ethanol is reduced to 6 cents, 4 cents, and 3 cents respectively. The amendments apply to goods entered or withdrawn for consumption within specific timeframes. The tariff duty on imported ethanol is reduced to 3 cents for goods entered or withdrawn for consumption in 2012, and to 2 cents for goods in 2013. Starting in 2014, duty-free treatment for alternative fuels is added to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule will include duty-free treatment for alternative fuels starting in 2014. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule will provide duty-free treatment for alternative fuels, including ethyl alcohol at a rate of 20%. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule provides duty-free treatment for ethyl alcohol or mixtures containing ethyl alcohol used as fuel or in producing gasoline-alcohol mixtures or special fuels. Step 1 - The curr_chunk is: \"suitable for any such uses\"\n\nStep 2 - The prev_chunk is: \"The Harmonized Tariff Schedule provides duty-free treatment for ethyl alcohol or mixtures containing ethyl alcohol used as fuel or in producing gasoline-alcohol mixtures or special fuels.\"\n\nStep 4 - Summarized text chunk: \"suitable for various uses\" The Harmonized Tariff Schedule is amended to remove certain headings and notes, effective January 1, 2014. Congress finds that hunger and poverty are significant issues in America, with 1 in 8 Americans experiencing hunger, 37.3 million people living in poverty, and 35.5 million Americans facing food insecurity. The recession is causing an increase in deep poverty among Americans, with a weakened safety net for very poor families. World Hunger Year has seen a rise in calls for food assistance. The production of cellulosic and advanced biofuels in the US will reduce dependence on foreign oil. The production of cellulosic and advanced biofuels in the US will reduce dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Congress suggests using the savings from this initiative to combat hunger and support domestic biofuel development through various means such as increasing assistance for nutrition programs and providing grants for biofuel processing facilities. Construct cellulosic and advanced biofuel processing facilities in the United States to reduce dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions."
