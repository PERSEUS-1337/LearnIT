    "content": "A fugitive felon is someone fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody for a felony. Social Security Act prohibits them from receiving benefits, including SSI, SSDI, and OASI. Benefits paid to fugitive felons are considered overpayments and must be repaid. Benefits can be restored if the person is cleared of charges. The Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 and the Social Security Protection Act of 2004 extended the prohibition of benefit payments to fugitive felons to SSDI and OASI programs. Since 1996, nearly 78,000 fugitive felons have had their benefits suspended, saving over $83 million. The statutory definition of a fugitive felon can be found in Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. The definition of a fugitive felon for benefit programs can be found in Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. It states that individuals cannot receive benefits while fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody for a felony. Regulations provide more detailed information on how an individual becomes a fugitive felon for the purpose of denying benefits. The regulations define a fugitive felon as someone ineligible for SSI benefits when a warrant is issued for their arrest, indicating they are fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody. The SSA's Program Operations Manual System (POMS) provides internal guidance to employees regarding the definition of a fugitive felon. Unlike the statutory definition, POMS considers a person a fugitive solely based on an outstanding warrant, without considering if they are actually fleeing. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 allows the SSA commissioner to pay benefits to fugitive felons under certain circumstances, but only if the felony offense is nonviolent and not drug-related. Mitigating circumstances can be considered in these cases. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 prohibits SSI benefits for fugitive felons with active warrants for violent crimes or drug-related felonies. This prohibition was extended to SSDI and OASI benefits in 2005. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 extended the prohibition of SSI benefits for fugitive felons to SSDI and OASI benefits effective January 1, 2005. The aim was to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in these programs by ensuring that benefits were not aiding fugitive felons in evading prosecution. The Senate Committee on Finance emphasized that the fugitive felon provision should only apply if a law enforcement agency is actively pursuing the individual to prevent the SSA from becoming the \"law enforcement agency of last resort.\" The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the SSA's policy of denying SSI benefits to individuals with outstanding felony warrants. This decision will impact how the fugitive felon provisions of the Social Security Act are enforced in three states. One individual, Fowlkes, had his benefits affected when the SSA discovered two outstanding Virginia arrest warrants. The SSA suspended Fowlkes' benefits due to two outstanding Virginia arrest warrants, one for petty larceny and the other for a voter registration offense. Fowlkes argued that he was not a fugitive felon ineligible for SSI benefits because he lacked the intention to flee and was financially unable to return to the charging state. The circuit court ruled that the SSA's interpretation of the statute regarding fleeing felons was in conflict with the plain language of the statute. The court stated that there must be evidence of conscious evasion of arrest or prosecution for benefits to be suspended, not just the existence of an outstanding warrant. The court found that the SSA's regulation on \"flight\" must involve a specific intent to avoid prosecution for benefits to be suspended. The regulation requires a warrant or order issued by a court based on a finding of flight, stricter than the statute. The POMS passages cited by the Commissioner were in direct conflict with this regulation. The court held that benefits may only be suspended with a warrant or court order based on a finding of flight from justice. The SSA issued an acquiescence ruling on applying this ruling to suspend benefits for fugitive felons. The SSA issued an acquiescence ruling on applying the Fowlkes case to all administrative determinations involving Title II and Title XVI applicants, beneficiaries, and recipients in the Second Circuit states. This ruling can be applied retroactively to December 6, 2005, if it would have changed the case outcome. The SSA will no longer rely solely on an outstanding warrant to determine fugitive status. The SSA will no longer suspend benefits based solely on the existence of a warrant to determine fugitive status. Instead, evidence is required that the individual knows about an outstanding felony arrest warrant issued for fleeing from justice."
