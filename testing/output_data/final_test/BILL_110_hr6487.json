The \"Diesel Tax Parity Act of 2008\" temporarily reduces taxes on diesel fuel, with the tax rate set at 18.3 cents per gallon during the applicable period. The amendment made by this subsection shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. The Diesel Tax Parity Act of 2008 temporarily reduces taxes on diesel fuel. If tax has been imposed on liquid held by a dealer and intended for sale, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer against their subsequent tax deposit. No credit or refund will be allowed unless a claim is filed. Unless a claim is filed within 6 months after the tax reduction date, and if liquid is held by a dealer, the taxpayer must provide certifications to the Secretary for a credit against the dealer's future purchase. The taxpayer must provide certifications to the Secretary for a credit against the dealer's future purchase, based on past business relationships with succeeding dealers. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided. The floor stocks tax is imposed on liquid held by a dealer after a certain date, following rules similar to section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code. The floor stocks tax is imposed on liquid held by a dealer after a certain date, with liability for the tax and method of payment outlined. The tax must be paid within 6 months of the floor stocks tax date. For purposes of this subsection, a liquid is considered \"held by a person\" if title has passed to them. \"Diesel fuel\" is defined as per section 4083 of the Code. The \"floor stocks tax date\" is January 1, 2009, and the \"applicable period\" is described in section 4081(f)(2) of the Code. The tax imposed does not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for exempt uses. No tax imposed on diesel fuel held in vehicle tank or up to 2,000 gallons by a person if required information is submitted to the Secretary. For purposes of this paragraph, fuel exempt from tax is not considered if held by a person exempt under specific conditions. Controlled groups are treated as one person as defined by the tax code. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those in section 1563 of the tax code apply to a group of nonincorporated persons under common control. All provisions of law, including penalties, apply to taxes imposed. Penalties applicable to taxes under section 4081 of the Code also apply to floor stock taxes as if imposed by section 4081. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or delegate."
