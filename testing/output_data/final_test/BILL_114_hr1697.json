The Electric Charging And Refueling Act allows a 50% tax credit for qualified electric vehicle recharging or refueling property placed in service during the taxable year. The credit is limited to $100,000 or $10,000 multiplied by the number of devices placed in service, with a maximum of $2,000 in other cases. Definitions are provided for clarity. The Electric Charging And Refueling Act offers a 50% tax credit for qualified electric vehicle recharging or refueling property, with a maximum credit of $100,000 or $10,000 per device, not exceeding $2,000 in other cases. Definitions are provided for clarity. The Electric Charging And Refueling Act provides a 50% tax credit for property that recharges electric vehicles or refuels hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles. The credit applies to devices that recharge one vehicle at a time and can be part of a larger property. This credit is part of the general business credit and has specific definitions for clarity. The tax credit for property related to electric vehicle charging or fuel cell refueling is treated as a credit under section 38(b) for the taxable year. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under subpart A. The tax credit for electric vehicle charging property is subject to special rules, including a reduction in basis for the property. Qualified property sold to tax-exempt entities for recharging purposes is treated differently if not leased. The tax credit for electric vehicle charging property includes rules for disclosure of credit amount, disqualification for property used outside the US, election not to take credit, and recapture rules similar to section 179A(e)(4). The tax credit for electric vehicle charging property includes rules for joint ownership of qualified electric vehicle recharging property placed in service with respect to multiple dwelling units. This provision ensures that each dwelling unit's portion of the property is separately considered for tax credit eligibility. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2013, with a specific provision for hydrogen refueling property placed in service after December 31, 2014."
