    "content": "The \"Small Tracts Conveyance Act\" allows for special conveyance authority regarding small parcels of national forest system land and public lands. The \"Small Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines key terms such as adjacent landholder, Director concerned, and eligible Federal lands parcel, which includes National Forest System land or public lands that share boundaries with non-Federal land. The \"Small Tracts Conveyance Act\" outlines criteria for eligible Federal lands parcels, excluding those with existing non-Federal rights, exceptional resources, or habitat for endangered species. An exceptional resource is defined as having scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational value on public lands. The \"Small Tracts Conveyance Act\" defines exceptional resources as having scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational value on public lands, requiring extraordinary conservation and protection for the benefit of the public. The term \"Indian tribe\" and \"National Forest System land\" are also defined within the Act. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain areas managed by the Forest Service, such as national monuments, wilderness areas, and lands held in trust for Indian tribes. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in national monuments, conservation areas, recreation areas, and wilderness areas. The term \"public lands\" excludes certain Bureau of Land Management-managed lands in national monuments, conservation areas, recreation areas, and wilderness areas. Regional Forester concerned means the Regional Forester with jurisdiction over the National Forest System land of a specific Forest Service Region. The Director or Regional Forester shall select eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance in response to a request from an adjacent landholder or upon the recommendation of the Bureau of Land Management District Office. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior must create a process for adjacent landholders to request to purchase eligible Federal lands parcels. The process should be consistent with other public purchase request processes and be accessible to the public online. The process for adjacent landholders to request purchasing eligible Federal lands parcels must be available to the public online within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Director or Regional Forester will review the parcel within 30 days of receiving the request to determine if it meets the criteria for conveyance. If the parcel is not eligible, the request may be rejected. If a parcel of National Forest System land or public lands covered by an adjacent landholder request fails to meet the criteria for conveyance, the Director or Regional Forester will provide a written explanation to the landowner detailing the reasons for rejection, including how the parcel fails to satisfy the definition of eligible Federal lands parcel and the potential impact of continued administration by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service on the parcel and surrounding economy. The Federal Government needs to maintain ownership of the parcel and would be the best land ownership steward. An eligible Federal lands parcel conveyed under this section may not exceed 160 acres unless approved for additional acreage. An adjacent landholder may acquire one parcel per year, with the possibility of acquiring additional parcels if they are less than 160 acres in size. The Director or Regional Forester must provide public notice of available eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance. Adjacent landholders can acquire additional parcels, not exceeding 160 acres, with approval for more acreage. The Director or Regional Forester must provide public notice of available eligible Federal lands parcels for conveyance. Single adjacent landholders can negotiate sales, while multiple adjacent landholders must use competitive bidding procedures for the sale of eligible public lands parcels. Rejection of offers is also addressed. The Director or Regional Forester may reject offers that do not meet minimum requirements. Purchasers must comply with local zoning laws. Eligible Federal lands parcels will be sold under specific conditions. The Director or Regional Forester shall convey US rights in a parcel for sale. An appeals process is available for rejected requests or offers, using an expedited Forest Service process. The expedited Forest Service appeals process for rejection of requests or offers is no longer available under Public Law 102-381. The administering official for the appeals process is now the Director or Regional Forester. Consideration for the sale of federal lands requires a cash payment equal to fair market value. The fair market value of an eligible Federal lands parcel is established by an appraisal submitted by the adjacent landholder seeking to purchase the parcel, unless rejected within 45 days. If rejected, another appraisal must be conducted within 30 days in accordance with regulations. The Act of 1976 establishes a special fund in the Treasury for the collection and distribution of funds from the conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels. Funds collected are distributed annually to States where the Federal Government owns more than 33% of the land area. Under this section, 50 percent of funds collected from a conveyance go to the State where it occurred, while the remaining 50 percent is divided equally among other States. States receiving funds must use them to purchase eligible Federal lands or comply with Federal requirements. To comply with Federal requirements such as the Endangered Species Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or National Environmental Policy Act, the purchaser must cover costs for conveyance including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. The purchaser must cover costs for conveyance, including survey, appraisal, environmental documentation, and administrative costs. If the amount collected exceeds the actual costs incurred, the excess must be refunded to the purchaser. Reimbursement received will be credited to the fund used for the conveyance costs. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels should take no more than 18 months and is categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements. This authority is in addition to existing sale authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The conveyance of eligible Federal lands parcels should take no more than 18 months and is categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements under Section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
