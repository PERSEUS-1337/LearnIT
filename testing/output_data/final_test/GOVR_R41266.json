    "content": "The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes liability for oil discharge into US waters, expands recovery of removal costs to any person, and sets limits on damages based on vessel or facility type. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), responsible parties are strictly liable for removal costs and damages in oil spill incidents, with liability limits based on vessel or facility type. Additional liability may be imposed under state law, and responsible parties can recover costs from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund if the responsible party fails to pay. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), responsible parties are liable for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills. Claims for removal costs must be presented to the responsible party first, and if not settled within 90 days, the claimant can take legal action or present the claim directly. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), responsible parties are liable for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills. Claims for removal costs must be presented to the responsible party first, and if not settled within 90 days, the claimant can take legal action or present the claim directly to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Certain claims for removal costs may be presented directly to the Fund in limited situations, such as when the President or Governor of an affected state notifies claimants in writing. Additionally, a \"United States claimant\" may present a claim for removal costs if a foreign offshore unit has caused damage for which the Fund is liable. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), responsible parties are liable for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills. Claims for removal costs must be presented to the responsible party first, and if not settled within 90 days, the claimant can take legal action or present the claim directly to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. When presenting a claim to the Fund, the claimant must prove that the actions taken were necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate the effects of the oil spill incident, and that the costs were incurred as a result of these actions. The compensation for removal cost claims against the Fund is based on the total of uncompensated reasonable removal costs of actions consistent with the National Contingency Plan or directed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), responsible parties are liable for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills. Removal activities must be coordinated by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator, and costs incurred without coordination may not be recoverable. Responsible parties are liable for damages resulting from oil spills, and claims must be presented to them first. If not settled within 90 days, claims can be presented to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Damages under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) must be presented to a responsible party first. If the party denies liability or the claim is not settled within 90 days, the claimant can take legal action or present the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Damages are capped per-incident and per-responsible party, with exceptions possible. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) holds a responsible party liable for damages without limits in a specific oil spill incident. Punitive damages are not typically recoverable under the act. Liability limits are determined per responsible party and per incident, based on the type of vessel or facility involved in the oil discharge. For example, the Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, falls under the category of a mobile offshore drilling unit. The Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, is classified as a mobile offshore drilling unit. It could be deemed an offshore facility if damages exceed liability limits for tank vessels under OPA. Liability for the responsible party may be limited to removal costs plus $75 million, with exceptions for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of regulations. Under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), responsible parties are liable for harm to natural resources caused by an oil spill incident. Liability limitations do not apply if the responsible party fails to report the incident, cooperate with removal activities, or comply with the National Contingency Plan. Natural resources are broadly defined to include various resources controlled by the United States, states, or local governments. Under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), responsible parties are liable for harm to natural resources caused by an oil spill incident. Damages for injury to natural resources can only be recovered by trustees acting on behalf of the United States, states, Indian tribes, or foreign governments. Claims for natural resource damages must be presented to the responsible party, with a procedure in place to recover uncompensated damages from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund if necessary. Responsible parties are also liable for harm to real or personal property resulting from an oil spill incident. A claimant affected by an oil spill incident can recover damages from the responsible party for injury or economic losses to real or personal property. If the responsible party fails to settle a claim within 90 days, the claimant can present the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. To recover damages, the claimant must prove property ownership, damage or injury, repair or replacement costs, and property values before and after the spill. Additionally, for economic losses, the claimant must show that the affected property was not available for use. Under OPA, responsible parties are liable to claimants for the \"loss of subsistence use of natural resources.\" Claimants must prove the unavailability of the affected property, the availability of substitute property, and a nexus between economic losses and property injury. If a responsible party fails to settle a claim for loss of subsistence use within 90 days, claimants can seek compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Under OPA, claimants must identify specific natural resources, describe subsistence use, explain how it was affected by the oil spill, detail mitigation efforts, and mention alternative sources of subsistence. Responsible parties are liable for damages equal to the net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees, or profit shares due to property or natural resource injury. Private entities cannot recover damages for lost government revenues. Private entities cannot recover damages for lost government revenues under the Oil Pollution Act. If a responsible party fails to settle a claim within 90 days, the claimant can present the claim to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. To recover from the Fund, the claimant must prove a causal link between the revenue loss and the oil spill, provide revenue assessments, and establish the net revenue loss. The total compensation for lost government revenue claims is the actual net revenue lost due to the oil spill incident. The Oil Pollution Act allows claimants to recover damages for lost profits or earning capacity due to injury, destruction, or loss of property or natural resources. If a responsible party fails to settle a claim within 90 days, the claimant can seek compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by proving the injury or loss of property, reduced income as a result, and the amount of the loss. The Oil Pollution Act allows claimants to recover damages for lost profits or earning capacity due to injury, destruction, or loss of property or natural resources. Claimants must prove reduced income, amount of loss, availability of alternative employment, and whether profits or earnings were lower during the claimed loss period. The responsible party is liable for costs incurred by states or political subdivisions for providing increased public services due to oil discharge. Only states and their political subdivisions can recover costs for providing additional public services under OPA. The United States cannot recover costs for providing increased public services from the responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act. If the responsible party fails to settle a claim for damages related to public services within 90 days, the claimant can seek reimbursement from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund by proving the need for services, their connection to the oil spill, and the total costs incurred. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) provides limited defenses to liability for the increased or additional provision of public services. The total compensation allowable is the net cost of the services provided by the affected state. A responsible party may not be liable if they can prove that the oil discharge was caused solely by an act of God, war, or a third party's actions. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) requires a responsible party to pay for removal costs and damages resulting from an oil spill, unless the incident was caused by a serious and unanticipated event, an act of war, or an act by a third party with no contractual relationship. The responsible party must prove due care and precautions were taken to avoid the spill. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) allows a responsible party to defend against liability for an oil spill caused by a third party if they were operating non-negligently. However, this defense is not available if the responsible party fails to report the spill, cooperate with removal activities, or comply with the President's removal authority. Additionally, transferring ownership of the facility does not absolve liability if the responsible party had knowledge of the spill. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a federally administered trust fund financed by a per-barrel tax on crude oil received at US refineries. It can be used to pay for oil spill removal activities, natural resource damage assessments, and unpaid damages claims, with a maximum withdrawal limit of $1 billion per incident. The US Attorney General can take legal action to recover funds from responsible parties. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 allows the Fund to take legal action against responsible parties to recover money paid to claimants under OPA.
