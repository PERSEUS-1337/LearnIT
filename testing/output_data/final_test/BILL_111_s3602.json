    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Treatment of Polluted Stormwater Runoff Act\" or the \"STOPS Runoff Act.\" It establishes the Federal-Aid Highway Runoff Pollution Management Program. The \"Safe Treatment of Polluted Stormwater Runoff Act\" establishes the Federal-aid highway runoff pollution management program, requiring covered projects to meet minimum standards for water quality protection. The Secretary must approve projects only if they adhere to these standards to maintain or restore predevelopment hydrology. The project site's hydrology must be considered in terms of temperature, rate, chemical composition, volume, and flow duration. Measures should be taken to avoid altering natural features, minimize pollution, capture highway runoff, and prevent remaining pollution through various control measures. Control measures for managing highway runoff pollution include pretreatment and treatment on the project site, discharge to off-site control measures under state control, and off-site mitigation if on-site measures are impracticable due to site conditions or other factors. Off-site runoff pollution mitigation program prioritizes measures for impaired waterways in the same or adjacent Hydrologic Unit Code as the project site. Secretary to publish guidance for States within 180 days of enactment to assist in implementation. The Environmental Protection Agency will provide guidance to States on managing highway runoff pollution from covered projects, including integrating control measures and creating a watershed-based approach. The Secretary will require States to report annually on highway runoff pollution reductions achieved for covered projects, while ensuring that more stringent laws are not affected by the requirements of this section. In this section, definitions for \"control measure,\" \"covered project,\" and \"Federal-aid highway runoff control measure retrofit\" are provided for projects under this title related to highway runoff pollution control. The term `Federal-aid highway runoff control measure retrofit' refers to installing or modifying a control measure for highway runoff pollution on a Federal-aid highway or associated facility constructed before the enactment of this section. Highway runoff pollution includes discharges of sediment, metals, bacteria, chemicals, nutrients, oil and grease, as well as exceeding predevelopment amounts of peak flow rate, water temperature, and runoff volume. The term 'significant Federal-aid highway improvement' refers to major projects that disturb 5 or more acres of land. The term 'watershed-based environmental management approach' involves selecting solutions to minimize environmental impact. The priority consideration for minimizing environmental impact within a watershed includes protecting drinking water supplies, restoring impaired waterways, and preserving aquatic ecosystems and fisheries. The legislation will be effective one year after enactment for construction of Federal-Aid Highway projects, with a focus on minimizing environmental impact and cost-effective use of Federal funds. The legislation establishes a Federal-aid highway runoff pollution management program."
