    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that certain areas in the White River National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management, Glenwood Springs Resource Area in Colorado along Deep Creek should be protected and enhanced for present and future generations. These areas include the rugged limestone gorge formed by Deep Creek on the White River Plateau, offering unique scenic, geological, scientific, and recreational opportunities. The high elevation riparian areas and wildlife components in the rural western setting provide extensive opportunities for primitive recreational activities. Deep Creek carves a rugged limestone gorge, forming a pristine canyon over 2,500 feet deep and 13 miles long, with ideal conditions for cave formation. Water rights upstream and downstream are private property entitled to protection. Proper management can balance wilderness values with reasonable development. The Wilderness Area near Trappers Lake and Deep Creek will be named Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness out of respect for the native Ute people. Colorado law allows the Colorado Water Conservation Board to hold instream flow rights to protect the natural environment. Establishing instream flow rights for Deep Creek, abandoning conditional rights upstream, or converting existing water rights to instream flow rights would benefit the Wilderness Area. The purpose of the Act is to conserve and protect the unique values of the Federal lands in the Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness Area in Colorado, including wilderness, geological, natural, scientific, recreational, environmental, biological, and scenic resources. There are no water resource facilities or projects within the Wilderness Area, so provisions for access, operation, routes, maintenance, or repair are not necessary. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act:\n(1) Wilderness area.--The term ``Wilderness Area'' refers to the Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness Area established by section 4.\n(2) Map.--The term ``Map'' refers to the map entitled ``Proposed Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness Area'' dated February 25, 2002.\n(3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nSEC. 4. DEEP CREEK-YAMPATIKA UTE WILDERNESS AREA DESIGNATION. The Deep Creek-Yampatika Ute Wilderness Area in Colorado, consisting of approximately 7,350 acres of Federal land, is established in furtherance of the Wilderness Act. The effective date is contingent upon the Secretary of Agriculture's determination regarding water rights. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine if Deep Creek's instream flow levels are sufficient and publish notice in the Federal Register. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT. The Wilderness Area must be managed to conserve, protect, and enhance its resources in accordance with the Wilderness Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and other applicable laws. Federal lands within the Wilderness Area are withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights. Federal lands within the Wilderness Area are withdrawn from various activities under public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. The Colorado Army National Guard is allowed to conduct aerial navigation training exercises over the Wilderness Area in accordance with a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum of understanding can be modified with the agreement of all parties involved. It must be reviewed annually, considering alternative locations for activities outside of the Wilderness Area. The Colorado Army National Guard may identify alternate locations for conducting activities. The National Guard can modify the memorandum of understanding if an alternate location outside the Wilderness Area is found for aerial training. The Act does not affect the Colorado Division of Wildlife's authority over hunting and fishing in the Wilderness Area. The Secretary will manage grazing leases in the Wilderness Area following existing laws and regulations. Grazing of livestock in the Wilderness Area on Forest Service lands and Bureau of Land Management lands shall be administered according to the Wilderness Act and specific guidelines. The Wilderness Act prohibits the creation of buffer zones around Wilderness Areas, allowing activities outside the area that may not be allowed within it up to the boundary of the Wilderness Area. SEC. 6. WATER RIGHTS AND MANAGEMENT. The term \"water resource facility\" includes various water structures. No one, including government officials, can claim water rights in Colorado based on this Act or wilderness designations. The Act does not affect existing water rights in Colorado or establish precedents for future wilderness designations. No new projects can be funded or permitted by the US government after the Act's enactment. States are prohibited from developing new water resource facilities in designated wilderness areas. The Act does not impact interstate compacts or existing water rights in Colorado. The Secretary of Agriculture must consult with the Colorado Water Conservation Board on instream flow protection recommendations for Deep Creek. The Secretary of Agriculture must consult with the Colorado Water Conservation Board on instream flow protection recommendations for Deep Creek within the Wilderness Area. The Secretary may enter into enforcement agreements with the Colorado Water Conservation Board for monitoring and protecting instream flows. Grants may be provided for compensating parties for canceling conditional water rights. The Secretary of Agriculture may compensate willing parties for conveying water rights within or upstream of the Wilderness Area to the Colorado Water Conservation Board for instream flows. Compensation will be given through enforceable agreements between the Department of Natural Resources of the State of Colorado and the willing party. Colorado and a willing party will determine the fair market value for canceling or conveying water rights, with an independent appraisal. $300,000 is authorized for this purpose. SEC. 7. MAP AND LEGAL DESCRIPTION. The Secretary must provide Congress with a Map and legal description of the Wilderness Area, which will have the same legal effect as if included in the Act. The Map and legal description will be available for public inspection in specified offices. The Office of the Regional Forester and White River National Forest Ranger Office in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, will control any discrepancies between the Map and descriptions. SEC. 8. WILDERNESS POTENTIAL: The Secretary has the authority to evaluate roadless and unroaded areas near the Wilderness Area for possible inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System."
