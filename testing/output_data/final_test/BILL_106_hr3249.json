The \"Artists' Contribution to American Heritage Act of 1999\" defines a qualified artistic charitable contribution as a donation of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the taxpayer at least 18 months prior to the contribution. The taxpayer must also obtain a qualified appraisal of the fair market value of the property. The taxpayer must attach a copy of the appraisal to their income tax return for the taxable year in which the contribution was made. The donee organization must be described in subsection (b)(1)(A) and use the property in a way related to its exempt purpose under section 501. The taxpayer must provide a written statement from the donee ensuring compliance with donation provisions and the appraisal must show evidence of similar property owned and used by qualifying organizations.
