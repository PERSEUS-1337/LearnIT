    "content": "The Act titled \"Antimicrobial Pesticide Registration Reform Act of 1995\" references the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act for any amendments or repeals. It focuses on regulating antimicrobial products. The Act \"Antimicrobial Pesticide Registration Reform Act of 1995\" defines an antimicrobial pesticide as a product intended to disinfect, sanitize, or protect against microbiological organisms. The Act \"Antimicrobial Pesticide Registration Reform Act of 1995\" defines antimicrobial pesticides as products intended to disinfect, sanitize, or protect against microbiological organisms. The Act also outlines registration requirements for antimicrobial pesticides, including evaluating reforms to reduce review periods for new active ingredients and end-use products. The Act \"Antimicrobial Pesticide Registration Reform Act of 1995\" aims to reduce review periods for new antimicrobial pesticides. This includes a 75 percent reduction in review time or specific review periods of 12 months for new active ingredient registrations and 6 months for new uses of registered active ingredients. The Act \"Antimicrobial Pesticide Registration Reform Act of 1995\" aims to reduce review periods for new antimicrobial pesticides. This includes specific review periods ranging from 1 to 3 months for various types of registrations and amendments. The Administrator is required to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking within 90 days of enactment. The Administrator will publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register to gather input for defining classes of antimicrobial use patterns and differentiating types of review for antimicrobial pesticides based on risks and benefits. The Administrator will implement regulations within 1 year to ensure the review process maintains antimicrobial pesticide efficacy and sets effective deadlines for process management. The Administrator will propose regulations within 1 year to establish a certification process for regulatory actions involving manageable risks in a cost-efficient manner. This process may include certification by approved laboratories and utilize cost-effective measures. The Administrator will propose regulations for a certification process for regulatory actions involving manageable risks. This process will include expanded use of notification and non-notification procedures, revised application review procedures, and allocation of resources for streamlined management of antimicrobial pesticide registrations. A transition period will apply for antimicrobial pesticide applications filed after 90 days from the enactment of this subsection. The registration of an antimicrobial end-use pesticide that is substantially similar or identical to a currently registered pesticide, or differs in ways that do not increase environmental risk, shall take no more than 135 days. Amendments to current registrations not requiring scientific review shall have a review period of no more than 90 days. The scientific review of data for antimicrobial pesticide applications must be completed within 135 days. If final rules are not effective within 545 days, a new active ingredient pesticide registration will have a review period of 18 months. The timeframe for pesticide registration varies depending on the type of registration: 12 months for a new use of a registered active ingredient, 6 months for a new use of a registered end-use product, 6 months for a new end-use product registration, 135 days for a substantially similar product, 6 months for an amendment requiring scientific review, and 135 days for an amendment not requiring scientific review. The Administrator must notify registrants before the end of the review period whether their application has been approved or denied. Failure to do so results in automatic denial, which can be challenged through judicial review. The Committees on Agriculture in both the House of Representatives and the Senate will oversee the antimicrobial registration reform process. The Administrator must submit an annual report detailing efforts to reduce registration application backlogs. The Administrator must submit an annual report detailing efforts to reduce the backlog of pending registration applications and progress towards reforms for antimicrobial registrations. Registrants of antimicrobial pesticides are required to obtain approval before changing label or labeling statements. Antimicrobial pesticides may alter label statements if truthful and not misleading. Diluted solutions may have different cautionary statements than concentrates for adequate protection. Disposal regulations apply to household and industrial formulations. The amendment exempts household and industrial disinfectant products from regulation under certain acts. Data coordination and sharing are required when requested by State or Federal agencies. The Administrator must coordinate and synchronize data requests among agencies to reduce burdens and avoid redundancy. Procedures for this coordination must be developed within one year. States retain authority to regulate pesticides."
