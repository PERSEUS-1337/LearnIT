    "content": "The \"Television Improvement Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that television is a pervasive presence in American homes, with the average household having 2.5 televisions and a television being on for 7 hours a day. Children spend an average of 21 hours a week in front of a television, which has a significant influence on their perceptions and behaviors. Research shows a strong link between children's exposure to televised violence and behavioral issues. Numerous studies confirm that children who regularly watch violent TV shows are more likely to display aggressive behavior and become desensitized to real-life violence. Additionally, sexual content on television can also impact children significantly. Research suggests that heavy exposure to TV programming with strong sexual content can lead to early sexual activity among teenagers. The National Association of Broadcasters adhered to a code of conduct emphasizing the careful selection of program subjects to responsibly use television's influence. Broadcasters have a responsibility to ensure that programs for children cater to a range of interests and contribute to their balanced development. Violence, whether physical or psychological, should be handled with caution. (C) Violence, physical or psychological, should be portrayed responsibly, avoiding exploitation. Programs should show the consequences of violence to victims and perpetrators without excessive or gratuitous details. (D) Depictions of marriage, family, and sexual content should be treated sensitively and not exploited. (E) Broadcasters must consider the family viewing atmosphere when creating programs, going beyond legal requirements. The NAB abandoned its code of conduct in 1983 after legal challenges on advertising restrictions, but the programming standards were never found to violate antitrust laws. Since the NAB abandoned its code of conduct in 1983, programming standards on broadcast and cable television have deteriorated, leading to concerns about the impact on children and society. Polls show that over 80% of Americans are worried about the graphic nature of content and the glorification of criminal behavior on TV. Congress has urged the television industry to address these issues. The television industry responded to public concerns by adopting voluntary guidelines to limit violence in programming and implementing a rating system for harmful content. Despite these efforts, concerns about the impact of television on children persist. Despite the television industry's voluntary guidelines to limit violence and rating system for harmful content, many Americans, especially parents, are still frustrated with the declining standards of TV programming and its negative influence on children and American values. In 1993, the Department of Justice ruled that developing and implementing voluntary programming guidelines would not violate antitrust laws and could have procompetitive benefits. The Children's Television Act of 1990 mandates that US television broadcasters must meet the educational needs of children, but independent analyses show they have not fulfilled this obligation since the Act's enactment. The Children's Television Act of 1990 requires US television broadcasters to address the educational needs of children, but they have not fully met this obligation since the Act was passed. The Children's Television Act of 1990 aims to allow the television industry to collaborate in addressing concerns about harmful content for children, develop voluntary guidelines similar to the NAB Television Code, and promote educational programming for children without giving the Federal Government authority to restrict content. The Children's Television Act of 1990 aims to collaborate with the television industry to address concerns about harmful content for children and promote educational programming without granting the Federal Government additional authority to restrict television programming beyond existing laws. The Children's Television Act of 1990 collaborates with the television industry to address harmful content for children and promote educational programming without granting additional authority to restrict television programming. The applicability of the Television Program Improvement Act to agreements on guidelines for telecast material is outlined in Section 4. The Television Program Improvement Act of 1990 is amended to broaden the scope of exemption for telecast material, focusing on alleviating negative impacts and promoting educational content for children. The Television Program Improvement Act of 1990 is amended to broaden the exemption scope for telecast material, focusing on alleviating negative impacts and promoting educational content for children. Subsection (d) is further amended to include provisions regarding boycotts and advertising restrictions."
