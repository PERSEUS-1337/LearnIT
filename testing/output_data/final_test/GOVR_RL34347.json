Congressional practices related to the death of a sitting Member date back to the Continental Congress in 1775, where mourning rituals were observed for a deceased Delegate from Virginia. During the First Congress, the death of Senator William Grayson and Representative Theodorick Bland led to mourning rituals and funeral arrangements by Congress. In the 19th century, Congress began covering some funeral expenses for sitting Members, with services sometimes held in the House or Senate chamber. During the 19th century, funeral services for deceased Members of Congress were held in the House or Senate chamber, with both chambers appointing committees to escort the remains to their final destination. This practice continued into the 41st Congress, where a joint committee attended the remains of Senator Daniel S. Morton to his home. In contemporary times, chamber rules and statutes outline the congressional response to the death of a Member. In response to the death of a sitting Member or former Speaker, congressional customs include briefly adjourning, appointing Member delegations to funerals, and covering funeral costs. Some traditions like wearing crape or holding services in chambers have not been observed for decades. External factors, such as the circumstances of the Member's death and family preferences, also influence contemporary congressional responses. Congressional response to the death of a sitting Member involves various actions determined by factors such as the Member's preferences, Congress's session status, pending business, and external events. These actions typically include floor announcements, condolence resolutions, funeral arrangements, benefits for the deceased Member's office and staff, and publication of memorials. Recognition of the Member's death occurs primarily on the chamber floor, with specific actions dependent on Congress's session status and the circumstances of the death. When a sitting Member of Congress passes away, the House typically announces the death on the floor and may continue with pending matters, suspend business for memorials, or adjourn for the day in honor of the deceased Member. For example, the death of Representative Julia May Carson was acknowledged during a House session, with the chaplain noting her passing and Representative Dan Burton also recognizing her. The House acknowledged the passing of Representative Julia May Carson, with Representative Dan Burton and Peter Visclosky paying tribute and observing a moment of silence. In contrast, no formal announcement was made for Representative Jo Ann Davis, who passed away in 2007. Following the recent deaths of Representatives Paul E. Gillmor, Juanita Millender-McDonald, and Charles W. Norwood Jr., resolutions of condolence were considered and adopted in the House. Representative John Boehner informed the chamber about Gillmor's passing, while Representative Ralph Regula and Pete Stark announced the deaths of their colleagues and called for moments of silence. The House then moved to adopt the resolutions before adjourning. Representative Charles W. Norwood Jr. of Georgia passed away on February 13, 2007, during a debate in the House regarding President George W. Bush's decision to send more troops to Iraq. His death was acknowledged twice during the debate, with Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Representative John Nathan Deal announcing it. The Speaker typically announces a revised whole number of the House after a Member's passing. When a Member of the House dies during a congressional recess, the House acknowledges it by making an announcement when they reconvene. This practice dates back to at least 1826. The Speaker addresses the House to announce the death, funeral arrangements, and plans for a resolution and tribute. Representatives-elect who pass away before Congress convenes are also acknowledged. In 1833, the death of Representative-elect Thomas D. Singleton was announced while he was traveling to Washington, DC. The House acknowledges the death of Representatives-elect by making an announcement when they reconvene. In 1833, the death of Representative-elect Thomas D. Singleton was noted, and in the 20th century, similar recognition was given to deceased Representatives-elect. When a sitting Senator passes away, the Senate typically acknowledges it through prayers by the chaplain, tributes from other Senators, and a resolution of condolence. The chamber may continue with business or adjourn as a mark of respect. When a sitting Senator passes away, the Senate typically acknowledges it through prayers by the chaplain and tributes from other Senators. The chamber may adjourn as a mark of respect. Exceptions to this practice arise when news of the death of a Senator reaches the Senate while it is meeting. In those circumstances, the majority leader makes an announcement, as seen in the deaths of Senator Paul Coverdell, Senator Quentin Burdick, and Senator Craig Thomas. Senator Thomas' passing was not formally announced in the Senate, but tributes were offered by Senator Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Harry Reid. When a sitting Senator passes away, the Senate typically acknowledges it through prayers and tributes. The Senate may adjourn as a mark of respect. This was seen in the tributes for Senator Thomas and Senator Wellstone. Since 1807, Senators who have died during recess have been honored when the Senate reconvenes. Senator Kennedy was the most recent sitting Senator to die during a recess. The Senate honored the late Senator Edward Moore Kennedy of Massachusetts, who passed away during a recess on August 25, 2009. Senator Harry Reid led a moment of silence and tributes were offered by other Senators. The Senate adopted a resolution of condolence and set a period for memorial statements. Resolutions for mourning sitting Senators date back to 1806, with traditions of using mourning badges and attending funeral services. The House typically adjourns as a mark of respect for deceased Members. In the House, resolutions expressing condolences to the family of deceased Members have been a tradition since 1864, becoming more routine around 1899. The House typically introduces a resolution within a day of the Member's passing, with one hour of debate before adoption by voice vote or unanimous consent. The House tradition of passing resolutions expressing condolences to deceased Members' families dates back to 1864, with resolutions typically introduced within a day of the Member's passing and adopted by voice vote or unanimous consent. The House also authorizes necessary steps and expenses for carrying out these resolutions, including adjourning as a mark of respect and appointing a committee to attend the funeral. The Senate adopts resolutions of condolence when a Representative dies, typically introduced by leaders or surviving Senators. All living Senators are listed as cosponsors, followed by a period of debate before adoption by unanimous consent. The resolution includes milestones of the late Senator's career. The Senate adopts resolutions of condolence when a Representative dies, typically introduced by leaders or surviving Senators. The resolution typically includes a preamble with milestones of the late Senator's career and expresses profound sorrow at their passing. The Secretary of the Senate communicates the resolution to the House of Representatives and the family of the deceased Senator. The Senate may adjourn as a mark of respect, and the deceased Senator's desk may be draped in black. Flowers may be displayed on the desk on the day of eulogies. The House may also adopt a resolution of condolence. Since 1978, Senate and House resolutions have been adopted to honor deceased Senators. Public funds have historically been used to cover funeral expenses for sitting Members, dating back to 1802 when the House first provided a funeral at public expense. In 1809, the Senate allocated funds for a monument for Senator Francis Malbone. In 1809, the Senate authorized payment for Senator Malbone's funeral expenses. The practice of funding Member funerals with public funds has been controversial since 1802. Discussions in 1848 questioned the payment of funeral expenses for Members outside of Washington, DC. In 1895, a bill was considered to provide for the disposition of deceased Members' remains at the Capitol. The bill S. 236 proposed arrangements for the disposition of deceased Members of the House and Senate who died at the Capitol during sessions. It included provisions for a committee to prepare the body for transport to family or friends, with a specially appointed sergeant at arms accompanying the body. The bill aimed to cover the costs of preparation and transport of the deceased Member, while prohibiting payment for any other related expenses. Senator William Alfred Peffer of Kansas highlighted the rising costs of Member funerals and the need for more reverent services. In 1906, concerns were raised after a Representative from Pennsylvania committed suicide and requested no committee or memorial services be held for him. Both chambers may pay for funeral services for Members who die in office, and a granite monument may be provided at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC. The House Sergeant at Arms is authorized to make necessary arrangements. The House Sergeant at Arms arranges for committees to attend the funeral of deceased Members of the House. Expenses for funeral services and participants are covered. The location of funeral services for Senators is chosen by their family. Official arrangements are the responsibility of the Sergeant at Arms. No published procedures for lying in state in the Capitol for sitting Members have been identified. Costs for funeral arrangements, including transportation and preparation of remains, are covered by the Senate Sergeant at Arms. The decision for the remains to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda is made by Senate and House leadership, along with the Architect of the Capitol. Congress typically authorizes the use of the Capitol Rotunda for services or for the remains of government officials through a concurrent resolution. If Congress is not in session, authorization is given by the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate. The Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate make arrangements for funeral services and honor guards for deceased government officials. The deceased's office is renamed, staff remain employed until a successor is elected, and any unpaid salary is paid to beneficiaries. A death gratuity is typically provided by the House. The House typically provides a death gratuity equal to the Member's annual salary to the deceased Member's widow, widower, or children. Employees in the personal office of a deceased sitting Senator are continued on the Senate payroll for up to 60 days after the Senator's death. The Committee on Rules and Administration may extend this period if needed. The Official Personnel and Office Expense Account covers expenses related to closing a Senator's office, paid from the Senate's Contingent Fund. The Senate Financial Clerk provides information on office allowances for the deceased Senator's office. Benefits are determined for the beneficiary or survivors, with a gratuity paid to the widow(er) or next-of-kin. A death gratuity is considered a gift by statute. The Government Printing Office compiles a tribute book with legislative proceedings and memorial services for deceased Members of Congress. 50 copies are delivered to the family, with additional copies distributed to Members of Congress. The Senate may also order printing of tributes for deceased Senators. The Senate may order the printing of tributes for deceased Senators, with examples provided in Table 3 of Senate observances for 28 Senators who passed away during their Senate service. Criteria for inclusion in the list include serving as President Pro Tempore, lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda, being designated as one of the \"Famous Nine\" Senators, or having services held on the Senate floor. Congress or the Senate approved various actions to honor these Senators, with observances sometimes held soon after their death through resolutions or agreements. In some cases, Senate observances for deceased Senators were authorized through formal legislative action, while in others, observances were held without formal authorization. The decision-making process for these observances is unclear, but factors such as past Senate practices, the wishes of the deceased Senator, family considerations, and external events may influence future observances. Observances for deceased Senators in the Capitol Rotunda are well established, but the Senate floor has not been used for such events in over 50 years. Questions about security and preservation may arise if observances are proposed in the Senate chamber. Services may also be held in the state the Senator represented, including public or private viewings, lying in honor, funeral or memorial services, procession, and interment. Senate participation will likely be determined in consultation with the family. Senate participation in observances for deceased Senators will be determined in consultation with the family of the deceased."
