    "content": "This report discusses the debate on whether a patent holder, who has agreed to license patented technology on fair terms, can still seek injunctions against infringing products. It covers patent law principles, standard-setting organizations, FRAND licensing, the role of the International Trade Commission, and legal standards for injunctive relief in federal courts and the ITC. Recent developments in standard-essential patents and FRAND licensing are also highlighted. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issues patents to inventors after approval of patent applications. A patent application includes a specification and claims that define the scope of the invention. Section 101 of the Patent Act allows for patents on new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements. To qualify for patent protection, an invention must fall within one of the four statutory categories: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. The U.S. Supreme Court has set limits on patent eligibility, excluding \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\" Patent examiners must ensure that new inventions meet substantive requirements, such as novelty, before granting a patent. The Patent Act requires that an invention must be novel, nonobvious, and useful to qualify for patent protection. Patent holders have the exclusive right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing their invention in the United States. The Patent Act grants patent holders exclusive rights to their invention, including the ability to prevent others from using, selling, or importing it in the United States. Infringement occurs when someone performs any of these acts without authorization, leading to potential civil action and damages. Patent protection typically lasts for 20 years, after which the invention can be used by others freely. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles patent-related disputes. The Federal Circuit is a specialized tribunal with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases. Parties can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Federal Circuit's rulings, but the Supreme Court has discretion to grant certiorari. The IT industry faces challenges with multiple patents, creating a \"patent thicket\" that companies must navigate to commercialize new technology. The IT industry is overwhelmed by a large number of potentially relevant patents for products like smartphones and tablets, which comply with industry standards related to cellular communications and wireless technology. Standards are established by government actions or industry groups known as standards setting organizations. Standards bodies and their members face challenges with patents covering industry standards, potentially leading to infringement issues. Industry standards offer economic benefits like interoperable products and competitive markets, while patents promote innovation and technology transfer. Conflicts between standards and patents require careful consideration of these interests, prompting standards bodies to implement disclosure and licensing policies to address potential conflicts. Standards bodies implement disclosure and licensing policies to address conflicts between industry standards and patent rights. These policies generally require disclosure of pertinent patent rights and licensing essential patents on \"reasonable and nondiscriminatory\" terms, known as RAND or FRAND licensing. However, specific royalty rates for FRAND licenses are often not provided, leading to uncertainty in defining \"reasonable\" license terms. In the IT industry, products use industry standards for interoperability, requiring manufacturers to license essential technology on FRAND terms. Standard-essential patents (SEPs) are patents necessary to implement industry standards, subject to FRAND licensing. The definition of FRAND has not been directly addressed in court, but manufacturers can dispute unreasonable license offers. Standards are crucial for technology advancement and product interoperability, reducing costs and increasing competition. However, they also create essential patents, which are patents necessary for a standard. These patents gain significance and require FRAND licensing for fair access. \"FRAND commitments aim to prevent essential patent owners from gaining excessive market power. Concerns have been raised about owners using injunction threats to demand higher royalties after their technology is incorporated into industry standards.\" SEP holders can gain significant bargaining power by having their patents essential to a standard, leading to potential patent hold-up issues. This can result in companies delaying or avoiding standardized technology in their products, ultimately harming consumers by passing on higher royalties as higher prices. When courts deny injunctions to patent holders, the question of what monetary remedy to apply arises. The court opinions commonly require ongoing royalties for infringing products instead of injunctions. Setting the royalty rate lacks consensus, but district courts must provide a reasonable basis. The FTC notes that patent law heavily influences licensing rates in the context of SEPs. Negotiations breaking down leads to patent litigation, heavily influencing the negotiated amount. Determining damages in patent litigation is challenging due to complex product elements. Courts may use the entire market value rule or apportionment principles to calculate damages. Professor Jorge L. Contreras highlights the complexities involved in determining actual damages. University Washington College of Law Professor Jorge L. Contreras has explained the challenges surrounding FRAND licenses, noting significant disagreements among market participants over royalty levels and the use of injunctive relief. He emphasizes that a commitment to grant a FRAND license does not constitute a license until parties agree on \"fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory\" terms. In a ruling by federal Judge Richard Posner, guidance was provided on calculating a FRAND royalty for a standards-essential patent. The method involves determining the cost to the licensee of obtaining a license for the patented function before it was declared essential to industry standards. The purpose of FRAND requirements is to limit the patentee's royalty demand to the patent's value. The FRAND requirements aim to restrict the patentee's royalty demand to the value of the patent itself, excluding any additional hold-up value. Apple argued that FRAND royalties should not be based on the end price of devices like the iPhone, which derive more value from product-differentiating technology than standardized technology. They compared it to a toll on a highway, where the fee is the same regardless of the car's speed or style. The FRAND requirements aim to limit patent royalties to the true technical value, not inflated by standardization. The US DOJ and USPTO recommend fair compensation for SEP patents essential to a standard, balancing IP protection with FRAND commitments. The importance of fair compensation for patent holders making F/RAND commitments is emphasized to incentivize participation in standards-setting activities. U.S. patent holders can seek legal relief for infringement in federal courts or obtain orders from the U.S. International Trade Commission to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods. The ITC enforces Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, prohibiting unfair competition in product importation. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of articles that infringe U.S. intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and design rights. To adjudicate a patent dispute, the ITC requires the patent holder to meet the \"domestic industry\" requirement, ensuring that a related industry exists or is being established in the United States. This requirement was included because the ITC is primarily a trade forum, not an intellectual property forum. The ITC requires patent holders to meet the \"domestic industry\" requirement to adjudicate a patent dispute. This requirement ensures that a related industry exists or is being established in the United States. Patent holders can satisfy this requirement by showing significant investment in plant and equipment, employment of labor or capital, or substantial investment in exploitation such as engineering, research, development, or licensing. The ITC has jurisdiction over accused imported products and does not need personal jurisdiction over accused manufacturers or meet venue requirements. The ITC's Administrative Law Judges manage litigation, preside over evidentiary hearings, and make an initial determination in investigations involving unfair practices in import trade. The Commission may review, adopt, modify, or reverse the ALJ's determination. The President can veto the determination within a 60-day review period, otherwise, it becomes final. The determination by the ITC becomes final after a 60-day review period or when the President approves it. Appeals can be made to the Federal Circuit within 60 days of the final determination. The court upholds factual findings supported by substantial evidence but reviews patent claim interpretations de novo. The ITC has the power to order injunctive relief, such as exclusion orders and cease and desist orders, but cannot award monetary damages for patent infringement. Patent claims are reviewed de novo by federal courts, and ITC decisions do not have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect. The federal court can grant injunctions in patent infringement cases to prevent the infringer from using the patented invention until the patent expires. This is crucial for the value of the patent and as an incentive for research. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit used to routinely grant injunctions to patent owners, but the U.S. Supreme Court changed this practice in May 2006. In May 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit's practice of automatically granting permanent injunctions in patent infringement cases. Justice Clarence Thomas stated that a plaintiff must meet a four-factor test to obtain injunctive relief, including demonstrating irreparable injury and that monetary damages are inadequate. In May 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Federal Circuit's practice of automatically granting permanent injunctions in patent infringement cases. Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., and Justice Anthony Kennedy filed concurring opinions in eBay, revealing a disagreement among the Justices regarding injunctive relief in patent infringement cases. Chief Justice Roberts predicted that injunctive relief will likely continue to be the usual remedy, while Justice Kennedy suggested that historical practice might not fully apply in deciding whether an injunction should issue in patent infringement cases. In patent infringement cases, Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer noted that historical practice may not be applicable due to the changing business environment. Justice Kennedy acknowledged the rise of patent holding companies using patents for licensing fees rather than production. This has led to the use of injunctions as a bargaining tool for exorbitant fees. The eBay case marked a shift in patent litigation by reducing patent holdup. Before eBay, patentees could threaten to shut down entire products, leading to high royalties in settlements. Following Justice Kennedy's concurrence, federal courts now rarely issue injunctions to patent holding companies, impacting the availability of injunctive relief for SEP. eBay's impact on injunctive relief for SEP holders has been significant. The FTC commissioner noted that it may be challenging for RAND-encumbered SEP holders to prove that money damages are insufficient due to their commitment to license on RAND terms. The ITC, as an administrative agency, does not have to follow the eBay decision in its remedy determinations under Section 337, as confirmed by the Federal Circuit in Spansion, Inc. v. ITC. The legislative history of Section 337 indicates that injunctive relief is the normal remedy for violations, without the need to show irreparable harm. Congress eliminated monetary remedies for intellectual property import violations in 1930, emphasizing injunctions as the sole remedy. In 1988, Congress amended Section 337, removing the requirement to prove injury to the domestic industry or irreparable harm for patent infringement by importation. In contrast to the remedial scheme before the Commission, district courts have different statutory remedies for infringement by importation. District courts can grant damages under 35 U.S.C. Section 284 and have the discretion to issue injunctive relief based on equity principles. The ITC, under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, considers various factors when deciding on exclusion orders. Colleen Chien and Mark Lemley point out that the ITC rarely considers public interest factors when granting exclusion orders, with only three exceptions in the past quarter century involving critical national policy goals. They suggest that the ITC's focus on enforcing patents may bias its decisions in favor of patent holders. The FTC has noted concerns about patentees increasingly suing in the ITC for exclusion orders, especially after the eBay decision. Chien and Lemley argue that patent trolls are exploiting the ITC for injunctions. However, the ITC's data analysis in 2012 does not support a significant rise in troll filings. Chien and Lemley highlighted the discrepancy in patent law procedures between the ITC and other courts, noting that the AIA's joinder limitation does not apply in the ITC. This has led to a steady number of defendants per case in the ITC, despite a decline in district court cases post-AIA. The issue has sparked debates in various legal and scholarly circles. The debate surrounding the incorporation of a patent into an industry standard and its impact on the SEP holder's ability to seek injunctive or exclusionary relief from federal courts and the ITC has been a topic of discussion in various legal and scholarly circles. Key questions revolve around whether such relief is appropriate when an implementer refuses to license the SEP but still produces infringing products. The debate over granting injunctive relief to SEP holders centers on the balance between patent rights and innovation. The U.S. Justice Department has highlighted the complexity of this issue, especially with the acquisitions of patent portfolios by tech giants in 2011. In 2011, tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google acquired large patent portfolios related to wireless communication standards. The Justice Department approved these acquisitions, believing they would not harm competition for wireless devices. Tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google acquired patent portfolios related to wireless communication standards in 2011. The companies made public commitments to adhere to FRAND licenses, ensuring fair and nondiscriminatory access to essential patents for industry interoperability. Apple and Microsoft specifically emphasized the importance of not seeking injunctive relief on FRAND-committed patents to prevent harm to consumers and the industry. The Antitrust Division noted that Google's commitment to FRAND is not as straightforward as Apple's and Microsoft's. Google's policy is to refrain from seeking injunctive relief for SEP infringement, but with conditions such as forgoing defenses, paying disputed amounts into escrow, and agreeing to reciprocal injunction processes. This approach may reduce patent hold risks. The court cases addressed the availability of injunctive relief to SEP holders, with Judge Posner dismissing a lawsuit between Apple and Motorola involving SEPs. He stated that enjoining Apple would only be justified if they refuse to pay a FRAND royalty. Motorola's commitment to FRAND terms implied a willingness to license the patents to anyone meeting the FRAND requirement. Motorola's commitment to FRAND terms implied a willingness to license the '898 patent to anyone paying a FRAND royalty. Judge Posner ruled that injunctive relief was not justified as a FRAND royalty would provide adequate compensation for patent infringement. The Ninth Circuit held that when an SEP holder commits to license a patent on FRAND terms, it creates an enforceable contract with third parties. This commitment includes a guarantee not to seek injunctions but to offer licenses consistent with the FRAND commitment. The ITC is investigating cases involving FRAND-encumbered SEP holders seeking exclusionary relief. The ITC is investigating a case involving Motorola Mobility's claims of patent infringement against Microsoft's Xbox 360 gaming console. Motorola, a holder of standard-essential patents, has not reached an agreement with Microsoft on reasonable license terms. The ALJ recommended a ban on Xbox console imports after finding infringement, leading to concerns from Members of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee urged the ITC to protect Motorola's patent rights and criticized the potential exclusionary order against the Xbox gaming console. They emphasized the importance of honoring RAND commitments to prevent undermining competition and innovation. The House Judiciary Committee urged the ITC to protect Motorola's patent rights and criticized the potential exclusionary order against the Xbox gaming console. They emphasized the importance of honoring RAND commitments to prevent undermining competition and innovation. Inappropriate assertions of SEP rights through exclusion orders threaten innovation, competition, and the adoption of standards crucial to modern communications technologies and the global economy. Members of Congress from Illinois support intellectual property protection but caution against harming technological innovation and competition. To maintain economic success, injunctive and exclusionary relief must be available for entities infringing U.S. intellectual property rights. Denying patent protection hinders domestic commerce and discourages innovation. Senators urged the ITC to consider public interest arguments in cases involving SEPs. The Commission ordered a remand of the Xbox investigation to the ALJ with instructions to apply new opinions that may favor Microsoft. Motorola asked the ITC to drop patent claims against Microsoft involving SEPs, leaving only one non-standard-essential patent in the investigation. The ITC is investigating whether Apple infringes Motorola's patents on 3G technology in the US. The ALJ found Apple infringed one patent in 2012. The Commission is reviewing this decision and seeking input on FRAND issues. The FTC submitted a statement to the ITC regarding the potential impact of injunctive relief on disputes involving SEPs, specifically addressing whether a RAND obligation should preclude the issuance of an exclusion order in certain circumstances. The FTC expressed concerns about the potential harm of ITC exclusion orders on disputes involving SEPs with RAND commitments, arguing that such orders could undermine competition, consumers, and innovation. A group of 19 economics and law professors also opposed granting exclusion orders for patents subject to RAND terms, stating that it would negate the pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits of RAND commitments. The submission argues that patent holders trading exclusion rights for being essential to standards may have exceptions, such as when district court jurisdiction is lacking and public interest favors exclusion orders. The Commission reversed a determination of Apple infringing Motorola's SEP in 2012, without discussing FRAND terms or exclusion orders. Congressional hearings in June and July 2012 examined SEPs and the ITC, with concerns raised about the potential harm of exclusion orders on competition, consumers, and innovation. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Director David Kappos addressed concerns about standard-essential patents (SEPs) and exclusion orders from the International Trade Commission (ITC) during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in June 2012. He emphasized the importance of honoring FRAND commitments by SEP holders but also highlighted the need for flexibility in licensing terms. Director Kappos argued that enforcing patents under FRAND should not eliminate all opportunities for patent holders to protect their intellectual property, as it could discourage companies from taking licenses in the first place. Google urged caution in changing the status quo regarding FRAND-encumbered SEPs, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that benefits both patent owners and standard-setting participants. They agreed that compliance with licensing obligations should be a factor in determining exclusionary relief for SEPs, but warned against adopting categorical rules that could deprive patentees of their rights. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the impact of exclusion orders on competition for standards-essential patents. Witnesses included the acting assistant attorney general and the commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. The Antitrust Division investigated patent acquisitions to prevent higher royalties through injunctions or exclusion orders. The Antitrust Division closely monitors the use of F/RAND-encumbered standard-essential patents in the wireless device industry to prevent stifling competition and innovation. SSO members do not typically negotiate licenses for SEPs before a standard is adopted, creating the potential for hold-up in negotiations. Injunctive relief for a FRAND-encumbered SEP holder is likely inappropriate in most cases. The injunctive relief for a FRAND-encumbered SEP holder may lead to unfair licensing terms and higher prices for consumers, as it can allow the patent holder to exploit the threat of exclusion orders. This can result in royalty rates that reflect patent hold-up rather than the true value of the patent. Commissioner Ramirez emphasized the need to prevent patent hold-up by limiting the possibility of exclusion orders for FRAND-encumbered SEP holders. She suggested that if the ITC's public interest authority is not flexible enough, Congress should consider amending Section 337. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet discussed these issues in a hearing on patent disputes. The Trade Commission and Patent Disputes hearing focused on the impact of non-practicing entities on the ITC's docket, with some discussion on SEPs. Professor Chien highlighted the increase in litigious behavior at the ITC due to the ease of obtaining injunctive relief compared to federal courts. The litigious behavior at the ITC contributes to a favorable climate for patent trolling and holdup in today's patent system. Suggestions were made to minimize disruption to consumers and manufacturers by tailoring the scope of injunctions and delaying their effective date. However, designing around a SEP may not be feasible as it could result in non-compliance with the standard. Designing around a standards-essential patent is more challenging than non-SEP patents, as even minor changes can greatly impact product functionality. Consumers rely on standards for product compatibility and may avoid noncompliant products. This could undermine the value of successful standards and harm consumers. The American Antitrust Institute (AAI) supports FTC's principles for determining fair licensing prices for SEPs, emphasizing ex ante incremental value and smallest affected component as royalty base. SSOs should disclose proposed license terms to prevent holdup conduct. Injunctions for SEP infringement are deemed inappropriate by AAI, advocating for clearer FRAND commitment rules. Bernard Cassidy of Tessera Technologies, Inc. opposes weakening the ITC's jurisdiction, arguing that it would benefit foreign economies at the expense of the U.S. economy. He believes applying the eBay case to the ITC would weaken its ability to address unfair trade practices. Cassidy predicts that limiting exclusion orders or injunctions for FRAND-encumbered SEPs would have negative consequences. Reducing availability of exclusion orders or injunctions for FRAND-encumbered SEP holders could deter innovators from participating in SSOs or engaging in R&D for standardized technologies, leading to delays, inferior standards, and limited patent information. AIPLA opposed applying the eBay rule to ITC proceedings and raised concerns about denying injunctive relief to SEP holders. SEP owners, like all patent holders, should have the right to protect their intellectual property. Excluding SEPs from Section 337 proceedings could benefit foreign companies importing infringing goods. The FTC settled with Google over anticompetitive conduct related to standard-essential patents. The FTC settled with Google over anticompetitive conduct related to standard-essential patents. Google is required to stop excluding competitors using essential patents and offer licenses on fair terms. Google must not seek injunctions based on alleged infringement of FRAND patents unless it has made qualified offers to potential licensees. Exceptions allow Google to seek injunctive relief in certain cases, such as when a potential licensee is outside U.S. jurisdiction or refuses to license the patent. The proposed consent order prohibits Google from seeking injunctions for FRAND patents unless certain conditions are met, such as making qualified offers to potential licensees and responding to FRAND Terms Letters within 30 days. It also allows Google to seek injunctive relief in specific cases, like when a potential licensee is outside U.S. jurisdiction. The order will terminate after 10 years. The proposed consent order prohibits Google from seeking injunctions for FRAND patents unless certain conditions are met, such as making qualified offers to potential licensees and responding to FRAND Terms Letters within 30 days. It also allows Google to seek injunctive relief in specific cases, like when a potential licensee is outside U.S. jurisdiction. The order will terminate after 10 years and is subject to public comment for 30 days. The policy statement allows for injunctions or exclusion orders in specific cases where a potential licensee refuses to negotiate FRAND terms or pay a FRAND royalty, or if the licensee is outside the jurisdiction of a court that could award damages."
