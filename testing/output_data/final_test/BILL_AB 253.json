    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 987.010 of the Military and Veterans Code gives preference to applicants for funding from the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 for supportive housing projects with a multiyear commitment of Mental Health Services Act funding. Section 5845 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission is established to oversee various mental health programs outlined in the Welfare and Institutions Code. It replaces the advisory committee and consists of 18 voting members including the Attorney General and the Superintendent of Public Instruction or their designees. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission includes the Superintendent of Public Instruction or designee, the Chairperson of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee or selected member, and the Chairperson of the Assembly Health Committee or selected member. The Governor appoints a diverse group of individuals to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, including those with personal or family experience with mental illness, a physician specializing in alcohol and drug treatment, a mental health professional, a county sheriff, a superintendent of a school district, and representatives from various organizations and sectors. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission members serve without compensation but are reimbursed for expenses. Their term is three years, staggered for continuity. The commission meets quarterly in public, employs staff as needed, and operates independently from state health departments. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission can establish technical advisory committees, enter into contracts, and obtain data from relevant state entities for oversight and evaluation of projects supported by Mental Health Services Act funds. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission participates in decision-making processes, develops strategies to reduce stigma, advises the Governor and Legislature on improving mental health care, and can refer critical issues to the State Department of Health Care Services. The Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission collaborates with the State Department of Health Care Services and the California Mental Health Directors Association to provide technical assistance for the Mental Health Services Act. They also work on designing a joint plan for evaluating client outcomes in the mental health system. The California Health and Human Services Agency leads this effort. Section 14684 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to ensure that mental health plans, whether public or private, use state and federal funds solely for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Administrative costs must be clearly identified and reimbursed in accordance with federal Medicaid requirements. Administrative requirements should not exceed available funds. The mental health plan development process involves input from various stakeholders, including beneficiaries, advocates, providers, and agencies. It includes standards for quality, access, and coordination of services, with opportunities for existing providers to continue services. Continuity of care for current recipients is ensured during the transition to managed mental health care. Medi-Cal covered specialty mental health services are provided in the beneficiary's home community or nearby. Services can be offered in a facility, home, or community-based site. Eligibility is based on functional impairment, with a focus on adults with serious mental illness and children with emotional disturbances. Specialty mental health services for eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries, including adults and children, must include Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Services for those under 21 years old. Each mental health plan must monitor effectiveness, evaluate accessibility and quality of services, use state-adopted performance measures, review individual service plans, include a beneficiary satisfaction component, and have a grievance system for beneficiaries and providers. Each mental health plan must provide culturally competent and age-appropriate services, assess cultural competency needs, and ensure timely accommodation of significant needs. Performance measures will track the extent of cultural competence and age appropriateness. The department will post cultural competence plans online within 30 days of submission for approval. The mental health plan must be submitted for approval within 30 days and will be available on the Internet. The Legislature confirms that this aligns with the Mental Health Services Act."
