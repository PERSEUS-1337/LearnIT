    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Mandate Relief Act of 1993\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Federal Mandate Relief Act of 1993 acknowledges that Federal regulation has increasingly burdened State and local governments, affecting their ability to fulfill responsibilities and meet priorities. This Act aims to alleviate excessive fiscal burdens imposed by Federal mandates. The Federal Mandate Relief Act of 1993 aims to ensure that the Federal Government covers the additional costs incurred by State and local governments due to intergovernmental regulations implemented after the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"additional costs\" as expenses incurred by a State or local government in complying with federal regulations, excluding required contributions to federal assistance programs. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and \"Federal agency\" pertains to executive branch departments, agencies, or instrumentalities. The term \"Federal assistance\" refers to aid provided by a Federal agency to a State or local government in various forms, excluding direct cash assistance to individuals or procurement contracts for goods or services. The term \"intergovernmental regulation\" involves statutes or regulations that mandate specific actions by State or local governments. The term \"local government\" includes counties, cities, school districts, and other political subdivisions. The term \"State\" encompasses all states, territories, and districts mentioned. SEC. 4. COMPENSATION OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS. An intergovernmental regulation cannot be enforced on a State or local government for a fiscal year unless Federal funds are appropriated and made available to cover the additional costs incurred by the governments. Alternatively, Congress can waive this requirement with a two-thirds vote. In complying with an intergovernmental regulation, State and local governments must cover the total estimated costs for compliance as reported by the Director. The Director, in consultation with State and local governments, prepares and submits a report estimating additional costs incurred by each government in complying with intergovernmental regulations. Reimbursements for these costs are to be paid accordingly. The head of a Federal agency must reimburse State and local governments for additional costs incurred in complying with intergovernmental regulations. The reimbursement amount is based on a report submitted by the Director, detailing the specific costs for each government. In fiscal year, a joint resolution described in section 4(a)(2) is in effect. No statute enacted after this Act shall supersede it unless specifically stated in the new statute."
