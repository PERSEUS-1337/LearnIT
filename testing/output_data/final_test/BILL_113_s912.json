The \"Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013\" defines key terms such as \"a la carte,\" \"channel,\" \"multichannel video programming distributor,\" \"video programming,\" \"Commission,\" \"local commercial television station,\" and \"qualified local noncommercial educational television station.\" The term \"television station\" is defined in the Communications Act of 1934, and the term \"video programming vendor\" is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations. SEC. 3. A LA CARTE CHANNELS OF VIDEO PROGRAMMING. A multichannel video programming distributor can offer channels on an a la carte basis, with incentives for offering local commercial television stations without being subject to certain statutory licenses. A local commercial television station cannot elect retransmission consent or avail itself of certain protections if it offers channels on an a la carte basis. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to specify that a video programming vendor can offer a channel for purchase by a multichannel video programming distributor only if it is also available on an a la carte basis. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations to be carried by multichannel video programming distributors in fulfillment of certain requirements. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations to be carried by multichannel video programming distributors in fulfillment of certain requirements. The terms 'local commercial television station' and 'qualified low power station' are defined in section 614(h). Section 614(b) is amended to specify the stations to be carried, and section 615(h) is also amended. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to require multichannel video programming distributors to carry local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations. If agreement is not reached on terms for purchasing rights to provide local commercial television stations on an a la carte basis, disclosure to the Commission is required. SEC. 4. SPECTRUM USE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. Section 325(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include provisions for parity between over-the-air and multichannel video programming viewers. Television broadcast stations not retransmitting identical signals over-the-air as to multichannel distributors will forfeit their spectrum license, which will then be reallocated and reassigned. The Commission will reallocate and reassign spectrum licenses not retransmitting identical signals, with an exception for short commercial advertisements. Definitions for terms like 'multicast stream' and 'multichannel video programming distributor' are provided. The Commission will amend regulations to prevent sports blackout rules from applying to events held in publicly financed stadiums."
