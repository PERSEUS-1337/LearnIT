    "content": "The \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2005\" includes provisions for Federal-State agreements, requirements for regular and emergency extended unemployment compensation, payments to States, financing provisions, definitions, and applicability. The \"Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2005\" allows qualified States to enter into agreements with the Secretary for regular and emergency extended unemployment compensation payments. Qualified States include Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The agreement under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act allows State agencies to make payments of regular compensation to individuals based on State law with modifications. Eligible individuals receive an additional 25% or $100 on top of their regular compensation. The term \"eligible individual\" refers to someone receiving regular compensation under the State law of a qualified State affected by a major disaster declared due to Hurricane Katrina. The agreement allows for payments to these individuals, with a nonreduction rule in place. The Secretary determines if the method for calculating regular compensation in a State has been changed in a way that would result in lower payments than what would have been received before the modification. This modification also affects the amount of benefits payable under Federal law to eligible individuals based on the State's regular compensation. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Any agreement under this Act shall provide that the State agency will make payments of emergency extended unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation, have no rights to any other compensation, are not receiving compensation from any other country, and meet specific criteria. Individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under a State law will be eligible for emergency extended unemployment compensation if they meet specific criteria, including having no rights to any other compensation and not receiving compensation from any other country. Additionally, individuals must have either held employment in or resided in an area within a qualified State that the President has declared a major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Emergency extended unemployment compensation is available to individuals who have exhausted their regular compensation under a State law. The amount payable is equal to the regular compensation received during the benefit year. State law terms and conditions apply to claims for emergency extended unemployment. Emergency extended unemployment compensation is available to individuals who have exhausted their regular compensation under State law. The maximum amount payable to any individual for emergency extended unemployment compensation shall not exceed the amount established in their account. States must establish emergency extended unemployment compensation accounts for eligible individuals who apply for it. Emergency extended unemployment compensation is available to individuals who have exhausted their regular compensation under State law. The amount in the account is equal to 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. This includes regular compensation under the State law payable for total unemployment. SEC. 5. PAYMENTS TO STATES. Payments to States under this Act include 100 percent reimbursement for additional regular compensation, emergency extended unemployment compensation, and regular compensation for individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina. Sums payable to States under this Act are determined by the Secretary in advance or by reimbursement, based on estimated entitlements for each calendar month. The estimates can be adjusted based on prior month discrepancies, using agreed-upon statistical methods. SEC. 6. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account and Federal unemployment account of the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this Act. The Secretary certifies sums payable to each State for payment. Transfers are made from the accounts to the States based on the certification. Transfers from the Federal unemployment account of the Unemployment Trust Fund are made to States based on certification for payments. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The terms defined in this Act include \"Secretary\", \"State\", \"State agency\", \"regular compensation\", \"week\", \"benefit year\", \"base period\", \"wages\", \"employment\", \"extended unemployment compensation account\", \"Federal unemployment account\", and \"Unemployment Trust Fund\". The Unemployment Trust Fund is established by the Social Security Act. In the case of a State agreement under this Act, State law and regular compensation refer to the laws of that State, subject to modifications described in the Act. The agreement under this Act applies to unemployment weeks from August 28, 2005, to before September 1, 2006."
