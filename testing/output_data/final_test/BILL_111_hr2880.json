The Act titled \"Buy American Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009\" defines key terms related to conservation easements and climate mitigation contracts for eligible land. The Act \"Buy American Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009\" defines terms like eligible lands, eligible practices, program, and Secretary of Agriculture for climate mitigation contracts on privately owned agricultural and forestland in the United States. The Act \"Buy American Carbon Incentives Program Act of 2009\" establishes a carbon incentives program under the Secretary of Agriculture to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions on private agricultural and forestland in the United States. Financial incentive payments are provided for activities that increase carbon sequestration and storage and maintain carbon sequestration to avoid future emissions. Program requirements are outlined. To participate in the program, owners of eligible lands must enter into a climate mitigation contract with the Secretary. The program ensures that funds distributed are not used to reduce funding from other programs, emissions reductions cannot be credited under federal offset programs, and compensation rates are set to not exceed the estimated benefit for landowners. The program ensures that owners of eligible lands receive compensation rates that do not exceed the estimated benefit for the same practices under federally established carbon offset programs. SEC. 5. INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. The Secretary will establish regulations for climate mitigation contracts with eligible landowners, including compensation rates and guidelines. At least 35% of program funds will incentivize activities that protect carbon reductions and enhance environmental benefits. This includes payments for management activities that increase land resilience. The program will allocate 35% of funds to activities that increase forest resilience and compensate owners for entering avoided conversion agreements on lands subject to a climate mitigation contract. SEC. 6. PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLEMENTAL REDUCTIONS. The Secretary aims to achieve specific levels of carbon sequestration through climate mitigation contracts: 100,000,000 tons by 2020 and an additional 200,000,000 tons by 2030. SEC. 7. PROGRAM MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, VERIFICATION, AND REPORTING. The Secretary will establish protocols for monitoring compliance with climate mitigation contracts, including field sampling for emissions reductions. Adjustments to eligible practices and compensation rates may be based on results. A report must be submitted to Congress every 18 months, estimating reductions achieved and any program changes based on monitoring and verification. Each report required by subsection (b) shall be available to the public through the official website of the Department of Agriculture. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums are authorized to be appropriated as necessary for the purposes of this section."
