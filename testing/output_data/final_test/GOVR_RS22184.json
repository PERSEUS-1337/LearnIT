The OEA has provided $280 million in funding for previous BRAC rounds to help with local development efforts and other federal funding strategies. The Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) provides planning and implementation assistance to communities affected by defense program changes. They work closely with other federal agencies to assist communities impacted by defense cutbacks or realignments. The OEA operates with a staff of 45 civilian and 3 military personnel, funded through the Defense Appropriations bill. Funding for the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) is provided in the Defense Appropriations bill. The OEA offers assistance to communities affected by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds, with grants averaging $400,000 to $500,000 per year for three to five years. Congressional adjustments have also been made, with amounts reaching as high as $10,000,000 in a single year. The OEA's expenses and grants for FY1999-FY2007 are detailed in Table 1. Additionally, Title IX of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 provides economic adjustment grants to eligible communities facing sudden economic changes. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) has provided grants totaling over $640 million since 1988 for defense adjustment projects, including closed military bases. Grants are cost-shared with local governments and include funds for planning, infrastructure improvement, and private business development. President Bush's FY2006 budget request included changes to federal economic development programs, including the EDA. President Bush's FY2006 budget proposed changes to federal economic development programs, including the EDA. Congress has not acted on these proposals yet. Other federal agencies may also assist communities affected by base closures, such as DOD funding for environmental cleanup and land transfers from closed military bases for public benefit. Military airports may be transferred for civilian use under FAA programs. The Federal Airport Improvement Program provides financial grants for community development, while the Rural Development Administration offers assistance for economic development in rural communities. Various federal programs offer transition assistance to workers displaced by base closures. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides incentives and benefits to departing military personnel and civilian personnel displaced by defense drawdowns. These include early retirement incentives, medical care benefits, counseling, employment placement assistance, relocation assistance, and special education benefits. Additionally, DOD offers assistance such as advance notification of job reductions, counseling, and hiring preference for re-employment in federal agencies. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides training and services for dislocated workers, regardless of the cause of displacement. It aims to assist workers who have lost their jobs due to structural changes in the economy and may not easily find new employment in their previous industries. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides training and services for dislocated workers. The FY2004 appropriation for dislocated workers was $1.4 billion, increasing to $1.5 billion for FY2005 and FY2006. Approximately 80% of funds are for formula grants to states, with 20% for a national reserve. Governors can reserve funds for state-level and rapid response activities. At least 60% must be allocated to local workforce investment boards. Rapid response activities are provided by specialists in the state's dislocated worker unit after learning of a projected permanent closure or mass layoff. Services for dislocated workers include core, intensive, and training levels, with eligibility criteria for each level. The \"one-stop\" system provides job search services for individuals unable to obtain or retain employment. Eligibility for training services requires receiving at least one intensive service. Supportive services like transportation and child care can be provided to those participating in core, intensive, or training services. The Department of Labor announced the availability of National Emergency Grants (NEGs) for Phase I planning grants to states affected by the 2005 BRAC. These grants aim to plan a comprehensive response to a BRAC closure or realignment, with states eligible to receive up to $1 million in funds. Awards will be made in consultation with the Department of Defense. Phase I planning funds exceeding $1 million will be awarded in consultation with DOD. Phase II grants will provide employment and training assistance to affected workers. Various federal programs and assistance options are available for displaced workers, including post-secondary education, vocational education, unemployment compensation, health insurance, financial aid, and housing assistance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides subsidized school meals, Medicaid, and housing assistance."
