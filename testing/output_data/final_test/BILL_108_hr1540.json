    "content": "The \"Crackdown on Deadbeat Dealers Act of 2003\" aims to address the issue of a small number of licensed firearms dealers contributing significantly to crime guns. In 1998, a small percentage of dealers accounted for over half of crime guns traced to them. The Act proposes increasing compliance inspections of firearms dealers from once to three times. SEC. 4. INCREASING PENALTIES ON FIREARMS LICENSEES. Penalties for firearms licensees amended to 5 years. SEC. 5. SERIOUS RECORDKEEPING OFFENSES THAT AID GUN TRAFFICKING. Offenses related to gun trafficking carry fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. SEC. 6. SUSPENSION OF FIREARMS DEALER'S LICENSE AND CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE GUN CONTROL ACT. Subsections (e) and (f) of section 923 of title 18, United States Code, are amended to allow the Attorney General to suspend or revoke a license or impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation for willful violations of gun control laws or failure to provide secure gun storage. The Attorney General has the authority to suspend or revoke a dealer's license or impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for willfully transferring armor-piercing ammunition. Any person affected by a denial, suspension, revocation, or penalty will receive written notice stating the specific grounds for the action. Review of the Attorney General's actions can only be done as provided in subsection (f). The Attorney General has the authority to deny, suspend, or revoke a license, or impose a civil penalty. The aggrieved party can request a hearing to review the decision, and the effective date of suspension or revocation can be stayed upon request. The hearing will be held at a convenient location for the aggrieved party. The Attorney General has the authority to deny, suspend, or revoke a license, or impose a civil penalty. The aggrieved party can request a hearing for a de novo judicial review of the decision within 60 days. The court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties, even if not presented at the initial hearing. The court can order the Attorney General to comply with its judgment if it decides that the Attorney General was not authorized to deny, suspend, or revoke a license, or assess a civil penalty. SEC. 7 amends Section 925(b) of title 18, United States Code, regarding the termination of a firearms dealer's license upon felony conviction. SEC. 8 authorizes appropriations for hiring and training 500 additional inspectors for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives."
