    "content": "Neural networks in the brain and neuromorphic chips enable cognitive tasks but are susceptible to physical damage, affecting network performance. Research focuses on understanding how neural networks respond to damage and developing repair strategies. Two classes of networks, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs, trained on image datasets, are studied. A new framework is proposed to discover efficient repair strategies for damaged neural networks. The framework defines damage and repair operators for traversing neural networks' loss landscape, discovering path-connected attractor sets. A dynamic recovery scheme creates resilient networks through consistent on-line retraining during damage. This work aims to design fault-tolerant networks for real-time applications in biology and machine learning, focusing on the computational and mathematical principles impacting neural networks' ability to tolerate damage and be repaired. The framework introduces damage and repair operators for neural networks, identifying strategies to efficiently rescue damaged networks. It maps local geometric features of the loss landscape and discovers path-connected attractor sets. The iterative application of these operators results in highly resilient networks. The presence of geometric features resembling path-connected attractors in neural networks' loss landscape explains why damaged networks can be rescued quickly. The impact of neural damage on cognitive performance was studied by deleting neural units from MLPs and CNNs trained for image classification tasks. In this study, the researchers damaged nodes in hidden layers of MLPs and CNNs to simulate neuron death in biological networks. They observed a sharp decline in performance as nodes were incrementally deleted from the networks, indicating a phase transition in functional performance. This phenomenon highlights the vulnerability of neural networks to node damage. The study observed a phase transition in neural networks when damaged above critical thresholds, indicating vulnerability. Strategies were explored to rescue damaged networks, showing they can regain original performance with re-training but require a large number of training cycles. This reduces the feasibility of the rescue strategies. The study explored the feasibility of rescuing damaged neural networks by mapping geometric features of the loss landscape. A dynamical system involving damage and repair operators was used to analyze the network's recovery process. The text chunk discusses the operation of damaging and repairing a neural network using specific operators. The damage operator D_i is used to damage a node i in the network, while the rescue operator r {i,j} is used to repair the network by forcing it to descend the loss manifold and fixing nodes within a set. The repair process involves performing a constrained gradient descent on the network's loss manifold. The sequence involves applying a damage operator followed by a repair operator. A stochastic damage-repair sequence randomly samples a damage operator from D and applies an appropriate repair operator. A random variable D samples an operator D_i from the set of all possible damage operators. An iterative damage-repair sequence repeats the application of a random damage operator D with a deterministic repair operator to maintain zero edge-weight on damaged nodes. The text also discusses the notation for the iterative application of damage-repair operators and hypothesizes the existence of an invariant set of networks. Our numerical results strongly suggest the presence of an invariant, path-connected topological space U in neural networks' loss manifold. The set U is a collection of trained networks where the damage and repair operators result in networks belonging to the same set. This hints at the possibility that U is an invariant set. In this paper, we investigate how neural networks respond to damage and the efficiency of repair strategies. We find a phase transition when nodes are deleted, leading to a steep decline in performance. However, damaged networks can be rescued using an iterative damage-rescue strategy, producing resilient networks that can be restored quickly. This is facilitated by the presence of an invariant, path-connected set in the networks' loss manifold. Future work will focus on proving the presence of invariant 110 sets in the loss manifold using formalization presented in the paper and the Koopman operator machinery."
