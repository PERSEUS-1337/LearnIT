    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a potential free trade agreement among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement aims to eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in goods, services, and agriculture, while also addressing issues like intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment. Congress would need to approve implementing legislation for the U.S. involvement in the TPP. The TPP requires approval from Congress for U.S. commitments to take effect. The agreement will impact various sectors of the U.S. economy and influence trade policy. The report analyzes issues related to the TPP, negotiations, specific areas under discussion, and implications for Congress. The Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (P-4) agreement was conceived in 2003 by Singapore, New Zealand, and Chile for trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States joined negotiations in 2008, with President Obama committing to continue the TPP negotiations in 2009. President Obama notified Congress of the intention to negotiate with TPP countries in 2009. Malaysia joined negotiations in 2010, and a framework for the agreement was announced in 2011 at an APEC Ministerial. Canada, Japan, and Mexico later joined the negotiations after consulting with existing TPP partners. After intense bilateral consultations, Mexico and Canada joined TPP negotiations in December 2012. Japan officially expressed interest in March 2013 and fully participated in July 2013. South Korea began consultations in early 2014 but has not formally requested to join yet. The current 12 partners are undecided on allowing new members before concluding the initial agreement. The United States prefers waiting until negotiations are completed. The TPP negotiations are ongoing with no formal limit to potential membership. Current members are also part of APEC, and expansion may focus on other APEC members like South Korea. Non-APEC countries like Colombia and Costa Rica are interested in joining. Meetings among negotiators and ministers continue, with no major breakthrough announced. Leaders highlight progress in a statement following the November 2014 APEC meetings. The TPP negotiations are ongoing with no formal limit to potential membership. Recent progress was highlighted, with a focus on concluding the agreement soon. The most recent negotiating session took place in Hawaii in March 2015, with 9 chapters completed. Congressional consideration of Trade Promotion Authority could impact the finalization of the TPP negotiations, with outstanding issues mainly related to tariff removal and market access for sensitive products. The TPP negotiations are ongoing with a focus on concluding the agreement soon. Key unresolved issues include agricultural quota removal, market access on sensitive products, and nontariff barriers. Bilateral talks between the United States and Japan are challenging due to import protections for sensitive agriculture products and concerns over nontariff barriers in the Japanese auto market. The proposed TPP agreement aims to strengthen trade and investment ties among participants, with broader strategic implications. The TPP negotiations have broader strategic implications beyond economic value, impacting U.S. trade policy, the Asia-Pacific trade architecture, and U.S. strategic interests in the region. The agreement aims to set trade rules for a critical region, with the U.S. playing a leading role. President Obama emphasized the strategic significance of the TPP during his State of the Union address. The TPP negotiations have strategic implications beyond economic value, impacting U.S. trade policy and strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. aims to set trade rules in the region, with President Obama highlighting the importance of the TPP during his State of the Union address. The TPP is seen as a key element in the U.S. \"rebalancing\" towards Asia, aligning with the Obama Administration's pivot to Asia. It continues the U.S. strategy of using FTAs to promote trade liberalization and spark multilateral negotiations. The United States has 11 FTAs with 16 countries, including recent agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The future of this trade policy is uncertain due to low commercial value and lack of new partner countries. The TPP, supported by both the Bush and Obama administrations, allows the US to negotiate a comprehensive FTA with high standards, building on previous agreements like the US-Korea FTA. This aligns with the US strategy of using FTAs to promote trade liberalization and engage in regional free trade negotiations. The TPP partner countries, including the US and Japan, are advocating for trade liberalization through a comprehensive FTA. This approach may require greater compromise due to the varied levels of development among participants. The TPP model could overshadow narrower goods-based FTAs offered by China and more limited agreements by the EU and Japan. The TPP aims to establish disciplines on new trade issues and may impact the multilateral process of the WTO and the Doha Development Agenda. It includes provisions on agriculture, services, investment, intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment, which could disadvantage U.S. farmers, businesses, and workers if other models are adopted. The TPP aims to establish new trade rules that could impact the multilateral system. The potential expansion of the TPP could affect a significant portion of world trade, with over 60% of U.S. trade being with other APEC members. Successful negotiation of new trade rules in the TPP could serve as a template for future WTO negotiations. The addition of Canada, Japan, and Mexico to the TPP negotiations shows the potential for other regional economies to join. The TPP aims to establish new trade rules that could impact the multilateral system. The addition of Canada, Japan, and Mexico to the TPP negotiations shows the potential for other regional economies to join. TPP could help promote domestic economic policy reforms, particularly for countries like Vietnam. Opponents argue that TPP efforts may divert attention from multilateral WTO efforts and create overlapping trade rules, making international commerce more difficult. The proposed TPP agreement could simplify existing trade rules in the region by unifying them under one agreement. The TPP countries have committed to establishing a common set of rules of origin. The current 12 TPP countries are part of a network of Asia-Pacific FTAs. The United States has FTAs with six TPP countries. The proposed TPP aims to build on the existing Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership. The TPP partners, including ASEAN countries, are part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which aims for open and free trade. The United States and its TPP partners are seen as advancing the consensus-based approach of APEC. APEC Leaders have agreed to work towards a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The TPP partners, including ASEAN countries, are part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which aims for open and free trade. They acknowledged the TPP as potentially one of a number of \"ongoing regional undertakings\" to eventually achieve an FTAAP. Other regional undertakings like the RCEP may not aim for the same level of ambition as the TPP, making it more appealing to some countries. The impact of RCEP and TPP on each other and their potential effect on FTAAP remains unclear. Several countries are moving forward as negotiating partners in both the TPP and RCEP, viewing the negotiations as complementary. The TPP partners, including the United States, are interested in expanding the agreement to additional countries in the Asia-Pacific region, welcoming new members that strive for the same level of trade liberalization. China, the region's second-largest economy, is notably absent from the ongoing negotiations. National Security Advisor Susan Rice reiterated U.S. policy that nations willing to meet the high standards of the agreement are welcome to join and share in its benefits. The potential TPP agreement aims to include China and expand throughout the region, with a focus on establishing disciplines on certain aspects of the Chinese and other Asia-Pacific economies. The economic impact will depend on trade liberalization achieved and the growth of trade and investment among TPP members. The TPP aims to achieve comprehensive trade liberalization among its members, with the potential for significant economic impact. Japan's participation has increased the agreement's economic significance, especially as it is the largest economy and trading partner without an existing U.S. FTA. The TPP negotiators are working towards a high-standard FTA that will liberalize regional trade and investment. Japan's participation in the TPP has drawn interest from various U.S. industries like agriculture, automotive, and services due to its status as the United States' fourth largest goods export and import market. Malaysia and Vietnam, without existing U.S. FTAs, also show potential for growth with their rapid economic development and large populations. Malaysia and Vietnam have high average tariffs, with Malaysia at 6% and Vietnam at 9.5%. U.S. trade with TPP countries was over $1.6 trillion in merchandise in 2014 and over $273 billion in services in 2013. U.S. FDI into TPP countries was nearly $86 billion in 2013, while TPP countries invested over $69 billion in the U.S. The TPP has the potential to become the largest U.S. FTA with diverse member countries. The TPP is the largest U.S. FTA with diverse member countries. U.S. trade relations with TPP countries involve various merchandise exports and imports, including motor vehicles, petroleum, electronics, agriculture machinery, and aircraft. Key U.S. imports vary by country, with agriculture products from Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and Peru, apparel from Vietnam, and crude oil and manufactured products from Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, and Singapore. The United States has diverse trade relations with TPP countries, with key imports including motor vehicles, electronics, and agriculture products. Canada and Mexico are the largest trading partners in goods, while Japan is a significant partner in services trade. Singapore and Australia are top export markets, while Malaysia, Vietnam, and Singapore are major sources of imports. Market access and nontariff barriers are crucial in FTA negotiations. Negotiations in FTAs focus on eliminating tariffs and quotas on trade in goods, with a goal of duty-free access. TPP countries have varying MFN tariff levels, with plans for phase-out schedules covering over 11,000 commodity categories. Tariff phase-outs aim to prevent other forms of protection replacing reduced tariff barriers. The TPP negotiations focus on eliminating tariffs on trade in goods, with phase-out schedules for over 11,000 commodity categories. Tariffs on sensitive products will be phased out over varying periods of time. TPP partners are also discussing export and import licensing procedures, customs issues, and trade facilitation. Differences may arise between developed and developing countries, such as Vietnam, over tariff elimination. The United States prioritizes market access for services providers in its free trade agreements, while developing countries like Vietnam seek tariff elimination on labor-intensive products to compete with other countries like China. U.S. domestic producers push for safeguards and high tariffs on import-sensitive products, while some U.S. retailers and Vietnam advocate for lower tariffs for greater market access. The United States focuses on increasing market access for services providers in its free trade agreements, particularly in financial services, professional services, telecommunication services, express delivery, e-commerce, and data flows. This includes expanding on commitments made in the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). U.S. FTAs with TPP partners already cover trade in services, with Japan's entry further enhancing the significance of these provisions. The Obama Administration's vision of the TPP includes innovations in trade in services to create a \"21st-century model\" for trade agreements. The United States seeks broad TPP services provisions to cover trade with future entrants, with the OECD creating indices to measure services trade restrictiveness among TPP countries. This variation presents opportunities for liberalization through TPP negotiation efforts. The TPP aims to create a \"21st-century model\" for trade agreements with innovations in trade in services. The OECD indices measure services trade restrictiveness among TPP countries, showing opportunities for liberalization through negotiation efforts. The TPP will cover services trade in separate chapters, including cross-border trade with a \"negative list approach.\" The TPP aims to create a \"21st-century model\" for trade agreements with innovations in trade in services. The agreement will employ a \"negative list approach\" for services trade, which is more comprehensive than the \"positive list approach\" used in the WTO GATS. Most trade agreements on cross-border services trade, including U.S. FTAs, contain basic provisions on services that will likely be part of the TPP. The TPP aims to create a modern trade agreement with innovations in services trade, including provisions for market access, professional qualifications recognition, transparency in regulations, and capital flow allowances. The United States has prioritized market access for express delivery services in recent FTAs like KORUS FTA, which may also apply to TPP negotiations. Concerns arise when government-owned postal systems provide express delivery services. The KORUS FTA prohibits government-owned postal systems from using their monopoly power to give unfair advantages to express delivery subsidiaries or subsidize them with revenues from postal services. The TPP includes provisions that impact trade in services, particularly in relation to foreign investments. The TPP includes provisions related to trade in services, focusing on IP rights protection, cross-border data transmission, regulatory coherence, and telecommunications trade. It aims to promote access to telecommunications networks for foreign services suppliers and transparency in regulations. The United States obtained commitments in the KORUS FTA for U.S. investment in foreign telecommunications companies, leading to controversy between developed and developing countries over market access for services. Developing countries are cautious about liberalization in services trade due to concerns about competition and political implications. The U.S. may face challenges in opening its market to maritime service providers. The United States has faced pressure to liberalize access to its market for maritime services and business personnel under the GATS mode-4 delivery. The draft TPP outline includes provisions for financial services, with a commitment to address them in a separate chapter. The original P-4 agreement did not initially include financial services provisions but partners committed to including them within two years, which was overtaken by the launch of the TPP. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on financial services, distinguishing between services traded across borders and those sold by providers with a commercial presence in the buyer's home country. It applies a negative list approach for providers with a foreign commercial presence and limits coverage to specific banking and insurance services for cross-border trade. The FTA allows parties to impose prudential measures for financial system integrity and stability, and addresses insurance sold by Korea Post. The KORUS FTA addresses concerns about Korea Post's insurance operations not being regulated like other financial institutions, giving them a competitive advantage. The agreement stipulates tighter regulation for Korea Post. Additionally, U.S. financial service providers in South Korea should be able to transfer information electronically for business operations. The United States is a member of the plurilateral WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and has sought the inclusion of government procurement provisions in its FTAs with TPP partner countries. Malaysia has maintained preferences to assist the ethnic Malay population in government procurement, which has been a sensitive area in FTA negotiations with the United States. U.S. FTAs with various countries include chapters on government procurement similar to obligations in the GPA. The FTA obligations allow firms from different nations to bid on government contracts over a certain threshold on a reciprocal basis. U.S. negotiators have proposed a similar chapter in the TPP talks. Supporters argue that this will give U.S. firms access to large government procurement markets overseas, as government procurement accounts for a significant portion of a country's GDP. According to the WTO, government procurement accounts for 15%-20% of a country's GDP, with the government procurement market among GPA members valued at $1.6 trillion in 2008. The United States is not including state or local procurement in the TPP negotiations, possibly due to resistance from some U.S. states. The number of states opting into government procurement commitments in FTAs has decreased significantly. Canada is looking to address U.S. Buy American exclusions by proposing to open procurement projects funded by the central government to competition from sub-federal entities. The United States and Japan are negotiating market access for key agricultural commodities in the context of the TPP agreement. This is crucial for concluding the agricultural dimension of the agreement and moving the broader TPP negotiations forward. The U.S. agriculture sector has offensive and defensive interests in the TPP negotiations, particularly regarding market access in Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The U.S. sugar industry opposes additional access to the market, while the dairy industry has both offensive and defensive interests. Negotiations involve exchanging offers and requests to improve market access. The United States has engaged in offer/request processes with countries without bilateral FTAs like Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. Canada's support regimes for dairy, poultry, and eggs hinder market access. The US won't renegotiate existing market access provisions. Japan is seen as a promising market for US agriculture within the TPP group. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projected that Japan would absorb 70% of the increase in agricultural trade among TPP countries in 2025. U.S. agriculture stands to capture one-third of the increase in farm exports within the TPP, contingent on Japan reducing tariffs and quotas on sensitive commodities like pork, beef, rice, and dairy products. Japan's offers on market access for these commodities have not been disclosed. During the last half of 2014, concerns were raised by Members of Congress and commodity groups about Japan's concession offers in the TPP negotiations. 140 House Members signed a letter expressing deep concern over Japan's market access offer, stating it falls far short of acceptability. The National Pork Producers Council and other trade organizations called for an agreement with full tariff elimination. The National Pork Producers Council and other trade organizations raised concerns about Japan's market access offers in the TPP negotiations, specifically regarding pork. Recent reports suggest Japan may have improved its market access offers on pork, beef, and rice, indicating progress in narrowing differences over these sensitive items. In late January 2015, significant progress was noted on Japan's market access offer on pork. In discussions about market access in the TPP negotiations, concerns were raised about Japan's tariffs on beef, pork, rice, and dairy products. The House Committee on Agriculture and the American Farm Bureau Federation expressed worries about Canada's protectionist measures for poultry, egg, and dairy industries. They urged the President to continue TPP negotiations without Japan, Canada, or any other country that hinders a robust outcome for U.S. farmers. The President is urged to pursue TPP negotiations without Japan, Canada, or any country that doesn't open its markets to high standards. Once US-Japan agricultural market access negotiations are settled, focus will shift to Canada's market access issues. Canada may seek greater access to US markets for commodities like sugar, peanuts, and dairy products. The timeline for resolving agricultural market access issues remains uncertain. In January 2015, unresolved issues in TPP negotiations were discussed in House and Senate trade policy hearings. House Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Levin highlighted the need for greater access for U.S. agricultural products in Japan and Canada, particularly dairy and sugar. The U.S. dairy industry, represented by NMPF and USDEC, supports eliminating tariffs on agricultural imports in TPP countries, but not all food groups agree. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) and the U.S. Dairy Export Council (USDEC) are advocating for increased access to dairy markets in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), specifically in Canada and Japan. They emphasized the importance of expanding market access for the U.S. dairy industry in a letter to Members of Congress. Japan and Canada are identified as key markets that need to provide more opportunities for U.S. dairy exports within the TPP agreement. The NMPF and USDEC, along with other dairy industry organizations, are urging for increased market access for U.S. dairy products in Canada and Japan within the TPP agreement. They emphasize the need for more progress in negotiations with Japan and urge for focused dairy market access negotiations with Canada. The U.S. dairy industry is pushing for increased market access in Canada and Japan within the TPP agreement. There are opposing views on opening the U.S. sugar market to TPP countries, with candy makers advocating for immediate access while sugar producers oppose it. Australia may use the TPP negotiations to seek access to the U.S. sugar market. Negotiators in the TPP are addressing disputes over sanitary and phytosanitary standards in agricultural trade, regulations on tobacco products, geographical indication for agricultural products, and export subsidies in the competition chapter. Negotiators in the TPP are drafting a chapter on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) matters to enhance U.S. agricultural exports. The text includes mechanisms for resolving SPS disputes and barriers to perishable product shipments among TPP members. At the Ottawa round in July 2014, USTR indicated willingness to accept dispute settlement for some SPS obligations, but not all. The United States' stance on the type of mechanism and specific obligations remains unclear. U.S. agricultural interests support including an enforcement mechanism for SPS disputes in the TPP text. Testimony before the House Committee on Agriculture highlighted nontariff barriers hindering fruit and vegetable exports and called for a timely dispute settlement process. Members of Congress have also advocated for effective resolution of SPS disputes. Members of Congress have called for \"effective and enforceable rules\" to strengthen the role of science in resolving SPS disputes. Representative Levin cautioned against new SPS disciplines under TPP risking U.S. regulatory sovereignty. The U.S. position on controlling tobacco use has drawn criticism for being inadequate to protect public health, with some arguing for tobacco products to be excluded from trade liberalization. USTR's proposal clarifies that TPP countries agree on exceptions for tobacco products. The USTR's proposal under TPP clarifies exceptions for tobacco products, requiring consultation with TPP partners before legal challenges. Malaysia has proposed exempting tobacco-control measures from TPP challenges. USTR's proposal has faced criticism from Members of Congress, tobacco control groups, and attorneys general. Several Members of Congress and Senators expressed concerns about USTR's TPP proposal regarding tobacco products. USTR's August 2013 proposal was criticized for not providing enough protection for domestic tobacco control measures and not recognizing tobacco as a uniquely harmful product. Tobacco control groups and attorneys general also raised issues with the proposal. Several Members of Congress and Senators, as well as 45 attorneys general, expressed concerns about the TPP proposal regarding tobacco products. U.S. business associations and food and agriculture organizations opposed excluding tobacco manufacturers from investor-state dispute settlement provisions in a TPP agreement. Senator Mitch McConnell also conveyed concerns to USTR. Senator Mitch McConnell has expressed concern to USTR Michael Froman about excluding tobacco products from investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the TPP negotiations. Another issue in the talks involves geographical indications (GIs) for agricultural products like cheese, wines, and spirits. The U.S. dairy industry is worried about the EU's GI protections for cheese names like parmesan. The U.S. dairy industry is concerned that the GI provisions in FTAs like KOREU and EU-Canada could hinder exports of cheeses with common names like parmesan. They are urging for safeguards in TPP to prevent such restrictions and address the GI issue for countries with existing FTAs with the EU. Australia and New Zealand aim to address geographical indication (GI) issues in the TPP by improving safeguards on common food names to counter the EU's trade barriers. They seek to regulate export subsidies, official export credits, and food aid in the agricultural sector, arguing that these distort trade. The US opposes including food aid disciplines in the TPP, despite eliminating export subsidies and reforming export credit guarantees. Australia is pushing for food aid disciplines in the TPP to address agricultural export competition issues and gain access to the U.S. market for sugar and dairy products. The TPP includes provisions that align with WTO agreements and are common in U.S. FTAs. Developing countries may eventually have to comply with all obligations of the agreement. The TPP participants may allow developing countries longer phase-in periods for rules-based commitments. The United States has sought increased intellectual property rights protection in its FTAs, going beyond the level of protection provided in the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The United States aims to have partner countries sign the WIPO's Performances and Phonograms Treaty, including provisions from the last TPA proposal. Strong copyright provisions are favored in FTAs, with recent efforts to extend copyright terms and prohibit removal of copyright information. Different domestic constituencies influence U.S. negotiating positions, especially regarding copyright and the Internet. The United States is pushing for strong copyright provisions in FTAs, including extending copyright terms and prohibiting removal of copyright information. There are divergent views on copyright enforcement and the Internet, with ISPs and content providers having different perspectives. The US proposed limitations on copyrights consistent with the \"three-step test\". The proposal for copyright enforcement in FTAs includes exceptions that align with domestic copyright laws, do not conflict with normal exploitation of works, and do not unreasonably prejudice rights holders. The United States supports criminal penalties for trademark infringement, counterfeiting, and copyright piracy on a commercial scale, including file sharing and cam-cording in movie theaters. Some countries aim to replace U.S. text on criminal enforcement with that of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The U.S. proposal for the TPP, similar to ACTA, includes stricter criminal enforcement measures for intellectual property rights (IPR) than the WTO TRIPS Agreement. However, ACTA offers more flexibility in IPR enforcement compared to U.S. proposals. The scope of patentability is a key issue in the negotiations, with the U.S. seeking the ability to patent a wider range of inventions in the TPP. The United States is pushing for broader patentability in the TPP negotiations, including the ability to patent plants, animals, and new forms of existing products without enhanced efficacy. This has raised concerns about \"evergreening\" and access to medicines, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. is negotiating broader patentability in the TPP, focusing on patent provisions for medicines. U.S. negotiators are considering a balance between patent protections and access to medicines, building on the May 10th Agreement. The TPP proposal offers developing countries options on patent protections, following the U.S. Peru FTA model. This includes optional patent term extensions, patent linkages, and data exclusivity for five years after marketing approval. The TPP proposal offers developing countries options on patent protections, with eligibility based on economic indicators like per capita GNI. Developing countries may have the option to phase in compliance with obligations, but consensus is lacking on whether to include these provisions at all. The United States is seeking to negotiate side letters with partner countries in the TPP agreement to address key IPR issues. They also support pre-grant opposition procedures and propose a 12-year data exclusivity period for biologics. Biotechnology groups argue that biologics, unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, require longer exclusivity periods for commercial viability. The U.S. grants a 12-year exclusivity period for biologics under the Affordable Care Act. The USTR aims to base trade proposals on existing U.S. law, seeking to define the scope of biologic medicines and improve protections for trade secrets in trade negotiations. The 2014 Special 301 report highlighted the challenge of protecting U.S. trade secrets, especially against cybertheft. U.S. businesses are concerned about governments pressuring them to reveal trade secrets or transfer technology. One objective in TPP negotiations is to establish criminal penalties for trade secret theft. Other TPP chapters may address issues related to trade secrets, such as prohibiting countries from conditioning market access on technology transfer. The curr_chunk discusses various practices related to intellectual property rights (IPR) in the TPP negotiations, including seeking concessional terms for acquiring IPR, promoting local standards, and preventing disclosure of confidential business information. Malaysia also proposed preventing the disclosure of proprietary formulas for food products. Rules of origin (ROO) are being considered to define goods eligible for preferential treatment under the agreement. The TPP participants are discussing a single rule of origin that is objective, transparent, and predictable. Inputs from any TPP country can be combined to claim origin within the TPP region for preferential treatment. Textiles and apparel have been a contentious issue, especially regarding the \"yarn forward\" rule used by the United States in previous FTAs. The TPP participants are discussing rules of origin for preferential treatment in the textile industry. The U.S. textile industry advocates for a strict \"yarn forward rule,\" while some TPP countries, like Vietnam, prefer a more flexible \"cut and sew\" rule. Negotiations are ongoing for compromise positions, including short-supply provisions for non-originating inputs in apparel assembly. The TPP participants are discussing rules of origin for preferential treatment in the textile industry. Some countries advocate for a strict \"yarn forward rule,\" while others prefer a more flexible approach. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) are standards and regulations that may discriminate against imports, and WTO members must adhere to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. The TBT Agreement establishes rules for member countries to follow regarding voluntary standards, technical regulations, and assessment procedures. It ensures non-discriminatory application of standards, transparency in regulations, and recognition of equivalent domestic regulations of trading partners. WTO members have a central point of inquiry for information on standards and regulations. The U.S. FTAs, like the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS), build on the TBT Agreement by allowing partner countries to comment on standards and regulations. TPP negotiators aim to use KORUS as a model for developing TBT provisions, including sector-specific commitments. The debate over access to medicines in TPP negotiations goes beyond pharmaceutical patents, involving national formularies that prioritize generic drugs for cost containment. The industry is concerned about national healthcare programs like New Zealand's PHARMAC, which they believe disadvantage innovative pharmaceutical products, often from the United States. Negotiations with Australia led to transparency mechanisms for U.S. manufacturers. New Zealand is reluctant to change PHARMAC without reciprocal concessions from the U.S. on drug pricing programs like Medicaid. The United States has modified its position on appealing adverse decisions on listing new drugs and drug pricing in the TPP. USTR reassures that TPP proposals will not weaken healthcare programs like Medicaid. Foreign investment is a priority in FTA negotiations, focusing on establishment rights for foreign providers. Discussions include treatment of foreign investment, expropriation rules, and payment transfers. The current text chunk discusses provisions in U.S. free trade agreements related to foreign investor protections, dispute settlement procedures, and prohibitions on performance requirements. One contentious issue is whether to include investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions, which allow foreign investors to seek arbitration against host governments. The U.S. has typically included ISDS provisions in its FTAs, except for the one with Australia. These provisions aim to protect foreign investors from potential challenges in domestic judicial systems, particularly in developing countries. Critics argue that investor-state procedures in U.S. free trade agreements give foreign investors more protection than domestic investors and infringe on host government sovereignty. Provisions in the KORUS FTA state that regulatory actions for public welfare objectives do not constitute indirect expropriation. However, the threat of investor-state suits may deter nations from implementing such regulations. Australia has opposed including an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in FTAs. Australia's opposition to ISDS may have stemmed from a case involving Philip Morris International using an investor-state provision to challenge plain packaging laws. However, Australia's stance has evolved under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government, now considering ISDS provisions on a case-by-case basis in FTAs. For example, Australia included ISDS provisions in its FTA with South Korea but not in its FTA with Japan, both signed in 2014. The issue of governments imposing controls on capital outflows during financial crises has raised concerns in US FTAs. Previous agreements call for free flow of capital but allow for exceptions in times of balance of payments problems. Some Members of Congress worry that FTAs may limit government discretion. The IMF has suggested short-term capital controls could help mitigate the effects of financial crises. Short-term capital controls in US FTAs aim to address capital volatility during economic instability. These agreements also involve cooperation on enforcing competition laws to prevent market dominance and trade distortions. Partner countries must inform individuals subject to antitrust laws of related hearings and allow them to present their case. Monopolies and state-enterprises are required to operate in compliance with competition laws. The TPP partners are discussing a chapter on competition policy to promote a competitive business environment, protect consumers, and ensure a level playing field for TPP companies. Provisions on competition policy will be critical in dealing with state-owned enterprises, addressing issues concerning their financing, regulation, and transparency to prevent unfair competitive advantages. Trade remedies are measures to help domestic industries affected by imports. They include antidumping remedies, countervailing duty remedies, and safeguard actions. These actions are meant to provide relief from unfair trade practices and are sanctioned by the WTO if done fairly. The United States insists on retaining the right to use trade remedies to counter unfair practices and import surges, as reflected in existing U.S. FTAs. TPP participants are discussing including provisions for transparent trade remedy investigations and actions. Worker rights are a controversial issue in TPP negotiations, with concerns about promoting collective bargaining to avoid low labor standards. The November 2011 TPP framework for negotiations includes a separate labor chapter with commitments on labor rights protection and cooperation. Worker rights provisions in U.S. trade agreements have evolved over time, with NAFTA including labor provisions in a side letter. The November 2011 TPP framework for negotiations includes a separate labor chapter with commitments on labor rights protection and cooperation. Worker rights provisions in U.S. trade agreements have evolved over time, with NAFTA including labor provisions in a side letter requiring all Parties to enforce their own labor standards. The provisions are enforced under a special dispute settlement procedure attached to, but outside of, the main agreement. More recently, under the May 10th Agreement, internationally-recognized labor principles were included in FTAs with Peru, Panama, South Korea, and Colombia. The agreement stipulated that the four FTAs would require each of the Parties to adopt and maintain five internationally-recognized worker rights. The United States is pursuing provisions in the TPP to prevent countries from waiving or derogating labor standards to attract trade and investment. Some Members of Congress have concerns about expanding labor obligations, fearing potential unwarranted litigation and trade sanctions. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) TPA legislation introduced in January 2014 includes labor negotiating objectives consistent with the May 10th Agreement provisions. Worker rights may be controversial among TPP partners, with Vietnam and Brunei opposing binding dispute settlement procedures for worker rights provisions. Canada's approach at the Lima Round in 2013 is modeled after its Canada-Panama labor cooperation agreement, which does not allow for the suspension of trade concessions as a resolution to a labor-related dispute. The United States is negotiating a labor action plan (LAP) with Vietnam, similar to the one negotiated with Colombia. The plan includes benchmarks to address labor law weaknesses and protect worker rights. House Democrats have requested LAPs with Brunei, Malaysia, and Mexico. Dispute settlement panels may mandate action plans with a $15 million penalty for non-compliance. The United States is negotiating labor action plans (LAPs) with Vietnam, Colombia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Mexico. Environmental provisions in U.S. FTAs have evolved over time, with the May 10th Agreement adding obligations to adhere to multilateral environmental agreements and access full dispute settlement provisions. USTR has pushed for the incorporation of the May 10th Agreement and long-standing provisions in TPP environmental talks. The U.S. seeks commitments on worker rights and environmental protection in trade agreements. The U.S. is pushing for environmental commitments in trade agreements, including enforcing domestic laws, combating wildlife trafficking, and ensuring stakeholder participation. The inclusion of binding dispute settlement provisions in the environmental chapter of the TPP has sparked controversy among member countries. The leaked environmental chapter from January 2014, prepared by Canada, includes a special dispute resolution process and affirms each party's intention to implement MEAs. This diverges from reported U.S. positions in the TPP talks. U.S. negotiators are pushing for stronger environmental provisions with enforcement processes, including recourse to trade sanctions. Despite facing opposition, they are pressing harder, not retreating. The leaked document from February 2014 suggests that the United States is seeking to change language on trade and climate change in the TPP agreement. The framework from November 2011 includes provisions for trade in goods and services through electronic means, addressing obstacles such as customs duties and consumer protection to promote the free flow of information in the global economy. The U.S. is pushing for e-commerce provisions in trade agreements like the U.S.-South Korea FTA and TPP to ensure equal protections for digital products and free flow of information. This includes prohibiting customs duties on digital products and blocking cross-border data flows. U.S. high technology groups support unfettered cross-border data flows and oppose localization requirements for Internet-based services and cloud-computing. TPP partners like Australia and New Zealand have privacy concerns regarding prohibitions on local data storage conflicting with national privacy laws. Vietnam and Malaysia have local content restrictions for mercantile or censorship reasons. The U.S. FTAs include provisions for customs valuation and trade facilitation to ease the passage of goods over borders and reduce transaction costs. These provisions have become more important with the increase in global supply chains. The United States seeks efficiencies and cooperation in this chapter, focusing on common rules of origin and commitments for quick release of goods. Negotiations for local content restrictions are being conducted separately. The United States seeks commitments for quick release of goods, expedited express shipments, advanced tariff rulings, electronic customs processing, and risk-based inspections in the TPP. It also aims to prevent smuggling, transshipment, and duty evasion. The TPP includes disciplines on new activities like regulatory coherence, supply chain competitiveness, and support for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The TPP negotiations include new cross-cutting trade issues such as regulatory coherence to ease trade conditions and costs between countries while affirming their rights to regulate economies. The initiative aims to improve regulatory practices, eliminate barriers, reduce standards divergence, promote transparency, and enhance cooperation on regulatory issues. The TPP negotiations aim to improve regulatory practices, eliminate barriers, reduce standards divergence, promote transparency, and enhance cooperation on regulatory issues, including establishing domestic regulatory structures similar to the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Regulatory impact assessments would be conducted to assess the need for regulations, conduct cost-benefit analysis, and assess alternatives. The draft recommends establishing a regulatory coherence committee among TPP members to ensure transparency and openness in the rule-making process. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) may receive advantages from governments, hindering competition and market access. This concern has shaped texts by the United States regarding SOEs. In the context of TPP negotiations, the presence of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore is a concern. The TPP agreement could set a precedent for future trade agreements, including addressing fair competition and SOEs. Existing U.S. FTAs like NAFTA and agreements with Australia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and South Korea have provisions on SOEs, emphasizing national treatment, nondiscrimination, and transparency while allowing countries to maintain SOEs. The TPP agreement may include provisions on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to ensure they operate on a commercial basis and achieve competitive neutrality with private sector companies. The U.S.-Singapore FTA has extensive SOE provisions, but they mainly apply to Singapore. The form of these provisions in the TPP remains uncertain, with potential enforcement based on a harm test similar to the WTO subsidies agreement. Competitive neutrality aims to prevent SOEs from receiving competitive advantages over private companies. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in the TPP may not receive competitive advantages beyond private sector companies. The U.S. position on SOEs aims to balance defensive and offensive interests, with some suggesting existing regulations are sufficient while others advocate for additional provisions for transparency. The U.S. first proposed its SOE regulations in late 2011. The United States and Australia proposed State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) regulations in the TPP. Negotiations are ongoing regarding exceptions for SOEs, with some countries like Vietnam seeking significant exemptions. SOEs operate in all TPP countries, and efforts are being made to craft disciplines that allow for their proper operations. Trade in intermediate goods is a crucial part of international trade, accounting for over half of nonfuel merchandise traded in 2009. The supply chain in international trade involves goods passing through multiple borders, including U.S. imports from China with components sourced globally. The TPP will address supply chain issues in a separate chapter and other related chapters. Business groups urge negotiators to consider factors affecting the flow of goods. The TPP negotiations consider various factors affecting the flow of goods in global supply chains, such as harmonization of standards, infrastructure, rules of origin, and customs efficiency. Balancing competitive supply chains with strong rules of origin is a challenge, especially for supply chains incorporating goods from outside TPP countries. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a significant role in international trade, accounting for the majority of firms involved but a smaller share of trade value. They also contribute to the supply chain of larger products for export and employ half of the U.S. nonfarm private sector workforce. Small businesses create more jobs than large businesses, often due to their age. Government efforts aim to improve SME access to international markets, with a focus on FTAs and trading agreements. The proposed TPP agreement includes a chapter on SMEs to enhance their exporting capacity. The TPP agreement includes a chapter focusing on SMEs' capacity to benefit from enhanced trading opportunities. The negotiations on the SME chapter were concluded in May 2012, with provisions related to dispute settlement and governance. The agreement aims to address informational challenges SMEs face, such as access to foreign country tariff schedules and regulations affecting imports. The proposed TPP agreement may establish formal procedures for new members to join. The existence of a secretariat for the agreement is being considered. U.S. FTAs have had minimal structures, including a commission overseeing implementation, dispute resolution, and committee work. Regular meetings are held, with special sessions upon request. Specific issue committees are often created, such as KORUS's committees on outward processing. The KORUS agreement has committees on outward processing zones and fisheries, but lacks a standing secretariat. The P-4 agreement also lacks a secretariat, with New Zealand serving as a document repository. Other organizations in the Asia-Pacific region, like ASEAN and APEC, have secretariats that engage in trade capacity building and technical assistance. The need for a formal secretariat in the TPP agreement is debated, given the number of participants. Previous U.S. FTAs and the P-4 agreement provide dispute resolution options. Dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements involve consultation, joint committee meetings, and establishment of a dispute settlement panel. Panels typically consist of three arbiters, with each party appointing one and the third chosen by mutual consent or by lot. The unsuccessful party is expected to remedy the issue after the panel's decision. Dispute settlement in trade agreements involves remedies such as compensation, suspension of benefits, or fines for non-compliance. State-State dispute resolution under U.S. FTAs has been infrequent, but with new agreements like the TPP, existing models may need to be reevaluated. The scope of dispute settlement, especially regarding labor and environmental provisions, remains a contentious issue. The TPP is a \"living agreement\" open to new members and issues. New members are added informally with consensus, requiring a genuine willingness to negotiate and commit to the agreement's standards. This process involves months of bilateral consultations. The TPP is open to new members through months of bilateral consultations on key issues. Concerns about Canada's supply management system and modernizing copyright laws were addressed for entry into the talks. Japan made commitments in its beef, auto, and insurance sectors to join the negotiations. The focus has been on APEC countries, with potential for expansion. Potential candidates for joining the TPP include countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Colombia, and Costa Rica. While no new members are expected to join the negotiations at this stage, countries like South Korea may accede later to the final agreement. The accession process raises questions about when a country can join the TPP. The accession process for joining the TPP raises questions about whether countries should have input on existing agreements. Differences exist among participants on how the TPP will harmonize trade rules, with a focus on establishing a single set of TPP rules of origin. The United States and other TPP participants are pursuing different approaches to developing a TPP tariff schedule. While the US is negotiating market access bilaterally with certain countries, others are seeking plurilateral market access schedules. Despite these differences, they have agreed to develop a single TPP tariff schedule to facilitate trade, although some participants may seek to reopen market access provisions of prior FTAs. For example, Australia is looking for better market access for its sugar in the US. Congress may use TPA to express its views on the TPP architecture. Congress has shown a strong interest in the TPP negotiations since 2008, holding hearings and expressing views through letters and consultations. Key issues for Congress include whether the US can achieve a comprehensive agreement and the challenges of negotiating with a diverse group of countries. The TPP negotiations are the most comprehensive agreement undertaken by the United States, aiming to provide a structure for trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Members of Congress have differing views on countries to include and high standards in areas like worker rights and intellectual property. Some are interested in broadening negotiations to include exchange rates. The TPP negotiations involve differences on the meaning of \"high-standard\" among negotiating partners, which may lead to a debate in Congress. Any trade agreement with TPP partners must be approved by Congress through implementing legislation. The Obama Administration has proceeded with negotiations despite the expiration of the latest Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in 2007. The Obama Administration has been consulting Members and congressional staff for the TPP negotiations, but Congress has yet to formally weigh in on negotiating objectives for the expired Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). These objectives typically include reducing trade barriers, protecting intellectual property rights, and ensuring environmental and worker rights. Congress has revised and expanded these objectives over the years to adapt to evolving policy issues and the complexity of the global trading system. In renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), Congress may need to establish new negotiating objectives to address modern trade policy issues such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory coherence, digital technology, and green technologies. The objectives should be flexible to allow for a \"living agreement\" that can adapt to changes in the international trading system. Timing of TPA could impact negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), as partners may require assurance of credible U.S. commitments that cannot be amended by Congress. Some officials from TPP partner countries have emphasized the importance of TPA for concluding the agreement. Some officials from TPA partner countries believe TPA is crucial for concluding TPP negotiations. Members of Congress, like Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Levin, have differing views on the timing and importance of TPA. President Obama requested TPA reauthorization in 2013 and 2015. Legislation for TPA was introduced in the 113th Congress but not considered. The President reiterated his request for TPA in his January 2015 State of the Union address to the new Congress. Chairman Ryan and Chairman Hatch have both announced TPA as a top legislative priority in the 114th Congress. Congress may consider the institutional structure, expansion, and terms of a future TPP agreement. This includes attracting new members, negotiating new content, and the manner of approving new members. Congress may also consider the possibility of a Secretariat for the TPP if concluded. The TPP, if concluded, may have a Secretariat for continuing negotiations and could shape future multilateral trade liberalization. TPP offers an opportunity for countries to break new ground on issues not negotiated at the multilateral level. Past FTAs like NAFTA incorporated new trade policy ideas, pushing the Uruguay Round to conclusion. The approval of a high-standard TPP agreement could show the WTO that trade liberalization can proceed without them. The world trading system has changed since the 1990s, with developing countries like Brazil, India, and China now playing a more assertive role in the WTO. The TPP may attract more countries to negotiations as an alternative venue for trade liberalization. The U.S. pursuit of the TPP raises questions about its possible outcomes. The pursuit of the TPP and its potential impact on U.S. trade policy raises questions about its relation to the U.S.-EU FTA negotiations and the future of the WTO. Some argue that the TPP could signal the end of multilateral agreements in favor of regional pacts, while others see it as a building block for a more effective multilateral trade system. The TPP may become a leading force for trade liberalization in the future. The potential impact of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on U.S. trade policy is a significant consideration. If the TPP negotiations fail or are delayed indefinitely, it could lead to the U.S. having to adjust its trade ambitions. This outcome may also hinder the progress towards a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and potentially force the U.S. to step back from trade agreements altogether. The proposed agreement under consideration has significant policy implications for the United States, particularly in trade policy. It is ambitious in terms of size, scope, and flexibility, aiming to reduce barriers in goods, services, and agricultural trade. However, achieving such an agreement may be challenging due to differing opinions among negotiating partners. The TPP agreement faces challenges due to differing opinions among negotiating partners, especially regarding the form of provisions. Despite unresolved issues like market access, countries remain committed to achieving the ambitious agreement for economic growth and prosperity. The TPP agreement faces challenges due to differing opinions among negotiating partners, especially regarding provisions. The large network of existing FTAs among members indicates willingness to cooperate on trade issues, implying some challenging issues have been addressed."
