    "content": "The Act titled \"Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act\" emphasizes the importance of nuclear forensics in identifying the source of a nuclear weapon after interception or detonation. This is crucial in the event of a nuclear terrorist attack on American interests, as attribution of responsibility is paramount due to the lack of forensic evidence beyond radioactive material in the weapon. Advanced nuclear forensics techniques can aid in tracing the origin and pathway of the weapon or material, even before detonation. The field of pre-detonation and post-detonation nuclear forensics is underdeveloped, with challenges in identifying the source of nuclear or radiological material after an attack. Having a robust capability to acquire and analyze samples quickly is crucial for confidently identifying special nuclear material and preventing the transfer of such materials. Effective attribution could deter proliferators and improve security at material storage facilities. The timely acquisition and analysis of samples are crucial in nuclear forensics. The ability to gather atmospheric samples has diminished and needs to be restored. Pre-detonation forensics is an undeveloped field, and the effects of radiation on traditional forensics techniques are unknown. Radiochemistry plays a significant role in post-detonation scenarios. The number of radiochemistry programs and experts in the US has declined, posing a challenge to nuclear forensics. Comparing samples against known materials from various sources worldwide is crucial for analysis. Samples are available to the International Atomic Energy Agency through safeguards agreements. The Congress emphasizes the need for international agreements to establish a framework for identifying the source of confiscated nuclear material. International cooperation is crucial to catalog all existing sources of nuclear material for effective deterrence against potential traffickers. The text chunk discusses the responsibilities of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, including developing protocols for data exchange related to nuclear or radiological materials and identifying the source of a nuclear detonation. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is amending subsection (a) to lead the development of a national strategic five-year plan for improving nuclear forensic capabilities and to establish the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center for centralized stewardship of all Federal nuclear forensics activities. The National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program aims to establish a pathway for academic study in nuclear and geochemical science specialties relevant to technical nuclear forensics, including radiochemistry, nuclear physics, and materials science. The program offers undergraduate scholarships lasting up to 4 years, including a summer internship at a national laboratory. It also provides doctoral fellowships lasting up to 5 years. The program offers undergraduate scholarships lasting up to 4 years, including a summer internship at a national laboratory. It also provides doctoral fellowships lasting up to 5 years, with requirements for post-doctoral positions in technical nuclear forensics-related specialties. The program offers scholarships and fellowships to faculty and students for 3 to 5 years, emphasizing technical nuclear forensics programs and encouraging participation from diverse institutions. Selection of individuals for scholarships and fellowships is included in the program. The program offers scholarships and fellowships for academic merit and nuclear forensics needs. Up to 10% of awards can go to Federal employees for education in critical nuclear forensics areas. The Secretary can make agreements with higher education institutions for scholarship funds. The scholarship under this section covers tuition, fees, and authorized expenses paid directly to the institution. Recipients must maintain satisfactory academic progress and adhere to specific requirements. A scholarship recipient must maintain academic standing and adhere to disciplinary rules. Failure to do so may result in repayment of scholarship funds to the United States within a year, with a possible extension granted by the Secretary. A scholarship recipient failing to fulfill post-doctoral service requirements in nuclear forensics specialty at a national laboratory or Federal agency is liable to repay the United States. The scholarship recipient must report the total amount received and interest payable if the scholarship was a loan. An annual report to Congress on program activities is required. Definitions for Alaska Native-serving institution and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for different types of minority-serving institutions, including Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institution, Hawaiian native-serving institution, Hispanic-serving institution, and historically Black college or university. The curr_chunk discusses the Joint Interagency Annual Reporting Requirement to Congress and the President, specifically amending Section 1907(a)(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. It includes details about the Director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and relevant departments partnering in the National Technical Forensics Center. The National Technical Forensics Center is required to assess each office's activities in nuclear forensics, include the strategic five-year plan, and report on new agreements and efforts. The National Technical Forensics Center assesses activities in nuclear forensics, including the strategic five-year plan and new agreements and efforts in support of nuclear forensics and attribution activities. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
