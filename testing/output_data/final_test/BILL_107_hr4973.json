The Congress finds that elected legislatures are crucial for democratic governments to be accountable to citizens. Legislative staff with expertise are necessary for drafting effective legislation and overseeing government policies. Emerging democracies struggle to reform institutions and develop wise laws. The United States aims to promote sound lawmaking and government accountability in countries with political, economic, and security ties. Professional legislative staff trained in public policy and national security are crucial for developing effective legislation and overseeing government operations. Professional legislative staff trained in public policy and national security play a vital role in promoting democracy and fostering open discussions on political, economic, and social issues among political leaders and citizens. These staff members, even after leaving their legislative roles, continue to contribute to their nation's civil service, defense establishments, or political systems, further advancing democracy and promoting the national interest of the United States abroad. Establishment of International Legislative Staff Training Program. The Secretary of State will establish a program to professionalize legislative staff from foreign bodies. The program will bring staff to the US for seminars on legislative work techniques and practices, including observing the US Congress. Activities will cover the role of a legislature in a democratic system, executive-legislative relations, and the role of constituents and lobbyists. The program for professionalizing legislative staff from foreign bodies includes seminars on legislative work techniques, observing the US Congress, and meetings with experts and congressional staff to discuss executive-legislative relations, policy issues, and the role of stakeholders in the legislative process. The program for professionalizing legislative staff from foreign bodies includes seminars on legislative work techniques, observing the US Congress, and meetings with experts and congressional staff to discuss executive-legislative relations, policy issues, and the role of stakeholders in the legislative process. Participants are selected from countries with free and fair elections. The Secretary of State prioritizes individuals from countries with inexperienced legislative staff and democratic institutions for a program focusing on public policy, international affairs, defense, and budgetary matters. Participants must come from countries with free and fair elections and not be state sponsors of terrorism. The Secretary of State administers the program through the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Contracts can be entered into with private or nonprofit organizations without competitive procedures for the fostering of democratic institutions. The term \"elections that are generally regarded as having been free and fair\" is defined in this section.
