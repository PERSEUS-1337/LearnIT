    "content": "The federal government does not have its own juvenile justice system but influences state systems through grant programs. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, passed in 1974 and reauthorized in 2002, guides these programs administered by the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) was enacted in 1974 and reauthorized in 2002. It established federal institutions to coordinate juvenile justice efforts, grant programs for states, and core mandates for grant eligibility. Despite amendments, the act maintains these components and remains a key source of federal funding for juvenile justice. Other programs administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention also contribute to federal funding. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) established federal grant programs for states to improve juvenile delinquency programs and justice systems. Funding is allocated based on the population under 18, with core mandates for eligibility. Despite authorization expiration in FY2007, Congress continues to provide appropriations. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program replaced smaller grant programs in the 2002 JJDPA. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program, established in the 2002 JJDPA reauthorization, replaced smaller grant programs. Funding is allocated based on the population under 18, with grants provided to state, local, tribal governments, and private entities for programs to prevent juvenile delinquency. Despite authorization expiration in FY2007, Congress continues to provide appropriations for this program. The Challenge Grants and Gang-Free Schools and Communities Grant programs were repealed in 2002 but have continued to receive appropriations each fiscal year. These grants support mentoring programs and gang resistance education and training projects. Funding for prevention and accountability-based gang projects is included in appropriations for the Title V program. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to make grants for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles in contact with the justice system. Funding for child abuse prevention and court reforms is also provided. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) program, created by the FY1998 DOJ Appropriations Act, authorizes grants to strengthen juvenile justice systems and promote accountability. Administered by OJJDP, the program expired in FY2009 but received appropriations through FY2013. The juvenile justice appropriation includes funding for various grant programs administered by OJJDP, such as the JABG program and the Victims of Child Abuse Act grant. Funding for juvenile justice programs saw fluctuations, with a peak of $565 million in FY2002, a decrease to $348 million by FY2007, and an increase to $384 million in FY2008. The JABG program saw a significant reduction in funding from $250 million in FY2002 to $49 million in FY2007. Funding for juvenile justice programs increased by about 10% from FY2007 to $384 million, then rose to $424 million in FY2010. However, funding began to decline from FY2011 to FY2015. In FY2011, $275 million was provided for DOJ's juvenile justice programs, with $199 million for JJDPA programs. In FY2012, $262.5 million was allocated for juvenile justice programs, including $138 million for JJDPA programs. In FY2013, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provided $279.5 million for juvenile justice programs, with funding decreasing to nearly $261.0 million after rescissions and sequestration. Funding for juvenile justice continued to decline in FY2014. In FY2014, juvenile justice funding continued to decline with Congress appropriating $254.5 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). JABG funding was eliminated in FY2014. Funding dropped again in FY2015 to $251.5 million through the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235). However, in FY2016, Congress increased juvenile justice funding to nearly $270.2 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), with most programs seeing an increase in funding levels. Specific funding was added to support improvements in juvenile indigent defense. For detailed juvenile justice programs account information, refer to Table 1. Table 1 summarizes juvenile justice appropriations by program, which have varied over the years. The 21st Century Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2002 consolidated grant programs, but the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant Program has not been funded. Instead, funding has been allocated to pre-existing grant programs like Victims of Child Abuse and Juvenile Mentoring Programs. Specific program appropriations fluctuate annually. Some programs receive varying appropriations annually, like the Community Based Violence Prevention Initiative and the National Forum on Youth Violence Prevention. The OJJDP's Tribal Youth Program has consistently received funding from the Title V grant program since FY1999."
