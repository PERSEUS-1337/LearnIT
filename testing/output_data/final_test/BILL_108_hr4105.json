Congress finds that the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides immediate, confidential assistance to over 500 individuals daily, with bilingual staff and access to translators in 150 languages. The hotline connects callers with over 5,000 shelters and service providers in the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands for crisis intervention. The National Domestic Violence Hotline in Austin, Texas, received its first call in 1996 and reached its one millionth call in 2003. Approximately 60% of callers use the hotline as their first step in addressing domestic violence. Call volume increased by 27% between 2000 and 2003, with 26,000 calls going unanswered in 2002 due to high demand. The Department of Justice reported over 18,000 acts of violence by intimate partners in the United States. An average of 3 women are murdered every day in the United States by their intimate partners. Improving technology infrastructure at the National Domestic Violence Hotline and forming partnerships between the public and private sectors can enhance the hotline's ability to handle more calls efficiently.
