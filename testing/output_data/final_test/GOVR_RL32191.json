    "content": "High prescription drug prices have led consumers to seek cheaper medications abroad through commercial or personal imports. Congressional legislators are exploring legislative solutions to address rising drug costs, including modifying existing laws to allow FDA-approved importation of prescription drugs. Recent legislation has prohibited restrictions on prescription drug importation. The Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, prohibited U.S. Customs and Border Protection from using funds to prevent individuals from carrying a 90-day supply of Canadian prescription drugs that comply with the FFDCA. However, most Canadian drugs do not meet FFDCA requirements, making the provisions ineffective in changing the law on importing prescription drugs. Policymakers are divided on allowing drug importation due to consumer safety concerns. Critics argue that the FDA lacks resources to ensure safety of imported drugs, which may be mishandled, mislabeled, or counterfeited. Concerns also exist about FDA's ability to inspect increasing imports. Opponents fear importation would hinder new drug research, while proponents believe it would lower prices for consumers with proper precautions. Proponents of drug importation argue that safety concerns are exaggerated and could be addressed with additional precautions. They believe that U.S. consumers should not bear the burden of subsidizing research and development costs, and that allowing imports would lead to lower drug prices through increased competition. Studies comparing U.S. and Canadian drug prices show mixed results, with some finding higher prices in the U.S. due to factors like the selection of drugs for comparison and the consideration of cheaper U.S. generic drugs. The impact of drug imports on prices remains a topic of debate. The debate over drug importation revolves around its potential impact on drug prices. Supporters believe allowing imports would lower prices through increased competition, while opponents argue that prices could rise due to increased demand and limited supplies. A study by the Congressional Budget Office suggests that the reduction in drug spending from importation would be minimal, partly due to new safety costs and potential alterations by manufacturers. Implementing a safe drug importation program could cost at least $100 million, with estimates rising to several hundred million dollars. Several congressional legislators have introduced bills to address concerns about prescription drug imports, with potential costs rising to several hundred million dollars. Current regulation of prescription drug importation involves federal laws under the FDA, prohibiting importation by anyone other than the manufacturer. The FDA enforces federal laws prohibiting the importation of prescription drugs by anyone other than the manufacturer. The DEA administers the Controlled Substances Act, regulating addictive substances. State boards of pharmacy and medical boards oversee pharmacy and medical practices, with laws varying by state. Foreign laws are not covered in this report. The FDA regulates prescription drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, governing safety and efficacy. The DEA and CBP have limited regulatory authority over prescription drugs. The FFDCA prohibits anyone other than the manufacturer from importing prescription drugs. The FFDCA prohibits the importation of prescription drugs by anyone other than the manufacturer, affecting drugs made in the US and foreign versions approved for domestic sale. The FDA's strict requirements make it difficult for foreign-made drugs to comply, leading to illegal status for non-FDA inspected drugs. The section also covers importation of US-manufactured drugs, seizure of mail order prescriptions, penalties under the FFDCA, FDA's importation procedures, state plans for drug importation, and businesses facilitating drug importation. The FFDCA prohibits anyone other than the manufacturer from importing prescription drugs into the US, including drugs made domestically or abroad. Critics argue against this restriction, but the FDA maintains its stance. The FDA cannot guarantee the safety of prescription drugs once they leave the country. Congress adopted importation amendments in 2000 to allow importation from Canada under certain safety precautions. In 2000, Congress adopted importation amendments to allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada under safety precautions. The Medicare Act of 2003 allows pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from Canada, with additional provisions for individuals to import for personal use under certain circumstances. The Medicare Act of 2003 allows importation of prescription drugs from Canada under safety precautions. However, the Secretary of HHS has not certified that importation would pose no risk to public health or reduce costs, so the ban on drug importation remains. The FDA maintains that importing drugs from foreign countries would likely violate other provisions of the act. The FDA states that Canadian or other foreign versions of U.S.-approved drugs are generally considered unapproved in the U.S. due to manufacturer-specific approvals and differences in product requirements. Importing prescription drugs from a Canadian pharmacy is likely to violate the Medicare Act, as most shipments do not meet U.S. approval standards. To comply with the FDA Act when shipping prescription drugs to the U.S., businesses must sell only FDA-approved drugs made outside the U.S. Consumers can check FDA's website for approved drug manufacturers. The FDA requires that prescription drugs imported into the U.S. must be FDA-approved and properly labeled. It is illegal to import prescription drugs without a valid U.S. prescription. Violations of the FDA Act, such as mislabeling or importing unapproved drugs, can result in penalties. The FDA and CBP found that a significant number of drug shipments from foreign countries violated the FFDCA due to containing unapproved drugs that could pose safety risks. These drugs were either not approved by the FDA, inadequately labeled, withdrawn from the U.S. market, could cause dangerous interactions, required monitoring by a doctor, or were controlled substances. For example, in February 2007, consumers who ordered prescription drugs online received products with the wrong active ingredients. The FDA investigation found that 43% of imported drugs intercepted from India, Israel, Costa Rica, and Vanuatu were falsely believed to be from Canadian pharmacies. Only 15% actually originated in Canada, with the rest manufactured in 27 different countries. Prior to November 17, 2005, CBP allowed prescription drug mail orders from Canada for up to 90 days. The CBP began strictly enforcing importation laws on November 17, 2005, after allowing prescription drug mail orders from Canada for up to 90 days. This policy change led to complaints from consumer groups and Canadian pharmacies, who believed it was intended to push seniors to enroll in the Medicare plan and reduce competition for costly prescription drugs. CBP officials denied this, stating the enforcement was to protect consumers from potentially dangerous drugs. Over the next eleven months, CBP confiscated and destroyed foreign prescription drugs in mail packages, with an estimated 37,000 to 40,000 packages detained. In response to the CBP's strict enforcement of importation laws on prescription drugs from Canada, Representative Emerson added a provision to the FY2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill prohibiting CBP from using funds to prevent importation of \"FDA-approved\" drugs. Critics argued that this provision could expose the US to harmful counterfeit drugs and terrorist exploitation, while Canadian pharmacist associations feared shortages in their country. The Senate Committee on Appropriations removed a provision from the Homeland Security appropriations bill that aimed to force the FDA to assess prescriptions from foreign countries for safety. However, Senators Vitter and Nelson introduced a funding prohibition for certain seizures of Canadian drug imports, which passed as an amendment. The provision allows individuals not in the business of importing prescription drugs to import FDA-compliant drugs from Canada. The provision allows individuals to import a personal-use quantity of prescription drugs from Canada that comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, excluding controlled substances and biological products. It permits transportation of a 90-day supply by foot or vehicle, but its impact is limited as it only applies to FDA-compliant drugs. The provision allows individuals to import a personal-use quantity of prescription drugs from Canada that comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Most drugs from Canada do not meet these requirements, making them illegal to import. Despite this provision, the majority of imported drugs from Canada will still not comply with the Act, allowing CBP to detain them legally. CBP announced a change in its enforcement policy, focusing on intercepting counterfeit medicines, narcotics, and illegal drugs. The FDA now determines the legality of international drug imports entering the US, with prescription drugs mostly illegal to import. FDA has the authority to seize adulterated or misbranded products, but its ability to handle confiscated imports is questioned due to resource shortages. Senators Grassley and Baucus attempted to modify the Homeland Security importation provision in December 2006. Members of Congress attempted to modify the Homeland Security importation provision to allow importation from Canada of prescription drugs with at least two generic competitors. They also tried to attach language to FDA funding in the agriculture appropriations bill to expand the types of persons who may import prescription drugs. The House FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill included a provision that was not included in the Senate bill. The House on August 2, 2007, \u00a7726 of H.R. 3161 stated that FDA funds cannot be used to prevent certain individuals from importing prescription drugs that meet FDA requirements. The White House expressed concerns about the difficulty of verifying FDA-approved prescription drugs at the border under H.R. 3161, which aimed to allow certain individuals to import prescription drugs meeting FDA requirements. The bill aimed to allow certain individuals to import prescription drugs meeting FDA requirements, but drug manufacturers may not have allowed non-importing individuals to do so. The provision in H.R. 3161 was not included in the FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill, limiting its effect. Stabenow cosponsored an amendment to the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill allowing individuals to import prescription drugs from Canada if they meet certain criteria, excluding controlled substances and biological products. The amendment to the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill allowed individuals to import Canadian prescription drugs that comply with certain FDA provisions, excluding narcotics and biologics. This amendment would have potentially allowed unlimited importations of drugs, but the requirement for compliance with FDA regulations limited its impact. The amendment to the FY2008 Homeland Security Appropriations bill allowed individuals to import Canadian prescription drugs that comply with certain FDA provisions, excluding narcotics and biologics. However, it is unlikely that prescription drugs manufactured for the Canadian market would meet the FDA requirements, making it illegal for most drugs imported from Canada to comply with the FFDCA. CBP would still have the authority to detain Canadian drug imports that did not meet the specified FDA regulations. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 did not include the amended provision allowing import of Canadian prescription drugs. The Department of Homeland Security proposed deleting the section due to concerns about drug affordability. Violations of the act's prohibitions carry criminal and civil penalties. Violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) carry penalties that vary depending on the offense. Misdemeanor offenses can result in up to a year in prison or a $1,000 fine. Felony offenses, such as repeat violations or intentional fraud, can lead to up to three years in prison or a $10,000 fine. Importation violations are even stricter, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison or $250,000 in fines for knowingly importing drugs illegally. Monetary fines can exceed specified amounts due to additional fines under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) can result in fines of up to $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for organizations for misdemeanor offenses, and up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for corporations for felony offenses. Federal courts can issue injunctions to stop violations, and adulterated or misbranded drugs can be seized. Aiding or abetting a violation of the act can also lead to criminal liability. Illegal importers of prescription drugs can face charges under the FFDCA and other federal criminal statutes, including mail or wire fraud. Businesses facilitating the importation of unapproved drugs may be liable for causing violations of the act. Penalties under the Controlled Substances Act may also apply to those importing controlled substances illegally. Despite the range of penalties available, the FDA has clarified its enforcement priorities. The FDA's enforcement priorities do not target consumers who import prescription drugs in violation of the FFDCA. The agency allows personal importation of certain illegal prescription drugs under specific circumstances through its personal importation procedures. This discretion permits consumers to import such drugs for personal use, recognizing the FDA's limited enforcement resources. The FDA may refrain from legal action against illegally imported drugs for personal use under specific circumstances, including unapproved use for serious conditions, no commercial promotion in the U.S., low risk, and affirmation of personal use by the patient with a U.S. licensed doctor's information provided. The FDA's personal importation procedures outline that importing unapproved prescription drugs into the U.S. is illegal, even if certain criteria are met. This does not apply to commercial shipments or foreign versions of drugs already approved in the U.S. Personal importation of cheaper versions of prescription drugs not approved in the U.S. does not align with FDA regulations. In the U.S., Canadian pharmacies supply drugs to two million people, about one percent of the market. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 allows importation of prescription drugs from Canada under certain conditions, including a 90-day supply and a valid prescription. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003 allows importation of prescription drugs from Canada under specific conditions, including a 90-day supply, a valid prescription, and approval by the Secretary. The new individual importation provisions differ from the FDA's personal importation procedures due to the certification requirement, which the current Secretary of HHS has not provided in the past. The FDA permits personal importation but it remains illegal. An elderly couple challenged the prohibition on personal importation in Andrews v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, but the court rejected their claim. The court determined that there is no fundamental right to purchase drugs from a preferred source. The court upheld the ban on personal importation of prescription drugs, stating that there is no fundamental right to purchase drugs from a preferred source at a preferred price. States and cities are exploring innovative methods to provide more affordable prescription drugs to their residents, even if it means violating federal law. Several states and the District of Columbia have online prescription drug importation programs, with some localities like Boston importing drugs from Canada. Interest in importing Canadian drugs may be decreasing due to factors like Medicare Part D, increased seizures by CBP, declining currency-exchange rates, and more use of generic drugs. Each state and local importation plan varies, with Illinois having a program called I-SaveRx. The state has established a drug importation program known as I-SaveRx, providing information on pharmacies in Canada, Ireland, and the UK. Kansas, Missouri, Vermont, and Wisconsin also participate in I-SaveRx. Rhode Island passed a law to license Canadian pharmacies, and other states are considering similar importation plans. Some states have petitioned the FDA to allow prescription drug importation pilot plans. The FDA's waiver provisions in the Medicare Act require certification by the Secretary for safe and cost-effective drug importation. Maine and Vermont have sought access to foreign prescription drugs through importation programs, with Vermont suing the FDA for denying their pilot program petition, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Vermont lawsuit against the FDA for denying their importation program petition was rejected by a federal court. The court ruled that the FDA did not act arbitrarily in denying the petition, as it asked for approval of an illegal program. The court also found that the certification provision in the Medicare Act for drug importation is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The FDA rejected Montgomery County's petition for a waiver to import prescription drugs from Canada, citing a previous case. Montgomery County filed a lawsuit alleging that the FDA's denial was arbitrary and violated the APA, arguing that the FDA allowed other jurisdictions to import drugs illegally but refused to assist those trying to import legally under a waiver program. The FDA's failure to act on illegal importation programs does not indicate a safety risk. The court dismissed the case, stating that the FDA's denial of a waiver request was not arbitrary or capricious. The court also noted that the Secretary of HHS has discretion in certifying importation programs. The court dismissed the case regarding the FDA's denial of a waiver request for importation programs. Despite state efforts, the FDA maintains importing unapproved prescription drugs is illegal and unsafe. FDA has informed states that importing drugs violates federal law. The FDA argues that importing drugs from Canada or any foreign country violates the FFDCA due to statutory prohibitions on non-manufacturer imports and non-compliance with approval, labeling, and dispensing requirements. The agency considers all imports of prescription drugs to be illegal, regardless of the importer. The FDA argues that importing drugs from Canada or any foreign country violates the FFDCA due to statutory prohibitions on non-manufacturer imports and non-compliance with approval, labeling, and dispensing requirements. The agency considers all imports of prescription drugs to be illegal, regardless of the importer, and warns states that legislation authorizing prescription drug imports would be preempted by federal law. The FDA also cautions states about potential lawsuits for injuries to consumers who purchase unapproved drugs based on state endorsement. The FDA warns against importing prescription drugs from Canada or any foreign country, stating that it violates the FFDCA. Despite this, the agency is currently not taking legal action against state and local governments with drug importation programs. For example, the FDA did not take enforcement action against Minnesota for providing information on accessing cheaper drugs from Canada. Similarly, the FDA is unlikely to sue Illinois for importing drugs from Canada and certain European countries. The FDA is not currently suing states or localities for importing drugs from Canada. The agency may be waiting for a state to actually purchase foreign drugs before taking legal action. The FDA has not pursued cities importing drugs due to their small size. Previously, the FDA wanted to win a case against Rx Depot before taking action against states and local governments. The FDA has taken legal action against businesses that facilitate the importation of unapproved prescription drugs, particularly those acting as middlemen between consumers and foreign pharmacies. This includes a case discussed in detail in the following section. In United States v. Rx Depot, the Department of Justice filed suit against a storefront operation that helped U.S. consumers obtain prescription drugs from Canada, alleging violations of the FFDCA. Rx Depot admitted to causing the shipment of unapproved prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies to U.S. citizens, while countering that the FDA's concerns were unfounded. The FDA raised concerns about Rx Depot's shipment of unapproved prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies to U.S. citizens. Critics argue that FDA's importation procedures protect drug manufacturers' profits over consumer interests. Despite arguments against FDA's stance, the district court ruled against Rx Depot in a preliminary decision. The district court issued a preliminary injunction against Rx Depot for importing prescription drugs, citing safety concerns due to lack of FDA oversight and potential contamination. The court issued a preliminary injunction against Rx Depot for importing prescription drugs with safety concerns related to FDA oversight and potential contamination. The drugs obtained from outside the U.S. may be contaminated, counterfeit, or have inconsistent active ingredients. Additionally, they may be stored improperly, leading to outdated or subpotent drugs. Despite high U.S. drug costs, the court emphasized the need for Congress to address the safety and cost balance. After the court issued a preliminary injunction, Rx Depot agreed to a consent decree with the FDA, admitting liability for importing unapproved drugs and agreeing to cease such activities. The legal battle continued with the U.S. seeking disgorgement of Rx Depot's profits, which was deemed appropriate to deter future violations of the FDCA. Despite this, many companies like Rx Depot are still in business, and some states have considered importation programs. Drug manufacturers are now limiting sales to Canadian pharmacies to prevent unauthorized distribution. Several major prescription drug manufacturers are limiting sales to Canadian pharmacies to prevent drugs from being resold in the U.S. at cheaper prices, raising questions about potential violations of federal antitrust laws. This move may be aimed at restricting Canadian distributors and pharmacies from selling excess supplies of prescription drugs to U.S. consumers at lower prices. Several major prescription drug manufacturers are limiting sales to Canadian pharmacies to prevent drugs from being resold in the U.S. at cheaper prices, raising questions about potential violations of federal antitrust laws. Members of Congress have introduced bills to address these sales tactics, and a federal court has ruled on antitrust allegations against drug manufacturers. Additionally, a state investigation is underway regarding potential violations by GlaxoSmithKline. This section discusses federal and state antitrust issues related to drug manufacturers limiting supply to Canadian distributors and pharmacies. Federal antitrust laws focus on market competitiveness, not specific programs or goals. It may be challenging to use existing laws to challenge pharmaceutical manufacturers limiting the supply of imported drugs. Current antitrust statutes do not typically prohibit market-oriented activities unless the entity is a monopolist. Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that restrain trade. The Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that restrain trade, focusing on market competitiveness rather than specific goals. Section 1 of the Act only applies to multiple parties engaged in concerted action, while Section 2 governs the conduct of a single firm and prohibits monopolization. The Sherman Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a71] prohibits unreasonable restraints of trade through contracts, combinations, or conspiracies between separate entities, not unilateral conduct. The Act allows businesses to freely choose who they deal with and under what circumstances. This principle remains unchanged even when patent or copyright laws are involved, unless fraud is proven. The Sherman Act prohibits unreasonable restraints of trade through contracts, combinations, or conspiracies between separate entities. The Act allows businesses to freely choose who they deal with and under what circumstances, unless fraud is proven. The Supreme Court has indicated that a formal contract may not be necessary to establish collective action required by antitrust laws. An antitrust violation may be found if an unlawful agreement can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. The standard for proving unlawful agreement is evidence that excludes the possibility of independent action and shows a conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective. The Court held that uniform business behavior can suggest concerted action but does not prove an unlawful agreement. Competitors accepting an invitation to participate in a plan that restrains interstate commerce can establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act. In Theatre Enterprises v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., the Court emphasized this point. The Court in Theatre Enterprises v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp. clarified that parallel behavior alone does not prove a conspiracy under the Sherman Act. Conscious parallelism may suggest agreement but does not conclusively establish it. Court decisions have shown that an unlawful agreement in restraint of trade can be proven by consciously parallel behavior accompanied by specific \"plus\" factors. However, there is no consensus on which factors hold evidentiary weight. Factors like artificial standardization of products and price increases during surplus have been viewed favorably, while mere communication between parties is seen as ambiguous evidence of conspiracy. Ultimately, the key factor is whether parties acted in their own self-interest. Based on court decisions, behavior consistent with maintaining profitability or staying in business does not prove conspiracy. If a defendant has no motive to conspire, their actions are considered independent. Without evidence of collusion, limiting drug supplies to Canada may not violate the Sherman Act. Manufacturers may have legitimate reasons such as limited production capacity or focusing on the US market. The first federal court case, In Re: Canadian Import Antitrust Litigation, involved consumers and organizations from Minnesota challenging American drug companies for violating antitrust laws by suppressing the importation of prescription drugs from Canada for personal use in the US. The district court ruled that importing prescription drugs from Canada for personal use in the US is illegal under the FFDCA, leading to the dismissal of the case. The appeals court upheld this decision, affirming that the importation of drugs from Canada is unlawful. The court ruled that importing prescription drugs from Canada is illegal and plaintiffs lacked standing under antitrust laws. The antitrust injury was not caused by defendants but by US government regulations. This decision may impact how antitrust issues are handled in courts, and drug manufacturers limiting sales to Canadian distributors may still violate state antitrust laws. The legal dispute between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the state of Minnesota serves as an example of potential liability under state antitrust statutes for drug manufacturers limiting sales to Canadian distributors and pharmacies. State antitrust laws vary in scope and enforcement across all fifty states and the District of Columbia. The legal dispute between the state of Minnesota and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) involves allegations of antitrust violations related to prescription drug importation. The Minnesota Attorney General filed a motion to compel GSK to release information from Canada and the UK regarding their decision to stop selling drugs to Canadian pharmacies that sell to US consumers. GSK argued that importing drugs from Canada is illegal and federal law preempts Minnesota's antitrust laws. The district court of Hennepin County, Minnesota ordered GSK to produce records and information sought by the AG, despite GSK's argument that importing drugs from Canada is illegal and federal law preempts Minnesota's antitrust laws. The court ruled that enforcement of federal law is the responsibility of the FDA, not GSK, and found sufficient authority for the Minnesota AG's investigation under state statute. The Minnesota Attorney General filed a lawsuit against GSK in 2004 for violating state antitrust laws. GSK and the AG are in a legal battle over the public release of documents. The Minnesota Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court to decide on the disclosure of the documents. Minnesota's case against GSK may have been affected by a federal court decision on drug importation antitrust. The feasibility of prescription drug importation may be impacted by international trade obligations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Legislative proposals on importation could conflict with international trade agreements, potentially hindering the process. The WTO Agreement contains exceptions that may justify inconsistencies in trade agreements. GATT 1994 Articles III:4, I:1, and XI:1 affect prescription drug imports, requiring national treatment for imported products. National treatment prohibits discrimination against imported goods compared to domestic products. The WTO Agreement requires national treatment for imported products, prohibiting discrimination against them compared to domestic goods. The most-favored-nation clause extends this obligation to internal regulatory measures affecting prescription drug trade in the United States. The broad interpretation of Article III of the WTO Agreement suggests that any proposals affecting the labeling or destination of imported prescription drugs may conflict with national treatment and most-favored-nation obligations. Article XI:1 of the GATT prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports from other countries, requiring non-discriminatory treatment. Measures that prevent importation or affect the right of importation are covered, with restrictions needing to apply equally to all like products from third countries. The GATT prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports from other countries under Article XI:1, requiring non-discriminatory treatment. Legislative or regulatory proposals that restrict importation of prescription drugs may be challenged under Article XI:1. Article XX of the GATT provides general exceptions for measures that fulfill public policy objectives without unjustifiable discrimination or disguised restrictions on trade. Specifically, Article XX(b) exempts measures related to prescription drugs. Article XX(b) exempts measures related to prescription drugs, and a three-part test must be applied to determine eligibility for this exception. The country invoking the exception must demonstrate that any GATT/WTO inconsistent measures are necessary to fulfill the policy objective and must apply the measures in conformity with Article XX. The United States would bear the burden of demonstrating that the measures satisfy all three parts of the test if Article XX(b) is invoked in defense of import restrictions. Another possibly relevant GATT exception is Article XX(d), which may be invoked in certain situations. The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) expands upon GATT Article III obligations and applies to all products, excluding those covered by the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. It does not apply to government purchasing specifications. Another relevant GATT exception is Article XX(d), which can be invoked for measures necessary to comply with non-GATT laws or regulations. The TBT Agreement covers technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures. Technical regulations are mandatory documents that define product characteristics and production methods. They may also include labeling requirements. To qualify as a technical regulation, a measure must apply to an identifiable product or group of products. The TBT Agreement requires that technical regulations must define product characteristics and be mandatory. These regulations should not create unnecessary trade barriers and should be no more restrictive than necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. The TBT Agreement mandates that technical regulations must define product characteristics and be mandatory to achieve legitimate objectives, such as preventing deceptive practices and protecting human health or safety. Members are required to review and update regulations if the circumstances or objectives change to allow for less trade-restrictive measures. Conformity assessment procedures are used to ensure compliance with technical regulations and standards through various methods like sampling, testing, and inspection. These obligations are outlined in Article 5 of the TBT Agreement. Conformity assessment procedures under the TBT Agreement must meet specific requirements for ensuring conformity with technical regulations. These procedures must adhere to principles of national treatment and not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade. The procedures should provide suppliers with the right to an assessment of conformity and not be more strict than necessary to ensure product compliance. The TBT Agreement requires conformity with technical regulations to avoid non-conformity risks. The application of the Agreement depends on the details of any drug importation program. A measure with prohibitive and permissive elements may be covered by the Agreement. Importing drugs from approved countries could be seen as a prohibition on importing from other countries. Based on the TBT Agreement, there may be no issues if a proposal is narrowly interpreted. However, if a proposal has both prohibitive and permissive elements, TBT obligations could apply. The Agreement's Preamble suggests exceptions for measures necessary for protecting human, animal, or plant life or health, but it is unclear how this language would be interpreted in practice. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to measures affecting trade in services, defined as the supply of a service through cross-border supply and consumption abroad. The phrase \"measures by Members affecting trade in services\" is interpreted broadly to encompass any measure that affects the supply of a service. The GATS imposes obligations such as most-favored-nation treatment, market access, and national treatment on Members' specific scheduled sectoral commitments. These obligations apply to GATS-covered measures, with exemptions allowed for specific national measures. The application of the GATS depends on the details of any specific prescription drug importation enacted. The GATS imposes obligations on Members' specific scheduled sectoral commitments, including most-favored-nation treatment, market access, and national treatment. Any legislative or regulatory proposal affecting prescription drug wholesale distribution may face a WTO challenge for inconsistency with GATS commitments. General exceptions under Article XIV allow measures necessary for protecting human, animal, or plant life or health, but must not discriminate between countries or restrict trade in services. The GATS Article XIV exception may follow a similar test as the GATT Article XX(b) exception. The GATS Article XIV exception, like the GATT Article XX(b) exception, raises questions about antitrust law, trade law, and prescription drug imports. There is uncertainty about the impact of the change in language from \"like conditions\" in GATS to \"same conditions\" in GATT. A federal court case, Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC, highlighted the potential for drug manufacturers to sue importers for patent infringement and block drug imports. The first sale of a patented product exhausts the patent holder's rights in that market. In Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC, the court ruled that U.S. patent rights are not exhausted by products of foreign provenance, meaning the sale of a patented product abroad does not exhaust the patent rights in the U.S. The patent holder retains its rights, allowing them to block drug imports and sue importers for patent infringement. In Jazz Photo Corp. v. ITC, the court ruled that U.S. patent rights are not exhausted by foreign sales, allowing patent holders to block imports of patented drug products into the U.S. Some legal commentators question the ruling, and proposed bills in Congress aimed to overturn it. The debate on importing prescription drugs continues, with the FDA unable to guarantee their safety or effectiveness. Consumers seek affordable prices by importing drugs, leading to calls for changes in current laws. Proposed changes to current laws include promoting generic drugs, negotiating lower drug prices, expanding prescription drug insurance coverage, reducing co-pays, allowing drug imports from approved Canadian pharmacies only, and increasing inspections of foreign drug manufacturers."
