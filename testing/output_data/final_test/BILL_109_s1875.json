    "content": "The \"Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds the obligation to secure the nation's borders and prevent illegal entry of undocumented persons and drugs. Despite Border Patrol apprehending over 1,000,000 people annually, unauthorized aliens increase by 500,000 yearly. The Southwest border sees 94% of migrant apprehensions, with an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the US. The border region is a major drug shipment corridor. Border communities face significant costs due to inadequate border security, with law enforcement and criminal justice expenses exceeding $89 million annually for Southwest border counties. In 2005, New Mexico and Arizona declared states of emergency to address criminal activity along the border. The Federal Government provides assistance to cover costs related to border security. Border communities along the Southwest border face significant costs related to inadequate border security. Local law enforcement agencies in these areas must use their limited resources to combat various border-related crimes, as they receive no assistance in covering expenses. Counties along the border with Mexico are among the poorest in the country and struggle to cover the additional costs associated with illegal activities. Federal assistance is needed to help local law enforcement in border communities address the challenges of illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-related crimes due to inadequate overall border security in the region. The Border Relief Grant Program is established to provide federal assistance to local law enforcement in border communities facing challenges related to illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-related crimes. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible law enforcement agencies to address criminal activity near the US border and the failure to secure borders. Grants may be awarded from 2006 to 2010 on a competitive basis, with priority given to agencies in communities with populations under 50,000. Grants awarded under this section are for eligible law enforcement agencies in communities with populations under 50,000 located within 100 miles of a US border with Canada or Mexico. The funds can be used for equipment, personnel, technology upgrades, operational costs, and other resources to address criminal activity along the border. Agencies must submit an application to receive a grant. Applicants seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. The application should describe the activities for which assistance is sought and provide necessary assurances for compliance. Eligible law enforcement agencies are defined as tribal, State, or local agencies within 100 miles of a US border. The term \"High Impact Area\" refers to a county designated by the Secretary based on factors like law enforcement resources, border security impact on criminal activity, and unique challenges faced by the county. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is authorized to appropriate $30,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2010 for law enforcement agencies dealing with border security challenges. Two-thirds of the funds go to agencies in the 6 states with the highest undocumented alien apprehensions, while one-third is allocated to High Impact Areas designated by the Secretary. Amounts appropriated for grants under this section must supplement, not replace, other State and local public funds for the purposes outlined in this Act. SEC. 4. REPORT REQUIREMENT.\n\nWithin 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Comptroller General must report to Congress on costs incurred by State and local law enforcement agencies due to criminal activity near the U.S. borders with Canada or Mexico, and the Federal Government's border security failures.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\nThis Act does not give State or local law enforcement agencies authority to enforce Federal immigration laws."
