    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Afghan Women Security and Freedom Act of 2004\". The findings of Congress highlight the severe human rights violations against women in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, including denial of basic rights like education, healthcare, and freedom of movement. Women faced beatings and imprisonment for asserting their rights, leading to long-term consequences. Most Afghan women lack access to food, healthcare, education, and employment due to years of war and Taliban restrictions, resulting in violence against them and their families. Women in Afghanistan face high mortality rates, with 16,000 maternal deaths annually. Strengthening women-led institutions and NGOs is crucial for protecting women's rights. It is essential for women to hold key positions in the Afghan government and UN agencies to promote democracy and women's rights. Despite the Taliban regime's collapse, challenges persist. Despite the Taliban regime's collapse in 2001, warlords and the Taliban are regrouping in Afghanistan, posing a threat to the central government, people's security, and women's rights. The deteriorating security situation may delay elections, requiring an increase in international peacekeeping forces. The new constitution in Afghanistan guarantees basic rights for women, but enforcement depends on improved security conditions. Despite ongoing human rights violations and women's rights abuses in Afghanistan, Provincial Reconstruction Teams lack the authority to intervene and stop such violations. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of protecting women's rights, reestablishing democracy, and eliminating terrorism in Afghanistan. It calls for substantial international resources, including expanding peacekeeping forces in Kabul. The United States is urged to support Afghan institutions promoting women's and human rights. International peacekeeping forces and Provincial Reconstruction Teams are highlighted for their role in Afghanistan's stability. Provincial Reconstruction Teams, including US military forces and allied personnel, should intervene to protect human and women's rights in Afghanistan. US foreign policy should focus on restoring rights for women and girls, aiding their recovery from Taliban repression, and supporting Afghan institutions led by women. Aid to Afghanistan should be contingent on adherence to international standards for women's and human rights. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR ASSISTANCE.

The curr_chunk focuses on the sense of Congress regarding the provision of assistance. The sense of Congress is that assistance provided under this Act should be conditioned on adherence to international standards for women's rights and human rights. Priority should be given to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and other agencies promoting women's rights. Assistance should also prioritize training programs and be distributed based on need throughout Afghanistan.
