It also seeks to reduce administrative costs of Federal education programs and ensure accountability for student achievement, especially for disadvantaged children. Definitions in the Act align with those in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The \"Make Education Local Act of 2018\" emphasizes accountability in public schools to parents and taxpayers for the use of funds and student academic progress. It defines terms like \"accountability,\" \"State,\" and \"State management decision.\" The \"Make Education Local Act of 2018\" defines terms like \"State Authorizing Officials\" and \"State designated officer\" for the expenditure of Federal funds in eligible programs to advance the educational policy of the State. The \"State Designated Officer\" is the person designated by State Authorizing Officials to submit State management decisions to the Secretary and act as the point-of-contact for the State regarding responsibilities under the Act. The State Designated Officer is responsible for submitting State management decisions to the Secretary and serving as the State's point-of-contact for responsibilities under the Act. Each State can submit a State management decision to the Secretary to receive Federal funds for managing educational programs. The decision can include programs aligned with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act but not those funded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Each State management decision under this Act allows funds to be used for educational purposes permitted by State law. State educational agencies can remove fiscal and accounting barriers to consolidate funds for improving educational opportunities. The decision must include a list of eligible programs subject to it. The State management decision must be authorized by State officials, specify the duration, use fiscal control procedures, comply with civil rights laws, advance educational opportunities for the disadvantaged, and include a plan for maintaining direct programs. The State management decision must be authorized by State officials, specify a duration of 5 to 10 years, seek to supplement State education funding with Federal funds, and address persistently failing public schools. The Secretary will review the decision within 60 days of receipt. The State management decision must be approved by the Secretary within 60 days. If no action is taken, the decision is deemed approved. State officials can amend an existing decision by directing the submission of amendments to the Secretary for consideration. The State management decision can be amended to expand or reduce its scope, modify duration, or make other appropriate modifications as deemed necessary by State officials. The effective date of the amendment must allow for full compliance with Federal program requirements. Beginning on the effective date of an amendment executed under paragraph (2)(B), each program requirement of each program removed from the State management decision shall apply to the State's use of funds made available under the program. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY FOR RESULTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. Each State under this Act must inform parents and the public about the student achievement assessment system for accountability. The State must establish an accountability system focused on academic achievement and progress evaluation of students. The State must disseminate a report on student progress annually, including student performance data, high-quality school options for parents, and how Federal funds have been used to improve academic achievement and reduce disparities between student groups. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. States with a State management decision can spend up to 1 percent of Federal funds on administrative expenses, unless part A of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is not included, in which case the limit is 3 percent. Private school children and teachers must be included in activities funded by State management decisions, following the same guidelines as outlined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
