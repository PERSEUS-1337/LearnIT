    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer Science Education and Jobs Act of 2013\". Congress acknowledges the transformative impact of computer science on various industries, job growth projections in STEM fields, and the importance of computer science education in developing critical thinking skills. The College Board's AP computer science examination can increase students' likelihood of majoring in computer science in college. However, in 2012, only a small percentage of high schools in the United States offered this exam. Additionally, only 14 states allow computer science courses to count towards graduation requirements, which may deter student interest. The lack of certification or licensure processes for computer science teachers in many states further complicates the issue. Computer science education faces confusion with technology education. The ACM and CSTA have set standards for computer science education. Support is needed to reform elementary and secondary computer science education. SEC. 3. REFERENCES. Whenever an amendment or repeal is mentioned in this Act, it refers to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 4. COMPUTER SCIENCE DEFINITIONS. SEC. 4 amends Section 9101 to define computer science as the study of computers, algorithms, computing principles, hardware, software design, applications, and societal impact. It also includes computer science in academic subjects. SEC. 5 expands access to advanced placement computer science by including it in Section 1705(c)(4) (20 U.S.C. 6535(c)(4). SEC. 6 focuses on incorporating computer science into state plans. Incorporating computer science into state plans by amending Section 1111(b) to include computer science as a subject and outlining how it should be considered in academic standards, accountability, and assessments. Additionally, amending Section 1119(a)(2) to ensure highly qualified teachers for computer science education. Amending Section 1119(a)(2) to ensure computer science teachers are highly qualified by the end of the 2015-2016 school year. SEC. 7. Amending Part B of title II to include a new subpart heading for Partnership Grants in Mathematics and Science. Amendment to include computer science professionals and informatics professionals in education programs, along with mathematics and science defined to include technology and engineering. Amendment to include computer science professionals and informatics professionals in education programs, along with mathematics and science, defined to include technology and engineering. The amendment also expands the scope to include science, informatics, and computer science in various sections. Amendment includes adding informatics and computer science to education programs, along with mathematics and science. It expands the scope to include informatics and computer science in various sections. The amendment expands education programs to include informatics and computer science in addition to mathematics and science, under the subpart 1--partnership grants. The sections 2201 and 2202 of the U.S.C. are amended to replace \"part\" with \"subpart\" in subsections and paragraphs. In sections 2201 and 2202 of the U.S.C., \"part\" is replaced with \"subpart\" in various subsections and paragraphs. Additionally, section 2203 (20 U.S.C. 6663) is also amended to make the same change. SEC. 8. EXPANDING TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. This section introduces a Computer Science Model Teacher Preparation Program under Part B of title II. The Secretary can award grants to higher education institutions to enhance training for computer science teachers in elementary and secondary schools. Eligible institutions must have programs in teacher education and computer science, and use grant funds to develop courses for students preparing to teach computer science. The Secretary awards grants to higher education institutions to improve training for computer science teachers in elementary and secondary schools. Grants aim to prepare students to teach computer science, focus on informatics or computer science education, and involve relevant departments. Additionally, funding is provided for teacher mentoring programs to support new computer science teachers. Grants are for a 5-year duration, and institutions must submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within 180 days after the grant period ends.

Institutions must submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within 180 days after the grant period ends, which includes identifying the number of teachers served, those who obtain teaching positions in computer science classrooms, and evaluating the activities carried out under the grant. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program includes a computer science model teacher preparation program. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program is updated to include computer science alongside mathematics, informatics, and computer science in various sections."
