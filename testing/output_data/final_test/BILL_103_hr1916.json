    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Biotechnology Investment Act of 1993\" is abbreviated as such. It includes findings related to marine biotechnology. The Congress recognizes the importance of oceans as a source of food and natural products, and acknowledges the potential of molecular biology and biotechnology to enhance products from the oceans. Marine biotechnology can benefit marine ecosystems by developing substitute products, improving aquaculture, and aiding in environmental remediation. The United States is a leader in marine biotechnology but faces challenges due to inadequate public investment compared to other countries. The United States should establish a national program for marine biotechnology within the National Sea Grant College Program and increase investment in this area to support job creation, stimulate private sector investment, and maintain preeminence in marine biotechnology. The National Sea Grant College Program Act is amended to include a Marine Biotechnology Program under section 206A. The Marine Biotechnology Program, defined as the application of molecular and cellular biology to marine organisms, is included in the National Sea Grant College Program. This program aims to identify, develop, and enhance products derived from marine and fresh water organisms through research, development, risk assessment, education, and technology transfer. The Secretary is responsible for administering the program by making grants, entering contracts, and engaging in other authorized activities. The Secretary administers the marine biotechnology program by coordinating activities, providing oversight, and ensuring high-quality research, development, education, and technology transfer. Applications for grants and contracts must adhere to regulations set by the Secretary. The Secretary administers the marine biotechnology program by coordinating activities, providing oversight, and ensuring high-quality research, development, education, and technology transfer. Grants and contracts under this program are forwarded to the National Sea Grant Office and reviewed by the Marine Biotechnology Review Panel. Awarding of grants and contracts is done based on panel recommendations. The Secretary awards grants and contracts based on recommendations from the Marine Biotechnology Review Panel, with exceptions for conflicts of interest, non-compliance with requirements, or relevant procedures. The Secretary will not award grants or contracts involving genetically modified organisms unless they have been reviewed and approved under other federal laws or are deemed to pose no significant environmental risk. Rejected award recommendations under this provision must be documented and reported to the Panel. The National Sea Grant College Program will fund research on genetically modified organisms, defined as organisms with altered genetic material at the molecular level. Activities involving GMOs must comply with safety regulations. The college program involving genetically modified organisms must comply with safety guidelines for research, including those for recombinant DNA molecules and performance standards for conducting research on genetically modified finfish and shellfish. Performance standards for the National Sea Grant College Program may apply if published by the Secretary in the Federal Register. The Secretary will withdraw any award for activities involving genetically modified organisms if the grantee fails to follow guidelines. A Marine Biotechnology Review Panel will review grant applications competitively. The Marine Biotechnology Review Panel evaluates grant applications for scientific, technical, educational, and commercial merits. It consists of up to 15 individuals with expertise in marine biotechnology or related fields. The Marine Biotechnology Review Panel consists of up to 15 individuals with expertise in marine or freshwater ecological risk assessment, reflecting a balance among areas of expertise and geographic balance. Members receive travel expenses in accordance with regulations. The Marine Biotechnology Review Panel is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Marine Biotechnology Review Panel is authorized to appropriate funds. Section 212 of the National Sea Grant College Program Act is amended to include a Marine Biotechnology Program with authorized appropriations for grants and contracts. The Marine Biotechnology Review Panel is authorized to appropriate funds for the program. The Marine Biotechnology Program under section 212 of the National Sea Grant College Program Act is allocated funds not exceeding $200,000 for fiscal years 1994 and 1995, and $250,000 for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. The National Sea Grant College Program Act was amended to include \"marine biotechnology\" in the definition of marine technology."
