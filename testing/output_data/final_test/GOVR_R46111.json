    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides medical services to low-income populations, including children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly. It is authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and funded by the federal government and states. States have flexibility in designing and administering their Medicaid programs within federal guidelines. The Medicaid program allows states flexibility in providing medical services to low-income populations, with eligibility, benefits, and payment rates varying by state. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administers Medicaid at the federal level. This report focuses on Medicaid eligibility for older adults, individuals under 65 with disabilities, and children. Lawmakers are interested in these populations due to their higher likelihood of needing long-term services and support. Older adults and individuals with disabilities are more likely to need LTSS due to physical limitations, cognitive impairment, or chronic disabling health conditions. Medicaid provides LTSS coverage that is generally not covered by Medicare or major health insurance plans. Federal policymakers are interested in understanding Medicaid eligibility for this diverse group with long-term care needs. In 2016, Medicaid spent $154 billion on long-term services and supports (LTSS), accounting for 42% of all LTSS expenditures nationally. Older adults and individuals with disabilities, who make up 23% of Medicaid enrollees, accounted for 54% of benefit spending. Medicaid provided health care services to 71 million enrollees, with total expenditures of $538 billion. In FY2013, 30% of Medicaid spending was on LTSS, with older adults and individuals with disabilities accounting for 54% of benefit spending. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law, leading to variability across states. Medicaid eligibility varies across states based on state policy decisions within federal requirements. Individuals qualify for Medicaid by meeting specific eligibility pathways offered by the state, which can be mandatory or optional. States have discretion to set eligibility criteria and can apply for waivers to expand coverage. Eligibility pathways are federal references under Title XIX of the SSA that extend Medicaid coverage. Medicaid eligibility pathways under Title XIX of the SSA define groups covered, financial criteria, and state discretion. Additional requirements include meeting state-based care criteria and financial rules for LTSS coverage. Residency and immigration status are also mandatory for all Medicaid applicants. Medicaid eligibility pathways determine services based on residency, immigration status, and citizenship documentation. Enrollees may receive traditional Medicaid services or alternative benefit plans, including long-term services and supports (LTSS) through waivers. Various eligibility pathways exist for low-income older adults and individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities may qualify for Medicaid through various eligibility pathways, including those based on age or disability status. Medicaid data categorize eligibility groups as children, adults, aged, and disabled. Older adults and individuals with disabilities can qualify based on being aged, blind, or disabled (ABD eligibility). Blindness is often considered separately from other disabilities in ABD pathways. CMS includes statutorily blind individuals in the \"disabled\" category for reporting purposes. Individuals with disabilities may qualify for Medicaid through various pathways, including age or disability status. Medicaid categorizes eligibility groups as children, adults, aged, and disabled. Those who do not meet disability criteria under ABD pathways or have income/assets above limits may still be eligible. Applicants can choose the most beneficial pathway for Medicaid eligibility based on income, assets, and available options. This report categorizes Medicaid eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities into two groups: Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-Related Pathways and Other ABD Pathways. SSI-Related Pathways include mandatory and optional eligibility groups meeting federal SSI program requirements. Other ABD Pathways consist of optional groups with income/resources above SSI rules. Medicaid eligibility for older adults and individuals with disabilities is determined by specific SSI financial criteria. Various pathways exist under broad coverage groups such as children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and individuals aged 65 and older. Each group has distinct eligibility criteria. Medicaid eligibility has evolved from being limited to specific groups receiving cash assistance to now allowing states to extend coverage to individuals not based on cash assistance, including the ACA Medicaid expansion. Medicaid's financial eligibility rules have evolved over time for certain groups, including the ACA Medicaid expansion population. The program is means-tested and limited to those with financial need, with income and resource tests varying by eligibility group. Income and resource standards are expressed separately, with specific counting methodologies for each. The Medicaid program uses income-counting and resource-counting methodologies to determine eligibility. Certain types of income can be disregarded, and rules dictate how resources are counted before comparing them to the standards. For most groups, eligibility is based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) rules, with no asset test for MAGI-eligible individuals. Medicaid financial eligibility for MAGI-eligible individuals is based on MAGI income-counting rules, except for certain populations like older adults and individuals with disabilities who are exempt. For these populations, eligibility is determined based on income-counting rules that align with related social programs such as the SSI program. SSI rules serve as the foundation for Medicaid eligibility for older adults and individuals with disabilities, including income and resource tests. States have the option to modify SSI program rules for income and resource counting under certain eligibility pathways. States have the option to modify income and resource counting methodologies for certain Medicaid eligibility pathways, allowing them to include or disregard specific sources of income or resources. Medicaid programs must establish an Asset Verification System (AVS) to ensure compliance with eligibility criteria. Medicaid programs must establish an Asset Verification System (AVS) to determine eligibility for aged, blind, or disabled applicants. SSI program rules are foundational for Medicaid eligibility criteria for older adults and individuals with disabilities, using SSI categorical and financial standards. Understanding SSI rules is crucial for understanding Medicaid eligibility. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides monthly cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and resources. It aims to guarantee a minimum income for those struggling to cover basic living expenses due to age or disability. SSI also supports needy children under 18 with severe disabilities. Unlike Medicaid, SSI has nationally uniform eligibility requirements and benefit levels. Administered by the Social Security Administration, SSI is separate from the Social Security program. To be categorically eligible for SSI, a person must be aged 65 or older, blind with limited vision, or disabled and unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment. The Social Security Administration uses a monthly earnings standard to determine if an individual's work activity constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA). In 2019, the SGA earnings standard is $1,220 per month. Adults qualify as disabled if they are unable to perform substantial work considering their age, education, and work experience. Children under 18 are considered disabled if they have a physical or mental impairment. Children typically qualify as disabled if they have a severe impairment that limits their ability to engage in age-appropriate activities at home, in childcare, at school, or in the community. The Social Security Administration periodically reevaluates blind or disabled SSI recipients to determine if they continue to meet the definition of blindness or disability through continuing disability reviews. The Social Security Administration reevaluates child SSI recipients every three to seven years, and when they turn 18, they are reassessed under the adult disability definition. To qualify for SSI, individuals must meet income and resource limits. The SSI federal benefit rate in 2019 is $771 per month for individuals and $1,157 per month for married couples. The SSI resource standard is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples, and these amounts are not adjusted for inflation. The SSI program sets income and resource standards for individuals and couples, with the federal benefit rate at $771 per month for individuals and $1,157 per month for couples. The resource standard is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples, with certain exclusions like the first $20 of any income and primary residence. These amounts have not been adjusted for inflation since 1989. The SSI program uses person-based methodologies to determine eligibility and payment amounts. Deeming rules may apply to count income or resources of ineligible family members. The Social Security Administration calculates countable income and resources by subtracting applicable exclusions from gross amounts. The SSI program determines financial eligibility by subtracting applicable exclusions from income and resource standards. Recipients' circumstances are periodically reevaluated to ensure correct payment amounts. Medicaid LTSS coverage requires meeting state-based level-of-care criteria. Medicaid LTSS coverage eligibility is determined by state-based level-of-care criteria, which may include functional criteria like the ability to perform activities of daily living. Each state defines its own institutional level-of-care criteria for Medicaid, which also applies to Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) eligibility. Medicaid LTSS coverage eligibility is determined by state-based level-of-care criteria, including functional and clinical criteria such as diagnosis, treatment, medications, and cognitive status. Optional ABD eligibility pathways are available for older adults and individuals with disabilities, establishing Medicaid eligibility for LTSS. Medicaid LTSS coverage eligibility is determined by state-based level-of-care criteria, including functional and clinical criteria. Medicaid enrollees may be eligible for LTSS if they meet the level of care criteria and are subject to separate financial eligibility rules. These rules prevent asset divestment and include spousal impoverishment rules to protect non-Medicaid-covered spouses. Medicaid has specific rules for income treatment after eligibility for LTSS, known as Post-Eligibility Treatment of Income (PETI) rules. Beneficiaries with income above certain limits must contribute towards their care costs. Participants can keep a portion of their income for personal use based on the services received. States may offer LTSS under waiver programs outside Medicaid State plan requirements. States can cover Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) under SSA Section 1915(c). Under SSA Section 1915(c), states can cover Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) which allow individuals needing institutional care to live independently. The HHS Secretary can waive service comparability and statewideness requirements. States can also waive income and resource rules for Medicaid eligibility. States can combine Section 1915(b) and 1915(c) for managed care, and limit program enrollment. States can use Section 1115 waivers to expand LTSS coverage, modify eligibility criteria, and adjust income and resource counting rules for specific groups. Waivers have been used to extend coverage beyond statutory limits, cap program enrollment, and implement waiting periods. Additionally, waivers have been utilized to encourage participation in managed LTSS and to liberalize or restrict income counting rules for certain subpopulations. The Section 1115 waivers have been used by states to modify Medicaid eligibility requirements, including spend-down requirements and eligibility redeterminations. SSI-Related Pathways include various eligibility groups such as aged, blind, or disabled individuals who meet SSI program requirements. These pathways are organized into three subgroups: SSI Recipients, Special Groups of Former SSI Recipients, and Other SSI-Related Groups. These pathways extend Medicaid coverage to individuals enrolled in the SSI program. In December 2018, 8.1 million individuals received SSI or federally administered SSP. States must provide Medicaid coverage for all SSI recipients, with the option to use more restrictive eligibility criteria. SSI recipients are usually eligible for Medicaid for the month they receive SSI. In 2019, 34 states and the District of Columbia allow the Social Security Administration to determine Medicaid eligibility for SSI recipients under Section 1634 of the SSA. These states are known as \"1634 states.\" Some states conduct their own Medicaid eligibility determinations for SSI recipients using the same standards as the SSI program. In 2019, eight states provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients using more restrictive eligibility criteria than the SSI program. These states are known as \"209(b) states\" and require a separate Medicaid application. In 2019, eight states provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients using more restrictive eligibility criteria than the SSI program. These states, known as \"209(b) states,\" may have stricter criteria for blindness, disability, income, resources, or property ownership. In 2019, eight states known as \"209(b) states\" provide Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients with more restrictive eligibility criteria. These states deduct SSI and optional state supplementary payments from income to determine Medicaid eligibility, allowing for \"spend down\" of medical expenses. States provide optional state supplementary payments (SSPs) to complement federal SSI payments, helping individuals whose basic needs are not fully met by the SSI federal benefit rate. SSPs can be provided to all SSI recipients or limited to certain individuals, with amounts and standards determined by the states. States may self-administer SSP programs or have the Social Security Administration administer them. In 2019, 44 states and the District of Columbia offer optional SSPs to some or all SSI recipients, with the option to provide Medicaid coverage for those receiving only SSPs. Medicaid coverage is available for individuals who receive only an optional SSP, based on their countable income compared to the SSI income standard. States must apply the same standards and methodologies for individuals under this pathway as they do for those receiving SSI. States may apply more restrictive income-counting methodologies to individuals under the SSP program compared to those receiving SSI. 43 states and the District of Columbia offer Medicaid to individuals with optional SSP, but this pathway is closed to new enrollment. States must maintain income levels from December 1973 for individuals transferred from former adult assistance programs to SSI in 1974 to receive federal Medicaid funding. States must provide a special payment, known as a mandatory SSP, to individuals who were converted from former adult assistance programs to the SSI program in January 1974. The mandatory SSP is the difference between the current SSI payment and the individual's December 1973 payment under the former program. States are required to provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who receive mandatory SSPs, including those with earnings above certain SSI limits. Individuals who would still be eligible for SSI if not for their earnings may be deemed eligible under Section 1619(a) and 1619(b) of the SSA. To qualify for Medicaid under the 1619 provisions, individuals must have received SSI for at least one month before the 1619 determination is made. Disabled SSI recipients with earnings above the substantial gainful activity standard can continue to receive cash payments under Section 1619(a) of the SSA. Individuals in 209(b) states must have been eligible for Medicaid in the month prior to becoming eligible for 1619 status. Adults aged 65 and older may qualify for 1619 provisions if they meet the SSI definition of blindness or disability. Disabled individuals who meet the substantial gainful activity (SGA) standard but have income below the SSI standard can receive special SSI payments under Section 1619(a). These payments are calculated like regular SSI payments and continue as long as the individual meets SSI eligibility criteria. States must also provide Medicaid coverage for 1619(a) recipients. Section 1619(b) requires Medicaid coverage for blind or disabled individuals who would still be eligible for SSI or 1619(a) payments if not for their earnings. Section 1619(b) allows blind or disabled individuals to qualify for Medicaid even if they lose SSI eligibility due to excess earnings. To qualify, individuals must continue to be blind or disabled, meet SSI financial eligibility requirements except for earnings, need Medicaid to continue working, and have earnings insufficient to replace the benefits they would receive without earnings. The Social Security Administration uses an annual earnings standard to determine 1619(b) eligibility. The annual earnings standard for disabled 1619(b) participants varies by state, ranging from $27,826 in Alabama to $66,452 in Connecticut in 2019. If earnings exceed the standard, eligibility is determined using individualized criteria considering Medicaid expenditures and publicly funded care. The pathways for Special Groups of Former SSI Recipients extend Medicaid coverage to special former SSI/SSP recipients who would continue to be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for receipt of certain Social Security benefits. Special former recipients are deemed to be receiving SSI/SSP for Medicaid eligibility purposes; however, they no longer have a current connection to the SSI program. In determining Medicaid eligibility, most states must disregard the applicable Social Security benefit from the special former recipient's countable income. 209(b) states have the option to disregard some or all of the Social Security benefit in determining Medicaid eligibility. The \"Pickle Amendment\" under 209(b) states requires Medicaid coverage for special former recipients who would still be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for Social Security benefit increases. States may choose to exclude some or all of these benefit increases in determining eligibility. The \"Pickle Amendment\" under 209(b) states requires Medicaid coverage for special former recipients who would still be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for Social Security benefit increases. This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people. Social Security provides widow(er)'s benefits starting at age 60, or at age 50 if the individual is disabled. The amount of the benefit is based on the deceased insured worker's past earnings, with a reduction for claiming before full retirement age. Lawmakers eliminated the additional reduction factor for disabled widow(er)s aged 50-59 under P.L. 98-21. Individuals qualify for Medicaid coverage under the Pickle Amendment if they were entitled to Social Security benefits in December 1983, received disabled widow(er)'s benefits and SSI/SSP in January 1984, lost SSI/SSP eligibility due to the elimination of the ARF, have been continuously entitled to widow(er)'s benefits since January 1984, filed for Medicaid continuation before July 1, 1988, and would still be eligible for SSI/SSP if the increase in benefits were deducted from their income. Disabled adult children of retired, disabled, or deceased insured workers may also qualify for Social Security disabled benefits. Individuals who lose eligibility for SSI/SSP due to entitlement to Social Security disabled adult child's (DAC) benefits or widow(er)'s benefits may qualify for Medicaid coverage. States have the option to exclude some or all of the DAC benefits that caused ineligibility for SSI/SSP. Medicaid coverage is also available for individuals aged 50 to 64 who lose SSI/SSP eligibility due to entitlement to widow(er)'s benefits but are not yet eligible for Medicare Part A. Individuals aged 50 to 64 who lose SSI/SSP eligibility due to entitlement to widow(er)'s benefits but are not yet eligible for Medicare Part A may qualify for Medicaid coverage. States may exclude some or all of the widow(er)'s benefits that caused ineligibility for SSI/SSP. This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people. Individuals aged 50 to 64 who lose SSI/SSP eligibility due to entitlement to widow(er)'s benefits but are not yet eligible for Medicare Part A may qualify for Medicaid coverage. States may exclude some or all of the widow(er)'s benefits that caused ineligibility for SSI/SSP. This pathway is closed to new enrollment and applies to relatively few people. Individuals qualify under P.L. 92-336 if they were entitled to Social Security benefits in August 1972, were receiving cash assistance under the former adult assistance programs in August 1972, and would be eligible for SSI/SSP had the COLA under P.L. 92-336 not been applied to their Social Security benefits. Other SSI-Related Groups pathways extend Medicaid coverage to certain individuals who were eligible for Medicaid just prior to SSI's start in 1974, and to aged, blind, or disabled individuals who would be eligible for SSI/SSP today if not for a certain requirement in those programs. These pathways are closed to new enrollment and apply to relatively few people. States are required to provide Medicaid to three groups eligible in December 1973: essential spouses, institutionalized individuals, and blind or disabled individuals. Essential spouses are spouses of cash assistance recipients, institutionalized individuals are inpatients of medical institutions, and blind or disabled individuals meet state-established criteria for blindness or disability. Medicaid must be provided if they continue to meet the eligibility criteria. States must provide Medicaid for essential spouses, institutionalized individuals, and blind or disabled individuals who meet the eligibility criteria from December 1973. In 209(b) states, eligibility is determined before deducting medical expenses. Residents of public institutions are generally ineligible for SSI. About 60% of eligible single adults aged 18 and older participated in SSI in 2015. Residents of public institutions are generally ineligible for SSI. However, residents of certain medical institutions can receive a reduced SSI payment called a personal needs allowance (PNA) if more than 50% of their care costs are covered by Medicaid. The PNA, capped at $30 per month (or $60 for couples in certain situations), is used for small comfort items. Some states supplement the PNA for institutionalized individuals. Any countable income reduces the PNA, but the SSI/SSP income standard is used to determine eligibility for the SSI program. States have the option to provide Medicaid coverage for institutionalized individuals who are ineligible for SSI/SSP due to lower income standards. They may provide Medicaid to individuals in certain institutions with income above the PNA standard but within the SSI/SSP income standard. States are required to provide Medicaid for aged, blind, or disabled individuals who would be eligible for SSI/SSP if not for certain eligibility requirements prohibited by Medicaid laws. Certain settlement payments made to hemophilia patients infected with HIV are excluded from eligibility determinations. However, federal law does not exempt these payments from being counted as income or resources under the SSI program. States must provide Medicaid coverage for individuals who lost SSI eligibility due to receiving settlement payments. Optional aged, blind, or disabled (ABD) eligibility pathways allow states to extend Medicaid coverage to older adults and individuals with disabilities with higher income or resources than SSI rules permit. Some ABD pathways also allow states to use less restrictive income or resource-counting methodologies compared to SSI rules. Optional eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities, such as Special Income Level, Special Home and Community-Based Waiver Group, and Katie Beckett, establish Medicaid eligibility along with coverage for LTSS. States can also extend eligibility to individuals who \"spend down\" their income on medical expenses, including LTSS. This section outlines various optional Medicaid eligibility pathways for ABD individuals, including Poverty-Related, Special Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Group, and Medically Needy. Enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, the Poverty-Related eligibility pathway allows states to cover aged and disabled individuals with incomes higher than SSI standards, up to 100% of the federal poverty level. Aged individuals are 65 years or older, and disabled individuals must meet the SSI program's definition of disability. States must use SSI rules for determining income and resources, with a reasonable definition of \"family\" allowed. In 2018, 24 states and DC offered the optional Poverty-Related eligibility pathway for Medicaid. Some states had income standards below 100% of the FPL, like Florida at 88% and Idaho at 77%. The Special Income Level pathway allows for higher income standards for Medicaid coverage of nursing facility services. Individuals must require care for at least 30 consecutive days to be eligible. The Special Income Level pathway for Medicaid eligibility allows individuals to receive coverage for nursing facility services if they require care for at least 30 consecutive days and have income not exceeding 300% of the SSI FBR. Income from spouses is not counted, and all income sources are considered. States may use additional income disregards or deductions. Eligibility starts on the first day of residency in an institution. In 2018, 42 states and the District of Columbia used the Special Income Level to qualify individuals for Medicaid coverage of institutional care. The Special Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Group eligibility pathway extends Medicaid eligibility to individuals receiving HCBS under a waiver program who require nursing facility level care. This pathway, also known as the \"217 Group,\" allows states to use the highest income and resource standard of a separate eligibility group to qualify individuals for Medicaid coverage. For example, states can extend eligibility to waiver program participants with income up to 300% of the SSI FBR. States can extend Medicaid eligibility to waiver program participants with income up to 300% of the SSI FBR. An independent eligibility pathway into Medicaid is available through the Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) State Plan option, which provides traditional Medicaid services to individuals receiving targeted HCBS state plan services. Eligibility for the Medicaid HCBS State Plan option is based on the need for long-term care. The HCBS State Plan option, enacted under the DRA and amended under the ACA, allows individuals with long-term care needs to access Medicaid services without meeting an institutional level of care requirement. Income standards for eligibility range from 150% to 300% of the FPL or SSI FBR, with states having flexibility in income-counting methodologies. States have flexibility in income-counting methodologies for the HCBS State Plan option, allowing individuals with long-term care needs to access Medicaid services without meeting an institutional level of care requirement. Some states offer this option as an independent eligibility pathway to Medicaid, while others provide HCBS state plan services to those eligible under existing Medicaid pathways. The Katie Beckett optional pathway under Medicaid provides coverage to severely disabled children who do not qualify for Medicaid LTSS at home due to their parents' income being too high. States can extend Medicaid coverage to disabled children meeting SSI disability criteria, aged 18 or younger, living at home, requiring institutional-level care, suitable for care outside a facility, and with home care costs not exceeding institutional care costs. States must use SSI income and resources rules for eligibility determination. The Katie Beckett pathway under Medicaid provides coverage for severely disabled children whose parents' income is too high for Medicaid LTSS at home. States use SSI income and resources rules for eligibility, with a child's income and resources considered. Some states offer this pathway, along with optional Medicaid Buy-In pathways for working individuals with disabilities or families with a disabled child. Medicaid Buy-In pathways allow disabled individuals to work while retaining Medicaid coverage or accessing additional services not covered by employer plans. States can impose premiums or cost-sharing based on income. Various eligibility groups exist, including the BBA 97 Eligibility Group and the Family Opportunity Act for disabled children. Premiums and cost-sharing requirements vary by state. The Family Opportunity Act, enacted under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, offers coverage through Buy-In pathways for disabled individuals with family income below 250% of the FPL. States determine family eligibility based on SSI guidelines, with earned income disregarded and resources limited to SSI standards. The Basic Eligibility Group, established under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, provides an optional pathway for individuals with higher income levels above 250% of the FPL. States have the flexibility to set income and resource standards, with the option to disregard additional income or resources using Section 1902(r)(2) of the SSA. The Medical Improvement Group pathway under the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 allows individuals aged 16 to 64 with severe medically determinable impairments to qualify for benefits if they no longer meet the disability definition but continue to have impairments. Eligible individuals must earn at least the federal minimum wage and work a minimum of 40 hours per month. The Family Opportunity Act (FOA) optional pathway allows families with income up to 300% of the FPL to buy Medicaid coverage for their disabled child aged 18 or younger. States can exceed 300% of the FPL without federal matching funds for such coverage. States choosing this pathway use the SSI program's definition of disability and income-counting methodology for a family. The Medically Needy option is for individuals with high medical expenses who exceed income standards for Medicaid. They can qualify by having income/resources below state standards or by spending down their income to the state standard. States may disregard additional earned income above SSI's earned income disregard for certain individuals. States must require parents of eligible children under the FOA optional coverage group to enroll in employer-sponsored insurance as a condition of Medicaid eligibility for the child. The Medically Needy option allows individuals with high medical expenses to qualify for Medicaid by either having income/resources below state standards or spending down their income to the state standard. This involves deducting incurred medical expenses from their income to meet the eligibility threshold. States determine a specific budget period for this spend-down process, typically ranging from one to six months. The Medically Needy option allows aged and disabled individuals with high medical expenses to qualify for Medicaid by spending down their income to the state standard. States set income eligibility standards, typically no higher than 133\u2153% of the state's AFDC level in 1996. Nursing facility services are optional for Medically Needy individuals, with income standards lower than SSI benefits. States use the SSI income-counting methodology for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. States set resource standards for aged, blind, or disabled individuals within federal requirements, using SSI's definition of disability. In 2018, 32 states and the District of Columbia offered coverage to the Medically Needy. Medicaid eligibility pathways for older adults and individuals with disabilities are categorized into SSI-Related and Other ABD Pathways, with details on age criteria, mandatory or optional status, and relevant citations provided in tables. The curr_chunk provides income and resource standards for Medicaid eligibility pathways covering older adults and individuals with disabilities, with details on counting methodology and relationship to federal poverty level or SSI federal benefit rate. State-specific information can be found in external resources.
