    "content": "The FY2010 budget proposal for farm commodity and crop insurance programs is separate from the discretionary budget that funds USDA operations. The Administration has proposed a budget outline to reduce mandatory spending programs, with most of the $16 billion in farm commodity reductions intended to offset proposed increases in child nutrition. The Administration's proposal to reduce mandatory spending on farm commodity programs would require legislative action by Congress and likely originate in agriculture authorizing committees. The agriculture committees may not take up the proposal, but if budget reconciliation is ordered, the President's farm proposals may receive more attention from Congress. The President's FY2010 budget proposes reductions in farm subsidies, including direct payments, payment limits, cotton storage payments, and crop insurance, estimated to save $16 billion over 10 years. One proposal is to prohibit \"direct payments\" to farmers with sales over $500,000 per year, affecting 76,500 farms and estimated to save $9.8 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to reduce total direct payments by 22% over 10 years, tighten payment limits to $250,000 per person, and eliminate storage payments for cotton, estimated to save $126 million over 10 years. The Administration's proposal includes reducing crop insurance subsidies by $5.2 billion over 10 years, eliminating storage payments for cotton to save $126 million, and making cuts to the Market Access Program and Resource Conservation and Development program. The Administration's budget proposal includes reducing crop insurance subsidies, eliminating storage payments for cotton, and cutting the Market Access Program and Resource Conservation and Development program. The proposal aims to eliminate direct payments to farms with sales over $500,000, adding a new sales limit for farm commodity support. This $500,000 limit on sales would be more restrictive than the current adjusted gross income limit. The proposed limit on farm commodity support sales is $500,000, which is more restrictive than the current adjusted gross income limit. Farms exceeding this sales limit may have little profit or even a loss, as sales can be variable and subject to \"bracket creep.\" The share of farms with sales over $500,000 increased during 2007-2008 due to commodity price increases, but this share may decline in the future. In the fall of 2008, sales for farms may be variable and subject to \"bracket creep\" based on prices and yields. Net income measures could be more stable with higher production expenses or tax management tools. Expenses can vary based on production, some fixed regardless of production, while others can be manipulated to manage taxable income. USDA data shows 76,500 farms in 2007 received government payments with sales over $500,000, accounting for 11% of farms receiving government payments. In 2007, 116,000 farms had sales over $500,000, producing 74% of the value of production and receiving 47% of government payments. Large farms, although fewer in number, accounted for most of the production and government payments, with states like Iowa and Illinois being the most affected. The states with the highest number of affected farms are Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska. These four states account for one-third of the 76,500 affected farms in the nation. California stands out for its fruit and vegetable production, with a higher number of farms with sales over $500,000 than receiving government payments. Delaware has a high ratio of farms with sales exceeding $500,000, likely due to concentrated poultry production on a small amount of land. The Administration's proposal would affect a higher percentage of cotton and rice farms in the southern United States compared to corn, soybean, or wheat farms. Cotton and rice farms are larger and have higher production value per acre, making them more likely to exceed sales thresholds. Farms selling corn, soybeans, or wheat with sales over $500,000 account for 51%-59% of national production, while farms selling cotton and rice with sales over $500,000 account for 75% of national production. The sales of rice exceed $500,000, accounting for 75% of national production. Corn, soybean, and wheat farms with sales over $500,000 are more numerous due to their larger acreage compared to cotton and rice farms. States like Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska rank high in terms of farm sales."
