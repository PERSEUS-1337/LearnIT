Impeachment investigations are rare but may be conducted to determine grounds for impeaching a federal official, with the investigating committee potentially recommending articles of impeachment to the full House. The House committee investigations in the House of Representatives can serve various objectives, including gathering information for legislative purposes or oversight of the government. Impeachment investigations are rare but may be conducted to determine grounds for impeaching a federal official. Speaker Pelosi announced that ongoing House committee investigations concerning President Trump constitute an \"official impeachment inquiry,\" blending legislation, oversight, and impeachment purposes. Many investigations have been hindered by refusals to comply with committee requests. The House investigations have faced obstacles due to refusals to comply with subpoenas for documents or testimony. Legal explanations for these refusals include restrictions on disclosing grand jury materials and claims of executive privilege. The question arises whether invoking the impeachment power could enhance the House's ability to obtain withheld information, particularly through the courts. The House investigations have encountered obstacles in obtaining information through subpoenas. The impeachment power may provide additional authority to access certain categories of information, but Congress already has substantial access rights in typical legislative investigations. House committees have the necessary tools to obtain information regardless of the type of investigation they are conducting. The House has the \"sole Power of Impeachment,\" but there is no explicit definition of impeachment investigations. The courts generally do not interfere in the impeachment process, leaving the House with discretion on how to implement its impeachment powers. An impeachment investigation is conducted by the House to determine if there are sufficient grounds to charge an impeachable official with an offense. The process has evolved over time, with no single uniform approach to starting investigations. The House has the discretion to implement its impeachment powers without interference from the courts. Impeachment investigations in the House can be conducted without explicit authorization, as seen in cases involving President Clinton and Judges Nixon, Hastings, and Claiborne. Authorization may come after a preliminary investigation, as with President Nixon. The Judiciary Committee began the preliminary phases of an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon after authorization. House practice on authorizing resolutions for impeachment investigations has varied due to practical, procedural, and political factors. Before standing committees existed, an authorizing resolution was necessary for creating an investigating committee with jurisdiction and investigative tools like subpoena power. The House granted committees standing investigative and subpoena powers in 1975, but authorizing resolutions were still used for additional investigative tools. These resolutions allowed the House to control the scope and direction of impeachment investigations. The House's impeachment investigations reflect different conceptions of its power and authority, including the authority to conduct legislative investigations in aid of lawmaking or oversight of the executive branch. The power of legislative investigations is essential for Congress to gather information necessary for effective lawmaking and oversight of the executive branch. This authority, though not explicitly stated in the Constitution, is implicit in Congress's legislative powers. The importance of these investigations is reflected in the statutory requirement for committees to monitor the executive branch's implementation of laws. House committees have oversight responsibilities to monitor the executive branch's implementation of laws and may conduct investigations, hold hearings, and subpoena witnesses as necessary. The House Rules delegate investigative powers to aid in legislative functions. The House committees have oversight responsibilities, including conducting investigations and subpoenaing witnesses as needed. Impeachment investigations are a form of legislative investigation, with the legal basis for these investigations leading to different roles for the House and investigating committees. Impeachment investigations are considered a form of legislative investigation, aimed at aiding the House in the impeachment process. The House committees have oversight responsibilities and can use their existing investigative authorities to assist in impeachment without needing additional authorization. Impeachment investigations derive their authority directly from the House's \"sole Power of Impeachment\" in the Constitution, allowing for the investigation of allegations of impeachable conduct. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has suggested that the Impeachment Clause is the constitutional source for investigative authority in presidential impeachment inquiries. The authority to investigate impeachable conduct is constitutionally independent of Congress's general power to conduct legislative investigations. Committees must have the delegation of authority from the House to inquire into impeachment matters. The authority to investigate impeachable conduct is constitutionally independent of Congress's general power to conduct legislative investigations. Committees must have the delegation of authority from the House to inquire into impeachment matters, including the exercise of impeachment powers and investigative powers ancillary to impeachment. The current House Rules do not explicitly provide for such delegation, leading to the argument that committees need adequate authorization from the House to exercise these powers effectively. The House lacks a clear definition or established process for initiating an impeachment investigation. House leadership believes committees can engage in such investigations without specific authorization, while others argue for adopting an authorizing resolution. Some argue that adopting an authorizing resolution for impeachment investigations is useful to empower and direct a committee, providing clear House support. Despite lacking explicit authorization like in past investigations, recent House actions may fulfill this requirement, especially for court proceedings. The Rules Committee report states that House committees have the necessary authority under Article I of the Constitution for judicial proceedings, such as impeachment investigations. The White House argues that without a formal authorizing resolution from the House, committees are not engaged in impeachment investigations. Litigation challenges may arise due to courts historically deferring to the House's internal powers. An impeachment investigation involves various areas where courts are hesitant to question the House and its committees, including the House's sole power of impeachment and authority to set its own rules. Judicial recognition of an impeachment investigation may only require presenting enough evidence tied to the impeachment process. While courts have intervened to ensure committees stay within their delegated authority, they generally defer to the House's internal powers. The House General Counsel has asserted that the House may not need to vote to authorize the Committee to investigate impeachment, as it is overseen by the Bipartisan Legal Advocacy Group. While an explicit authorization from the House could remove ambiguity, the current focus on this issue may give the impression that an impeachment inquiry is the only way for Congress to investigate allegations. Congress can investigate executive branch misconduct through impeachment or legislative investigations. Impeachment inquiries may provide access advantages, especially if executive privilege is invoked. However, Congress's ability to access information from the executive branch in legislative investigations is substantial. The significance of obtaining information through an impeachment inquiry compared to a traditional legislative investigation may not always be as significant as perceived. House committees have the authority to investigate executive branch misconduct, including criminal activity, even without invoking impeachment power. Courts recognize Congress's broad investigative powers to inquire into government officials' conduct for legislative purposes. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's broad investigative powers to probe into federal government departments for corruption, inefficiency, or waste. This includes the authority to expose misconduct in government agencies through tools like subpoenas and other legislative leverage available to House committees and individual Members. The House's access to information during an impeachment inquiry is compared to legislative investigations, both serving as checks on executive power. Recent changes to House Rules allow committees to gather information promptly, regardless of full committee participation. The House's impeachment inquiries differ from legislative investigations in terms of frequency and procedural rights granted to the subject. For example, the House has conducted numerous legislative investigations but comparatively few impeachment investigations of executive branch officials. Additionally, impeachment investigations have historically granted the President certain procedural rights, such as the right to respond to evidence and raise objections to testimony. The Judiciary Committee's power to issue subpoenas in impeachment investigations has been altered to ensure a fair and bipartisan investigation. If the Chairman and Ranking Member disagree on issuing a subpoena, the decision is settled by a vote of the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee's power to issue subpoenas in impeachment investigations is subject to a vote if the Chairman and Ranking Member disagree. This provision has been criticized for potentially undermining the minority's subpoena power. The extent of the House's investigative authority during impeachment investigations is unclear, with limited historical and judicial precedents available for analysis. There have been few impeachment investigations of executive branch officials, none of which have been resolved in court. The House asserts a robust right of access to information for impeachment investigations, viewing it as a broad and unlimited power. The executive and judicial branches cannot impede the House's sole power to impeach. The Supreme Court has compared the House's right to information in impeachment investigations to that of a court of law. The House asserts a broad and unlimited power of access to information for impeachment investigations, likening it to a court of law. The need for a fair inquiry based on all pertinent information is crucial, especially in cases involving the President. President James K. Polk acknowledged the House's authority in impeachment investigations, stating it would reach into the most secret areas of the Executive Department. President James K. Polk acknowledged the House's authority in impeachment investigations, stating it would reach into the most secret areas of the Executive Department and provide all necessary assistance for the inquiry. The House's access to relevant information in impeachment investigations is crucial for ensuring presidential accountability, especially since impeachment may be one of the few available methods for holding a sitting President accountable. Impeachment and removal may be necessary to hold a President accountable for criminal conduct. Broad access to evidence is crucial for the House to accuse and maintain its role as a check on the executive branch. Constitutional limitations may apply to congressional investigative activity. Constitutional principles, including the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, may apply in impeachment investigations. Executive privilege may be less of an obstacle in impeachment investigations. Impeachment investigations involve political and judicial phases, impacting decision-making in all branches of government. The impact of an impeachment investigation on decision making in all branches of government is political in nature, involving negotiation and accommodation influenced by legal and political levers. Congress can use various tools such as restrictions on appropriations, changes to executive branch authority, delay of nominations, and enforcement of subpoenas. The executive branch can leverage its information to delay or maintain the status quo in disputes with Congress. Most conflicts are resolved through negotiation, with options like compliance, narrowing inquiries, or reaching agreements. The impact of an impeachment investigation on interbranch disputes is uncertain due to the rarity of impeachments of executive officials. During an impeachment investigation, the executive branch's compliance decisions may be influenced by the potential exercise of impeachment power and resulting political pressure. Past presidents like Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton have cooperated with House impeachment investigations, but impeachment is not a guaranteed solution for access to information. During an impeachment investigation, the threat of impeachment for contempt of Congress can compel compliance with committee demands for information from the executive branch. This leverage was seen in past cases involving Presidents Nixon and Clinton, where noncompliance led to potential impeachment. In contrast, legislative investigations have limited tools to enforce subpoenas. The primary method for enforcing compliance with a subpoena is through the judiciary in a civil enforcement action. The Senate Watergate Committee pursued this route when President Nixon refused to comply with subpoenas for White House tapes. The House Judiciary Committee, during its impeachment investigation of President Nixon, chose not to litigate enforcement of its subpoenas, as it believed the courts had no role in the impeachment process. Instead, the Committee obtained information from other sources and recommended an article of impeachment based on Nixon's failure to comply. During the Clinton impeachment, the Judiciary Committee recommended an article of impeachment for the President's failure to respond to requests and providing false information. This leverage can be used in political negotiations, and if there is an impasse, the judiciary may be asked to intervene. The ongoing disagreement between the legislative and executive branches may be resolved through political accommodations or legal principles applied by federal judges. Courts rarely intervene in information access disputes, but this has become more common in recent years, especially regarding House subpoenas. The preference for political solutions over judicial ones has historically been the norm, with the courts only becoming involved in investigative disputes in the 1970s. The courts have historically avoided adjudicating investigative disputes between the executive and legislative branches, preferring political resolutions. Lower federal courts suggest delaying judicial intervention until settlement options are exhausted. Interbranch subpoena disputes in impeachment investigations have never been resolved by the courts due to constitutional limitations and the House's preference for political solutions. The House and courts have historically avoided judicial involvement in impeachment investigations, preferring political resolutions. Any attempt by the House to seek judicial enforcement of a subpoena in an impeachment inquiry may complicate the case due to the judiciary's limited role in such matters. The courts have the authority to adjudicate subpoena enforcement cases during an impeachment investigation, but they may choose to leave resolution to the political branches to avoid judicial involvement. This could limit the House's ability to enforce subpoenas issued to the executive branch. The House may need to find alternative methods to enforce subpoenas issued to the executive branch, potentially through impeachment. An impeachment investigation could strengthen the House's legal position in obtaining information through the judiciary, including access to grand jury materials and overcoming limitations on committee actions. These factors are relevant to current investigations into President Trump's conduct. An impeachment investigation could enhance the House's ability to obtain information, including access to grand jury materials, and overcome executive privilege claims. House committees have significant authority to gather information, but face challenges in obtaining evidence from the Trump Administration. The House's impeachment investigation could provide access to grand jury materials from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. The Department of Justice has cited Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to prevent disclosure, but past precedents suggest a court may grant access to such materials for an impeachment investigation. The grand jury rule broadly encompasses revealing what occurred in the grand jury room. Courts have allowed Congress access to grand jury materials for impeachment investigations, considering them as preliminary to a judicial proceeding. An impeachment trial in the Senate is seen as a judicial proceeding, and the House investigation as preliminary to that trial. The House investigation preliminary to impeachment is considered a 'judicial proceeding' and is within the scope of the Rule. Court opinions have determined that committee legislative investigations do not qualify as judicial proceedings, even when requesting grand jury materials for oversight responsibilities. Grand jury materials were disclosed during the Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquiries, with ambiguity in the legal reasoning for those disclosures. In the Nixon impeachment investigation, the House Judiciary Committee requested access to evidence presented to the court by the grand jury. Judge Sirica concluded that disclosure of grand jury materials to the House Committee was proper and obligatory, without a detailed discussion of Rule 6(e). He based his decision on factors such as favoring disclosure to those with a legitimate interest, the lack of objection from the President, and the importance of allowing access in an impeachment investigation. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this decision in Haldeman v. Sirica. The D.C. Circuit affirmed Judge Sirica's decision in Haldeman v. Sirica, agreeing with the disclosure of grand jury materials to the House Committee for impeachment investigations. Independent Counsel Ken Starr was also authorized to provide grand jury material in connection to the Clinton impeachment. The reasoning behind these decisions was not explicitly stated, leading to ambiguity in interpreting Rule 6(e)'s application. The D.C. Circuit authorized Independent Counsel Ken Starr to provide necessary material to the House of Representatives for the Clinton impeachment, citing expired statutory requirements. This decision was influenced by the Independent Counsel Statute and Rule 6(e) regarding impeachment investigations. While there is precedent for a committee in an impeachment investigation to access grand jury materials, courts have also allowed disclosure during legislative investigations. Congress may have a \"constitutionally independent legal right\" to obtain information for legitimate legislative activity, overriding Rule 6(e) restrictions. For instance, a Florida court ruled that a congressional subcommittee engaged in legitimate legislative activity could access grand jury information. The court ruled that a committee engaged in legitimate legislative investigative activity has a right to access grand jury material despite Rule 6(e) restrictions. This decision was based on the interpretation of the Speech or Debate Clause and a desire to prevent constitutional conflicts between branches. Congress is likely to obtain grand jury materials for impeachment investigations, but there are arguments that committees can also access such material for traditional legislative purposes. The Trump Administration argues that some House investigations lack a \"legislative purpose\" but courts have rejected this. Congress has broad authority to obtain information for legislative investigations, but it must aid the legislative function. This authority extends to impeachment investigations as well. The Supreme Court limits investigative power to inquiries aiding the legislative function, requiring a valid legislative purpose. This requirement is broad, allowing investigations on topics for potential legislation or oversight of the executive branch's compliance with laws. It rarely restricts investigations, especially concerning government officials. The Supreme Court limits Congress's investigative power to inquiries aiding the legislative function, requiring a valid legislative purpose. Congress exceeds its authority when investigating private conduct unrelated to legislation or when probing functions exclusively under another branch of government. The Supreme Court restricts Congress's investigative power to matters aiding legislation, prohibiting inquiries into areas under the Judiciary or Executive branches. The D.C. Circuit reaffirmed this limitation, stating that congressional investigators cannot delve into subjects where no constitutional statute exists. The legislative purpose requirement may not significantly constrain a committee's impeachment investigation, depending on whether the inquiry is based on the House's general legislative power or the Constitution's impeachment provisions. The legislative purpose requirement may not significantly constrain a committee's impeachment investigation, depending on the source of authority for the inquiry. If the authority comes from Article I's vesting of legislative power, the requirement likely applies, but if it derives directly from the House's impeachment power, the restriction may not apply. The scope of an impeachment investigation is primarily governed by the need to assist the House in carrying out its impeachment power. The scope of an impeachment investigation is determined by its relationship to the House's impeachment role. Once meeting the threshold requirement, the investigation can include any matter \"reasonably relevant\" to possible impeachment. The legislative purpose requirement is unlikely to restrict the investigation significantly. In legislative investigations of presidential misconduct, the requirement for a legislative purpose is narrow. Courts have upheld Congress's authority to investigate illegal conduct of a President, even before impeachment proceedings, rejecting attempts to block subpoenas for financial records. The scope of an impeachment investigation is determined by its relevance to possible impeachment, with the legislative purpose requirement unlikely to significantly restrict the investigation. The D.C. Circuit affirmed in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP that the Committee's subpoena was valid for legislative investigations of presidential misconduct. The court upheld the Committee's articulated legislative purpose, including reviewing laws and pending legislation, despite also investigating potential criminal wrongdoing by the President. The D.C. Circuit affirmed in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP that the Committee's subpoena was valid for legislative investigations of presidential misconduct. The court held that the committee's interest in alleged misconduct aligns with its legislative purpose, and legislation requiring presidential disclosure of financial information is within Congress's power. The dissenting judge argued that investigations of impeachable offenses are not within Congress's legislative authority. The majority opinion in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP affirmed that impeachment investigations are within Congress's power, with deference to Congress in deciding when to move from legislative investigation to impeachment. The legislative purpose requirement is unlikely to hinder information access in an impeachment investigation. The requirement of a legislative purpose does not pose a significant obstacle to information access in an impeachment investigation. Executive privilege has been used to justify noncompliance with committee subpoenas in House investigations, with courts potentially preferring political resolution over intervention. If a court were to address a privilege dispute, there are reasons to believe that a committee involved in an impeachment inquiry would have legal standing. Executive privilege is a term used to describe the President's power to resist disclosure of crucial information for the executive branch. There are different privileges, including the presidential communications privilege, that may allow committees in impeachment investigations to access certain material covered by the privilege. The presidential communications privilege, deliberative process privilege, and law enforcement privilege are key components of executive privilege. Each privilege protects different types of communications within the executive branch. The specific privilege asserted in response to a subpoena is crucial in a congressional investigation. The presidential communications privilege, deliberative process privilege, and law enforcement privilege are key components of executive privilege. These privileges protect different types of communications within the executive branch. While the presidential communications privilege derives from the Constitution, the deliberative process privilege appears to arise from common law. The law enforcement privilege is asserted to derive from the President's powers under Article II and constitutionally based individual trial and privacy rights. None of these executive privileges, even if covering subpoenaed information, present an absolute bar to congressional access. The Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon stated that in executive privilege disputes, courts must balance the interests of each branch. The privilege can be overcome with a sufficient showing of need, as seen in Nixon where the President's interest in confidentiality yielded to a specific need for evidence in a criminal trial. The type of privilege, executive need for confidentiality, and Congress's interest in the information can all impact judicial outcomes. The Supreme Court has not addressed executive privilege in legislative or impeachment investigations. The D.C. Circuit's decision in Senate Select Committee v. Nixon addressed executive privilege in the congressional context, involving a subpoena for recordings of conversations between President Nixon and advisers. The court ruled that a President's privilege could be overcome by a strong showing of need by another government institution, allowing Congress to obtain critical evidence for its investigative powers. The Senate Watergate Committee argued for access to Nixon's tapes to fulfill its oversight and lawmaking functions, but the circuit court rejected their claims. The circuit court rejected the Senate Watergate Committee's arguments for access to Nixon's tapes, stating that the need was too tangential to its functions. The court considered the tapes had already been provided to the House Judiciary Committee and partial transcripts had been released publicly by the President, impacting the assessment of the Senate Watergate Committee's need for the tapes. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the content of Nixon's tapes was not crucial for legislative decisions by the Watergate Committee. The court suggested that a different outcome might have occurred if the tapes were sought for an impeachment investigation. The district court had previously stated that demands for tapes related to impeachment would be more significant. The D.C. Circuit compared the oversight function of the Senate Watergate Committee to the impeachment function of the House Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has begun an inquiry into presidential impeachment, with investigative authority derived from the Constitution. The court did not clearly weigh one function against the other but acknowledged Congress's oversight power beyond legislative responsibilities. The Supreme Court suggested that impeachment investigations may be treated differently from legislative investigations, with a focus on addressing misconduct by federal officials and preserving the separation of powers. This could lead to a more favorable balance for congressional access in invoking executive privilege. The Supreme Court indicated that impeachment investigations, focused on addressing misconduct by federal officials and preserving separation of powers, should be given deference over executive branch confidentiality interests. Congress has historically viewed its power to obtain information for impeachment investigations as extensive, with executive privilege unable to block access to relevant information. The House Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment investigation emphasized the importance of congressional inquiry in impeachment proceedings. The House's need for information in an impeachment investigation is equated to that of a court in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court weighed the privilege in United States v. Nixon in the context of a criminal trial subpoena. The Judiciary Committee argues that a generalized Presidential interest in confidentiality cannot prevail over the fundamental need to obtain all relevant facts in the impeachment process. The need for all relevant facts in an impeachment process is crucial, with concerns about executive privilege not being used to conceal wrongdoing. Courts have emphasized the importance of disclosure frequency in balancing executive privilege, as seen in cases like Nixon and Dellums v Powell. The court's reasoning suggests a willingness to order disclosure in rare impeachment investigations compared to more common legislative investigations. Specific factual evidence is deemed crucial in impeachment proceedings, with courts emphasizing the importance of disclosure frequency in balancing executive privilege. The court distinguished between legislative and grand jury investigations, highlighting that legislative judgments are based on predicted consequences and political acceptability, while grand juries focus on determining probable cause for specific crimes. The court found no comparable need for detailed fact-finding in the legislative process, especially in the context of impeachment proceedings. Impeachment investigations require a more exacting factual record compared to legislative judgments. Impeachment decisions involve specific findings of wrongdoing to support the impeachment of a federal official. While committees engaged in impeachment investigations may have a better chance of overcoming executive privilege, committees in legislative investigations may also obtain protected information. The executive branch has voluntarily disclosed information to Congress despite initial claims of protection. Legislative investigations can overcome claims of executive privilege if the evidence is crucial to fulfilling the committee's function. Impeachment investigations, exclusive to the House of Representatives, require a strong factual record. The House of Representatives has exclusive power for impeachment investigations, which strengthens its investigative authorities to obtain information from the executive branch. This power is not always necessary as Congress has broad authority to access sensitive information for legislative purposes, oversight, or impeachment inquiries."
