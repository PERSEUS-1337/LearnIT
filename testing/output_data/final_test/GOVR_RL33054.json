    "content": "The United States is facing two major demographic changes - the aging population and a slowdown in population growth. This will increase the dependency ratio, especially the old-age dependency ratio. While this reflects longer life expectancy, concerns arise about how a smaller workforce will support a larger number of dependents without affecting the standard of living. Solutions to prevent this include increasing productivity and encouraging immigration. One way to prevent the challenges of an aging population and a smaller workforce is to increase productivity or encourage immigration. Another suggestion is that older individuals may extend their working lives due to longer life expectancy, but there are obstacles to this, such as job loss and health issues. Older displaced workers facing job loss may struggle to delay retirement, impacting society by potentially depleting retirement savings and relying on government assistance. Even if reemployed in lower-paying jobs, they may not save enough for retirement, leading to potential eligibility for means-tested aid. This report examines the labor market experiences of these older workers. This report analyzes the labor market experiences of older workers who have lost long-held jobs involuntarily, such as factory workers affected by import competition or IT workers whose jobs were outsourced. It also looks at current policies aimed at reemploying older displaced workers to keep them in the workforce longer. Definitions of displaced and older workers vary, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Displaced Worker Supplement to track these groups. The Displaced Worker Supplement (DWS) is part of the Population Survey (CPS) and has been administered every two years since the mid-1980s to determine the characteristics and labor market outcomes of adults who lost jobs due to various reasons. The Bureau of Labor Statistics includes only workers with at least three years of tenure in their definition of displaced workers. Analysts may not always apply this tenure screen, and researchers may define older workers based on age criteria. The Health Retirement Study (HRS) survey focuses on individuals over 50, examining displacement among older workers due to job loss. Researchers also use unemployment insurance (UI) records for detailed estimates, as it covers workers in a state and provides earnings histories over several years. According to DWS data, over 900,000 workers aged 55 and older with at least three years of tenure were displaced during 2005-2007. Older workers comprised one in four long-tenured workers displaced during this period. The displacement rate for older workers compared to younger workers has fluctuated over time, with some analyses suggesting an increase in the relative rate of displacement among older workers from the 1980s to the 1990s. During the 1980s to the 1990s, older white-collar workers, aged 40 to 64, faced a heightened risk of job loss due to corporate restructuring and position abolishment. Job tenure, not age, drives displacement trends, making older workers more vulnerable in the future. Displaced older workers experience more adverse consequences compared to younger workers, with unfavorable labor market outcomes. Older displaced workers face longer spells of unemployment compared to younger workers, with 20% of those aged 55 and older experiencing unemployment for six months or more. This is two weeks longer than the median period for reemployed workers aged 25 to 54 who were displaced between 2005 and 2007. Older workers also tend to exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits more often, possibly due to a preference for leisure. Older displaced workers face longer spells of unemployment compared to younger workers, with a lower reemployment rate. The longer unemployment spells and larger earnings losses of older workers are attributed to their inferior job prospects, with fewer than one in five workers aged 65 and older finding new jobs. Older displaced workers have lower employment rates compared to older nondisplaced workers, especially in their 60s. The impact of displacement on employment status is long-lasting, with only 60% of men and 55% of women who lost their jobs at 55 years of age being employed two years later. The employment gap remains significant even four years after termination, with older displaced workers experiencing about a 20% lower employment rate than their nondisplaced counterparts. This disparity is attributed to the limited job opportunities older jobseekers typically encounter. Older jobseekers face restricted employment opportunities due to age discrimination, lawful considerations of employers, steep wage profiles, defined benefit pensions, and high demand for computer skills. The labor market structure is not conducive for later retirement, leading to constrained access to jobs for older workers. Older workers may face challenges in finding new jobs due to age discrimination and higher health care costs. Employers with health benefit plans tend to hire fewer workers aged 55-64. Despite arguments that older workers could absorb higher costs by accepting lower wages, data shows that reemployed older workers do not experience greater tradeoffs. Labor markets in the US have shown adaptability over the years. Labor markets in the US have shown adaptability over the years, with firms adjusting compensation structures in response to changes. Older workers may face challenges in finding new jobs due to age discrimination and higher health care costs, leading to involuntary withdrawal from the labor market. Older job losers disproportionately leave the labor force, despite efforts to absorb higher costs by accepting lower wages. Older workers may withdraw from the labor market due to challenges in finding new jobs, including age discrimination and higher health care costs. This is especially true for those 65 or older, who may also have access to other sources of income like Social Security benefits. Additionally, older displaced workers who find new full-time jobs often earn less than they did before. Older workers displaced from full-time positions often experience lower wages in their new jobs, especially if they had accumulated substantial tenure in their previous job. This loss of earnings is more significant for older workers compared to younger ones, who are more likely to have lost high-tenure jobs. Additionally, more workers aged 55 and above who lost long-held full-time jobs ended up working part-time in 2008. When older workers are displaced from full-time positions, they often experience lower wages in their new part-time jobs. Real earnings decrease with age, with workers aged 60 and above facing the largest decrease of 34.4%. Displaced workers continue to earn significantly less for up to 10-12 years after termination, with some experiencing reduced earnings for the rest of their working years. Older workers who are displaced from full-time positions often face lower wages in new part-time jobs. A study using HRS data found that reemployed retirees and displaced workers experienced greater wage decreases compared to those who quit for other reasons. Older displaced workers saw pay cuts averaging 12%, with males who held their job for 10+ years experiencing a 20% drop in earnings upon reemployment. Many older workers who were laid off found new jobs in different industries, contributing to their substantial wage losses. Two in five older men displaced from long-term jobs lacked pension coverage upon reemployment. Older workers changing industries faced significant earnings decreases, especially those from mass layoffs. Loss of firm-specific skills impacted earnings for displaced factory workers. Earnings losses were larger for older displaced workers, with a marked decrease in pension benefits. Delaying retirement did not significantly increase pension wealth for older displaced males. Lower earnings and reduced pension gains dampened motivation to find another job after displacement. The study found that earnings and pension losses did not significantly impact the high retirement rates of older displaced workers. Other obstacles such as employer reluctance to train older individuals and age discrimination may better explain the trend. Programs like the Dislocated Worker program and Trade Adjustment Assistance are available to help displaced workers find new employment. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program is limited to workers who have lost jobs due to imports or shifts in production outside the US. It provides reemployment assistance beyond what the Dislocated Worker program offers, including relocation allowances. TAA aims to address reemployment barriers and financial disincentives for older displaced workers. The programs draw upon public funds to provide training for older workers, addressing employer reluctance and high demand for computer skills. While training can expand job opportunities, taxpayer-subsidized training does not guarantee a job at the end. Few evaluations have been conducted on training programs for displaced workers, with some focusing more on job search assistance or reemployment bonuses. Publicly subsidized training aims to compensate workers for job loss due to economic changes, unlike unemployment insurance which only provides short-term compensation during job search. Some analysts suggest that retraining may not be suitable for all displaced workers, and alternative solutions should be considered. The Trade Act of 2002 established the ATAA program for older workers eligible for TAA, providing a wage supplement for two years if they take a lower-paying job within 26 weeks of job loss. The supplement is funded by the Federal Unemployment Account and equals 50% of the wage difference, up to $10,000 over two years. Wage insurance can enhance reemployment prospects for displaced workers by bridging the gap between old and new job wages, with a maximum of $10,000 over two years. It encourages workers to consider lower-paying positions and offers on-the-job training for increased productivity and potential pay raises. The time-limited supplement also incentivizes quicker reemployment, reducing UI costs and keeping workers in the labor force. The Canadian Earnings Supplement Project aimed to assess the impact of a wage insurance program on reemployment of displaced workers. The program offered a two-year supplement to replace 75% of earnings lost for those finding lower-paying full-time jobs within 26 weeks. However, only about 20% of eligible workers received payments, indicating challenges in quickly securing new employment. The Canadian Earnings Supplement Project offered a wage insurance program to displaced workers, but only 20% received payments due to challenges in finding new employment quickly. The program did not significantly impact job search timing or intensity, nor did it lower unemployment insurance costs. While there was a small difference in full-time reemployment rates between supplement and control group members, this difference diminished over time, with rates essentially equal after one year. The Canadian Earnings Supplement Project had little impact on job search timing or intensity and did not lower unemployment insurance costs. The supplement had a noticeable effect on compensation for recipients, with older workers facing challenges in finding full-time reemployment. Age was a significant factor in reemployment rates, with older workers and those with long tenure experiencing reduced probabilities of finding full-time positions. The U.S. experience with the ATAA program faced implementation problems, hindering worker access to wage supplements. Only 19 states had the wage insurance program running in 2003 due to difficulties in creating separate payment systems. Wage insurance and training focus on the supply side and do not address demand-side barriers to reemployment. The Senior Community Service Employment Program is the only federal program targeting limited job opportunities for older unemployed workers. The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) creates part-time public service jobs for individuals aged 55 and older with low incomes and poor job prospects. Raising the Social Security eligibility age may not delay retirements for older displaced workers due to demand-side obstacles. This could lead to unplanned retirements, reduced circumstances, and reliance on government benefits. Older workers wanting to extend their working lives through non-career jobs may also face challenges due to these obstacles."
