    "content": "The Act, known as the \"Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act,\" aims to expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor, which holds significant natural and cultural resources. This expansion would provide new opportunities for the National Park Service to engage urban communities, particularly those underrepresented in national parks. The National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 is amended to adjust the boundaries of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area by adding the Rim of the Valley Unit. The Secretary is required to update the general management plan within 3 years to reflect these new boundaries. The Rim of the Valley Unit is to be administered by the Secretary as part of the recreation area, with land acquisition limited to exchange, donation, or purchase from willing sellers. Activities or land visible from within the unit do not automatically restrict uses up to its boundary. The Rim of the Valley Unit management plan does not modify laws regarding public access to non-Federal land, create liability for private property owners, establish buffer zones outside the unit, impact ownership rights of non-Federal land, or require local government participation. The Rim of the Valley Unit management plan does not alter existing rights or responsibilities of states or local agencies, require local government participation, promote trespass on non-Federal lands without consent, or impact water resource facilities within or adjacent to the unit. The Rim of the Valley Unit management plan does not interfere with existing rights or responsibilities of states or local agencies, or impact water resource facilities within or adjacent to the unit. The Rim of the Valley Unit management plan ensures that activities of utility and water resource facilities within the unit are conducted to minimize impact on resources. Utility facilities include electric substations and communication structures, while water resource facilities encompass irrigation and pumping facilities, dams, and water conservation works. Water conservation works, including debris protection facilities, sediment placement sites, rain gauges, stream gauges, recycled water facilities, conveyance distribution systems, water treatment facilities, aqueducts, canals, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, transmission facilities, groundwater recharge facilities, water filtration plants, and other water diversion structures."
