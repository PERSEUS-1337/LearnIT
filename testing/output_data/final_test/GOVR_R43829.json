    "content": "Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a deadly communicable disease primarily found in Africa. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. The United States has experienced imported cases from West Africa, leading to the first instances of Ebola transmission within the country. State and federal governments are responding to the outbreak. The federal and state governments have taken measures to respond to domestic Ebola cases and prevent further spread of the virus. Questions arise about the effectiveness of these responses due to the high fatality rate of Ebola. The current outbreak raises civil rights issues regarding individual liberty versus the common good. This report provides an overview of state and federal authorities used to prevent Ebola transmission and potential limits under current law. Efforts to prevent further spread of Ebola focus on restricting movement of exposed or infected individuals through quarantine and isolation measures. Federal and state authorities have jurisdiction over these measures, including entry restrictions at the U.S. border and limits on international air travel. Quarantine separates exposed individuals, while isolation separates infected individuals. Federal government oversees interstate and border quarantine. The federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and border quarantine, with authority derived from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, with the power to apprehend, detain, or release individuals based on an executive order listing specific diseases. The CDC has quarantine authority for communicable diseases listed in Executive Order 13295. Quarantine measures are carried out at 20 ports of entry and land-border crossings, including international airports in various cities. Federal regulations allow for the apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional release of individuals. Section 361 of the PHS Act authorizes the apprehension and examination of individuals reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage, allowing for detention if necessary. Regulations for quarantine authority can be found in Parts 70 and 71 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Director of the CDC is authorized to prevent the spread of communicable diseases between states by prohibiting infected persons from traveling without a permit. Federal-state cooperative activities under Section 311 of the PHS Act allow for enforcement of quarantines, with the federal government able to assist states and localities in enforcing health regulations. The federal government can authorize quarantine and isolation, but primary authority lies with states. CDC defers to state and local health authorities for quarantine powers, using federal authority only in rare situations. State quarantine laws vary widely. State and local quarantine laws vary widely, with some states requiring a court order for detention. Diseases subject to quarantine may be defined by statute, and the duration of quarantine is determined based on public health threat. Federal authority over interstate and foreign travel is limited. During a public health emergency, federal, state, and local authorities may have overlapping quarantine authority. Coordination between government levels is crucial. Constitutional rights like due process and equal protection may be affected by quarantine orders. Legal challenges to quarantine orders are limited, with some cases providing insights. In United States v. Shinnick (1963), a court upheld a quarantine for a passenger who had been in Stockholm, Sweden. The court upheld the isolation of a passenger from Stockholm, Sweden, declared a smallpox-infected area by the WHO, due to lack of vaccination proof. State courts require due process for quarantine, including notice and right to counsel. Quarantines may face equal protection challenges, as seen in Jew Ho v. Williamson. The court invalidated a quarantine targeting Chinese residents as discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment. Federal law allows restrictions on entry for those suspected of carrying diseases like Ebola. Foreign nationals can be denied entry based on health grounds defined by the Secretary of HHS. Foreign nationals suspected of carrying diseases like Ebola can be denied entry into the United States based on health grounds defined by the Secretary of HHS. This exclusion does not apply to most lawful permanent resident aliens who briefly travel abroad. The determination of inadmissibility on health-related grounds is based on individual assessment rather than a general bar for those who may have had contact with a person carrying a communicable disease. It is not guaranteed that a foreign national carrying Ebola virus will be identified. Foreign nationals suspected of carrying diseases like Ebola can be denied entry into the United States based on health grounds. However, it is not assured that a foreign national carrying the Ebola virus will be identified, whether when applying for a visa or upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Some Members of Congress have suggested a blanket ban on admitting foreign nationals from Ebola-stricken countries, a proposal opposed by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration has opposed a suggestion to implement a blanket ban on admitting foreign nationals from Ebola-stricken countries. Section 212(f) of the INA allows the President to deny entry to any alien or class of aliens deemed detrimental to U.S. interests, potentially including those from regions with Ebola outbreaks. This restriction would apply to foreign nationals, not U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad have a constitutional right to reenter the country, with heavier burdens on the government to justify restrictions. Travel restrictions may affect all individuals, regardless of citizenship, from traveling to the U.S. from countries with Ebola transmission. Nonstop flights from West African countries with Ebola to the U.S. are currently unavailable, with about 150 passengers daily traveling to the U.S. via connecting flights. On October 21, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security announced enhanced screening procedures for passengers arriving in the United States from countries affected by Ebola. Restrictions were later extended to include passengers originating from Mali due to new confirmed cases. The concept of national sovereignty over airspace has long been established in international agreements. The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty over its airspace, regulated by the FAA to ensure safety and security in air commerce. The FAA can restrict airspace use and prevent entry of aircraft, as well as regulate U.S. carriers in other countries' airspace. During the Ebola outbreak, the FAA acknowledged its authority to restrict U.S. airspace but stated that decisions based on public health would involve other federal agencies. The FAA has not restricted airspace solely for public health reasons in the past. The Do Not Board (DNB) list was created by the DHS and CDC in 2007 to prevent the spread of communicable diseases by restricting individuals who pose a serious public health threat from boarding commercial flights in the United States. State and local health officials contact the CDC to place a person on the DNB list if they are likely contagious with a communicable disease. The CDC determines if a person is likely contagious with a serious public health threat, unaware of public health recommendations, or likely to board a commercial aircraft. Once on the DNB list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass for any commercial flight. Buses and trains are not covered. Noncontagious patients must be removed within 24 hours. Airlines are not legally obligated to transport individuals on the DNB list. Airlines have clauses in their contracts of carriage allowing them to deny transportation to passengers who may pose a safety risk, including those who are unable to complete a flight safely or have a communicable disease. Despite these clauses, airlines must still comply with federal nondiscrimination laws. The CDC has issued guidance for airline crew to identify passengers infected with Ebola. Federal law requires immediate reporting to CDC if there is a death or illness on board a commercial aircraft. The CDC has issued guidance for airline crew to identify passengers infected with Ebola, including managing ill passengers on board and cleaning aircraft to reduce the risk of spreading the disease. The World Health Assembly adopted a revision of its International Health Regulations in 2005, broadening the scope beyond just three diseases. The International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005 expanded beyond just three diseases to address existing, new, and re-emergent diseases, as well as emergencies caused by non-infectious agents. The IHR(2005) include provisions on national points of contact, core public health capacities, disease control measures, and require control measures recommended by WHO to be no more restrictive than necessary. The regulations represent a balance between sovereign rights and a commitment to prevent the international spread of disease. The International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005 expanded beyond three diseases to address various health emergencies. The IHR(2005) do not have an enforcement mechanism but rely on negotiation and arbitration for dispute resolution. The United States accepted the IHR(2005) with reservations, including implementing it in line with U.S. federalism principles. Member states must develop public health infrastructure for full compliance within five years. Article 6 requires notifying WHO of potential Public Health Emergencies of International Concern. The International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005 define a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" as an extraordinary event that poses a public health risk to other countries and may require a coordinated international response. Mandatory WHO notification is triggered for certain diseases like smallpox and SARS, while reporting for other diseases, such as Ebola, depends on factors like public health impact, international spread risk, and travel restrictions. The Ebola outbreak was declared a PHEIC by WHO in 2014. The WHO director-general declared a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" during the Ebola outbreak. Temporary recommendations were issued under the IHR(2005), allowing State Parties to implement measures for greater health protection as long as they are consistent with the IHR(2005) and not overly restrictive of international trade and travel. The director-general recommended no international travel for Ebola contacts or cases in affected countries. The WHO director-general declared a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" during the Ebola outbreak, issuing temporary recommendations under the IHR(2005). These recommendations included no international travel for Ebola contacts or cases in affected countries, with specific guidelines for isolation, treatment, and travel restrictions. In countries with intense Ebola transmission, exit screening in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is crucial for reducing the exportation of Ebola cases. Governments should maintain high-quality exit screening at international airports, seaports, and major land crossings for potential Ebola infections. The screening should include a questionnaire, temperature measurement, and assessment for Ebola virus disease. Civil rights issues may arise in governmental responses to infectious diseases like the Ebola outbreak, regarding the balance between individual liberty and the common good. The U.S. Constitution guarantees individual due process and equal protection rights, which may be limited as community needs change. Federal nondiscrimination laws may protect individuals exposed to Ebola in public places and workplaces. Employers may have the right to terminate employees under \"employment at will\" contracts if they cannot work due to illness. Hospitals and other employers may have specific obligations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act for employees treating Ebola patients. Discrimination against individuals with infectious diseases may be covered by various statutes such as the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Rehabilitation Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) protect individuals from discrimination based on disability. These laws define an individual with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that limits major life activities. The Rehabilitation Act and the ADA would likely protect individuals sick from Ebola virus or those who have recovered from EVD. It is unclear if individuals exposed to the virus but not sick would be covered. A symptomatic individual with EVD would qualify as having a disability, as it limits major life activities. Someone who has recovered from Ebola would also qualify. It is uncertain if an asymptomatic individual exposed to Ebola would be covered by the acts. The Rehabilitation Act and the ADA may protect individuals sick from Ebola virus or those who have recovered from EVD. It is uncertain if individuals exposed to the virus but not sick would be covered. The issue of contagious diseases and disability was addressed by the Supreme Court in the context of Section 504 in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, where a teacher with recurrent tuberculosis claimed discrimination based on disability. The laws do not specifically mention contagious diseases, leaving uncertainty on whether an individual regarded as contagious but not actually so would qualify as having a disability. The Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline addressed the issue of contagious diseases and disability. The Court held that a contagious disease can qualify as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. It emphasized the need for an individualized inquiry to determine if the plaintiff was qualified for her job while considering health and safety risks to others. The Court adopted the American Medical Association's test to assess if an employee poses a significant risk to others. The Court emphasized the need for an individualized inquiry to determine if individuals with contagious diseases pose a direct threat to others. The ADA allows employers to take actions against individuals with disabilities who pose a direct threat to others, defined as a significant risk to health or safety that cannot be eliminated by reasonable measures. Under Title III, businesses can deny accommodations to individuals with disabilities who pose a \"direct threat\" to the health or safety of others, defined as a significant risk that cannot be eliminated by reasonable measures. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission considers factors like the duration, nature, and likelihood of harm in determining a direct threat. Under Title III, businesses can deny accommodations to individuals with disabilities who pose a \"direct threat\" to the health or safety of others, defined as a significant risk that cannot be eliminated by reasonable measures. The Department of Justice interprets Title II to have similar \"direct threat\" allowances. Employers, businesses, and state/local programs can take steps to protect others from a contagious individual with EVD under the ADA. Non-contagious individuals cannot be discriminated against, and must be given full access under the ADA. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) prohibits discrimination by air carriers against individuals with disabilities. It applies to both foreign and U.S. carriers, prohibiting exclusion of qualified individuals with a disability from air transportation, except when permitted under regulations. Carriers cannot refuse transportation or delay passengers with communicable diseases unless there is a direct threat posed. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by air carriers, including delaying transportation or imposing conditions not imposed on other passengers. A passenger's condition is considered a direct threat if it poses a significant risk to others that cannot be eliminated. Carriers must make an individualized assessment based on current medical knowledge and may rely on directives from public health authorities like the CDC. If a direct threat is determined, the carrier must choose the least restrictive response. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by air carriers, including imposing conditions not imposed on other passengers. Carriers must assess if a passenger's condition poses a direct threat and choose the least restrictive response to protect health and safety. Violations may result in civil penalties by the Department of Transportation. In response to potential outbreaks, infection control measures like quarantine and isolation are critical. Quarantine and isolation may be effective for minimizing Ebola exposure but can raise employment concerns. The employment concerns related to quarantine and isolation orders may lead to job loss or wage issues for workers. Tort law could offer relief for terminated workers, while the Family and Medical Leave Act may protect infected workers with serious health conditions. Some jurisdictions have specific employment protections for workers under quarantine or isolation orders. The employment-at-will doctrine governs the relationship between employers and most private sector workers, allowing termination for any reason at any time. The employment-at-will doctrine allows termination for any reason at any time, but wrongful discharge claims can challenge this. Wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claims protect employees from being fired for activities beneficial to public welfare, such as refusing to commit unlawful acts. The claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy encompass four categories of conduct: refusing to commit unlawful acts, exercising statutory rights, fulfilling public obligations, and whistleblowing. States may have varying criteria for recognizing such claims, with Texas requiring termination for refusing to perform illegal acts or questioning the legality of employer instructions. Other actions beneficial to public welfare could also lead to a wrongful discharge claim. Some courts have broadly defined what constitutes \"public policy,\" indicating that it concerns what is right and just and affects the citizens collectively. Public policy is found in the State's constitution, statutes, and judicial decisions, holding that no one can lawfully do anything injurious to the public or against the public good. This suggests that an employee's isolation or quarantine during a pandemic in some states could potentially lead to a wrongful discharge claim. During a pandemic, an employee's isolation or quarantine may lead to a public policy exception to the at-will rule of employment. Courts could view termination of isolated individuals as violating public policy, especially if mandated by the government for public health reasons. This action would benefit the public good and could support a strong argument for the exception. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees eligible employees unpaid leave for various reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition. This could potentially support a public policy exception to the at-will rule of employment, especially during a pandemic when isolation or quarantine is mandated for public health reasons. The FMLA provides unpaid leave for employees with family members on active duty in the Armed Forces. It applies to employers with at least 50 employees and covers public agencies as well. Employees must have worked for at least 12 months and 1,250 hours to be eligible for leave benefits. The FMLA allows employees of public agencies to take unpaid leave for certain health conditions, including caring for infected relatives. Eligibility requirements must be met, such as working a specified number of weeks. The FMLA defines a serious health condition as an illness requiring inpatient care or continuing treatment. Employees exposed to Ebola may qualify for leave under the FMLA if eligibility criteria are satisfied. The FMLA grants leave to employees to care for relatives with serious health conditions, including those affected by Ebola. Employees can comply with quarantine orders without fear of termination for up to 12 workweeks. However, employees not exposed or responsible for care of an exposed relative are not protected by the FMLA. Some states have recognized this gap in protection for employees needing isolation or quarantine. Some states have enacted legislation to protect employees who are under isolation or quarantine, prohibiting their termination. Minnesota allows affected employees to seek reinstatement or recover lost wages. New Jersey and Maine also have laws requiring reinstatement or leave for employees in quarantine. Maine law requires employers to grant leave to employees under quarantine or isolation, which can be paid or unpaid. While federal law does not protect against termination for absences due to isolation or quarantine, there are similar protections under the FMLA for serious health conditions. Proposed expansions to the FMLA include paid leave for such conditions. USERRA also provides employee protection in these situations. The USERRA and FMLA provide employee protection for absences due to various reasons, including service in the uniformed services and serious health conditions. Employers may need to comply with OSHA standards to ensure workplace safety, especially in cases of potential exposure to the Ebola virus. OSHA standards, including the Bloodborne Pathogens, Personal Protective Equipment, and Respiratory Protection standards, apply to employee exposure to Ebola in the workplace. If no specific OSHA standard applies, employers must follow the General Duty Clause to provide a safe workplace free of recognized hazards. Noncompliance can result in penalties for employers, but the OSH Act does not offer monetary relief to employees. The Bloodborne Pathogens standard aims to prevent the spread of disease-causing microorganisms in the blood, including the Ebola virus. Employers subject to this standard must have written plans to minimize employee exposure to infectious materials, update them annually, and follow universal precautions. The Bloodborne Pathogens standard requires employers to manage employee behavior to minimize contact with infectious diseases by providing protective equipment and implementing universal precautions such as handwashing and proper disposal of sharp medical equipment. Employers must provide personal protective equipment (PPE) at no cost to employees to prevent exposure to infectious materials. The PPE standard requires assessment of workplace hazards and use of appropriate protective gear. This includes protection against potential exposure to Ebola through contact with infected bodily fluids. Employers must provide personal protective equipment (PPE) at no cost to employees to prevent exposure to hazards identified during the assessment, including bioaerosols containing Ebola virus. OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard mandates the provision of respirators and a written program for employee use. Employers must provide appropriate respirators to prevent exposure to hazards like Ebola virus under the General Duty Clause, which requires a safe workplace free from recognized hazards causing harm."
