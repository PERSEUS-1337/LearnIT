The project will last for a maximum of 2 years, with reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit annual and final reports to Congress on the demonstration project for reimbursement from Medicare for health services provided to Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries. The reports will include the number of beneficiaries opting to participate in the project. The demonstration project established under this section aims to study the impact of easier access to the military treatment system on the number of Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries receiving health benefits through the Medicare program. It will also provide a list of primary health insurance plans and programs for these beneficiaries before their participation in the project.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make monthly payments to the Department of Defense from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries enrolled in the TRICARE program. TRICARE Payments: Monthly payments made to DoD from Medicare Trust Funds for eligible military beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE program.

The payment under subsection (a) is made to medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries in a military treatment facility within the geographic region of the demonstration project. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services estimate a minimum enrollment number of beneficiaries before establishing the project.

A minimum level of health services must be provided to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries through military treatment facilities in each region before payment is made. The Department of Defense may receive payment under subsection (a)(2) based on the determination of baseline costs by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They establish the minimum enrollment number and level of health services to ensure equivalent projected expenditures for medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries.
