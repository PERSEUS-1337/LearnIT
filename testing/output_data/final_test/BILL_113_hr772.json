Territorial disputes exist over the Spratly and Paracel Islands among China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. China's 9-dotted line submission to the UN in 2009 raised concerns about its extensive claims in the South China Sea. In November 2012, China included a map of its territorial claims in its passports, despite protests from neighboring countries like Vietnam and the Philippines. The United States has a national interest in maintaining peace and stability in East Asia and Southeast Asia, while ASEAN has promoted multilateral talks in disputed areas without resolving sovereignty issues. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, committing to resolving territorial disputes peacefully without the use of force. In 2010, the US and South Korea conducted joint naval exercises in international waters near the site of a North Korean attack. In March 2010, a North Korean attack on a South Korean military vessel led to objections from Beijing over foreign operations in the Yellow Sea. Tensions escalated in September 2010 near the Senkaku Islands when a Chinese fishing vessel rammed Japanese Coast Guard boats. Subsequent incidents included a Chinese navy frigate firing at Filipino fishing boats and Chinese patrol boats attempting to ram a Philippine surveillance ship in 2011. In May 2011, a Chinese maritime security vessel cut the cables of a Vietnamese exploration ship in the South China Sea. On May 31, 2011, Chinese military vessels threatened Vietnamese fishing boats in the South China Sea near Cam Ranh Bay. Vietnam strongly opposed China's actions, which violated its sovereign rights in the region. Additionally, on June 9, 2011, Chinese vessels damaged the cables of a Vietnamese exploration ship in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone. The actions of the Government of China in the South China Sea have affected US military and maritime vessels, including collisions and harassment incidents. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the US national interest in freedom of navigation in Asia's maritime commons. In June 2012, China established the city of Sansha to oversee its claims in the South China Sea. The United States offered military hardware to the Philippines for modernization, and conducted naval exercises in the region. In July 2011, an Indian naval vessel was warned by a Chinese vessel for allegedly violating Chinese territorial waters. In July 2012, China established a Sansha garrison in the South China Sea. Chinese patrol ships were seen near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Former Secretary of State Clinton emphasized resolving disputes diplomatically without coercion or force at the July 2012 ASEAN Regional Forum. In November 2012, a regulation authorized Chinese maritime police to board, search, and take over ships in the South China Sea. Former Secretary of State Clinton stated the US does not take a position on the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands but acknowledges they are under Japan's administration, opposing unilateral actions and urging peaceful resolution of disagreements. On August 3, 2012, the Department of State expressed concern over China's actions in Sansha City and called for peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea. They encouraged ASEAN and China to work towards a Code of Conduct and urged claimants to use diplomatic or legal means for resolution. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. In light of congressional findings, Congress urges the Secretary of State to support peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea. They should condemn threats or force by Chinese and North Korean vessels and emphasize that threats and gunboat diplomacy are not constructive in resolving disputes. Congress supports diplomatic efforts by ASEAN, the United States, and its allies to resolve maritime disputes peacefully. They also back the United States Armed Forces' operations in international waters and air space in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and Yellow Sea to uphold freedom of navigation rights. The Secretary of State must submit a report on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea to relevant congressional committees within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The report should be unclassified, with the option of a classified annex if needed."
