The Secretary can revoke certification if linked to illness outbreaks, not meeting requirements, or denying US officials necessary audits. The Secretary can conduct audits and investigations to ensure compliance with food safety standards for certifications lasting up to 5 years. Inspections, independent audits, and renewals every 5 years are authorized to maintain certification. The Secretary can enforce importation restrictions on food from foreign countries or facilities that do not allow audits or investigations by US officials. Rules and regulations will be promulgated to fulfill the requirements of this section. The Secretary will establish terms for the destruction of products that do not meet standards. A transitional food safety import review program will be implemented within 180 days of the Act's enactment to minimize disruption to commerce until the food import certification program is in place.
