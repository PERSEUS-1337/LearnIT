    "content": "The Veterans Visa and Protection Act of 2016 may be cited as such. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Veterans Visa and Protection Act of 2016 defines key terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"deported veteran,\" \"noncitizen,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The term \"service member\" is defined as an individual serving in the Armed Forces on active duty. The term \"veteran\" has the meaning given in title 38, United States Code. SEC. 3. RETURN OF NONCITIZEN VETERANS REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES; STATUS FOR NONCITIZEN VETERANS IN THE UNITED STATES. The Secretary must establish a program for deported veterans to enter the US as permanent residents and cancel removal orders for noncitizen veterans who meet certain requirements. Deported veterans who meet eligibility requirements can adjust status to permanent residents without numerical limitations on the number of eligible veterans. Deported veterans meeting specific criteria can potentially adjust their status to permanent residents, with the possibility of a waiver for humanitarian reasons, family unity, exceptional service in the military, or public interest. SEC. 4. Protecting veterans and service members from removal unless convicted of a crime of violence. SEC. 5. Naturalization through service in the armed forces of the United States. A noncitizen with lawful permanent resident status can be eligible for naturalization through military service, disregarding past removal orders or periods of absence from the US. The requirement for naturalization through military service may not consider past removal orders or periods of absence from the US, focusing instead on continuous residence or physical presence. Noncitizens with permanent resident status are eligible for military and veterans benefits regardless of past removal orders or departures from the US. Implementation details are outlined in Section 7. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to identify cases of service members and veterans at risk of removal from the US by inquiring about their military status, seeking approval before initiating removal proceedings, and keeping records of those affected. The Secretary must annotate immigration records of service members and veterans identified as at risk of removal, including military branch, service during hostilities, immigration status at enlistment, honorable service status, and reasons for removal. The Secretary must annotate immigration records of service members and veterans at risk of removal, including military branch, service during hostilities, immigration status at enlistment, honorable service status, and reasons for removal, such as criminal convictions. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement its provisions."
