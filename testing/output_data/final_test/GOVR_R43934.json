    "content": "The President is required by federal law to submit an annual budget request to Congress by the first Monday in February. This budget outlines proposed spending levels, revenues, and deficit/surplus levels, as well as priorities for federal programs. President Obama submitted his FY2016 budget request on February 2, 2015. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. CMS is the largest healthcare purchaser in the US, covering 126 million individuals in FY2016. The President's budget request includes sections for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, private health insurance protections, Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, and program management. The President's budget includes legislative proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, and program management within CMS. The budget projects a total of $957.4 billion in mandatory and discretionary net outlays for FY2016. The President's FY2016 budget includes legislative proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, and program management. It projects total net outlays of $957.4 billion in FY2016, with an increase of $70.6 billion over FY2015. Adjustments to baseline Medicare spending are estimated to increase net outlays by $5.3 billion in FY2015 and $8.8 billion in FY2016. If implemented, the legislative proposals would further increase net outlays by $5.1 billion in FY2015. The President's FY2016 budget includes legislative proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, and program management. CMS's total net outlays would increase by $5.1 billion in FY2015 and $5.4 billion in FY2016. The estimated impact of the proposals and savings from program integrity activities would result in a $73.6 billion increase in CMS's net outlays for FY2016. The CMS budget is divided into various sections including Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, private health insurance protections, and program management. Medicare is a federal program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older. It has expanded to include individuals under 65 with certain medical conditions. Medicare consists of four parts (A-D) covering various health care services. The President's budget projects Medicare outlays to be $583.5 billion in FY2016. The President's budget projects Medicare outlays to be $583.5 billion in FY2016, with adjustments and legislative proposals estimated to increase total net mandatory and discretionary outlays to $590.5 billion, an increase of 10.1% over the previous year. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program jointly funded by the federal government and states. The President's budget projects total net outlays for Medicaid to be $344.4 billion in FY2016, an increase of 4.8% over FY2015. There is no cap on federal Medicaid funds states may receive. The budget includes legislative proposals that could impact Medicaid outlays. The President's budget estimates a $6.6 billion increase in Medicaid outlays for FY2016 and a $26.7 billion increase over the next 10 years. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control program focuses on combating healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, with expanded activities in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. The HCFAC funding is used to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid, with a total budget authority of $2.0 billion in FY2016. This includes $1.3 billion in mandatory funding and $0.7 billion in discretionary funding, representing a 5.3% increase over FY2015. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide health insurance coverage to low-income children. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health insurance coverage to low-income children in families with income above Medicaid eligibility levels but without insurance. CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with federal funding capped on a state-by-state basis. The President's budget projects a significant increase in federal funding for CHIP in FY2016, with total outlays estimated at $14.0 billion, a 32.1% increase over FY2015. This increase is due to a 23 percentage point increase in the federal matching rate for CHIP. The President's budget includes legislative proposals impacting CHIP, with estimated outlay increases of $0.6 billion in FY2016 and $35.1 billion over 10 years. State grants and demonstrations funding supports various programs like Money Follows the Person Demonstration and Medicaid Integrity Program. FY2016 total outlays for state grants and demonstrations are projected to be $0.6 billion, a 3.7% increase from FY2015. The legislative proposals impacting the budget for state grants and demonstrations are estimated to increase funding by $0.6 billion over the next 10 years. The ACA included reforms focusing on restructuring the private health insurance market by creating new programs and imposing requirements on private health insurance plans. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight within CMS is responsible for implementing ACA provisions related to private health insurance programs. The President's budget projects a decrease in total outlays for private health insurance protections and programs in FY2016. The President's budget includes increases in funding for the Risk Adjustment Program and health insurance exchange grants, while not proposing any legislative changes to private health insurance protections. The ACA established the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation to test innovative healthcare models and appropriated $10 billion for its activities. The Innovation Center's initiatives include Partnership for Patients, Health Care Innovation Awards, bundled payments, ACOs, and primary care initiatives. The President's budget projects an increase in total outlays for the Innovation Center in FY2016. The budget does not include any legislative proposals impacting the Innovation Center. Funding for program management activities, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration, is projected to be $6.8 billion in FY2016. Funding for program management activities, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration, is projected to be $6.8 billion in FY2016, with discretionary funding for program management activities increasing by 6.8% to $4.2 billion. Mandatory funding for program management activities is projected to decrease to $0.1 billion in FY2016. The President's budget includes legislative proposals that could impact program management activities. The President's budget proposes an increase in total program level funding for program management activities by $1.0 billion in FY2016, reaching $7.9 billion, a 36.5% increase over FY2015. With risk corridor spending included, the estimated funding increases to $14.3 billion. The budget contains proposals impacting the CMS budget, including program expansions and measures to reduce federal spending in areas like Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. The legislative proposals cover Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, CHIP, state grants, and program management. Acute care hospitals with high readmission rates face payment reductions. CMS has implemented a hospital-wide readmission measure as part of its quality reporting program. CMS has implemented a hospital-wide readmission measure as part of its quality reporting program, but the President's budget does not include a proposal to adopt a comprehensive hospital-wide measure of readmissions. Acute care hospitals are required to submit information on conditions. The President's budget proposal would require hospitals to code patients' conditions as present on arrival instead of present on admission for Medicare's Hospital-Acquired Condition reporting and payment program, with no budgetary impact estimated over the next 10 years. Medicare reimburses providers for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts after reasonable collection efforts. Medicare providers receiving bad debt reimbursement include various healthcare facilities. BBA97 initially reduced bad debt reimbursement for hospitals, but subsequent legislation froze the reduction at 70% reimbursement in FY2001. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reduced Medicare bad debt reimbursement from 100% to 70%, except for dual-eligible beneficiaries. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 further reduced reimbursement to 65% for all providers. Providers previously reimbursed at 70% received 65% reimbursement starting in FY2013, while those reimbursed at 100% received 88% in FY2013 and 76% in FY2014, with a reduction to 65% in FY2015 and beyond. The President's budget proposes reducing bad debt reimbursement from 65% to 25% phased in over three years starting in FY2016. This would save $31.1 billion over 10 years. Medicare provides additional payments to hospitals with medical residency programs to cover higher patient care costs associated with training physicians. These payments vary based on the hospital's teaching program size. Teaching hospitals receive a 5.5% increase in indirect medical education payments for every 10% increase in their resident-to-bed ratio. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) found that less than half of these payments can be justified empirically. MedPAC recommended changes in Medicare's funding of graduate medical education to support workforce skills needed for cost reduction and quality improvement. The President's budget proposes a 10% reduction in indirect medical education funding starting in FY2016, with the Secretary given authority to set standards for receiving funds. The President's budget proposes a 10% reduction in indirect medical education funding starting in FY2016, with the Secretary given authority to set standards for teaching hospitals. The proposal aims to encourage training of primary care residents and remove Medicare's 190-day lifetime limit on freestanding inpatient psychiatric facilities, saving an estimated $16.3 billion over the next 10 years. The Administration estimates a $5.0 billion cost over 10 years for the proposal to remove the 190-day lifetime limit on freestanding inpatient psychiatric facilities. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) are limited-service rural facilities with specific criteria and receive enhanced cost-based Medicare payments. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare reimbursement to Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to 100% of reasonable costs starting in FY2016, saving $1.7 billion over 10 years. To be certified as a CAH, a rural entity must meet specific distance criteria or be designated as a necessary provider by the state. Federal distance standards require CAHs to be located a certain distance from other hospitals. States could waive these requirements for necessary providers until January 1, 2006. The Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 eliminated state authority to designate facilities as necessary provider Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs). The President's budget proposes rescinding CAH designation for entities within 10 miles of another hospital, saving $0.8 billion over 10 years. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) are exempt from Medicare's inpatient PPS and are either freestanding hospitals or distinct units of other hospitals. Since October 1, 1983, CMS has required that facilities must treat a certain proportion of patients with specified medical conditions to qualify as an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) and receive higher Medicare payments. IRFs must meet the \"75% rule,\" where at least 75% of a facility's inpatient population must be diagnosed with one of 13 preestablished medical conditions to be classified as an IRF. The rule was temporarily suspended in 2004 and reissued with a revised set of qualifying conditions and a transition period for the compliance threshold. The Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) compliance threshold has evolved over the years, with percentages ranging from 50% to 75% based on specific time periods. The DRA extended the 60% threshold, and the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 set the threshold at 60% with comorbidities included as qualifying conditions. The President's budget proposed reinstating the 75% threshold in FY2016 to save $2.2 billion over 10 years. Prior to FY2015, qualifying acute care hospitals received disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funds through an adjustment within the inpatient PPS. In FY2015, Medicare DSH funding to acute care hospitals changed. Qualifying hospitals receive 25% of DSH funds based on a specific formula, with the remaining funds reduced accordingly. In FY2016, CMS is distributing DSH funds to qualifying hospitals based on their share of uncompensated care using DSH patient days. The President's budget proposal includes clarifying that hospital days for certain Medicare beneficiaries are included in the DSH formula without a budgetary impact over the next 10 years. The Administration estimates that a proposal for post-acute care services would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. These services include nursing and rehabilitation following an inpatient hospital stay and are provided in various settings. Geographic variation in Medicare spending is influenced by the use of post-acute care services. MedPAC recommended testing bundled payments for post-acute care to encourage efficiency and care coordination. The President's budget proposes implementing bundled payments for post-acute care providers (LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs) starting in FY2020, with a goal of reducing bundled payment rates by 2.85% by FY2022. This would apply to at least half of total payments for post-acute care providers, with no changes to beneficiary cost-sharing. The Administration estimates a savings of $9.3 billion over the next 10 years. The Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) were created under the Medicare program to promote coordinated care for beneficiaries, especially those with chronic conditions. ACOs consist of groups of healthcare providers working together to deliver high-quality care to Medicare patients efficiently, reducing unnecessary services and errors. Providers in ACOs can share in savings if they lower Medicare spending compared to traditional fee-for-service care. Three models of ACOs exist: Medicare Shared Savings Program, Advance Payment ACO Models, and Pioneer ACOs. The Affordable Care Act did not classify federally qualified health centers and rural health centers as ACO professionals. The President's budget proposes assigning more Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics participating in an Accountable Care Organization under the Medicare Shared Savings Program. This could increase the number of beneficiaries assigned to ACOs, but specific details on how this would be achieved are not provided. The proposal to assign more Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics participating in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) under the Medicare Shared Savings Program was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. The Administration estimates this proposal would save $80 million over the next 10 years. Unlike managed care plans, Medicare beneficiaries are assigned to an ACO based on their utilization of primary care services provided by ACO professionals. The President's budget proposes to broaden the criteria for beneficiary assignment in the Medicare Shared Savings Program to include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists. This change is estimated to save $60 million over the next 10 years. Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part B typically pay a 20% coinsurance for covered services, but prevention services have no cost sharing. The President's budget proposes changes to Medicare cost-sharing for ACOs in two-sided risk models, allowing them to pay beneficiaries for their portion of primary care visit coinsurance. This proposal aims to incentivize quality of care over quantity. The President's budget proposes implementing value-based purchasing programs for various provider types, including HHAs, ambulatory surgical centers, hospital outpatient departments, and community mental health centers. The SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program would be enacted in FY2018, with payments tied to quality and efficiency of care starting at 2% in CY2017 and increasing to 5% in CY2019. This proposal is a modification of a previous legislative proposal and is estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. MedPAC recommended eliminating Medicare payment updates for SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs in March 2014. The ACA reduced annual updates for post-acute providers to include a productivity adjustment for cost savings. Productivity adjustments for SNFs, IRFs, and LTCHs were implemented in 2011, while HHAs saw adjustments in 2015. Annual payment updates for IRFs, HHAs, and LTCHs are also subject to other reductions. The President's budget proposes additional payment update reductions for IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs from 2016 through 2025. This would establish a payment update floor of zero to prevent rates from dropping below zero. SNFs would see a -2.5% update in FY2016, gradually increasing to a -0.97% update in FY2023. The proposal aims to save $102.1 billion over the next 10 years. The proposal aims to save $102.1 billion over the next 10 years by adjusting payments for physician and other practitioner services under Medicare Part B based on the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula. If expenditures exceed targets, future updates are reduced to align spending with the target. In 2002, actual expenditure exceeded allowed targets, growing each year. Congress enacted laws to override reductions, proposing to replace Medicare fee-for-service payments with alternative models rewarding quality and efficiency. The President's budget aims to accelerate physician participation in high-quality care by repealing the SGR formula and reforming Medicare payments. The recent bipartisan legislation, not included in the President's FY2015 budget, estimates a cost of $44.0 billion over 10 years. Medicare payment rates vary for ambulatory services in different settings. Medicare uses different payment schedules for physician services, outpatient services in hospital departments, and services in ambulatory surgical centers. The President's budget aims to lower payments to off-campus hospital outpatient departments under Medicare's outpatient PPS, potentially aligning them with the Medicare physician fee schedule or the rate for surgical procedures in ambulatory surgical centers. This move could impact total Medicare payments and increase beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. The proposal aims to reduce payments to off-campus hospital outpatient departments under Medicare's outpatient PPS, aligning them with the Medicare physician fee schedule or ambulatory surgical centers' rates. The payment reductions would be phased in over four years starting in CY2017, with the Secretary having the authority to adjust payments in case of beneficiary access issues. This proposal, estimated to save $29.5 billion over 10 years, was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. Medicare pays physicians based on the fee schedule, with additional bonuses for targeted activities like quality achievements or practicing in underserved areas. The ACA established a 10% bonus on select evaluation and management codes for primary care practitioners, which may become permanent starting CY2016. The proposal aims to make this bonus payment budget neutral within the Medicare physician fee schedule. The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, also known as the Stark law, was enacted. The Stark law, enacted in 1989, limits physician self-referrals for designated health services paid by Medicare or Medicaid. It prohibits physicians from referring to entities they have a financial relationship with and prohibits entities from billing for services from prohibited referrals. Exceptions exist for certain situations. The Stark law allows physicians to provide self-referred health services in their offices under specific requirements. Concerns about overuse have led to a proposal to exclude certain services from the exception, aiming to save $6 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to save $6 billion over 10 years by changing how Medicare covers some drugs under Part B, including biologics. Providers purchase and administer Part B drugs, receiving payments for both administration and drug supply. Medicare reimburses providers for most Part B drugs at 106% of the drug's average sales price, regardless of acquisition cost. The HHS OIG found that some Part B drugs' payment based on ASP exceeded market prices. CMS implemented a rule to lower Part B drug payments when market prices were lower than what Medicare was paying, starting in 2013. The President's proposed budget in CY2016 would reduce Medicare Part B drug reimbursement from 106% of ASP to 103% of ASP. The President's proposed budget in CY2016 aims to reduce Part B drug reimbursement from 106% of ASP to 103% of ASP, with provisions for rebates if providers' drug acquisition costs exceed 103% of ASP. This proposal is estimated to save $7.4 billion over the next 10 years. The President's budget proposal in CY2016 includes allowing certain nonphysician practitioners to document face-to-face encounters for prescribing durable medical equipment under Medicare. This proposal is estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. Medicare provides coverage for routine dialysis for individuals with end-stage renal disease. The President's budget proposal in CY2016 includes allowing Medicare payment to ESRD facilities for short-term dialysis treatment of individuals with acute kidney injury, estimated to save $0.2 billion over 10 years. Under Medicare Advantage (MA), beneficiaries can receive all Medicare-covered benefits (except hospice) through private health plans, including Employer Group Waiver Plans sponsored by employers and unions. The Secretary has authority to waive or modify requirements for these plans. Payments to MA plans are based on estimated costs of providing services compared to the maximum government payment. Starting in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans bid for services relative to a benchmark set by the federal government. If a plan's bid is below the benchmark, it receives a rebate based on plan quality. The rebate must be returned to enrollees as additional benefits or reduced premiums. Plans with bids equal to or above the benchmark require enrollees to pay an additional premium. Employer Group Waiver Plans tend to bid closer to the benchmark as they do not compete for enrollment. The President's budget proposes to base payment amounts for Employer Group Waiver Plans on average non-Employer Group Waiver Plans' bids in each market, aiming to save $7.2 billion over 10 years. Medicare Advantage plans receive monthly payments per person for covered benefits, with risk adjustment to account for care costs. The risk scores for Medicare Advantage enrollees are based on diagnoses submitted by doctors to adjust payment. Differences in diagnosis data completeness exist between original Medicare and MA, leading to adjustments in MA risk scores. The ACA required the Secretary to adjust MA risk scores for coding differences between MA plans and providers under Medicare Parts A and B for plan payments in 2008-2010. Minimum coding intensity adjustments were specified starting in 2014, with subsequent increases each year. The adjustments are to be applied until risk adjustment using MA diagnostic data is implemented. The President's budget proposes increasing the minimum coding intensity adjustment for risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage plans. The adjustment would gradually increase to 8.76% by 2021 and remain at that level. This proposal aims to save $36.2 billion over the next 10 years. Additionally, MA special needs plans target enrollment for individuals with special needs as established in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. Special needs plans in Medicare Advantage target beneficiaries who are institutionalized, eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, or have severe chronic conditions. These plans must meet all MA requirements, with CMS reviewing marketing materials for accuracy. Duals special needs plans require separate review by state Medicaid agencies. The ACA established the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office to improve coordination between Medicare and Medicaid programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries. The ACA established the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office within CMS to improve coordination between Medicare and Medicaid programs for dual-eligible beneficiaries. A proposal to authorize CMS to conduct a coordinated review of duals special needs plan marketing materials could reduce administrative burden and improve quality. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. CMS uses a star ratings system to assess the quality of Part D stand-alone prescription drug plans and MA plans with a prescription drug component. The average star rating for Part D stand-alone prescription drug plans is 3.75 stars in 2015, with 51% having a rating of 4 stars or more. For MA-PDs, the average star rating is 3.92 stars, with 40% having a rating of 4 stars or more. The President's budget proposes revising the payment system to reimburse plans based on their star rating, with higher-rated plans receiving more reimbursement. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget suggests a subsidy program similar to the MA quality bonus payment program for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. About 69% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Part D, with 30% qualifying for low-income subsidies in 2014. Dual-eligible beneficiaries and recipients of certain programs automatically qualify for the full LIS. Some Medicare beneficiaries automatically qualify for the full LIS, while others with limited assets and incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level may also be eligible. Prescription drug coverage is provided through PDPs or MA-PDs, with plan sponsors negotiating prices with drug manufacturers. Medicaid determines basic prescription drug rebates based on a comparison of a drug's quarterly average manufacturers' price. The President's budget proposal for Medicare Part D includes requiring drug manufacturers to pay the difference between rebates provided to Part D plans and Medicaid rebate levels. An additional rebate would be required for drugs with price increases higher than inflation. This proposal aims to save $116.1 billion over the next 10 years. The Medicare Part D standard drug benefit includes a coverage gap known as the \"doughnut hole.\" The Medicare Part D standard drug benefit includes a coverage gap called the \"doughnut hole,\" where enrollees face higher out-of-pocket costs between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic threshold. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) gradually eliminates this coverage gap through manufacturer discounts and federal subsidies on both brand-name and generic drugs. By 2020, enrollees will have a 25% cost share for all prescriptions from meeting the deductible to reaching the catastrophic limit. The ACA aims to eliminate the Medicare Part D coverage gap by providing discounts and subsidies on brand-name and generic drugs. By 2020, the government will subsidize 25% of brand-name drugs and 75% of generic drugs in the coverage gap. The President's budget proposes increasing the manufacturer discount for brand-name drugs to 75% by 2017, effectively eliminating the coverage gap for brand-name drugs. This proposal is estimated to save $9.4 billion over the next 10 years. The Administration estimates that the FY2015 budget proposal would save $9.4 billion over the next 10 years. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where private insurers compete by offering lower prices or more generous benefits. Part D plan sponsors negotiate rebates and discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Secretary is prohibited from interfering in negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies. CMS regulations allow insurers offering Part D plans to place expensive prescription drugs on a specialty price tier, with higher cost sharing for enrollees. Concerns have been raised about the rising cost of specialty-tier drugs, particularly biologics for diseases like hepatitis and cancer. Only 0.25% of 2013 Medicare Part D claims were for specialty-tier drugs. The President's budget recommends giving the Secretary authority to negotiate Part D prices for specialty-tier drugs like biologics. Pharmaceutical manufacturers would need to provide data for price agreements, with prices indexed to consumer inflation. Plan sponsors could negotiate additional discounts. HHS would monitor for any increase in physician-administered drugs under Medicare Part B. The Administration's proposal to allow the Secretary to negotiate Part D prices for specialty-tier drugs like biologics was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D may qualify for additional assistance with prescription drug cost sharing based on income. Dual-eligible beneficiaries with income below 100% of FPL have co-payments for generic and brand-name drugs until reaching the catastrophic threshold. LIS beneficiaries in Medicare Part D have different cost-sharing structures based on income levels. Full-benefit, dual-eligible LIS beneficiaries with higher incomes pay $2.65 for generic drugs and $6.60 for brand-name drugs until reaching the catastrophic threshold. Other beneficiaries with lower incomes pay a flat 15% coinsurance rate for all drugs up to the catastrophic threshold. LIS beneficiaries have higher drug costs and are less likely to use lower-cost generic drugs compared to non-LIS beneficiaries. The President's budget proposes reducing co-payments for generic drugs for LIS beneficiaries while increasing co-payments for brand-name drugs. The proposal allows the Secretary to exclude brand-name drugs from the increased co-payments if therapeutic substitution is not clinically appropriate or a generic substitute is not available. LIS beneficiaries could appeal the changes. The proposed cost-sharing change for Part D LIS beneficiaries would not apply to those in institutions. Beneficiaries with incomes between 135% and 150% of FPL may face higher cost sharing only after reaching their plan's catastrophic coverage limit. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget aims to save $8.9 billion over the next 10 years. Low-income individuals must qualify for assistance and enroll in a specific Part D plan to receive a low-income subsidy. Some LIS individuals are automatically enrolled in a Part D plan by CMS. CMS automatically enrolls Part D beneficiaries in a plan with basic prescription drug coverage and a premium at or below the low-income subsidy amount. If multiple plans meet the criteria, beneficiaries are randomly assigned. There is a facilitated enrollment process for certain groups. The President's budget proposes contracting with a single plan to provide coverage for LIS beneficiaries during eligibility processing. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget suggests having one plan as the contact point for LIS beneficiaries seeking reimbursement for retroactive drug claims. This proposal affects both Medicare and Medicaid budgets but is estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. HHS requires Part D sponsors to conduct drug utilization reviews to prevent prescription drug abuse. CMS tracks overutilization of prescribed drugs and provides quarterly reports to sponsors. The President's budget proposes restrictions for high-risk Medicare Part D beneficiaries to use specific prescribers and pharmacies for controlled substances, similar to state Medicaid programs. CMS must ensure continued access to quality services for Part D beneficiaries. This proposal would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. Medicare is the primary payer for medical services, with other insurance billed after Medicare pays to fill coverage gaps. The Medicare Secondary Payer laws prohibit Medicare from making payments when another insurer, like an employer-sponsored group health plan, has made or is expected to make payments. HHS matches Medicare recipient information with data from SSA and IRS to identify cases where Medicare is the secondary payer. Private insurers are required to regularly submit coverage information for Medicare beneficiaries. Employer- and union-sponsored health plans must report enrollment information to HHS, but other group health plans are not required to inform HHS or Part D plan. The President's budget proposes extending mandatory Medicare Secondary Payer reporting to prescription drug coverage to ensure all primary drug coverage is communicated to HHS and Part D sponsors. This could save $0.5 billion over 10 years. Recent investigations found some beneficiaries obtaining overlapping prescriptions for abused drugs. CMS has taken steps to reduce inappropriate utilization of Part D drugs. CMS has instructed plan sponsors to implement controls to prevent inappropriate utilization of Part D prescription drugs, particularly opioids and acetaminophen. The proposal would grant the Secretary authority to suspend Part D coverage and payment for drugs prescribed by providers who mis-prescribe or overprescribe potentially abused drugs. Additionally, the Secretary could require providers to include more information on certain Part D prescriptions. The Secretary may require providers to include additional information on certain Part D prescriptions, such as diagnosis codes, to obtain coverage. This proposal was part of the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 established the abbreviated new drug application path for FDA approval of generic versions of drugs after patent expiration. Generic sponsors can challenge brand-name manufacturers' patents through an abbreviated new drug application with a paragraph IV certification. The FDA grants the first successful filer 180-day market exclusivity. Settlements between brand-name and generic sponsors under the Hatch-Waxman framework may involve the brand-name company paying the generic firm to delay marketing the pharmaceutical. The legislative proposal aims to prohibit pay-for-delay agreements between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies to prevent the delay of generic drugs entering the market. This proposal is estimated to save Medicare $10.1 billion over the next 10 years. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established a pathway for competing versions of biologics, including biosimilar and interchangeable biologics, giving the FDA a significant role in regulation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established FDA standards for biosimilarity and interchangeability of biologics. It also created periods of data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand-name biologic drugs, with 4 years of marketing exclusivity and 12 years of data exclusivity. Data protection allows competitors to develop their own clinical data for approval. The President's budget proposes reducing data exclusivity for brand biologics from 12 to 7 years and eliminating exclusivity for \"minor\" product changes. Part B reimbursement for biosimilar and new biological products would be based on the average sales price of the reference product and its biosimilars, plus 6%. This proposal aims to save $4.4 billion over 10 years and affects both Medicare and Medicaid budgets. Most Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Part B pay premiums based on income thresholds, with higher-income beneficiaries paying a larger share. The ACA imposed income-related premiums for Part D as well. In 2015, less than 5% of Part B enrollees are expected to pay higher income-related premiums. The President's budget proposes increasing the applicable percentage of costs for higher-income enrollees starting in CY2019. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget would increase the applicable percentage of costs for higher-income Medicare beneficiaries, with new income thresholds and cost percentages. This change is estimated to save $66.4 billion over the next 10 years. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act set the 2005 deductible level at $110, increasing annually based on per capita costs. The 2015 Part B deductible is $147, with a proposed $25 increase in 2019, 2021, and 2023 for new enrollees. Two beneficiary groups would have different deductible amounts. The proposal would affect Medicare beneficiaries enrolling from January 1, 2019, onwards with increased deductibles. The deductible for this group would see a $25 increase in 2019, 2021, and 2023. This would result in new beneficiaries paying a $75 higher deductible by 2023 compared to those enrolled before 2019. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget aims to increase deductible amounts for Medicare beneficiaries, resulting in a potential difference of over $75 in deductible payments between different groups. The Administration estimates a savings of $3.7 billion over the next 10 years. Late enrollment in Medicare Part B can lead to a penalty of 10% increase in monthly premiums for each full 12-month period of eligibility not utilized. The President's budget proposal clarifies that the hold-harmless provision in Medicare Part B only applies to the annual premium increase, not late enrollment penalties. This proposal aligns with current CMS practice and was not included in the FY2015 budget. The Administration estimates that the proposal to include Medigap in the President's FY2015 budget would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. Medigap is private health insurance that supplements Medicare coverage, covering deductibles, coinsurance, and additional services not covered by Medicare. Medigap plans have varying levels of coverage, with two plans offering full coverage for Parts A and B deductibles and coinsurance. In 2013, about 66% of Medigap enrollees were covered by these two plans. The President's budget proposes a Part B premium surcharge for new Medicare beneficiaries choosing a Medigap plan with low cost-sharing requirements, estimated to save $4.0 billion over 10 years. Medicare covers a 60-day episode of home health care, including skilled nursing, therapy, social services, and medical supplies, with a 20% coinsurance requirement. Legislative changes eliminated Medicare cost sharing for home health services, but beneficiaries may still have co-payments for DME and osteoporosis drugs. MedPAC recommended a per episode co-payment for home health episodes without prior hospitalization. The President's budget proposed a $100 co-payment for new beneficiaries for each home health 60-day episode with five or more visits. This proposal aims to save $830. The President's FY2015 budget includes a proposal to save $830 million over 10 years by establishing the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to reduce Medicare spending growth rates. IPAB will submit proposals to Congress and the President when spending targets are exceeded, with recommendations automatically implemented unless Congress intervenes. Starting in 2015, proposals will be based on changes in consumer price indices for the first five years, then switch to Medicare target per capita growth rates. The President's FY2015 budget proposes establishing the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to reduce Medicare spending growth rates. IPAB will submit proposals to Congress and the President when spending targets are exceeded, with recommendations automatically implemented unless Congress intervenes. Starting in 2015, proposals will be based on changes in consumer price indices for the first five years, then switch to Medicare target per capita growth rates. However, projections suggest that IPAB activity will not be triggered in the next 10 fiscal years. The President's budget aims to lower the target rate applicable beginning in 2018 to GDP per capita growth plus 0.5 percentage points, estimating a $20.9 billion saving over the next decade. The Medicare and Medicaid appeals processes differ significantly, causing confusion and increased costs for providers and states. Dual-eligible beneficiaries face challenges navigating both systems, with Medicaid paying after Medicare for covered services. This proposal aims to streamline the appeals processes, potentially saving $20.9 billion over the next 10 years. The President's budget proposes creating an integrated Medicare and Medicaid appeals process for dual-eligible beneficiaries to address treatment delays, care interruptions, and potential added costs. The President's budget includes a proposal to create an integrated Medicare and Medicaid appeals process for dual-eligible beneficiaries. This proposal would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years and aims to streamline the appeals process for dissatisfied parties. At the second level of review, an independent contractor assesses claims. There is no claim-value threshold for the first two appeal levels. Administrative law judges review claims at the third level, requiring a minimum total amount in controversy of $150 in CY2015. Appellants can present new evidence and have a hearing before a judge. If dissatisfied, they can request a review by the Medicare Appeals Council at the fourth level, with no money in controversy requirement. A party may seek judicial review at the fifth level. At the fifth level of appeal, a party may seek judicial review in federal district court with a minimum amount in controversy of $1,460 in CY2015. No fees are currently charged for Medicare fee-for-service appeals. The Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals has a voluntary program for consolidating claims and proposing settlements. The President's budget includes proposals to reform the Medicare appeals process, including establishing a refundable filing fee for providers, suppliers, and state Medicaid agencies. The proposal includes establishing a refundable filing fee for providers, suppliers, and state Medicaid agencies at the appeal level. The filing fee would be refunded for fully favorable determinations, with no fee for beneficiaries. This would help reduce the appeal backlog by investing revenue from filing fees. Additionally, the proposal suggests increasing the minimum amount in controversy for administrative law judge adjudication to align with federal district court requirements. The proposal suggests aligning the value of claims appealed to the administrative law judge appeal level with the cost to adjudicate those claims. Appeals below the federal district court minimum amount in controversy would be adjudicated by a Medicare magistrate. This would help assign higher amount in controversy and more complex appeal claims to administrative law judges. The proposal aims to expedite appeal processing by allowing decisions without a hearing for claims with no material fact in dispute and remanding appeals to the redetermination level with new evidence. The proposal aims to expedite appeal processing by allowing decisions without a hearing for claims with no material fact in dispute and remanding appeals to the redetermination level with new evidence. Additionally, the proposal includes measures to incentivize appellants to include all evidence early in the appeals process and consolidate similar claims for administrative efficiency. These proposals were not included in the President's FY2015 budget and are estimated to have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. The Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals' workload increased significantly due to various factors, including the Medicare fee-for-service Recovery Audit Contractor program. RACs aim to reduce improper payments by identifying over- and underpayments, and they are paid based on the recovered overpayments. The Secretary is authorized to retain a portion of RAC funds. The Secretary is authorized to retain a portion of RAC recoveries to administer the program. The President's budget would expand this authority to fund RAC appeals and administration. The proposal could cost Medicare $1.3 billion over 10 years. The ACA allows CMS to provide claims data for evaluating providers' performance. The ACA requires qualified entities to combine claims data from various sources with Medicare data for provider evaluation. The President's budget proposes expanding the use of Medicare data for fraud prevention and value-added analysis for physicians. Qualified entities could release raw claims data to Medicare providers for care coordination and practice improvement for a fee equal to Medicare's cost. This proposal was included in the President's FY2015 budget with no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. The BBA97 required state Medicaid programs to pay Medicare Part B premiums for low-income Medicare beneficiaries known as qualifying individuals (QIs) with income between 120% and 135% of FPL. States receive federal funding to cover QIs' Medicare premiums up to a certain limit. The QI program has been reauthorized and funded multiple times, with the most recent authorization through March 31, 2015, and $1.035 billion in funding allocated. The President's budget proposes extending authorization and funding for the QI program through December 31, 2016, costing $975 million over the next 10 years. The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) provides long-term services to individuals aged 55 and older who require an institutional level of care, with capitated payments from both Medicaid and Medicare. The President's budget proposes a pilot demonstration to expand PACE eligibility to individuals aged 21 to 55, with no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. This proposal aims to decrease Medicare outlays by $2.4 billion in FY2016 and $423.1 billion over the next 10 years. The DRA allowed states to offer alternative benefit plans in Medicaid, similar to commercial insurance. These plans must now include essential health benefits as per the ACA. Enrollment eligibility depends on Medicaid pathway and state decisions. The DRA allowed states to offer alternative benefit plans in Medicaid, similar to commercial insurance, with enrollment eligibility based on Medicaid pathway and state decisions. States can choose to require enrollment in alternative benefit plans for certain groups under Section 1937 of the Social Security Act, with some limitations. Individuals eligible for Medicaid under the ACA expansion must enroll in alternative benefit plan coverage, while optional expansion groups defined as individuals under 65 with income above 133% of FPL cannot be required to enroll. The President's budget allows states to enroll non-elderly, nondisabled adults with income exceeding 133% of FPL in alternative benefit plans with no budgetary impact. States can provide inpatient psychiatric care for Medicaid enrollees under 21, known as \"Psych under 21,\" in psychiatric hospitals, units in general hospitals, and residential treatment facilities. CMS historically prohibited states from claiming Medicaid expenditures for inpatient psychiatric facilities unless made to qualified providers. The President's budget proposes lifting the exclusion of Medicaid enrollees aged 21 and younger in inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities from receiving EPSDT coverage. This would allow children to receive well-child visits, immunizations, and other necessary medical care. The Administration estimates the proposal to include Medicaid coverage for inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities for individuals aged 21 and younger would cost $0.4 billion over the next 10 years. Psychiatric residential treatment facilities are not recognized as qualified inpatient facilities for home- and community-based services. The President's budget proposes adding services in psychiatric residential treatment facilities to the list of qualified institutional benefits for 1915(c) waivers, extending coverage of HCBS to eligible individuals. This proposal is estimated to cost $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. The Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover preventive services without cost sharing, effective September 23, 2010. This includes services recommended by various health organizations for adults, children, and women. The requirements apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group coverage. The ACA mandates coverage of preventive services without cost sharing for health insurance plans. Medicaid must provide comprehensive tobacco-cessation services for pregnant women and coverage for preventive services for adults. The President's budget proposes extending coverage of preventive health services to all adults enrolled in Medicaid. The proposal aims to expand tobacco-cessation services under Medicaid to all eligible populations, costing $0.8 billion over 10 years. States have the authority to offer long-term care services through Medicaid, with options for institutional services and home- and community-based supports. The majority of home- and community-based services are optional for states. The President's budget proposes a long-term care state plan option for up to five states to provide home and community-based care at the nursing facility level of care. This aims to create equal access to HCBS and nursing facility services for Medicaid participants, costing $4.1 billion over 10 years. Section 2703 of the ACA allows states to establish health homes for Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions, with 90% federal Medicaid matching funds for the first eight fiscal quarters. The President's budget proposes a long-term care state plan option for up to five states to provide home and community-based care at the nursing facility level of care, costing $4.1 billion over 10 years. Section 2703 of the ACA allows states to establish health homes for Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions. Individuals eligible under Section 2703 must have at least two chronic conditions, one chronic condition and at risk of a second, or one serious and persistent mental health condition. States must enroll all individuals meeting these criteria. The President's budget proposes a long-term care state plan option for up to five states to provide home and community-based care at the nursing facility level of care, costing $4.1 billion over 10 years. States may elect to provide the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option to medically needy individuals enrolled in Medicaid, allowing them to receive full Medicaid state plan benefits. The budget proposal includes a plan to offer full Medicaid state plan benefits to medically needy individuals accessing HCBS through the Section 1915(i) state plan optional benefit, costing $38 million over 10 years. The Community First Choice option allows states to provide community-based attendant services and supports as a Medicaid state plan benefit, with eligibility criteria based on income and level-of-care needs. The President's budget proposal aims to expand eligibility for Community First Choice services by allowing states to offer it to individuals who would be Medicaid eligible if they were in a nursing facility, potentially reducing the need for Section 1915(c) HCBS waivers. The Administration proposed a 1915(c) HCBS waiver to provide Community First Choice services to Medicaid enrollees with higher incomes, costing $3.6 billion over 10 years. States can offer HCBS under Section 1915(i) without a waiver for enrollees with incomes up to 150% of FPL and lower level-of-care needs than in an institution. Eligibility can be extended to those with incomes up to 300% of the maximum SSI benefit under waiver programs. The President's budget proposes to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Section 1915(i) HCBS state plan option by removing the requirement for individuals to meet the higher financial eligibility threshold and waiver criteria. This proposal, estimated to cost $1.3 billion over the next 10 years, was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. Additionally, states are required to provide transitional medical assistance (TMA) to certain low-income families who would otherwise lose Medicaid coverage due to changes in income. Congress expanded work-related TMA benefits in 1988, requiring states to provide 6 to 12 months of coverage to families losing Medicaid eligibility due to increased work hours or income. An additional work-related TMA option was created in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allowing states to provide TMA for a full 12-month period. The expanded TMA requirements, authorized by PAMA, have been extended through March 31, 2015, with a proposal to further extend the program through December 31, 2016. States adopting the ACA Medicaid expansion can opt out of TMA, and income eligibility can be based on modified adjusted gross income. The proposal is estimated to cost $1.8 billion over the next 10 years. The Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 created a state plan option for \"Express Lane\" eligibility, allowing states to rely on findings from specified agencies for determining eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP. The President's budget proposes a permanent extension of this option for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. The President's FY2015 budget proposal includes a $0.7 billion cost estimate over 10 years for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. States must cover pregnant women with income below 133% of FPL, with limited coverage for pregnancy and postpartum care. Some states offer enhanced pregnancy services, and under the ACA, states can expand Medicaid eligibility. Under the ACA, states have the option to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income at or below 133% of FPL. Pregnant women must be enrolled through Medicaid's pregnancy-related pathways, but states are not required to track pregnancy status for those eligible through the ACA Medicaid expansion group. Coverage includes at least the 10 essential health benefits. The President's budget proposes allowing pregnant Medicaid enrollees to choose their eligibility category, which was not included in the FY2015 budget. This change would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. Medicaid and CHIP enrollees are required to report changes that may affect their eligibility status. The President's budget proposes extending 12-month continuous eligibility to all Medicaid-eligible adults. This policy allows coverage for a year regardless of income changes, and some states also apply it to separate CHIP programs. The Administration estimates a proposal to cost $27.7 billion over the next 10 years for Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments. Federal law requires states to make DSH payments to hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients, with federal matching funds up to a capped allotment. The ACA mandated reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020, with current law indicating reductions starting in FY2017 and ending in FY2024. The President's budget proposes to extend the ACA-reduced Medicaid DSH allotment levels to FY2025 and subsequent years, with adjustments based on the consumer price index. This proposal aims to save $3.3 billion over the next 10 years. States have flexibility in setting payment rates for Medicaid services. Providers under Medicaid have the freedom to set payment rates for services, with exceptions to ensure efficiency, economy, and quality of care. Federal regulations limit payments for hospitals and nursing facilities to Medicare principles. There is no upper payment limit for durable medical equipment (DME) under Medicaid, which historically follows Medicare fee schedules updated annually for inflation. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established a competitive bidding program for DME prices. The President's budget proposes limiting federal reimbursement for Medicaid DME spending to Medicare rates, saving $4.3 billion over 10 years. States typically set their own Medicaid payment rates for providers to ensure coverage availability. The ACA required Medicaid payment rates for certain primary care services to be raised to Medicare levels for CY2013 and CY2014. The federal government covered the cost difference for those two years, but the requirement expired on December 31, 2014. The President's budget proposes extending the enhanced primary care rates. The President's budget proposes extending enhanced primary care rates through December 31, 2016, expanding eligibility to include obstetricians, gynecologists, and nonphysician practitioners. Primary care services provided in emergency rooms would be excluded from the enhanced rates. The proposal is estimated to cost $6.3 billion over the next 10 years. Drug manufacturers must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to sell products to state Medicaid programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate program requires drug manufacturers to report drug pricing information and cover all outpatient drugs. States can dispute rebate claims dating back to 1991. Prenatal vitamins and fluorides are included in the program. Medicaid distinguishes between single source and innovator multiple source drugs for rebate purposes. Some manufacturers offer free medication through emergency-supply programs. Medicaid's drug rebate program distinguishes between single source and innovator multiple source drugs. Rebates for brand-name drugs include a basic rebate and an additional rebate if prices rise faster than inflation. Generic drugs only have a basic rebate component. Prices for generic drugs can rise faster than inflation, with manufacturers' Medicaid rebates being 13% of each drug's AMP. Drug makers may market innovator single source products as over-the-counter before patents expire, reducing Medicaid rebate obligations. The ACA required manufacturers to pay Medicaid rebates for both basic and additional rebates. The ACA required manufacturers to pay Medicaid rebates on line-extension products as if they were the original. Including authorized generic sales with brand sales lowers a product's AMP, decreasing manufacturers' rebate obligations. Medicaid law mandates federal upper limits for generic drugs to prevent excessive federal payments. The President's budget proposes legislation to lower Medicaid outpatient drug costs and strengthen the rebate program by clarifying rules for brand-name drugs, collecting inflation rebates for generics, including vitamins and fluorides as covered drugs, and making technical corrections to ensure rebates apply to line-extension drugs. The proposal aims to modify federal Medicaid law to improve Medicaid rebate program efficiency, including limiting time for disputes, excluding authorized generic sales from calculations, revising upper limit calculations, and exempting emergency drug supply program sales from rebate calculations. These modifications are estimated to save $6.3 billion over the next 10 years. Manufacturers' AMP for Medicaid is calculated based on sales transactions, but irregularities have been found in how manufacturers interpret guidance. They sometimes include excluded and non-FDA approved drugs in their calculations to reduce Medicaid rebates. CMS and HHS OIG monitor drug manufacturers to ensure accurate pricing and rebate payments to the Medicaid program. Under federal law, Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs that are FDA approved. Medicaid drug reimbursement is limited to drugs prescribed off-label if listed in specific compendia. CMS does not routinely verify manufacturers' drug prices for rebate accuracy. The President's budget includes policies to promote program integrity for Medicaid drug coverage, such as requiring manufacturers to compensate states for any drug rebate underpayments and allowing more regular audits of drug manufacturers for compliance with rebate agreements. Manufacturers must electronically list their products with the FDA to be covered and reimbursed by Medicaid. The proposal aims to align Medicaid drug coverage requirements with Medicare's, increase penalties for manufacturers providing false information under Medicaid rebate agreements, and save $10 million over 10 years. Section 6001 of the DRA amended the Social Security Act to require a nationwide survey of retail pharmacy prices, funded with $5 million annually for five years. CMS implemented a two-part survey to collect consumer price information and pharmacies' acquisition costs for setting prescription drug payment rates. The consumer price survey was suspended in July 2013 due to budget limitations. The Social Security Act allows the Secretary to verify manufacturer prices but does not provide the authority to collect wholesale prices regularly for all Medicaid-covered drugs. To ensure accurate reporting of pricing information by drug manufacturers, CMS would need to collect wholesale acquisition cost data. The President's budget proposes funding for a nationwide pharmacy survey to collect drug pricing data, including retail prices and wholesale acquisition costs for Medicaid-covered drugs. This initiative aims to increase transparency and help CMS verify reported prices to set Medicaid drug federal upper limits, potentially saving $30 million over the next 10 years. The President's budget proposes funding for a nationwide pharmacy survey to collect drug pricing data for Medicaid-covered drugs, aiming to increase transparency and potentially save $30 million over the next 10 years. Additionally, Medicaid proposals could increase total net outlays by $6.6 billion in FY2016 and $26.7 billion over the next 10 years. The RAC program, initially a three-year demonstration under the MMA, successfully reduced Medicare's improper payment rates and was made permanent in 2006. The RAC program aims to recover overpayments from Medicare providers, with contractors identifying $2.3 billion in claim corrections in FY2013. A proposal to amend the Social Security Act would allow RAC recoveries to be used for other program integrity activities, costing $2.8 billion over the next 10 years. Medicare covers DME when medically necessary, with a history of fraud. Medicare covers DME when medically necessary, with a history of fraud and abuse. The Secretary has authority to require prior authorization for DME items, including power mobility devices. CMS began a demonstration in 2012 requiring prior authorization for power mobility devices in seven states, later expanding to 12 states in 2014. Medicare also covers certain imaging services, with growth exceeding most other Part B services in the last decade. The President's budget proposal aims to extend the Secretary's authority for prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items, including power mobility and advanced imaging services. This proposal, included in the FY2015 budget, is estimated to save $90 million over the next 10 years. Medicare providers must update enrollment information to comply with Medicare law, with CMS using this data to monitor provider status. The President's budget proposal includes extending the Secretary's authority for prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items. Providers and suppliers must update enrollment records to comply with Medicare law, with CMS using this data to monitor provider status and ensure those at higher risk of fraud receive greater scrutiny. Failure to update records may result in civil monetary penalties. This proposal is estimated to save $29 million over the next 10 years. Section 6407(a)-(b) requires providers to ensure Medicare beneficiaries have a recent face-to-face encounter with a physician to determine eligibility for care. The encounter must occur within 90 days prior to or 30 days after care starts. The President's FY2016 budget proposes an administrative fee for improperly documented high-risk claims like home health and DME services. The proposal suggests an administrative fee for insufficient documentation to support services ordered by providers. The fee would be $50 for Part B supplies/services and $100 for Part A services. Billing companies, known as clearinghouses and billing agents, assist Medicare providers with claims submission. Unlike providers, billing agents are not required to enroll in Medicare. Billing agents and clearinghouses assist Medicare providers with claims submission without enrolling in Medicare themselves. CMS lacks the ability to monitor or identify billing agents, who have access to sensitive patient and provider information that could be misused for fraudulent claims. The ACA allows the Secretary to require billing agents submitting claims on behalf of Medicaid providers to register with the Secretary and state Medicaid agency. The proposal aims to expand ACA's provider screening activities by allowing billing agents to register with Medicare, aligning billing agent requirements with Medicaid, and charging an application fee for new Medicare suppliers. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary effect over the next 10 years. The proposal authorizes the Secretary to require noninstitutional Medicare suppliers and providers to pay application fees when enrolling or revalidating. The noninstitutional application fee would start at $50 and be adjusted annually for inflation, with hardship exemptions granted at the Secretary's discretion. The proposal suggests a Medicare noninstitutional provider application/revalidation fee to support provider screening activities. This proposal was not included in the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary effect over the next 10 years. Medicare covers part-time or intermittent home health services under both Parts A and B, including skilled nursing services, therapy, social services, and home health aide services. Home health service providers have high improper payment rates and vulnerabilities, with HHS struggling to collect most improper payments from HHAs. BBA97 mandated surety bonds on Medicare HHAs, with regulations setting the bond amount at $50,000 or 15% of annual revenue. The proposal aims to increase the required surety bond amount for Medicare HHAs to no less than $50,000, aligning it with the volume of payments made by Medicare to an HHA. This would help improve overpayment recoveries and ensure potential overpayments could be collected. The proposal was not included in the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary effect over the next 10 years. The Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) was established to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare. It allocated $75 million annually for activities like provider audits and payment integrity. The program aimed to ensure proper payments and restricted funding usage to specific areas. The President's budget proposes increasing MIP funding by $0.6 billion over 10 years, allowing for a broader range of activities. The additional investment would start at $25 million in FY2016 and gradually increase to $0.1 billion by FY2025, with annual adjustments for inflation. This funding would support Medicaid program reviews, enhance auditing systems, and assist states in combating fraud, waste, and abuse. The proposal to expand the MIP's authority for program flexibility in protecting state and federal resources, costing $0.6 billion over 10 years, was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. Different federal Medicaid rules apply to U.S. territories compared to states, with territories having capped Medicaid funding and tailored programs. In 2005, a GAO report found that some territories did not meet Medicaid eligibility requirements and none covered all mandatory benefits. Medicaid Fraud Control Units investigate and prosecute healthcare fraud, funded by HHS OIG grants and state funds. Territories do not currently operate MFCUs. The President's budget aims to encourage territories to establish Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) by exempting federal support from Medicaid funding cap and statutory payment ceiling. This proposal, costing $0.01 billion over 10 years, would give territories the authority to implement prescription drug monitoring activities. Some states have already implemented \"lock-in\" programs for Medicaid beneficiaries using prescription drugs above certain guidelines. States have linked Medicaid data with prescription drug monitoring programs to combat controlled substance abuse. Some states have laws to penalize those diverting Medicaid drugs for fraudulent activities. The President's budget proposes monitoring high-risk Medicaid drug billing to identify potential abuse. This initiative could save $0.7 billion over the next 10 years. The Administration estimates a $0.7 billion savings over the next 10 years. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to review programs for erroneous payments and report to Congress. CMS implemented the Medicaid Payment Error Rate Measurement program to estimate improper Medicaid and CHIP payments. States must assess Medicaid eligibility quality control and report erroneous payment rates. The President's budget proposes consolidating Medicaid eligibility quality-control and Payment Error Rate Measurement programs, with no budgetary effect over the next 10 years. Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) investigate and prosecute healthcare providers suspected of defrauding Medicaid, as well as review complaints of neglect or abuse in healthcare facilities receiving Medicaid payments. The President's budget proposes allowing Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) to receive federal matching funds for investigating and prosecuting abuse and neglect in noninstitutional settings. This proposal was included in the President's FY2015 budget and is estimated to have no budgetary effect over the next 10 years. Medicaid and CHIP are jointly funded by the federal government and states, with federal matching funds provided at an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage. The federal government provides guidelines to states on funding sources for the state share of Medicaid and CHIP. States have flexibility in funding their share, but federal funds cannot be used. The President's budget prohibits states from using federal funds for the state share, except for specific exceptions. The OIG can exclude healthcare providers convicted of crimes from federal health care programs. The OIG has the authority to exclude healthcare providers convicted of crimes from federal health care programs, including individuals or entities making false statements in enrollment applications. A loophole allows entities and their officers to evade exclusion by resigning from a sanctioned entity. The President's budget proposes expanding OIG's authority to exclude individuals and entities from federal health programs if they have relationships with sanctioned entities. This would close the loophole that allows officers, managing employees, or owners of sanctioned entities to avoid exclusion by resigning or divesting ownership interests. The proposal aims to save $70 million over the next 10 years and is part of the President's FY2015 budget. The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership is a voluntary collaboration between the government, state officials, law enforcement, health insurance plans, and anti-fraud associations. The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership, established in 2012, aims to detect and prevent healthcare fraud through information exchange. Federal funding for the partnership comes from the HCFAC account, with limitations on expenditures. The President's budget proposes allowing gifts to be made to support the partnership directly. The President's FY2015 budget proposal includes strengthening penalties for distributing beneficiary or identification numbers for federal health care programs to prevent fraud. This proposal would have no budgetary impact over the next 10 years. The President's budget proposes increasing program integrity spending by $0.1 billion in FY2016 and $2.4 billion over the next 10 years. Federal funding for CHIP would be extended through FY2019. The Administration estimates that a proposal costing $33.0 billion over 10 years was not included in the President's FY2015 budget. State CHIP allotment funds are provided annually and available for two years. If a state's allotment is insufficient, funding sources like Child Enrollment Contingency Funds, redistribution funds, and Medicaid funds are available. The President's budget proposes extending the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund through FY2019 at a cost of $0.2 billion over the next 10 years. CHIPRA established performance bonus payments for states that increased Medicaid enrollment among low-income children. Bonus payments were available from FY2009 to FY2013 based on specific enrollment and retention provisions. The CHIPRA performance bonus payments totaled $1.1 billion over five years, going to 27 states based on enrollment exceeding the baseline. The President's budget proposes extending these payments through FY2019, costing $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. This would increase total net outlays for CHIP by $0.6 billion in FY2016 and $35.1 billion over the next 10 years. Nearly all children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid with the same benefits. Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid with the same benefits as other children, including coverage for psychotropic medications. Factors like longer involvement with the child welfare agency and living in a group setting increase the likelihood of a child in foster care taking psychotropic medications. Research on the effectiveness and safety of these medications for children with mental health disorders is limited. Federal child welfare law requires states to provide information on protocols for the appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. The President's budget proposes a five-year joint initiative between CMS and HHS's Administration for Children and Families to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. This proposal includes performance-based incentive payments to states through Medicaid for evidence-based screening and treatment of trauma and mental health disorders. Estimated cost is $0.5 billion over 10 years. The Money Follows the Person program awards grants to states to transition Medicaid beneficiaries from institutions to community-based settings, aiming to increase the use of Medicaid HCBS. Eligible beneficiaries must have resided in an institution for at least 90 days and still require that level of care. The program provides increased federal Medicaid matching rates for 12 months for each transitioned beneficiary. The President's budget proposes extending the program through FY2020. The proposal in the President's FY2015 budget aims to authorize funds for preventing individuals from entering institutions, reducing the institutional requirement from 90 to 60 days, and allowing Medicare-covered days to count towards this requirement. It also allows individuals in certain mental health facilities to transition to community-based residential settings. The Administration estimates no budgetary impact over the next 10 years, with state grants and demonstrations proposals potentially increasing spending by $0.6 billion over the same period. The President's budget proposal includes increasing mandatory funding for program management by $0.4 billion to implement health care proposals. This funding will be used for system changes, process improvements, and enhancing program integrity. The President's FY2015 budget proposal aims to increase mandatory funding for program management by $0.6 billion to reform Medicare physician payments and improve healthcare delivery systems. This proposal is estimated to cost $1.0 billion over the next 10 years. Additionally, current law mandates quality and performance measurement duties for a contracted consensus-based entity.
