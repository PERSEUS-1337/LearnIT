The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is authorized to carry out major medical facility projects using funds appropriated for fiscal year 2002 or 2003. Projects must not exceed $25-30 million and are for improving, replacing, renovating, or updating patient care facilities at VA medical centers. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can use funds for major medical facility projects to update patient care facilities at VA medical centers. Projects should focus on seismic and fire safety, utility systems, accommodation for disabilities, and contemporary standards for research facilities. Improvements at patient care facilities include blind rehabilitation centers, programs for mentally ill veterans, substance-use disorder programs, physical medicine and rehabilitation activities, long-term care facilities, amputation care facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs evaluates projects for approval under various programs including prosthetics, orthotics, spinal cord injury centers, traumatic brain injury programs, women veterans' health programs, and hospice and palliative care facilities. A board independent of the Veterans Health Administration reviews each project before submission to the Secretary for approval. The board reviews projects for relevance to the medical care mission of the Department and assesses if they improve, renovate, repair, or update Department facilities. The Secretary considers the board's recommendations when selecting projects. If a project not recommended by the board is chosen, the Secretary must provide reasons in the report. Authorization of appropriations for construction projects under section 2: $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2003. Projects under section 2 must use funds from these appropriations, except for advance planning funds. Additionally, reports are required. The GAO Report due by April 1, 2003, will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of authorizing projects under section 2 through general authorization. The Secretary must submit a report on the authorization process within 120 days of selecting the final project site under section 2. The Secretary must submit a report on the authorization process under section 2, including project listings, assessments of utility, and recommendations for future congressional policy on medical facility construction projects for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on oversight of capital facilities projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 27, 2001."
