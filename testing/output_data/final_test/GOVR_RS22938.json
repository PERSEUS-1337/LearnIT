    "content": "Maine passed laws in 2003 to regulate shipping and delivery sales of tobacco products, aiming to prevent sales to minors. The laws included a \"recipient-verification\" provision requiring the addressee to be of legal age and show ID, and a \"deemed to know\" provision regarding package markings for tobacco products. Maine laws regulate shipping and delivery sales of tobacco products to prevent sales to minors. The laws require package markings for tobacco products and impose civil penalties for violations. The Supreme Court ruled that two Maine provisions were preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994. The Supreme Court ruled that Maine's mail-order tobacco product delivery laws were preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, similar to the preemption provision in the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act. The Court's decision was based on its interpretation of the preemption language in Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., which found that federal law preempts states from enforcing consumer-fraud statutes against deceptive airline-fare advertisements. The court found that state laws could be preempted if they had a significant impact on carrier rates, routes, or services, even indirectly. However, preemption may not occur if the state law only affects carrier services in a peripheral manner. The Rowe Court ruled that Maine's recipient-verification provision was preempted by federal law as it had a direct connection with motor carrier services and a significant adverse impact on federal preemption objectives. Maine's law was seen as substituting government authority. The Rowe Court found that Maine's law, specifically the \"deemed to know\" provision, directly impacted motor carrier services by imposing civil liability on carriers for not checking tobacco shipments against a proscribed list. This would interfere with Congress' deregulatory objectives by allowing states to implement their own shipment checking systems, leading to a significant impact on federal law. The Rowe Court held that federal law preempts Maine's regulation of a motor carrier's system for carrying goods, rejecting Maine's argument for a public health exception. Maine's law directly impacted motor carrier services, interfering with Congress' deregulatory objectives. The Court rejected Maine's argument for a public health exception to federal preemption of state laws regulating carriers, stating that Congress did not intend to create an exception that could impact tobacco shipments. However, the Court noted that general state public health laws may not always be preempted by federal law. The Court rejected Maine's argument that state laws could regulate carrier rates, routes, and services in connection to tobacco shipments, stating that federal law preempts such state laws with a significant impact. Justice Ginsburg highlighted the regulatory gap left by the FAAAA and the need for Congress to address it. Justice Ginsburg highlighted the regulatory gap left by the FAAAA and the urgent need for Congress to address it, particularly regarding age verification methods for tobacco sales to minors and the ease of purchasing tobacco products online. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address these issues. Justice Scalia concurred with the Court's opinion but disagreed on relying on congressional committee reports to demonstrate congressional intent for propositions already apparent from the text of the law."
