    "content": "The Act titled \"Assuring and Improving Cancer Treatment Education and Cancer Symptom Management Act of 2008\" includes provisions for Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services and research on cancer symptom management improvement. It also mandates an Institute of Medicine study on the provision of symptom management and supportive care in people with cancer. The Congress finds that cancer patients experience side effects and complications from treatment impacting their health and quality of life. Timely symptom management and education can help reduce these effects. Educational interventions by registered nurses have been effective in managing cancer pain for patients in outpatient and home-based settings. After attending a family caregiver cancer education program, caregivers reported feeling well-informed and confident in their caregiving role. Patients benefit from educational sessions with oncology nurses before treatment to manage side effects and improve well-being. The lack of coverage for patient education by Medicare and other payers results in inadequate education for patients and caregivers before treatment initiation. The Oncology Nursing Society recommends one-on-one educational sessions with nurses before cancer treatment to inform patients and caregivers about possible side effects and symptoms. Inadequate Medicare payments and lack of investment in symptom management research contribute to poor patient education, symptom management, and handling of late effects of cancer treatment. Comprehensive cancer care should include appropriate treatment, symptom management, and access to services for nausea and vomiting. Patients receiving different types of cancer care may not receive adequate treatment education. The Institute of Medicine reports emphasize the importance of managing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, and pain in cancer care to improve quality of life. Patients need relief from distressing symptoms, anxiety, and depression, as well as access to information about therapies and potential side effects. Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education and expanded cancer symptom management research can improve care and quality of life for older individuals with cancer. Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services is being expanded under the Medicare program. This includes providing education services for cancer patients as defined in the Social Security Act. Medicare is expanding coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, which includes one-hour education sessions delivered by a registered nurse to individuals diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers before treatment begins. The sessions aim to educate about all aspects of care to be provided. The expanded Medicare coverage includes education sessions by a nurse for cancer patients and caregivers before treatment, covering information on symptoms, side effects, treatment course, self-dosing responsibilities, and reporting side effects to healthcare providers. The expanded Medicare coverage includes a one-hour patient treatment education session for cancer patients and caregivers, providing updated information on symptoms, side effects, treatment course, self-dosing responsibilities, and reporting side effects to healthcare providers. The session is tailored to individual cultural and linguistic needs to ensure comprehension. The Secretary shall consult with relevant organizations to establish standards for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services. Payment rates for these services will be 150 percent of the rate for diabetes outpatient self-management training, without coinsurance. The Medicare Act is amended to include coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services. This coverage applies to services performed more frequently than currently covered. The amendment does not impact payment for other services, specifically chemotherapy infusion or injection codes. The Medicare Act is amended to include coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, effective for services provided after the first day of the first calendar year following the enactment of this Act. Expansion of research on cancer symptom management improvement is proposed in Subpart 1 of part C of the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will expand research on improving cancer symptom management and evaluating nursing interventions. This will be done in collaboration with various institutes and agencies. Nursing intervention research grants will be established. Nursing intervention research grants will be established under Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act. Nursing intervention research grants will be established for studying cancer symptom management care and services delivered by registered nurses to cancer patients, with a registered nurse as the principal investigator. The Director of NIH will provide for the participation of national research institutes in carrying out this section. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The Institute of Medicine will conduct a study on symptom management and supportive care for individuals with cancer. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will arrange for the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on symptom management, patient treatment education, and supportive care for people with cancer, including analyzing barriers to access and delivery of these services. The Institute of Medicine will conduct a study on symptom management, patient treatment education, and supportive care for cancer patients, evaluating incentives in the reimbursement system and the importance of nursing interventions in managing symptoms and side effects. Recommendations will be made to address barriers and challenges identified in the study. The Institute of Medicine will consider various perspectives in a study on symptom management, patient education, and supportive care for cancer patients. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for conducting the study and evaluation required for cancer patient care."
