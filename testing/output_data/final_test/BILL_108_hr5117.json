    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fortifying America's Intellectual Property Rights (FAIR) Act\" and includes findings. The \"Fortifying America's Intellectual Property Rights (FAIR) Act\" acknowledges the importance of international markets to intellectual property industries in the United States, highlighting the threat of infringement and unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted works. The United States is a significant creator and exporter of copyrighted materials, contributing billions of dollars to the economy annually. Global piracy is a major threat to the United States economy, with estimated losses in the motion picture, music, and software industries amounting to billions of dollars annually. The United States Trade Representative is tasked with identifying countries that do not adequately protect intellectual property rights. The USTR plays a crucial role in protecting the intellectual property rights of US persons abroad through trade tools and agreements. Currently, the USTR lacks a dedicated office for this purpose, with the Office of the Assistant USTR for Services, Investment, and Intellectual Property handling a heavy workload due to the significant role of services and investment in the US economy. Establishing a separate office dedicated to intellectual property matters within the USTR, headed by an Assistant USTR for Intellectual Property Rights, would enhance the agency's ability to protect the intellectual property rights of US persons abroad. Additionally, resources dedicated to securing high standards of protection in trade agreements and enforcing those provisions should be increased. Establishing a separate office within the USTR for intellectual property matters, led by an Assistant USTR for Intellectual Property Rights, would strengthen the agency's ability to safeguard US persons' intellectual property rights abroad. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for Intellectual Property Rights, responsible for intellectual property matters in trade agreements. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act and other trade agreements require the identification of countries violating intellectual property rights, investigations, and monitoring of trading partners' enforcement of intellectual property rights by the Assistant United States Trade Representative for Intellectual Property Rights. At least 6 professional staff members are assigned to this role. The Assistant United States Trade Representative for Intellectual Property Rights is required to have at least 6 professional staff members, with 3 specifically assigned to enforcement matters. They are responsible for directing and coordinating interagency activities related to trade-related intellectual property matters and serve as the primary contact in the executive branch for these issues. The Assistant USTR for Intellectual Property Rights receives compensation at the rate of pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. SEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit the powers of the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office."
