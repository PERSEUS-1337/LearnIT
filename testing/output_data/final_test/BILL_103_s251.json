    "content": "The Defense Worker Dislocation Act may be cited as the ``Defense Worker Dislocation Act'' and includes provisions for retraining. The Defense Worker Dislocation Act, also known as the Defense Worker Dislocation Act, allows for retraining. Section 325(a) of the Job Training Partnership Act is amended to allow grants in states where closures or reductions have been notified, and eligible employees have received warnings. Entities must submit an application to the Secretary to be eligible for a grant. Entities must submit an application to the Secretary containing necessary information for approval within 15-30 days. Grants can be used for retraining or skill updates for eligible employees under the Defense Worker Dislocation Act. The Federal government will pay for retraining of eligible defense contractors or subcontractors' employees involved in defense work to transition to nondefense work, ensuring placement in unsubsidized employment. The employer must certify that the employee would have become eligible without the retraining. The Federal government will cover 75 percent of the costs for retaining eligible defense contractors or subcontractors' employees transitioning to nondefense work. Upon approval of the application, 50 percent of the grant will be provided, with the remainder given after the submission of a required report on employee information. Grants under this program can reimburse entities for expenses incurred under other provisions of the title. Eligible employees are those who can benefit the most from the services provided. Performance standards are based solely on placement. The Secretary shall prescribe standards based on placement and retention in unsubsidized employment for eligible defense contractors and subcontractors affected by Department of Defense contracts. Services provided under individual readjustment plans are presumed compliant unless proven otherwise. The term \"eligible defense subcontractor\" refers to a subcontractor affected by a Department of Defense contract and certified by a State agency. An \"eligible employee\" includes dislocated workers impacted by defense expenditure reductions or closures. The term 'employer' includes eligible defense contractors and subcontractors impacted by defense expenditure reductions or closures."
