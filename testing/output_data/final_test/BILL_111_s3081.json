    "content": "The Act titled \"Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010\" allows for the placement of suspected unprivileged enemy belligerents in military custody. The Act \"Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010\" mandates that individuals suspected of engaging in hostilities against the US or its partners be placed in military custody for interrogation and status determination. The Act allows individuals captured by US intelligence agencies to be held in military custody for interrogation and transportation, considering operational needs and avoiding compromise of intelligence missions or sources. SEC. 3. INTERROGATION AND DETERMINATION OF STATUS OF SUSPECTED UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS. The President is authorized to establish an interagency team to interrogate individuals in military custody and make a preliminary determination of their status. Each team will consist of personnel with expertise in national security, terrorism, intelligence, interrogation, or law enforcement as deemed appropriate by the President. The President can establish an interagency team for interrogating individuals in military custody and determining their status. The team will be composed of experts in national security, terrorism, intelligence, interrogation, or law enforcement. High-value detainees are subject to interrogation by a designated group known as the high-value detainee interrogation group. A high-value detainee interrogation group is established to conduct interrogations of high-value detainees, utilizing various personnel including military, intelligence, and law enforcement. The group is responsible for coordinating interrogations within the Executive Branch and determining the status of detainees under the Act. The high-value detainee interrogation group determines the status of detainees based on interrogation results and intelligence information available to them. The group is responsible for interrogating high-value detainees and making preliminary determinations of whether they are unprivileged enemy belligerents. The high-value detainee interrogation group, in consultation with key intelligence agencies, submits determinations of detainee status to the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General for final determination. This final determination is then submitted to the President and Congress to decide if the detainee is an unprivileged enemy belligerent. The President makes the final determination in case of disagreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General regarding high-value detainees. All actions must be completed within 48 hours of placing a detainee in military custody. Regulations govern the operations of high-value detainee interrogation groups, specifying the responsible officers for detainee status determinations. Criteria for designating individuals as high-value detainees include the potential threat posed for attacks on civilians or facilities in the US or abroad and the threat to US citizens or civilian facilities. The criteria for designating individuals as high-value detainees include the potential threat they pose to US military personnel or facilities, their intelligence value, membership in terrorist groups like al Qaeda, and other relevant factors as determined by the President. Interrogations of high-value detainees are primarily focused on protecting US civilians and civilian facilities. The President must submit regulations and guidance for interrogation of high-value detainees to Congress within 60 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON PROSECUTION OF ALIEN UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS. No funds can be used by the Department of Justice to prosecute alien unprivileged enemy belligerents in the US or its territories. Pending final determination of status, high-value detainees are treated as unprivileged enemy belligerents. SEC. 5. DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL OF UNPRIVILEGED ENEMY BELLIGERENTS. SEC. 5 allows for the detention without trial of individuals deemed unprivileged enemy belligerents, including US citizens, for the duration of hostilities against the US or its coalition partners. This detention must comply with the law of war and any authorization for the use of military force provided by Congress. In this Act, the term \"act of terrorism\" is defined as per the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The term \"alien\" refers to a non-US citizen. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" includes specific committees from the Senate and the House of Representatives. The curr_chunk defines terms related to courts, coalition partners, Geneva Convention, and hostilities. The curr_chunk defines terms related to hostilities, including the definitions of \"hostilities,\" \"privileged belligerent,\" and \"unprivileged enemy belligerent.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding conflicts subject to the laws of war and individuals involved in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The curr_chunk specifies that individuals involved in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners must have been a part of al Qaeda at the time of capture. The Act will be effective upon enactment and will apply to individuals captured by the United States after that date."
