    "content": "The Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) governs the management of commercial and recreational fisheries in U.S. federal waters. It has been amended multiple times since 1976, retaining its original elements. The act established regional fishery management councils and emphasizes public input in developing fishery management plans. The focus has shifted towards conservation of fish populations and the marine environment. The MSFCMA was last reauthorized in 2006. The Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) was extensively amended in 2006 (P.L. 109-479), with authorization of appropriations expiring in FY2013. Despite this, Congress has continued to fund the act's requirements. Reauthorization offers the chance for significant amendments, focusing on balancing fish population utilization and conservation. Key issues include ending overfishing, rebuilding fish stocks, and supporting fishermen and fishing communities. Management concerns include data quality, stock assessments, and management process flexibility. Several bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to address these issues. Efforts to reauthorize the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) have been ongoing during the 113th Congress. Hearings have been held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Natural Resources. Drafts have been released by both committees, addressing the balance between conservation and utilization of fish populations. The ongoing debate surrounding the reauthorization of the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) focuses on the need to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks. Key issues include flexibility in stock rebuilding, incorporating new data for annual catch limits (ACLs), improving decision-making processes, establishing limited access privileges, and reducing bycatch. Environmental factors like climate change and habitat loss also pose long-term threats to fish populations' productivity. Quality is a significant long-term threat to fish population productivity. The MSFCMA reauthorization debate focuses on flexibility in rebuilding overfished fisheries. The amendment requires ACLs to end overfishing for federally managed stocks. Rebuilding plans for overfished stocks must adhere to a 10-year timeframe. RFMCs and NMFS must set ACLs within biologically determined levels. FMPs must align with the 10 national standards in the MSFCMA. Council members must consider national standards when developing FMPs. The Secretary of Commerce determines if FMPs align with national standards, including preventing overfishing and achieving optimum yield. MSFCMA amendments require ACLs to end overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks within 10 years. National Marine Fisheries Service updates guidelines for establishing ACLs. The National Marine Fisheries Service updated guidelines in 2008 to establish annual catch limits (ACLs) and biological benchmarks to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks. NMFS issued guidelines on January 16, 2009, emphasizing the need to end overfishing. Potential revisions to the guidelines were discussed in a notice published by NOAA on May 3, 2012. The terms overfishing and overfished are often confused, but they do not always occur together. Overfishing occurs when the rate of removals is high relative to the size of the fish stock, leading to a decline in biomass. A stock is considered overfished when its biomass is below a level that jeopardizes its ability to produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) on a continuing basis. Stock rebuilding has become controversial due to the timeframes required for recovery. Stock rebuilding has become controversial due to strict constraints on harvest levels. Greater flexibility in determining rebuilding periods could increase economic benefits and contribute to fishing community needs. Overfishing has been reduced in most U.S. fisheries, with 28 stocks subject to overfishing and 40 classified as overfished. NOAA reported 34 fish stocks rebuilt since 2000, with reduced fishing mortality under rebuilding plans. The NRC study found that while mortality of stocks under rebuilding plans has decreased and stock biomass has increased, there have been negative impacts on commercial and recreational fishermen and fishing communities. The mixed outcomes of rebuilding plans are attributed to scientific uncertainty and a mismatch between policy makers' expectations and the limits of science. This has raised concerns about the social and economic costs associated with implementing time-constrained rebuilding plans. Many question whether requirements adequately address complexities and uncertainties in managing fish stocks. Fishermen doubt efficacy of population assessments due to data constraints and inadequate models. Environmental factors also impact fish abundance. Environmentalists and managers argue for maintaining stock rebuilding schedules despite past failures, emphasizing long-term economic gains for fishermen. Environmentalists and stakeholders debate the effectiveness of the 10-year rebuilding timeframe for fish stocks, with some arguing for flexibility based on unique characteristics of each fishery to prevent loss of social welfare. Some argue that stock rebuilding targets should consider social and economic factors, not just biological ones. Extending the rebuilding timeframe could lead to increased economic benefits depending on stock productivity and fishery characteristics. Integrating economic and social analysis from the beginning of the management process can help identify the least costly and disruptive management alternatives. Increasing management flexibility may improve short-term economic returns and lessen immediate social impacts. Increasing management flexibility can improve short-term economic returns and reduce immediate social impacts on fishermen when external factors like environmental changes occur. However, excessive flexibility in some fisheries may hinder stock rebuilding progress and lead to higher long-term social costs. Developing specific rules for all fisheries is challenging due to their diverse nature in terms of target species, harvesting technology, and community socioeconomic factors. Dr. Ray Hilborn testified that reducing overfishing leads to underutilization of fish stocks, with 77% of stocks underfished and 30-48% of potential yield lost. Precautionary regulations to prevent overfishing contribute to lack of fishing effort, despite economic profitability being maximized at lower fishing levels. The management objective of maximizing net benefits by decreasing fishing effort to avoid overfishing is complex due to various factors like recreational fishing allocations, processing sectors, and the well-being of fishing communities. Rebuilding stocks using ACLs may improve fishing in the long run but raises questions about the distribution of benefits among fishermen and related businesses. Distributional issues may arise among different commercial gear types. The effects of stock rebuilding on the fishing industry may vary across different segments such as support services, harvesters, processors, wholesalers, and retailers. Distributional issues exist among commercial gear types, fishermen, and ports. Allocation for fisheries can be complex due to the decoupling of present costs and future benefits, with no guarantees for those enduring immediate costs. Small-scale fishermen and fishing communities may be disproportionately affected by overfishing requirements and stock rebuilding programs. The fishing industry is changing due to various factors like technology, social views, and resource limits. Fisheries management now focuses on long-term sustainability, leading to less flexibility for fishermen. Regulations often restrict access to fisheries, especially for smaller vessels and coastal communities. Multispecies fisheries are challenging to manage due to a mix of healthy and overfished stocks. The fishing industry faces challenges in managing multispecies fisheries with a mix of healthy and overfished stocks. Harvesting one stock at its optimum yield may lead to overfishing of another stock. Regulations often restrict fishing on healthy stocks to promote rebuilding of overfished stocks, resulting in lost yield. Greater flexibility in rebuilding timelines could increase profits in the fishery. The NMFS Guidelines address the need for a biological biomass threshold to prevent overfishing and extinction in multispecies fisheries. The mixed stock exception allows for achieving Optimum Yield for some species while potentially allowing overfishing of others, under certain conditions. This exception is limited in use and cannot be applied to stocks that require rebuilding. Several bills introduced during the 112th Congress aimed to increase management flexibility by amending the MSFCMA to change the requirement for rebuilding fish stocks from \"possible\" to \"practicable.\" These bills also proposed exceptions to the 10-year rebuilding requirement, allowing for extensions in certain circumstances such as when the cause of fishery decline is outside the Council's jurisdiction or to minimize economic impacts on fishing communities. The Secretary may extend the 10-year rebuilding period for fish stocks in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of a positive rebuilding trajectory, a substantial change to the biomass rebuilding target, or if the biomass target exceeds the highest abundance in the previous 25 years. The Secretary may extend the 10-year rebuilding period for fish stocks in certain circumstances, such as evidence of a positive rebuilding trend. Factors contributing to overfished status include environmental harm from development, predator-prey relationships, and ecological changes. Fishery management plans must include annual catch limits to prevent overfishing, effective in 2010 for overfished fisheries and 2011 for others. ACL requirements were implemented in 2010 for overfished fisheries and in 2011 for all others, aiming to end overfishing for federally managed fish stocks by setting appropriate catch limits. These limits, known as ACLs, are defined as the maximum annual catch that must not exceed allowable biological catch. Accountability measures (AMs) are put in place to ensure compliance with ACLs, including actions during the fishing season to prevent overages and adjustments in the following year if necessary. The dynamic nature of marine ecosystems and fisheries makes it challenging to determine ACLs and target stock levels, with benchmarks and forecasts constantly changing. NOAA Guidelines identify two types of measures to manage fisheries effectively. The NOAA Guidelines distinguish between management uncertainty, related to incomplete catch data, and scientific uncertainty, linked to stock biomass and fishing mortality rate estimates. Limited biological data and inadequate stock assessment models contribute to scientific uncertainty in fisheries management. The relationship between spawning adults and recruitment in fisheries management is complicated by biological and environmental factors. Assessments are often outdated due to delays in data collection and compilation. Uncertainty in management and scientific aspects of fisheries is inevitable, with factors like mischaracterization of catch adding to the scientific uncertainty. The 2009 guidelines classify fish stocks into two groups - stocks in the fishery and ecosystem component species. Stocks in the fishery require determinations of condition, reference points, and ACLs, while ecosystem component species do not. Ecosystem component species are defined as nontarget species not subject to overfishing or likely to become overfished. The guidelines encourage councils to consider measures to protect ecosystem roles. The guidelines encourage councils to protect ecosystem component species in the fishery by minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality. Disagreements about ACLs stem from management and scientific uncertainties, leading to strict constraints on fisheries. Precautionary approaches are now taken to ensure ACLs are not exceeded. Proposals to improve stock assessments or exclude certain stocks from ACL requirements have been prompted by concerns with uncertainties and their impact on fisheries. Some regions have adjusted to ACL requirements, while others have faced controversy and social issues. Approaches to reducing uncertainty in fisheries, particularly in regions like the Northeast, focus on technical improvements such as better data collection and assessment models. Increasing resources for these purposes is recommended to lower the risk of overfishing. However, these improvements can be costly and may have limited benefits, as the marginal benefits decrease with higher resource allocation. The question remains unanswered for many fisheries on how to address current uncertainties. Many fisheries face uncertainty in their management systems, leading to questions about the need for increased investment. Data-poor stocks lack sufficient information for proper assessment, with many having unknown overfishing and overfished statuses. Despite being of low value, these stocks still play a role in decision-making processes. Many fisheries face uncertainty in management systems, with data-poor stocks lacking sufficient information for assessment. Options for establishing ACLs include using recent average catch, grouping stocks into complexes, or moving stocks to the ecosystem category. ACL requirements may incentivize designating stocks in the ecosystem category to avoid management, despite scientific uncertainty due to data constraints and ecological factors. In 2013, NOAA reported that out of 478 managed fish stocks, 300 were overfished and 230 were overfishing. The Gulf of Maine cod stock exemplifies the challenges faced by fisheries scientists in assessing fish populations. Despite being well-studied, overfishing was still occurring in 2007, but by 2011 the stock had recovered. The 2011 stock assessment at the 53rd Stock Assessment Workshop revealed ongoing overfishing in 2010 with stock spawning biomass at one-third of 2007 levels, indicating the stock was overfished. Recreational fisheries contribute to management uncertainty due to challenges in quantifying catch and managing quotas in real-time, leading to potential overages. Statistical models may lead to unpredictable recreational openings and closures, with the use of accountability measures to limit quotas. The Marine Recreational Information Program aims to improve recreational data, but it will take time to be fully integrated into management processes. Legislation in the 112th Congress focused on excluding certain stocks from ACL requirements to address the need for more timely stock assessments. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to address the need for more timely stock assessments by excluding certain stocks from ACL requirements. Bills proposed amendments to the MSFCMA to allow the Secretary to suspend ACLs under specific conditions. H.R. 3061 aimed to sustain fishing community participation and minimize economic impacts. It also proposed a study with the NRC to update recreational survey methods and evaluate the Marine Recreational Information Program. Catch shares divide fish quotas among entities like fishermen and cooperatives. Catch shares, also known as individual transferable quotas (ITQs) or Individual Fishery Quotas (IFQs), are a type of limited access privilege (LAP) program under the MSFCMA. These programs allocate fish quotas to individuals, rather than sectors or cooperatives. Catch share programs have been controversial since their inception in 1990, with the first federal program established for the Mid-Atlantic surf clam fishery. The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 placed a moratorium on new ITQ programs due to concerns about quota allocations and economic effects. After the moratorium expired in 2002, ten new catch share programs were established, bringing the total to fifteen. Fishery-wide quotas incentivize fishermen to maximize their share of the total quota to prevent overfishing. Catch shares provide fishermen with their own quota, changing incentives and improving economic efficiency by eliminating the need for investments to compete for a greater share of the total quota. Quota shares can be transferable, allowing vessel owners to match their business needs. This system also offers fishermen greater flexibility. Catch shares provide fishermen with greater flexibility to land fish when conditions are favorable, improving markets by spreading out landings over a longer period. Despite increased profitability, catch shares remain controversial due to higher management costs, concerns about fairness in allocation, fleet consolidation, and impacts on fishing communities. Some in the industry feel catch share programs have been imposed on them. Catch shares may increase management costs due to administrative and monitoring expenses. Costs are recovered through fees or shared between the fishing industry and government, leading to contentious debates. Initial allocation of catch is controversial, favoring some fishermen over others. Some fishermen perceive the allocation of quota as unfair to crew members and future fishermen. Those not allocated enough quota may have to sell their share, impacting small remote fishing communities disproportionately. Concerns arise over a small number of fishermen controlling disproportionate shares of quota, potentially changing the nature of fisheries. Consolidation in fisheries may lead to more efficient use of investments in gear and vessels, but could also result in fewer crew members being employed. Greater fleet profitability from consolidation could lead to more stable and permanent jobs. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to address concerns related to LAP fisheries in specific regions. Several bills introduced in Congress aimed to address concerns related to LAP fisheries in specific regions. The bills proposed termination of LAP programs after five years unless approved by two-thirds of eligible fishermen, or if the number of eligible fishermen decreased by 15%. Fees were also required to cover all LAP program costs, including observer costs. H.R. 6350 sought to add the definition of catch share to the MSFCMA, while fisheries managers faced challenges in balancing uncertainty in decision-making processes. Some have questioned NOAA's ability to manage fisheries effectively due to data and science limitations. Suggestions include improving data quality, timely stock assessments, and taking risk-neutral approaches in setting ACLs. Fishermen advocate for a risk-neutral management approach, believing current constraints are unnecessary. NOAA guidelines recommend incorporating precautionary or risk-averse approaches in setting ACLs. Environmentalists advocate for precautionary approaches in fisheries management, citing historic risks taken by managers. They push for impartial peer review of stock assessments to ensure fairness and balance in decision-making. Some argue that the current process already incorporates the best available science. The fishing industry expresses concerns about the need for greater scrutiny in the management process, particularly when management measures negatively impact businesses. Closures in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic recreational fisheries are controversial, with fishermen claiming that abrupt actions harm businesses and hinder planning. They argue that decisions should be based on current conditions and the process should be more transparent and accessible to those being regulated. Several bills proposed changes to RFMC management processes, including requiring risk-neutral scientific advice, limiting SSC recommendations unless peer-reviewed, and mandating reviews of fishery closures' effects on small businesses and coastal communities. Fishermen often miss RFMC meetings due to being at sea. H.R. 2753, H.R. 6350, and H.R. 3061 aimed to increase public participation in RFMC meetings by requiring live broadcasts and providing complete audio, video, and transcripts of certain meetings. SSCs would have been required to submit annual reports on scientific advice to the Council. Many support managing fisheries at the ecosystem level for its potential to consider additional factors. Managing fisheries at the ecosystem level is seen as beneficial for considering additional factors beyond single species stock assessments. Ecosystem-based management advocates emphasize the need for data and models that capture the complexity of the marine environment. Despite the agreement on its relevance, questions remain about the implementation and cost. In 1996, Section 406 of the MSFCMA mandated the establishment of an advisory panel to expand the application of ecosystem principles in fisheries. The panel completed a report in 1998 assessing the application of ecosystem principles in fishery research and management. They highlighted the need for an ecosystem-based approach, considering interactions between fish stocks, predators, competitors, prey species, weather, climate, habitat, and fishing effects. Despite data limitations, practical ways to utilize available information were emphasized. The panel emphasized the need for an ecosystem-based approach in fishery management, recommending the use of fishery ecosystem plans (FEPs) to incorporate ecosystem principles into Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). They suggested that Congress mandate NMFS and regional councils to further integrate ecosystem principles and provide funding for scientific infrastructure. Requiring regional councils to prepare FEPs would help focus fishery management, measure progress, identify research needs, and support ecosystem-based decision-making. The 2006 reauthorization of the MSFCMA required NMFS to study ecosystem-based fishery management, focusing on integrating ecosystem considerations in federal fisheries management. The study aimed to make recommendations for scientific data, stakeholder participation, accounting for environmental effects on fish stocks, and assessing RFMC efforts in implementing ecosystem approaches. The 2009 NOAA report recommended maintaining and expanding fishery surveys, improving ecological models, and investigating the effects of environmental variation on fish stocks, especially climate change. It acknowledged critical gaps in data and modeling for marine ecosystems, stating that ecosystem-based management is more complex and resource-intensive than traditional fisheries management. Councils currently lack the resources to effectively implement ecosystem approaches. The report highlighted limitations in current stock assessments and predictive models, stating that ecosystem shifts are only recognized after they occur. Surveys lack sufficient data to manage all stocks and understand habitat-fish species relationships. Ecosystem components like water quality are outside fishery managers' authority. RFMCs have varied progress in incorporating ecosystem approaches. Some RFMCs have made progress in implementing ecosystem approaches to fisheries management, but there is a lack of agreement on how to do so. Unresolved questions include the level of investment needed and whether statutory changes are necessary. Recent discussions have focused on adapting to climate change, managing forage fish, and integrating habitat considerations. Climate change is expected to impact ecosystems and species composition. Climate change is likely to cause shifts in ecosystems and affect fish stocks. Fisheries managers need to prepare for these changes and coordinate with national and international jurisdictions. Proactive and precautionary approaches may be necessary as systems are modified by climate change. The Arctic Fishery Management Plan has closed U.S. federal waters in the Arctic Ocean to commercial fishing until sufficient data is collected. Forage fish like herring and anchovies are vital to marine ecosystems. Forage fish play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, connecting primary production to higher trophic levels. They are harvested by commercial fishermen for various uses. Some groups advocate for greater protection of forage fish due to their ecosystem importance. The 1996 reauthorization established requirements for essential fish habitat conservation. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) defines Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) as necessary waters and substrate for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth. EFH is identified and described for species in Fishery Management Plans (FMPs), with some areas closed to fishing due to gear impacts on bottom habitat. Prioritizing essential habitat is crucial for measurable progress, especially with limited budgets. Understanding the link between habitat and fish productivity, and the impacts of fishing and non-fishing activities on habitat, is often insufficient. Non-fishing impacts on habitat are not within the authority of fishery management. The MSFCMA requires consultation on nonfishing habitat degradation to minimize impacts. Commercial fishing gear selectivity depends on characteristics and species targeted. National standard 9 mandates measures to minimize bycatch and bycatch mortality. Bycatch is fish harvested but not sold or used personally, including economic discards. Bycatch in a fishery includes economic and regulatory discards. Economic discards are unwanted fish, while regulatory discards are required to be discarded or not sold. The MSFCMA excludes live fish released in recreational programs but NOAA defines bycatch more broadly. The MSFCMA focuses on reducing bycatch through various sections. The MSFCMA focuses on reducing bycatch through standardized reporting methodology, conservation measures, and bycatch reduction incentives. NOAA released a national bycatch report in 2011 to improve data collection and estimation. The report developed a tier system to rate 152 fisheries based on the availability and quality of bycatch data. Tier 0 - 24% of fisheries had no estimates due to lack of data. Tier 1 - 16% had unreliable or unanalyzed data. Tier 2 - 15% had available but improvable data. Tier 3 - 41% had higher quality data than Tier 2. Tier 4 - 4% had the highest quality data. In 2005, national bycatch was estimated at 1.221 billion pounds. The 2005 national bycatch report estimated 1.221 billion pounds of bycatch, with efforts to improve data collection and reduce bycatch still ongoing. Bycatch can harm marine ecosystems, deplete protected species, and result in economic losses. Efforts to reduce bycatch in fisheries have been successful, with initiatives such as closing areas with high Chinook salmon bycatch rates in the North Pacific. However, only 20 percent of existing Fishery Management Plans include incentives to minimize bycatch. Environmental groups advocate for more incentives, bycatch caps, and selective fishing gear to further reduce bycatch. Adequate knowledge of discarded organisms is crucial for measuring fishing mortality and developing reliable stock assessments. Efforts to reduce bycatch in fisheries have been successful, but there is a lack of bycatch data which hampers the development of ACLs. Bycatch information is often unreliable due to insufficient observer coverage on fishing boats. Electronic monitoring systems are being developed as a cost-effective alternative. Disaster relief may be provided by the federal government in cases of commercial fishery failure. Disaster assistance for commercial fishery failures can be provided by the Department of Commerce under specific acts. NMFS determines if a failure has occurred and allocates federal funds to states and fishing communities. Congress appropriates funds and oversees the process, while states play a key role in requesting, providing information, and disbursing funds. Critics argue that assistance programs often face delays in fund disbursement. Disaster assistance for commercial fishery failures can face delays in fund disbursement due to the lack of a permanent relief fund and challenges in appropriating funding in a timely manner. Legislation has been proposed to expedite the determination process by the Secretary of Commerce within 60 days. The study aimed to find the best way to insure harvesters, with the FCIC required to report results to House and Senate committees. Commercial fishermen were proposed to be eligible for emergency loans from the USDA's Farm Service Agency. However, these provisions were not included in the final bill. The use of at-sea observers and electronic monitoring systems has increased to monitor compliance and collect data on commercial fishing boats. Electronic monitoring, using cameras and other equipment, has become more common in monitoring fisheries due to cost and space limitations. Data collected is essential for stock assessments and regulations. Confidentiality rules under the MSFCMA protect data submitted for management purposes, allowing disclosure only in aggregated summary formats to prevent revealing specific business information. Subsistence fishing, a significant activity in coastal areas, is not explicitly addressed in the MSFCMA. While benefiting from sustainable stock management, subsistence fishermen can be impacted by allocation decisions. Their needs and use of fishery resources differ from recreational and commercial fishermen. The MSFCMA does not define subsistence fishing, but it involves customary and traditional uses in rural areas. Some groups are concerned that fisheries regulations do not account for traditional values and cultural beliefs, questioning if subsistence fishing could benefit from being included in resource management decisions. The halibut IFQ program has led to reduced fisheries participation in small Alaska indigenous communities. International agreements establish regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) to manage fish stocks across national jurisdictions and the high seas. Nations must align domestic laws with these agreements, often through legislation like the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006. This legislation addresses issues such as illegal fishing practices. The Fishing Moratorium Protection Act (P.L. 104-43) addresses illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by identifying nations engaged in IUU fishing and prohibiting U.S. imports of fisheries products from non-compliant nations. Bills introduced in the 113th Congress aim to strengthen enforcement provisions for international fishery agreements and reduce IUU fishing activities. The Tuna Commission was established by the 1949 Antigua Convention, ratified by the Senate in 2005. S. 269 was reported in 2013 but no further action was taken. The Agreement on Port State Measures aims to prevent illegal fishing by requiring advance notice for port entry and regular inspections. The Agreement on Port State Measures requires advance notice for port entry, regular inspections, and denial of port services for offending vessels. The United States signed the Agreement on November 22, 2009, and ratified it on April 3, 2014. The Pirate Fishing Elimination Act (S. 267) was introduced in the 113th Congress on February 11, 2012, to implement the agreement and apply to vessels seeking entry to U.S. ports. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 shifted jurisdiction of marine fishery resources within 3 to 200 nautical miles of shore to the federal government, while states retained jurisdiction up to three nautical miles offshore. The act aims to balance state interests with federal conservation goals through RFMCs and regional commissions. Some fishermen support shifting management responsibility to state or regional levels for better local knowledge and economic needs. This may require more state resources for data collection and stock assessment. However, others oppose further decentralization, fearing it may prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term sustainability. The red snapper fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico are a contentious issue, with calls for greater state involvement. The Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery has been managed by the federal government, but there are calls for greater state involvement. The stock was overfished in the 1990s, leading to rebuilding efforts by the Gulf of Mexico RFMC. While the stock biomass has increased, shorter seasons have resulted from higher catch rates by recreational fishermen. There are concerns about the accuracy of stock assessments and the complexity of inconsistent fishing seasons between state and federal waters. Some advocate for states to have a larger role in managing the fishery, including determining fishing seasons. Some bills in the 113th Congress aim to transfer management authority over red snapper from federal to state or regional control. H.R. 1430, S. 681, and S. 747 would grant management authority to coastal states, contingent on agreement by the Governors on a fishery management plan. If no agreement is reached, authority would revert back to the Secretary of Commerce. H.R. 3099, H.R. 3197, and S. 1161 would transfer authority to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission to develop a new management plan. H.R. 3099 and H.R. 3197 aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Gulf of Mexico red snapper population by requiring review and certification by the Secretary of Commerce. NOAA's Asset Forfeiture Fund (AFF) is funded by fines from fishermen violating marine laws, with concerns raised about misuse in a 2010 investigation. In response to management issues, NOAA began implementing reforms in 2010. Five bills were introduced during the 112th Congress to address concerns with NOAA enforcement funds, proposing the use of fines for fisheries management needs. Some bills aimed to reimburse fishermen for legal fees in certain fisheries enforcement cases. Legislation such as H.R. 2610, S. 1304, and S. 1312 aimed to reimburse fishermen for legal fees related to fisheries enforcement penalties. Regulatory uncertainties and technical challenges in developing commercial aquaculture in federal waters have hindered progress. Bills have been introduced to establish a regulatory system for offshore aquaculture in the U.S. EEZ, with controversy surrounding potential environmental and economic impacts. On January 28, 2009, the Gulf of Mexico RFMC approved a plan to regulate aquaculture in federal waters. The plan took effect on September 3, 2009, as the Secretary of Commerce did not oppose it. NOAA is reviewing draft regulations to implement the plan, expected to be completed in 2014. Some question NOAA's authority to regulate aquaculture under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. NOAA asserts its authority based on the Act's fishery management jurisdiction over the EEZ. The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides authority to regulate aquaculture in the EEZ, but controversy remains on whether it should be regulated under the Act. Ecolabels and seafood guides aim to promote conservation by identifying sustainable seafood options for consumers. Ecolabels and seafood guides promote sustainable seafood consumption by certifying products that meet specific criteria set by organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council. Certification ensures that fisheries adopt sustainable practices and maintain a separate chain of custody for certified seafood. Seafood guides provide information on sustainable seafood choices, categorizing products as best choice, good alternative, or to avoid. They include details on species, fishing gear, and harvest locations. However, information in supermarkets or restaurants is often limited for consumers to determine specific fishery or capture methods. Some argue for independent seafood certification programs due to government failures in managing fisheries. The absence of a U.S. government label has led to private companies and NGOs filling the gap. However, others believe that current federal and state regulations are sufficient to ensure sustainability without the need for additional certification. The 10 MSFCMA national standards may be enough to ensure sustainability in fisheries, but there is disagreement on the definition of sustainable fisheries and measurement standards. Seafood eco-labels focus on various concerns like ecosystem impacts and aquaculture methods, leading to discrepancies in recommendations. Some suggest government involvement in ecolabeling for credibility. Commercial fishing is hazardous, with a high fatality rate compared to other occupations. The U.S. Coast Guard regulates safety equipment and vessel procedures under the Commercial Fishing Safety Act of 1988. Fatalities in commercial fishing have decreased since then, with efforts to improve safety. Some fishermen urge fishery managers to prioritize safety in regulations. There are debates on revising the MSFCMA standard to focus more on safety considerations. Some recommend revising the MSFCMA standard to prioritize safety in fisheries management. The 2006 reauthorization added a provision to assess the impact of management measures on the safety of fishermen. NOAA is updating guidelines to address this provision, but no further action has been taken since a proposed rule was published in 2011. When the MSFCMA was reauthorized in 2006, NMFS was required to revise procedures to comply with NEPA for fisheries management actions. Issues arose due to timing mismatches and roles between NEPA and MSFCMA processes. NMFS consulted with CEQ and RFMCs, proposed a rule for better alignment, but it was withdrawn at OMB's request. Instead, NMFS developed an Interim Policy Directive focusing on roles, coordination, NEPA documentation, and partnerships. The NMFS developed an Interim Policy Directive to address issues with NEPA compliance for fisheries management actions. RFMCs questioned the alignment of MSA and NEPA processes and claimed inadequate consultation during policy development. The Marine Mammal Protection Act established a moratorium on taking marine mammals, with exceptions granted through permits for commercial fishing activities. The Secretary of Commerce oversees whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, while the Secretary of the Interior manages walruses, sea otters, polar bears, manatees, and dugongs. Issues include data gaps in assessing human-caused mortality and marine mammal stocks, as well as concerns about mammal populations impacting fisheries yield. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows NOAA to designate areas for conservation and management to preserve ecological values. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows NOAA to designate areas for conservation and management to preserve ecological values. NOAA has designated 13 sanctuaries of varying sizes for specific reasons, such as protecting cultural artifacts or entire ecosystems. Each sanctuary has its own management plans and regulations, leading to a wide variation in permitted uses. Fisheries are not regulated in most sanctuaries, and fisheries conservation is not the primary objective of any of the 13 national marine sanctuaries. The NMSA provides the appropriate RFMC the opportunity to determine if sanctuary fishing regulations are necessary. The Antiquities Act of 1906 allows the President to proclaim marine areas as national monuments, raising concerns about abuse of executive power and lack of public input. The Antiquities Act allows the President to designate marine areas as national monuments, sparking debate over its use. The Endangered Species Act protects species at risk of extinction by listing them as endangered or threatened, providing legal tools for recovery and habitat protection. Fishing activities may be restricted to minimize harm to protected marine species. Efforts are being made to reauthorize the MSFCMA during the 113th Congress, with proposals including flexibility in rebuilding fish stocks, setting ACLs, developing catch share programs, data confidentiality, and red snapper management. The House draft is open for public input, while the Senate draft addresses subsistence uses, forage fish, capital funds, rebuilding timeframes, and allocation review. The Committees plan to release refined proposals and make progress on reauthorization issues in 2014. Societal values are important in developing national policies alongside scientific input. The fishing industry faces challenges due to natural variability in fish populations and the need for stock rebuilding. A key policy question is whether to provide more management flexibility and resources to support commercial fishing and communities. Seafood is a major food source dependent on wild population harvest. Regulations on fisheries have become more rigid as fish stocks are overexploited. Fishery managers and fishermen can only control fishing effort to increase fish population abundance. In the agricultural sector, programs help farmers manage financial risks from natural disasters. Crop insurance protects producers, communities, and lending institutions. Many argue for more resources for data collection and stock assessments in the fishing industry to improve understanding of marine ecosystems and populations. However, the benefits of increased information may decrease with higher investments, as costs may outweigh benefits. Constraints to fishing remain regardless of improvements in data, assessments, and management. Managers face challenges in maintaining marine ecosystem productivity and population health due to environmental factors like climate change and habitat loss. This requires developing integrated management systems across agencies and disciplines to minimize constraints on economic activities. Some advocate for catch share programs in marine fisheries for flexibility, but fishermen are skeptical due to allocation issues. Progress requires integrating social concerns and bioeconomic analysis, along with industry input in data collection. Management costs have increased, prompting the need for cooperative research. President Truman issued proclamations in 1945 to address U.S. rights to marine resources beyond the territorial sea, emphasizing the need for conservation and management. Fishing technology advancements led to increased catches in offshore areas in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s and 1960s, foreign fishing vessels began operating in waters adjacent to the United States, leading to concerns about overfishing and depletion of fish stocks. This prompted the United States to declare jurisdiction over fisheries resources within 200 miles of the coastline through the enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) created a new federal fishery management system in 1976. By 1983, a 200-mile exclusive economic zone was established, shifting management under the FCMA. The Act aimed to expand domestic fishing industries and decrease foreign catch allocations. The FCMA, enacted in 1977, established a regional management system prioritizing domestic fishermen. It vested federal management authority in NMFS within NOAA. Eight Regional Fishery Management Councils were created, each comprising representatives from states in the region, NMFS regional director, and members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. Councils receive input from advisory committees. Fishery management councils receive input from various advisory committees, including species committees and ad hoc committees. Each council has a Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) and subcommittees for specific species. The SSC provides scientific advice for developing fishery management plans (FMPs) in federal waters, which include catch limits, minimum sizes, seasons, closed areas, and other measures. Public input is a crucial part of the council process. Most data collection and scientific assessments supporting FMP development are done by NMFS at regional science centers and labs. Management functions are carried out at NMFS regional headquarters. Proposed actions are reviewed by council committees, then submitted to NMFS for further review. Approved plans are implemented through regulations drafted by NMFS regional offices and enforced by the Secretary of Commerce. The management of fishery resources is regulated by NMFS, the Coast Guard, and state agencies through 46 FMPs developed by councils and NMFS. Plans are amended periodically to adapt to changes in the fishery. FMPs can be for individual species or larger species assemblages, with NMFS managing highly migratory species like tunas and sharks. The United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world, spanning the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. The implementation of fishery management plans, some developed jointly by multiple councils, has led to a decline in foreign catch in U.S. federal waters since 1992. Domestic offshore catch has increased significantly, with U.S. fishermen landing 10.2 billion pounds of unprocessed fish in 2012. In 2012, U.S. fishermen landed 10.2 billion pounds of unprocessed fish and shellfish from state, federal, and outside U.S. waters with a value of $5.63 billion at the dock. Total domestic landings totaled 9.63 billion pounds, with 7.48 billion pounds for human food and 2.16 billion pounds for industrial purposes. The top five species by volume were pollock, menhaden, cod, flatfish, and salmon. The value of domestically produced edible products was $9.5 billion, with crabs, scallops, and shrimp being the top species by value. In 2012, U.S. per capita seafood consumption was 14.4 pounds, with 91% imported. Edible fishery imports were 5.4 billion pounds valued at $16.7 billion, while exports were 3.3 billion pounds worth $5.5 billion. U.S. consumers spent $82.6 billion on seafood, with $55.2 billion in restaurants. Marine recreational anglers made 70 million fishing trips, catching 380 million fish. Top species by value were crabs, scallops, shrimp, salmon, and lobster. In 2012, marine recreational anglers in the United States caught an estimated 380 million fish, with 140 million fish retained. Most fishing trips were taken on the Atlantic coast, followed by the Gulf coast and the Pacific coast. A nationwide survey in 2011 estimated that saltwater recreational anglers spent over $10.3 billion on fishing trips and equipment. Various groups are involved in managing marine fisheries, with differing opinions on how to achieve common goals. Advocates of diverse groups involved in the reauthorization of the MSFCMA include national, regional, and local representation as well as individuals or informal groups. Recreational interests in fishing encompass a variety of activities such as non-extractive sports, catch and release fishing, and extractive recreational fishing from shore, boats, and charters. Different modes of recreational angling include fishing from shore, boats, and charters or party boats. Charters and party boats are commercial operations that provide fishing opportunities to sport anglers for a fee. Recreational interests are concerned about decisions affecting access to fisheries and allocation of fishing quotas among different interests. Commercial fishing involves harvesting fish for sale, with participants also gaining satisfaction from maintaining their livelihood and independence. Commercial fishing can be divided by target species, scale, and region, with different views among users based on fishing gear, port, or fishing grounds. During the last two decades, there has been increasing emphasis on the inter-dependence between fishing dependent businesses and maintaining fishing communities. National and regional environmental groups have gained influence in the fishery management process, focusing on indirect harm from fishing gear on marine mammals and sea turtles. Fishing associations and representatives offer regional perspectives on national and regional issues reflected in specific provisions of the act. Advocacy has expanded to include concerns about overfishing, bycatch, habitat, and marine biodiversity. Environmentalists and fishermen may have conflicting interests, but also share common concerns such as habitat degradation. Native American groups have cultural ties to marine resources and federal government may be required to protect their treaty rights. Tribes and indigenous peoples aim to preserve traditions, promote economic stability, and ensure resource sustainability. Fishery scientists and managers play a key role in fisheries management. Fishery scientists and managers are concerned with conserving and managing fishery resources to ensure future benefits. They analyze biological, social, cultural, and economic effects of federal fisheries management policy. Adequate funding for data collection and stock assessments is a primary concern. Fishery managers develop policies and implement management measures. Consumers are concerned with the availability, quality, and safety of seafood products, promoting sustainability. NOAA personnel draft, implement, and enforce fishery regulations. Consumers are increasingly concerned about sustainable fisheries and fraudulent seafood sales. Non-governmental organizations have developed ecolabels and seafood guides to help inform choices. Seafood safety and fraud are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing by implementing annual catch limits (ACLs) and improving science in federal policy decision-making. Councils are now required to set fishing limits based on scientific recommendations to prevent overfishing and maintain sustainable harvests. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 aimed to end overfishing by implementing annual catch limits and improving science in federal policy decision-making. The legislation increased the role of science in decision-making through provisions focused on Regional Fishery Management Councils' Scientific and Statistical Committees, requiring councils to develop rebuilding plans for overfished stocks within two years. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSFCMA) amended the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to advise councils on various issues related to fisheries management. It required Scientific and Statistical Committees (SSCs) to provide guidance on stock status, catch limits, overfishing, bycatch, habitat status, and sustainability. The amendments also enhanced transparency in the management process by establishing training programs for council members and clarifying conflict-of-interest requirements for RFMC members. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 enhanced transparency in fisheries management by requiring disclosure of financial arrangements that may pose a conflict of interest. It also authorized guidelines for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) to allocate fishing privileges and prevent \"derby\" fishing. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 improved transparency in fisheries management by requiring disclosure of financial conflicts of interest. It also authorized Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) to allocate fishing privileges and prevent excessive fishing. NOAA is directed to develop eligibility criteria for LAPPs based on traditional fishing practices, cultural and social aspects of the fishery, and projected economic impacts. Processors can participate in LAPPs but not receive a separate quota. Recreational fisheries data collection is also prioritized, including establishing regional registry programs for marine recreational fishermen. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 improved transparency in fisheries management by requiring disclosure of financial conflicts of interest and authorized Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) to prevent excessive fishing. The act also prioritized recreational fisheries data collection, including establishing regional registry programs for marine recreational fishermen. Amendments directed the Secretary to establish a cooperative research and management program, with requirements including identifying projects for funding to improve stock assessments, assessing bycatch and mortality, and collecting social and economic data. The Secretary of Commerce was directed to establish guidelines to protect participants' catch history and issue regulations for expediting regionally based experimental fishery. The 2006 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act directed the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations for expediting regionally based experimental fishery permits and focused on developing information for pilot projects to advance ecosystem considerations in regional fishery management. This included studying the state of the science, recommending scientific data and technology requirements, incorporating stakeholder participation, and providing technical assistance to councils for regional pilot programs. Other research efforts were also mentioned. The 2006 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act focused on developing regional pilot programs, deep sea coral research, and promoting new gear technologies to reduce bycatch. International efforts were made to combat Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing through strengthening enforcement measures and improving compliance with high seas fisheries regulations. The 2006 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act focused on combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) through defining IUU violations and allowing for enforcement measures under the High Seas Driftnet Act. The amendments also implemented provisions of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention, making conservation and management measures legally binding for nations and vessels under U.S. jurisdiction. The 2006 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act focused on combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) through defining violations and enforcement measures. Additional provisions included authorizing appropriations for implementing activities, establishing marine education and training programs, regional economic transition programs for disaster relief, and implementing the Pacific Whiting Act of 2006 between the United States and Canada. NMFS has summarized various activities associated with implementing the amendments in a table listing tasks. The NMFS report to Congress includes implementing new provisions to reduce IUU fishing activities and final guidance amending National Standard 1 to end overfishing. NMFS also released a new national policy on the use of catch shares in fishery management plans. RFMC, RFMO, and SSC are key organizations involved in fishery management."
