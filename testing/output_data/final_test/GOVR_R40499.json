    "content": "Approximately 1.7 million children in the U.S. have parents currently incarcerated, with over 10 million children experiencing parental separation due to incarceration. Around 53% of the 1.5 million inmates in the nation's prisons are parents of minor children. States are reevaluating their prison policies due to overcrowding, budget constraints, and the economic crisis, potentially leading to the release of nonviolent offenders. Shortfalls in prison policies may result in parents convicted of nonviolent offenses being released earlier than their sentence. Reconnecting former inmates with their families is crucial for society and Congress. Correctional institutions are focusing on successful re-entry to reduce recidivism and promote safer communities. Employment and support are key factors in successful reintegration. Research indicates that successful re-entry after prison relies on employment and family connections. The Child Support Enforcement program helps custodial parents obtain financial support from noncustodial parents, including those who were formerly incarcerated. Child support payments play a significant role in ensuring financial responsibility towards children, with it constituting about 17% of family income on average and 30% for poor households. The Child Support Enforcement program plays a crucial role in ensuring financial support for children, with payments constituting about 30% of family income. Positive family relationships, facilitated by regular child support payments, can lead to family stability and reduce recidivism. The alignment of state and federal correctional facilities' mission with the CSE program's goal provides an opportunity for positive outcomes for children. Congress and the Obama Administration are evaluating federal programs to reduce budget waste, which may encourage innovative collaboration among agencies. The report examines the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program in the context of former inmates re-entering communities. It reviews the program, data on parents in prison, and issues related to child support payment. Policy options are presented to address nonpayment, including ways for the CSE program to help ex-offenders reconnect with their children and communities, leading to lower recidivism and increased support payments. The focus is on dealing with nonpayment by noncustodial parents who are or were in prison. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to address nonpayment of child support by noncustodial parents, including those who are or were in prison. As more inmates are released, the program faces pressure to increase support collections and reduce debt, potentially leading to fewer parents returning to prison. The CSE program, established in 1975, helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents through various services. It operates in all 50 states and four jurisdictions, administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) under the Administration on Children and Families (ACF). The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) under the Administration on Children and Families (ACF), collects child support payments from noncustodial parents. The federal government and states share program costs, with the federal government paying states an incentive payment to operate effective CSE programs. In FY2007, the program collected $24.9 billion in child support payments and served nearly 15.8 million child support cases, with an average collection of $4.73 for each $1 spent on the program. In FY2007, the CSE program collected $4.73 for each $1 spent, totaling $5.6 billion in expenditures. Despite overall success, only 55% of cases had collections, and 19% of child support obligations were met. The program faces challenges in enforcing support until paternity is established, leaving 29% of children without support orders in FY2006. Many parents in the CSE program do not have child support orders issued on their behalf, partly due to low incomes. A 2007 survey in three states showed that non-custodial parents earn only slightly more than custodial parents. Policymakers believe that a significant number of low-income parents are unable to pay child support. Additionally, in mid-2007, 53% of U.S. prisoners were parents of minor children. In the U.S., 53% of 1.5 million prisoners are parents of minor children, with 52% in state prisons and 63% in federal prisons. These parents have a total of 1.7 million minor children. Inmates and former inmates are known to pay the lowest amount of child support, with high arrearages. About 25% of inmates have open child support cases, owing between $225 to $313 per month in child support. On average, they enter prison with $10,000 in arrearages and leave owing more. Former inmates enter prison with $10,000 in child support arrearages and leave owing over $23,000. Policymakers are focused on helping ex-offenders successfully reunite with their families and reintegrate into society. Family support and employment are key factors for successful re-entry. With limited resources, there is a push for effective and efficient programs, as the Obama Administration aims to reduce waste in the federal budget. The CSE program is being reviewed by Congress to address the impact of released inmates on local communities due to budget shortfalls and overcrowded prisons. Unrealistic child support orders and high debt are affecting program results. Many ex-offenders owe child support and are low-income noncustodial parents, so proposals to resolve child support issues would also help inmates and former inmates. The increase of mothers in prisons may impact the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. Federal law allows for the termination of parental rights for ex-offenders. Child support orders legally require noncustodial parents to financially support their children. Before 1989, courts had discretion in determining child support amounts, leading to varying awards. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 aimed to establish objective criteria for child support payments. The Family Support Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-485) required states to establish child support guidelines, making them the default unless proven otherwise in the best interest of the child. This aimed to increase the adequacy, consistency, predictability, and compliance of child support awards. States use different types of guidelines to determine child support award amounts, including \"Income shares,\" \"percentage of income,\" and \"Melson-Delaware.\" There is variation among states in the amount of child support obligation, especially for lower-income parents. The variance in child support orders widens due to state-established guidelines, especially for lower-income parents. Controversial issues like child care costs, medical expenses, and college expenses impact the range of support awards among states. Other factors include treatment of stepparent income, allocation of noncustodial parent income, minimum support levels, and duration of support orders. Many noncustodial parents struggle with high child support payments that exceed their affordability. They argue that the system does not consider their basic living expenses when calculating support amounts. The child support obligation varies depending on how the state determines income and guidelines application. When actual income is unavailable or deemed unreliable, income may be attributed to the noncustodial parent based on imputed income, even if incorrect assumptions are made. Setting child support orders above a noncustodial parent's ability to pay can decrease support received by the custodial parent. Realistic child support orders for low-income noncustodial parents may result in more child support payments. In FY2007, $138.0 billion in child support obligations was owed to families receiving CSE services, but only $26.1 billion was paid. The CSE program collected 19% of the total child support obligations, 61% of current child support payments, and less than 7% of arrearage payments in FY2007. In FY2007, $107.2 billion in child support arrearages was reported, but only $7.3 billion was collected. Arrearages can accumulate through nonpayment of child support or when the noncustodial parent is unemployed or incarcerated. Child support orders can be in effect for 18 years or longer, but they are not automatically changed when circumstances change. Noncustodial parents must show a change in financial circumstances and petition the CSE agency or court to lower their child support order. States are now required to review and adjust child support orders for children receiving TANF benefits every three years. Being in prison is not typically a basis for modifying child support. In many states, being in prison is not considered a valid reason for modifying child support orders. Some states view incarceration as voluntary unemployment due to the intentional criminal act leading to imprisonment. However, in some states, incarcerated parents can petition to have their child support order modified to a lower amount. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program has various enforcement methods to collect child support arrearages and encourage parents to meet their obligations regularly and on time. The accumulation of child support arrearages is a major concern as noncustodial parents mistakenly believe the amount owed can be reduced later by the court. However, if financial circumstances change, the court cannot retroactively reduce back payments. Collecting these arrearages would benefit children and families, while large balances give the impression that state CSE programs are not performing competently. The perception that state CSE programs are not effective due to growing child support arrearages may be oversimplified. An Urban Institute report explains that collecting arrears from obligors with no or low reported income is challenging. The CSE program serves both welfare and nonwelfare families, with collections for nonwelfare families going directly to the family. The CSE program aims to prioritize families' self-sufficiency by ensuring child support is a reliable income source. Legislation like P.L. 104-193 and P.L. 109-171 have advanced this \"family first\" policy. In 2007, 92% of child support collections went to families, with a focus on those who had previously received TANF benefits. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program collects billions in past-due payments, but the overall child support debt continues to grow. High arrearages may discourage noncustodial parents from paying support, as they perceive the system as unfair. Many fathers feel the CSE system is dismissive of their financial situation. The CSE program pursues child support payments from struggling parents, causing conflicts with mothers who use it as leverage. The female prison population, many of whom are mothers, has increased significantly since the early 1990s. Between 1991 and 2007, the number of mothers in prison increased by 122%, from 29,500 to 65,600. The rise in female inmates is attributed to mandatory sentencing laws for drug offenses. Analysts argue that the social impacts on children when mothers are imprisoned may be more detrimental, as mothers are typically the primary caretakers. Children of incarcerated mothers often have more varied and uncertain living arrangements, leading to a higher likelihood of being removed from the home. The increase in mothers in prison from 1991 to 2007 is significant, with children being more likely to be separated from their mothers compared to fathers. Female inmates were often the primary caretakers of their children before incarceration, leading to children living with relatives or in foster care. The impact on children's lives when their mothers are imprisoned is a concern, with commentators noting the difficulty of punishing women without affecting their children. Most mothers in prison were caretaker parents before incarceration, and the stigma and trauma of their imprisonment can be challenging for their children. Alternatives to prison, like community-based programs, could be considered for low-risk mothers. Reuniting with their children after release is a common goal, but the process is often difficult and can result in permanent parental rights termination. In some cases, incarceration can lead to permanent severance of parental rights, often resulting from criminal convictions. A felony conviction or incarceration was grounds for termination of parental rights in 27 states. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 required child welfare agencies to file for termination of parental rights if a child had been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, making it more likely for incarcerated parents with children in foster care to lose their parental rights. In 2004, a significant percentage of inmates in state and federal prisons had already served five or more years. One exception to the foster care rule allows children to be placed with relatives of incarcerated parents to avoid strict adoption requirements. Critics argue that women in prison, who were primary caretakers, are at higher risk of losing legal ties to their children compared to imprisoned fathers. Incarcerated fathers are less likely to be affected by federal provisions as their children usually live with their mothers, while incarcerated mothers are more likely to be impacted as their children often have absent fathers. It is crucial for family members to get involved in caring for children with incarcerated parents to prevent them from entering the foster care system and maintain parental ties. The Fostering Connections to Success law emphasizes the importance of recruiting relatives as caregivers for these children. The Fostering Connections to Success law authorizes funding for states to locate relatives of children and reimburse relative caretakers. Some suggest prisons should have a database of incarcerated parents for child welfare agencies. Exceptions to foster care time limits include cases where termination of parental rights is not in the child's best interest or when parents have not received required services for reunification. Many argue that parental rights should not be terminated due to a parent's incarceration, as it can have negative emotional and financial consequences for both the parent and child. Maintaining family connections and support is seen as crucial for successful outcomes for children with incarcerated parents. The parent is legally obligated to stay away from the child and have no contact. Ways to resolve issues in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program are discussed, including realistic child support orders, modification of obligations, and program coordination. Policymakers emphasize parents sharing the cost of supporting children based on their ability to pay. Policymakers stress the importance of setting appropriate child support orders based on parents' ability to pay, promptly adjusting orders when family circumstances change, and intervening when payments are not made. This is crucial during economic downturns to ensure children receive necessary financial support. However, setting child support orders too high may lead noncustodial parents to evade payments by working in the underground economy, while overly burdensome orders could result in incarceration, further hindering financial stability. Advocates for low-income parents stress the importance of considering economic realities in determining child support obligations. They suggest a low presumptive child support award for some noncustodial parents, emphasizing even small amounts can benefit children. It is seen as a way for noncustodial parents to acknowledge their responsibility to provide financial support, without alienating them or leading to incarceration. Advocates emphasize the need for realistic child support obligations, suggesting low presumptive awards to benefit children and avoid alienating noncustodial parents. The Project to Avoid Increasing Delinquencies (PAID) aims to improve child support order establishment by using income data for accurate assessments. The Project to Avoid Increasing Delinquencies (PAID) suggests reforms to child support guidelines, including presuming income at a reasonable level, accounting for a self-support reserve amount, limiting retroactive support amounts, reducing default orders, and allowing easy amendment of orders. Congressional legislation may be needed to require states to implement these changes. Congress may need to pass legislation to require states to implement changes to child support guidelines, including setting more realistic child support orders for ex-offenders. Despite a low percentage of arrearage payments collected in FY2007, 61% of obligors continued to make payments, indicating financial struggles among noncustodial parents. The Urban Institute study found that high debtors struggle to meet child support obligations, with orders often exceeding 55% of their income. They are less likely to pay support, have older orders, multiple orders, unknown addresses, and interstate cases. States have flexibility in modifying child support guidelines. States have flexibility in modifying child support guidelines, with federal law requiring reviews every three years. Analysts suggest changes to be more sensitive to periods of incarceration, unemployment, or illness affecting noncustodial parents' ability to pay. It is challenging for incarcerated parents to meet monthly payments, leading to recommendations for states to consider waiving or reducing obligations for parents in prison. Some argue that interest charges on overdue child support payments of incarcerated noncustodial parents should be prohibited as it adds to their debt, making it harder for them to pay. Others believe charging interest is necessary to ensure children receive support and to incentivize timely payments. Charging interest is seen as a fairness issue, ensuring custodial parents receive payments on time. Some suggest leveraging child support arrearages owed to state governments to encourage timely payments and avoid sending the message that noncustodial parents can ignore their obligations. Targeting low-income noncustodial parents for interest amnesty or debt compromise programs is recommended to address child support debt accumulation. The OCSE Strategic Plan proposes procedures to reduce high child support arrearages, including updating guidelines regularly, using automation to detect non-compliance early, and considering creative ways to promote regular payment of current support. This may involve compromising uncollected child support arrearages to encourage consistent payment. Some states use debt compromise to reduce child support debt, but federal share still owed. Congress would need to pass legislation to eliminate federal portion of debt. Recommendations include revising garnishment limits for child support. Garnishment can be up to 65% of wages, impacting housing, transportation, and employment for parents released from prisons and jails. Policymakers and observers recommend enabling courts to consider child support obligations at sentencing, prohibiting incarceration from being seen as \"voluntary unemployment,\" and automatically modifying child support orders for noncustodial parents in prison unless the custodial parent objects. Some noncustodial parents argue that child support is crucial for low-income families and lowering support orders could lead to poverty. They believe parents should still be financially responsible for their children even in dire financial situations. Policymakers need to consider equity issues for unemployed noncustodial parents when reducing child support obligations. Some argue that unilaterally lowering payments for law-breaking individuals while not making similar allowances for unemployed law-abiding citizens sends the wrong message. Large child support arrearages lead to children receiving less support, reduced program effectiveness, and a perception of neglect for low-income noncustodial parents. Early intervention to prevent unpaid child support accumulation is crucial for the program's success, especially for children of former inmates. Some advocate for proactive measures to address arrearages and suggest legislative action by Congress. Some fathers' rights groups are pushing for legislation to repeal the federal provision that prohibits retroactive modification of child support obligations. It is suggested that Congress mandate child support arrearage remedies outlined in the CSE FY2005-2009 Strategic Plan. States are seeking creative ways to maximize resources during the economic crisis, and collaboration between state and federal prison officials and CSE officials could benefit inmate parents. Analysts propose incorporating information on CSE obligations and services into re-entry programs to strengthen them. CSE programs can enhance success by identifying parents with child support obligations in prison to prevent arrearages. Strategies include inquiring about parental status during prison intake, encouraging contact with CSE agencies, and informing inmates about child support rules. The CSE program aims to prevent child support arrearages by identifying parents in prison and providing support such as informing inmates about modifying child support orders, encouraging contact with their children, and helping former inmates develop payment plans. Additionally, prison intake procedures could include data matching between corrections and CSE agencies to facilitate the child support modification process. States can use CSE funds for case identification, tracking, referral, and payment plan development. The CSE program provides support for parents in prison to modify child support orders, develop payment plans, and participate in work activities to pay child support owed. Federal grants fund projects to promote self-sufficiency for families, including those with incarcerated parents. Noncustodial parents who owe child support to a child receiving TANF benefits can be required to participate in work activities or face jail time. The CSE program helps parents in prison modify child support orders and participate in work activities to pay child support. It also assists noncustodial parents in finding jobs. Some suggest that responsible fatherhood and ex-offender re-entry programs, along with the CSE program, could work together to help former inmates reconnect with their children and communities. Some observers argue that children should not be disadvantaged by living in states without innovative child support policies. They suggest that Congress may need to mandate state-established policies to ensure all children benefit from positive Child Support Enforcement (CSE) developments and prisoner re-entry strategies. Responsible fatherhood programs aim to promote financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial parents and increase father involvement in their children's lives. Responsible fatherhood programs aim to promote financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial parents and increase father involvement in their children's lives. Specific funding for these programs was provided in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, including competitive grants for states and organizations to implement parenting education and training. Fatherhood programs focus on parenting education, responsible decision-making, conflict resolution, coping with stress, mediation services, problem-solving skills, peer support, and job training. Grantees were awarded $41 million per year for five-year contracts to implement these programs. Responsible fatherhood programs aim to address tension between noncustodial parents and the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program by encouraging proactive interaction with CSE agencies. Responsible fatherhood programs in some states, including Indiana and New Jersey, involve inmates or former inmates as part of their target population. Healthy marriage demonstration programs also provide services for couples with children, where one parent is involved with the criminal justice system. These programs promote personal responsibility and encourage noncustodial parents to interact with Child Support Enforcement agencies. Successful prisoner re-entry programs can enhance the effectiveness of the Child Support Enforcement program, reduce recidivism, and create safer communities. Research shows that children raised in single-parent households are more likely to face financial challenges and have poorer socioeconomic outcomes compared to those raised by both biological parents. Imprisonment can strain family relationships, emphasizing the importance of supporting programs that aid in re-entry and promote parental responsibility. Supporting programs that help maintain positive family bonds despite incarceration can improve child well-being and reduce recidivism. Spending on corrections has increased rapidly in state budgets, with successful ex-offender re-entry programs leading to safer communities and better use of tax dollars. The federal government provides grant funding for re-entry programs through various departments, but only a few specify funds for this purpose. Re-entry programs vary in content and scope. Re-entry programs aim to help former inmates reintegrate into society through various phases: preparation in prison, immediate services post-release, and long-term support. Inmates often use their time in prison to reflect on family relationships and self-improvement. Bureau of Justice Statistics data from 2004 shows high percentages of parents in state prisons. According to Bureau of Justice Statistics data from 2004, a high percentage of parents in state and federal prisons maintain contact with their children through phone, mail, or visits. Additionally, some parents in prison attend parenting classes, which can help them reconnect with their families upon release. It has been suggested that prisons include information on responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage programs for soon-to-be-released individuals to aid in their re-entry into society. Ex-offenders face barriers to employment due to their criminal records, leading to difficulties in re-entering their communities. Research shows that employment and family support are crucial for successful re-entry. Strengthening positive connections with family and community is important, especially as employment opportunities are limited. Financial struggles post-release can increase the risk of re-incarceration. Policies supporting noncustodial parents with a history of incarceration, unemployment, or low-wage jobs can improve their prospects. Policies supporting noncustodial parents with a history of incarceration, unemployment, or low-wage jobs can improve their prospects for steady employment, child support payments, and reintegration into society. Collaboration between CSE agencies and corrections facilities is recommended to promote positive outcomes for ex-offenders with dependent children. The current economic situation may lead to an increase in the number of individuals released from prison, as seen in California's overcrowded prison system. The judges recommended reducing the overcrowded prison system by 40% within a two- to three-year timeframe. Despite the expectation of receiving child support after a noncustodial parent's release from prison, many struggle to make payments due to lack of income and employment opportunities post-release. Former inmates often rely on family members for basic needs. After being released from prison, many parents struggle with significant child support debt and face wage attachments of up to 65% of their earnings. This can lead to driver's license suspension and limit job options, pushing some to work in the underground economy. Many former inmates are tempted to work in the underground economy to avoid having their earnings garnished, which can hinder their ability to reconnect with their families and communities and increase the likelihood of reoffending. Evaluations of re-entry programs and healthy marriage/fatherhood programs for incarcerated or formerly incarcerated parents are ongoing to determine their effectiveness in reducing recidivism and saving state and federal funds. Evaluation findings will provide insights on the effectiveness of marriage and family-strengthening programs for populations involved with the criminal justice system. Extreme poverty can prevent noncustodial parents, especially former inmates, from benefiting from child support debt reduction programs due to their financial constraints. Policymakers need to prioritize the financial well-being of children when assisting low-income noncustodial parents with limited education and work experience. Some policymakers argue for fair child support enforcement for noncustodial parents of all income levels, while ensuring children are not neglected. In cases where support obligations cannot be met, in-kind assistance like child care may be considered. Connecting children with noncustodial parents is a federal goal, and coordination between federal and state programs can optimize resources. Research suggests that programs in prisons and local communities can help noncustodial parents fulfill their child support responsibilities through parenting programs, conflict-resolution classes, and job readiness preparation. Family support is crucial in reducing recidivism rates, and involvement in children's lives promotes responsible behavior. Coordinating federally-mandated programs may increase child support collections and decrease reoffending. Incurring high costs for inmates, their children, and families, incarceration has far-reaching impacts. Incarceration has high costs for inmates, their children, families, and society. State and federal funding is now being divided among various important programs, including the CSE program. Collaboration between state and federal agencies may increase to achieve common goals during the economic downturn."
