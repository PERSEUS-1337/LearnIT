    "content": "Federal agencies have been grappling with the challenge of balancing the release of public information with the need to protect privacy and security. The term \"sensitive but unclassified\" (SBU) has been used both before and after 9/11 to identify and safeguard nonclassified information that could aid terrorists. This report focuses on designing uniform policies and controls for SBU information, particularly in scientific and technical fields and public policy decision-making. The challenge for federal agencies is balancing public information release with security concerns. There are divergent perspectives on broadening controls to restrict public access to sensitive information to prevent terrorism. Adversaries may derive a significant amount of intelligence from open-source information, including details on critical infrastructure. Some argue that limiting public access to sensitive information is necessary to prevent terrorists from aggregating seemingly harmless data for malicious purposes. Some argue that limiting public access to sensitive information is inadequate and weakens efforts to protect the nation from terrorist attacks. Government policies shifting towards more controls may deny citizens necessary information for informed decision-making and accountability. New control policies may hinder scientific progress and technology development to counter threats. The report discusses the evolution of controls on scientific and technical information, including critiques of control policies and proposals for clarification. It highlights the issue of classifying information and the impact on scientific progress and technology development. The federal government has broad authority to classify scientific research to prevent publication if it compromises national security. Executive Orders 12958 and 13292 allow for classification, with the latter expanding classification authority to include information related to defense against transnational terrorism. In 2001 and 2002, heads of federal agencies were granted original classification authority, including the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, the EPA Administrator, and the Director of the White House OSTP. The Director of the White House OSTP oversees federally funded researchers who must report classified information. Prepublication reviews and control clauses are used to safeguard R&D data. Some information is classified under the Atomic Energy Act and the Information Security Act. Researchers are also subject to controls for nonclassified information. During the early 1940s, research on fission was withheld from publication due to concerns about aiding German atomic energy research. This led to foreign scientists, particularly Soviet scientists, speculating about American atomic bomb development. More recently, voluntary controls have been implemented in biological sciences to prevent research that could aid terrorists. The Department of Homeland Security's academic centers of excellence have developed guidelines to control the dissemination of sensitive information in various fields. Government-mandated controls, such as regulations from the Department of Energy, require written permission for investigators to check DOE computers accessed by individuals for up to three years. This regulation applies to all types of information, including classified and sensitive but unclassified data, and may be costly for some. The federal government mandates controls on contract research, including restrictions on publications and prohibitions on foreign nationals for receiving research awards. Export control regulations do not apply to fundamental research if it is published and shared broadly. Export control regulations and ITAR permit licensing for the export of scientific and technical information to specific foreign countries or citizens working in the US. Controversy arose in 2004-2005 over strict adherence to government interpretations regarding deemed exports of commercially available equipment used in research. The Department of Commerce (DOC) recommended using country of birth as the criterion for determining nationality for deemed export controls, requiring an export license for certain foreign researchers refurbishing commercially available equipment used in research. The Department of Defense (DOD) proposed rules in 2005 for badging, training, and segregated work areas for eligible researchers. Some university officials argued that expanded interpretations of deemed export licenses may be unnecessary. Some in the academic community have concerns about administering use controls in university laboratories, including ambiguity in identifying equipment subject to export controls, discrimination based on nationality, difficulty in controlling access, licensing delays hindering important discoveries, loss of research talent, and reduction in cutting-edge research. The National Academies presidents opposed such controls in a letter to DOC Secretary Carlos M. Guitierrez in 2005, recommending against them. In June 2005, recommendations were made regarding international students and postdoctoral fellows' access to controlled equipment. One policy group suggested requiring a deemed export license for transfers of technology to individuals with adverse information. A National Academies panel recommended providing foreign students and researchers with access comparable to U.S. citizens and removing technology items from deemed-export lists available for purchase overseas. The National Foreign Trade Council and other technology groups opposed rules regarding international students' access to controlled equipment. The Department of Commerce modified its procedure to base controls on a foreign national's most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency. The Department of Defense also modified its proposed rules in response to complaints. The Department of Defense (DOD) modified its proposed rules in August 2006, withdrawing prescriptive identification requirements but still requiring adherence to existing export control rules. More governmental scrutiny has been implemented for visas and the Technology Alert List (TAL) has been expanded. The State Department tracks foreign students and scholars to deter terrorism. The State Department tracks foreign students and scholars to deter terrorism, which critics argue has led to a decrease in foreign students studying science and technology in the United States. In 2004, the federal government proposed rules restricting collaboration with scientists from countries under trade embargoes, sparking opposition from scientific societies. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) allowed editing and peer review but still prohibited collaboration between U.S. scholars and researchers in sanctioned countries. The term \"Sensitive But Unclassified\" (SBU) has been used since the 1970s without a statutory definition. Federal agencies refer to the Computer Security Act of 1987 for the definition of sensitive information. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (CSA) aimed to protect sensitive unclassified information in federal computer systems. P.L. 100-235 defined \"sensitive\" information as data that could harm national interests or privacy if accessed without authorization. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (CSA) defined \"sensitive but unclassified\" information and required federal agencies to protect it. The act authorized the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), now NIST, to create security standards and develop security plans for systems containing sensitive information. NIST issued guidance in 1992 giving agencies authority to secure sensitive information. In 1992, NIST issued guidance allowing agencies to implement risk-based procedures to protect sensitive information. NIST emphasized that agencies are responsible for interpreting the definition of sensitive information and identified three security goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. NIST recommended using a risk-based approach to identify information to be protected and necessary controls based on the risk of loss. The type and amount of protection needed for information depends on its nature and processing environment. Controls used are based on the risk and harm from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 allows public access to certain information but exempts nine types from disclosure. The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 allows public access to certain information but exempts nine types from disclosure, including sensitive information like personnel files and law enforcement records. Some federal agencies categorize all For Official Use Only (FOUO) information as Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and may withhold it under FOIA. After the 9/11 attacks, the White House and DOJ expanded agencies' ability to withhold SBU information to prevent terrorist use. The \"Card memo\" required agencies to withhold sensitive information and use FOIA exemptions if legally justified. This modified the previous policy of releasing information unless harm was foreseeable. In 2003, DOJ issued guidance broadening exemptions from disclosure based on court decisions. The 2004 Freedom of Information Act Guide discussed new exemptions under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, emphasizing the protection of critical infrastructure information. Changes post-9/11 have increased the focus on safeguarding sensitive information to prevent risks to national security. The 2004 Freedom of Information Act Guide emphasized the need to safeguard sensitive information to prevent risks to national security, urging federal departments and agencies to consider the sensitivity of disclosed information. Labels like SBU and SHSI do not provide protection from disclosure, except for critical infrastructure information (CII) protected by statute. Agencies are encouraged to exempt highly sensitive nonclassified information from disclosure. The Homeland Security Act defines homeland security information as any information related to terrorist threats, prevention, or investigation. Federal officials should consider protecting sensitive information under Exemption 2 to prevent harm to critical systems and assets. The Homeland Security Act required agencies to develop information-sharing systems for terrorist-related information, including sharing with state and local levels. It also allowed for nondisclosure agreements for sharing sensitive but unclassified information. Executive Order 13311 transferred some responsibilities regarding safeguarding sensitive homeland security information. In Executive Order 13311, the President transferred some functions to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary for sharing sensitive homeland security information. DHS was developing guidance in 2004 to identify and protect sensitive but unclassified information. The procedures will define, mark, and identify sensitive information for sharing between federal, state, and local entities. The procedures for identifying and marking sensitive homeland security information (SHSI) aim to establish minimum standards for secure handling and sharing with appropriate entities. The guidance was still pending as of November 14, 2006, awaiting release for public comment after review by the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, a memorandum issued by the President on December 16, 2005, outlined guidelines and requirements to support information sharing among federal agencies. The memorandum issued to federal agencies required standardizing procedures for designating, marking, and handling SBU information to promote safeguarding and sharing. Agencies were tasked with inventorying procedures, assessing effectiveness, and reporting to the Director of National Intelligence within 90 days. The DNI, in coordination with department heads, is to submit recommendations for government-wide standards within a year. The Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment will support implementation by executive departments and agencies. The interagency group is working on standardizing SBU procedures, but federal agencies and state/local officials have not agreed on labels. A 36-page report recommended continuing efforts to settle on a new system, with the White House urging agencies to stop creating new labels. The proposal was deemed lacking substance, prompting a reevaluation by the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security. According to government officials, a report on SBU policy principles lacked specifics on implementation. Testimony on the issue was heard in May 2006, with plans for standardization by an interagency committee in 2007. The Computer Security Act of 1987 authorized NIST to develop standards for federal agencies to protect information on computer systems. The act defined sensitive information and agencies could obtain waivers. The act was modified by the Federal Information Security Act of 2002, which required standards to protect all information, not just sensitive information. The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 updated NIST's mission to develop risk-based standards for information security, removing specific requirements for inventorying sensitive information systems and eliminating waivers for not using NIST standards. The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 directed NIST, GAO, and DHS to develop risk-based standards for categorizing agency information based on security control objectives and risk levels. FISMA mandated minimum information security requirements for each category, to be issued as FIPS by the Director of OMB in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The act does not define \"sensitive\" or address the relationship with SBU or sensitive homeland security information. FISMA, part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, clarified management and reporting, strengthened NIST's role, and consolidated information security requirements. OMB is required to authorize and accredit each agency's nonsecurity information system. NIST continues to use the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in its standards development. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, through FISMA, strengthened NIST's role in information security by emphasizing the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Agencies can develop more stringent standards than NIST's, as long as they incorporate mandatory NIST requirements and align with risk management principles. NIST's risk analysis procedures and information systems controls, developed iteratively since 2002, align with OMB guidelines and FISMA requirements. The core NIST documentation standards include FIPS Publication 199 and FIPS Publication 200, with the latter being delayed until March 2006. Agencies use NIST's guidance to categorize federal information and determine security protection levels based on risk. The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199, issued in February 2004, provides a framework for agencies to identify and prioritize important information based on potential impact of loss. It establishes a continuum of \"criticality and sensitivity\" for information, with a focus on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The FIPS Publication 200 sets minimum security requirements for federal information systems, establishing due diligence for information security and a consistent approach for selecting security controls. NIST Special Publication 800-60 helps agencies map types of information and information systems. The NIST Special Publication 800-60, issued in June 2004, assists agencies in identifying information types and systems, assigning impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability based on security categorization guidelines in FIPS Publication 199. It provides explicit guidance on developing impact standards for different risk categories, including fields like public health, environmental management, energy, and research and development. The NIST Special Publication 800-60 helps agencies categorize information types and assign impact levels based on security guidelines. The highest security impact category for certain types of information is moderate, with examples including environmental remediation and health care services. Agencies can adjust security controls based on risk assessments and local conditions using NIST publication SP 800-30. NIST publication SP 800-30 outlines minimum security requirements for information and information systems, categorized into 17 security control clusters with 154 unique controls. These controls cover areas such as access control, audit, incident response, and physical protection. OMB's guidance for information security protection advises agencies to focus on assessing and managing risks rather than conducting formal risk analyses. This approach is seen as more effective in improving security for systems. The need for adequate security requires a risk-based approach, considering factors like system value, threats, vulnerabilities, and safeguards effectiveness. NIST provides guidance on risk assessment, but there is limited information on how agencies categorize information based on NIST standards. Experts recommend using risk-based processes to identify, categorize, and control sensitive information. The use of risk analysis is important in discussions related to developing criteria for a code of conduct for researchers and handling sensitive scientific information. Jacques S. Gansler and William Lucyshyn proposed criteria development and an executive order for identifying controlled information. The proposal suggests developing criteria and issuing an executive order to identify \"controlled unclassified security information (CUSI)\" that could endanger public safety if improperly released. The objective is to discourage research, experimentation, and publication of CUSI, similar to restrictions on certain experimental techniques. A risk-based process called \"Work-Factor\" would assess the risk of release based on the resources needed to use the information for harmful purposes. The report recommended implementing a policy for sharing sensitive information, known as CUSI, to prevent the release of potentially harmful information. This policy would enable sharing between government agencies and the private sector while considering the resources needed to exploit vulnerabilities. The report recommended implementing a policy for sharing sensitive information, known as CUSI, to prevent the release of potentially harmful information. It suggested that DHS should develop educational programs and government controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information. Federally-funded researchers should disclose security concerns in grant proposals, and professional peer reviews should be conducted before publication of work with safeguarding criteria. DHS monitored review panels will assess security implications of potentially impactful work. DHS should lead the effort to develop model review policies for potentially impactful work, encouraging researchers to submit their work to a government-monitored or independent review panel. Publishers should be trained to conduct reviews before research is released, with a two-tiered publication scheme to restrict detailed content. Brian J. Gorman proposed a risk-based approach called \"Due Process Vetting System\" (DPVS) for prepublication peer review. The curr_chunk discusses a proposed classification system for sensitive life science research to align with national security interests. Researchers are suggested to self-evaluate the sensitivity of their work and impose constraints if necessary. Information should be shared among those with a \"need to know.\" This proposal is part of a report by the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security. The Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security proposed a risk management approach to classification to balance national security needs with civil liberties requirements. Specific laws and policies protect sensitive unclassified science- and technology-related information in various fields. The need to protect critical infrastructure information is based on the premise that potential terrorists should not have access to information that might expose vulnerabilities in the nation's core physical systems. Charlie Reeder from DOD highlighted vulnerabilities in government websites that include maps of installations and specifications of weapons and communication systems. The importance of protecting critical infrastructure information is emphasized to prevent terrorists from exploiting vulnerabilities. Open-source information, easily accessible through various sources like the internet, poses a significant risk. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld highlighted that public sources can provide up to 80% of enemy information. The availability of sensitive information on corporate websites has been overlooked by IT and security managers, posing a security threat. The Citigroup headquarters building in Manhattan is a site named in a recent terror advisory by the Department of Homeland Security. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 prohibits disclosure of critical infrastructure information related to security, with penalties for employees who disclose such information. The act also preempts state freedom of information laws regarding public disclosure of this information shared with state or local government officials during DHS activities. The DOD and DHS implemented rules to protect critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to them. President Bush issued HSPD-7 directing federal agencies to safeguard this information. DHS established the PCII Program to protect critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. The rules for handling Protected Critical Infrastructure Information were amended and issued in a final regulation on September 1, 2006. These procedures govern the receipt, validation, handling, storage, marking, and use of critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the Department of Homeland Security. CII information submitted to DHS is not subject to disclosure under FOIA. The term \"sensitive security information\" (SSI) is used by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has regulations to protect and distribute sensitive civil aviation security information obtained during security investigations. The FAA implemented regulations to protect Sensitive Security Information (SSI) related to transportation safety. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the TSA and prohibited disclosure of certain information detrimental to passenger safety. P.L. 107-296 expanded coverage to include information detrimental to transportation security. The FAA regulations protected Sensitive Security Information (SSI) related to transportation safety, which was later expanded to include all transportation-related activities. The DOT and DHS jointly promulgated revised regulations defining SSI information, including security programs, directives, and circulars related to aviation and maritime transportation. The DHS and DOT issued regulations protecting sensitive information related to aviation and maritime transportation security, including performance specifications, vulnerability assessments, threat information, security measures, screening information, training materials, and critical infrastructure asset information. This information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. The curr_chunk discusses the withholding of transportation-related information under exemption 3, which has use limitations and imposes penalties for disclosure. Critics argue that too much information is being kept from the public, potentially hindering safety and oversight. TSA's use of SSI is criticized for stifling debate and criticism. The TSA has been criticized for denying access to information that could improve safety conditions, such as denying pilots access to information to comply with regulations and denying the District of Columbia government access to information about trains carrying chlorine. Critics argue that the unrestricted use of the SSI designation by TSA stifles debate and criticism. The TSA's unrestricted use of the SSI designation is criticized for hindering citizen and media oversight of seaports, airports, and transit systems. This could lead to withholding information from civic activists and organizations, limiting public access to critical oversight information. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded its ability to withhold critical oversight information (COI), which includes budget details, personnel qualifications, and environmental impact information, in order to protect internal agency decision-making and prevent terrorists from using the information to harm critical infrastructures. Various courts have ruled on the interpretation of regulations regarding COI. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expanded its ability to withhold certain environmental impact information under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) through new categorical exclusions. These exclusions cover projects affecting national security, those requiring environmental assessments, and those with potential environmental impacts that need detailed statements. EPA allows categorical exclusions for actions that do not have significant environmental effects. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded its ability to withhold environmental impact information under NEPA through new categorical exclusions. These exclusions cover projects affecting national security and exempt DHS agencies from releasing certain information under FOIA. Some argue this could exclude environmental impact statements required by NEPA from public view. DHS announced new rules allowing them to withhold sensitive environmental impact information under NEPA, categorizing some reviews as exempt from public disclosure. The public comment period was extended, and a final rule was published in 2006. EPA responded by forming a group to review the release of environmental information. The DHS released environmental review information and may waive environmental protection laws for border security. Critics argue that these policies conflict with environmental laws and limit access to critical infrastructure information, hindering community safety. Several environmental groups criticize controls on environmental information, stating that too much is being withheld by EPA and DHS under the DHS environmental directive. The Natural Resources Defense Council argues that communities should have the opportunity to evaluate environmentally related decisions made by agencies subsumed by DHS. Some agencies restrict access to environmental impact statements, labeling them as SBU and only releasing them to those with a \"need to know.\" Other agencies post environmental impact materials online with redacted details, while some publish documents with SBU information in a separate appendix for controlled access. The American Library Association proposed that DHS should limit its non-disclosure provision to information qualifying for withholding under FOIA exemptions, arguing that withholding \"meaningless\" information not subject to exemption should be deleted. The American Library Association suggested that DHS should only withhold information that qualifies for FOIA exemptions, arguing that non-exempt \"meaningless\" information should be deleted. OMB Watch also raised concerns about DHS's lack of procedures for determining which environmental analysis to remove if exempt, highlighting the challenge of balancing access to information with protection. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission faced criticism for removing certain security information from public access, sparking debate over transparency and information security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission faced criticism for restricting access to sensitive documents in its online library, leading to concerns about transparency and information security. Representative Edward J. Markey requested an investigation into the agency's information release policies, citing worries about withholding releasable documents from public access. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission faced criticism for withholding public information and restricting access to sensitive documents. In response, the agency proposed to broaden restrictions on disseminating sensitive information, including emergency evacuation plans and safety analyses related to nuclear materials. Despite concerns about transparency, the NRC announced the restoration of viewing access to over 70,000 documents after reviewing them for security information. The agency implemented the Sensitive Information Screening Project to withhold potentially useful information from terrorists, following FOIA principles. The National Academies released a report criticizing security restrictions on sharing information, recommending improved interaction with industry and the public for increased confidence in the NRC. The National Academies report highlighted the potential security threats posed by certain biological information and data, leading to federal controls. This includes biotechnology agents and genetic advances that could be used for biowarfare, as well as dual-use biological agents and research developments with malevolent potential. The National Academies report emphasized the security threats posed by biotechnology agents and genetic advances that could be used for biowarfare. It also highlighted dual-use biological agents and research developments with malevolent potential, such as the ability to manipulate behavior and activate molecules in the body through advances in neurobiology and gene expression technologies. Additionally, synthetic biology and nanotechnology advancements may offer similar risks. Advances in synthetic biology and nanotechnology present dual-use opportunities, with potential for misuse in developing bioweapons targeting specific groups. Proposals for controlling access to biological sciences information have been suggested to address security concerns. The federal government has already regulated the registration of laboratories handling select agents to mitigate risks. The registration of laboratories handling select agents, organisms and toxins with bioterrorist potential, began in 1996. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates coordination between DHHS and USDA to regulate these agents. The USA PATRIOT Act prohibits access to select agents by certain individuals. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates regulations for select agents, organisms, and toxins with bioterrorist potential. The \"Fink\" report in 2004 called for greater self-regulation by scientists and NIH review of certain research reports before publication. It also recommended the use of screening criteria in prepublication reviews and the creation of a federal advisory board. The Fink report recommended greater self-regulation by scientists and NIH review of research reports before publication. It proposed the creation of a National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) in 2004, funded in 2005, to advise federal departments on oversight of dual-use research involving biological agents. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) advises federal departments on oversight of dual-use nonclassified biological research. Its charter includes developing national policies, a code of conduct for researchers, training programs, and fostering international collaboration. NIH uses NSABB guidance to develop policies for performer institutions it funds, including the use of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBC) and reviewing specific experiments for potential threats to public health or national security. Policy guidance flows from the federal board to institutional committees in cases of uncertainty or disagreement. The NSABB met multiple times in 2005 and 2006 to develop criteria for dual-use research, a life sciences code of conduct, and guidance on chemical synthesis of genomes. Some suggested licensing biologists for sensitive research and enforcing compliance among research institutions to prevent policy makers from imposing stricter controls. During 2005 and 2006, the NSABB developed guidelines for dual-use research and synthetic biology. Recommendations included conducting risk-benefit analysis for potentially dangerous gene sequences and regulating synthetic DNA orders against select agents. The NSABB developed guidelines for dual-use research and synthetic biology, including risk-benefit analysis for dangerous gene sequences and regulating synthetic DNA orders against select agents. Topics for future meetings include oversight plans and objections to prepublication review guidelines. Critics suggest stronger biosecurity measures, such as a network with intelligence and military agencies to prevent misuse of biological information. The NSABB recommended creating an independent advisory group in the security community to enhance scientific expertise, promoting a global culture of awareness among life scientists, and establishing a network of informed scientists to identify and report potentially harmful use of knowledge or technology. Other policy shortcomings were also noted. The DHHS's NSABB board has been criticized for its limited scope, not covering privately funded research or international standards. Critics also point out flaws in the select agent rules and call for expanded federal regulations to prevent unauthorized possession of DNA components. George Church is organizing a consortium to push for federal licensing of DNA segment purchasers for bioterror agents. John Steinbruner and CISSM recommend mandatory licensure for biodefense researchers and institutions, with three levels of independent review to monitor risks. Independent review at institutional, national, and international levels would monitor risks and benefits of research proposals, issuing approval or disapproval for researchers and publications. Nongovernmental professional groups have explored codes of conduct and self-policing policies for research topics. Some publishers have adopted risk-based publishing principles, but changes are minimal. Various organizations have drafted codes of ethics and urged scientists to prevent misuse of their work. Two researchers proposed an international code of ethics to prevent bioterrorism, urging scientists to refuse work that could be used maliciously and restrict access to sensitive information. Recommendations include instilling a culture that discourages harmful research, conducting peer reviews before publication, and defining policy controls for these activities. J. Gaudioso and R. M. Salerno proposed a biosecurity risk assessment process with four levels: low, moderate, high, and extreme risk. Most pathogens and toxins are low-risk, while select agents are moderate-risk. Security measures for low and moderate risk categories should be cost-effective and rely on existing biosafety measures. High-risk agents require stringent security measures and a dedicated Biosecurity officer. Biosecurity levels should be developed by experts in biological weapons, microbiology, security, and public health. Brian J. Gorman proposed a risk-based approach for prepublication peer review called \"Due Process Vetting System\" (DPVS) with a Risk Assessment Scale (RAS) and a Least Restrictive Classification System. The Due Process Vetting System (DPVS) proposed by Brian J. Gorman includes a Risk Assessment Scale (RAS) and a Least Restrictive Classification System for sensitive life science research. The process would be overseen by the Biologic Regulatory Commission and triggered by a predetermined score on the RAS. The DPVS aims to safeguard high-risk articles by identifying potentially dangerous content before publication without resorting to censorship. Gorman proposed a Due Process Vetting System (DPVS) to safeguard high-risk articles by vetting them before publication, involving a qualified body of world scientists. Some scientists disagree with the restrictions, as existing controls on select agents have led to researchers discontinuing or avoiding research on regulated biological agents. Only 323 facilities are registered with the CDC, despite an expected 817 entities to register under the new select agent rule. Complaints have been raised about the U.S. \"select agent\" rules hindering cooperation from foreign scientists due to security control costs and standards. This could lead to foreign partners being limited to being \"mere sample exporters\" and potential criminal sanctions for U.S. partners in collaborations. Concerns about the CDC's information security manual have also impacted influenza researchers' access to virus sequence databases, potentially hindering flu vaccine development and public health. The National Academies report in 2004 concluded that unrestricted access to genome data on microbial pathogens is crucial for developing effective defenses against dangerous pathogens, including bioterrorism and infectious diseases. Some members at the NSABB meeting suggested that ethics education for researchers could address potential problems instead of formal restrictions, while others warned that controls on biological research information could impede the exchange of necessary information for vaccine development. The report emphasized the importance of open access to genomic information on pathogens for defense against bioterrorism and infectious diseases. It argued that restricting distribution of such data could hinder research efforts. In a separate incident, the DHHS tried to block the publication of an article on botulism in the milk supply, but the National Academy of Sciences published it, highlighting the need for information sharing in preventing bioterrorism. The Academy published a paper on biodefense guidance despite potential threats, emphasizing the benefits of sharing information. International groups like the UK's Royal Society and the Wellcome Trust urged caution on government intervention, suggesting scientific societies take more responsibility. Life scientists from various countries discussed developing a code of conduct in Geneva in 2005, while biosafety in life sciences research was a topic at an OECD meeting. At an OECD International \"futures\" program meeting in September 2004 and a National Academies International Forum on Biosecurity in Como in March 2005, discussions were held on codes of conduct and oversight of biosecurity research. Controversy surrounds access to geospatial information, including satellite imagery and maps. RAND Corporation recommended in March 2004 that the federal government should not restrict public access to geospatial information due to outdated data and the availability of information from other sources. The federal government was advised not to restrict public access to geospatial information in March 2004 by RAND Corporation. In June 2005, the Homeland Security Group of the Federal Geographic Data Committee issued guidelines for organizations to assess the sensitivity of geospatial information for homeland security purposes. The guidelines aim to balance security risks with the benefits of data dissemination. The group recommended safeguarding sensitive data before public release by either modifying the information or restricting access. Congressional action in 2004 tightened controls on geospatial information, allowing for withholding of certain land remote sensing information. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 prohibits the public disclosure of certain land remote sensing information for national security reasons. The DOD's National Geospatial Intelligence Agency announced the removal of certain publications from public sale for security and intellectual property rights concerns. The agency removed aeronautical safety navigation publications from public sale due to intellectual property rights concerns. Legislation introduced during the 109th Congress aimed to expand the use of federal remote sensing data for various projects. The DHS issued an internal management directive on safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information in May 2004. The directive labeled information as For Official Use Only (FOUO) to protect sensitive unclassified data. This generated opposition due to its mandatory nondisclosure requirements. In January 2005, the controversial mandatory and punitive employee and contractor nondisclosure requirements were replaced with security education practices under directive MD 11042.1. Contractors still sign nondisclosure agreements, and violations can result in administrative or disciplinary action. The directive identifies various control labels for sensitive unclassified information, including FOUO, CII, and SSI. One type of sensitive unclassified information is developing or current technology that could hinder DHS objectives if released. The DHS directive specifies that sensitive unclassified information, including developing or current technology, must be protected to prevent hindering DHS objectives. Access to this information is restricted to cleared homeland security personnel on a need-to-know basis. The DHS directive emphasizes the protection of sensitive unclassified information, including technology, to support DHS objectives. Information marked as FOUO may still be subject to disclosure under FOIA upon request, requiring case-by-case review. Procedures for safeguarding and sharing such information outside of DHS are outlined, including secure storage and encrypted communications. Balancing security and access presents a challenge for policymakers, as highlighted in a joint report from the Heritage Foundation and Center for Strategic and International Studies. The report from the Heritage Foundation and Center for Strategic and International Studies emphasizes the need to balance sharing information with the public for homeland security. Critics argue that government controls on sensitive information may be unwarranted, with examples of information being removed from public access for security reasons highlighted by various advocacy groups. Some criticisms have been made regarding information control policies in scientific and technical fields, focusing on how controls can hinder research and innovation, inconsistencies in disclosure requirements, and the relationship between sensitive but unclassified information and the Freedom of Information Act. The curr_chunk discusses the need for standard definitions of SBU information, monitoring agency use of risk-based standards, and recommendations for better governance. It also mentions concerns about how sensitive information controls can hinder innovation and cites an example of a natural gas pipeline location being removed due to security concerns. The regulations require natural gas pipelines to be clearly marked for safety, but a company removed a sign citing local laws. This action increases the risk of accidents. Critics argue that strict information controls hinder scientific research and innovation, potentially compromising efforts to combat terrorism. The three presidents of the National Academies issued a statement in 2002 balancing security and openness in disseminating scientific information. They emphasized the importance of not restricting nonclassified research reporting to accelerate technical knowledge and understand potential threats. The statement in 2002 emphasized the importance of not restricting nonclassified research reporting to accelerate technical knowledge and understand potential threats. It recommended eliminating vague categories like \"sensitive but unclassified\" to prevent stifling scientific creativity and weakening national security. The ACLU and American Association of University Professors also called for the elimination of barriers to public access to information and the resistance against regulating or making secret research results. The National Academies and the Center for Strategic and International Studies collaborated on a workshop in 2003 to address concerns about regulating research results under the \"sensitive but unclassified\" label. They established a Roundtable on Scientific Communication and National Security to develop a publications policy. Additionally, the National Academies have a Committee on Scientific Communication and National Security (CSCANS) to inform the policy debate on the relationship between science and national security. The Academy established a Committee on a \"New University-Government Partnership for Science and Security,\" focusing on federal contracts, dissemination of scientific information, sensitive but unclassified information, and management of biological agents in academic research. A legal author raised concerns about including SBU information clauses in contracts, citing potential government censorship and prior restraint on private speech. The inclusion of SBU secrecy controls in university contracts may lead to government censorship and prior restraint on private speech, posing a threat to the university's role in promoting innovation and expression. The government's legitimate right to protect SBU information in contracts must be balanced with the university's special role in expanding and disseminating knowledge. The constitutional right to protect SBU information in contracts must consider national security reasons, use uniform definitions for security levels, have review procedures, and employ the least restrictive method. Controls on unclassified information could impact government-private sector relations and procurement. Foreign vendors may struggle to comply with information security standards in contracts. The Defense Security Services require U.S. citizen employees for data processing involving SBU information. Background checks are necessary for potential vendors. DHS and DOT procurement rules mandate background checks for prime or subcontractors handling sensitive information. Scientists agreeing to pre-research reviews may hinder universities' research involving foreigners. The Council on Governmental Relations warns that restrictions on publishing DHS-funded research could jeopardize universities' privileges, such as involving foreign nationals without a government license. Some agencies have vague nondisclosure agreements and penalties, potentially weakening federal employee rights and whistleblower protections. Some agencies have policies for nondisclosure agreements and penalties related to sharing sensitive information. Penalties include imprisonment, fines, and dismissal for inappropriate sharing of Critical Infrastructure Information (CII). Various departments like DHS, DHHS, CDC, USDA, and the Department of the Treasury have provisions for handling sensitive information and require nondisclosure agreements for certain information. Certain bidders must sign nondisclosure agreements for SBU information, with penalties for unauthorized release. Users of federal SBU information exchange systems need clearances and must adhere to nondisclosure provisions. The General Services Administration ensures bidding documents are only available to authorized firms who have completed necessary forms. Penalties for disclosing SBU information are severe. Penalties for disclosing SBU information can be more severe than for disclosing classified information. Unauthorized disclosure of Critical Infrastructure Information can lead to criminal sanctions under the Homeland Security Act. The revised DHS employee nondisclosure policy has been criticized for still being problematic. Legislation introduced during the 109th Congress, S. 494, known as \"The Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act,\" aims to protect federal employees who lawfully disclose evidence of waste, abuse, or mismanagement, including classified information to authorized individuals. It also allows the Merit Systems Protection Board to review retaliation charges for whistleblowing, requires agency nondisclosure forms to preserve employees' right to disclose certain information, and amends the Homeland Security Act to permit the disclosure of independently obtained critical infrastructure information. The House version of the \"Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act,\" H.R. 1317, aims to protect federal employees who disclose evidence of waste, abuse, or mismanagement. It allows disclosure of critical infrastructure information for specified whistleblower purposes, with exemptions for certain agencies. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and Homeland Security Information Guidance and Training Act of 2005 aim to establish best practices for sharing sensitive nonfederal homeland security information among emergency management personnel. Controversy exists over whether SBU information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, with differing interpretations and ongoing policy debates. The CSA and DOJ's FOIA guidelines specify that SBU and SHSI information should not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA, except for certain protected categories like CII and SSI. There is ongoing debate over whether 'sensitive but unclassified' homeland security information can be disclosed. The ambiguity surrounding the protection of 'sensitive but unclassified' homeland security information under the FOIA is highlighted. The DOJ guidelines suggest that such information should not be exempt from disclosure, but there are broad court interpretations that may allow withholding. The Card memo instructs agencies to use FOIA to protect sensitive information if it could harm homeland security. The DOJ guidelines emphasize agencies should withhold sensitive information under FOIA to protect against terrorist threats. Federal agencies have varying policies on releasing information, such as the NRC's proposed rules for Safeguards Information and CDC's SBU information exemption from disclosure under FOIA. The DHS management directive 11042.1 on SBU requires review of requests for documents marked SBU to determine FOIA exemption eligibility. Information labeled SBU should be labeled FOUO and released on a case-by-case basis to authorized personnel only. Some parts of DOD automatically exempt SBU information from FOIA. Sensitive unclassified information, also known as SBU, requires protection but is not classified as national security information. Different agencies have varying designations for SBU, such as FOUO or OUO, and may exempt it from disclosure under FOIA. DOE and FERC have specific guidelines for handling SBU information. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a policy of sharing sensitive unclassified information (SBU) under a category called CEII, which is exempt from disclosure under FOIA but available to those with a \"need to know.\" Critics argue that FERC's policy is not based on a court-accepted interpretation of FOIA, but on the Justice Department's exemptions. FERC required parties to sign a nondisclosure agreement to access this information, leading to controversy with Connecticut's State Attorney General in 2006. The dispute between Connecticut's State Attorney General and FERC arose over access to information about a proposed LNG plant. FERC claims the information is CEII and not releasable under FOIA, while the USDA says some SBU information is releasable but must be protected under FOIA exemptions. Thomas S. Blanton, Director of the George Washington University National Security Archive, testified that the use of the term SBU hinders the intent of FOIA, leading government officials to withhold information. The new secrecy stamps and labels signal to bureaucrats to find reasons to withhold information, despite claims that they are just guidance for safeguarding information. The TSA released a document labeled \"Sensitive But Unclassified\" with the full text completely blacked out, including a section briefing Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge on an upcoming meeting with the Pakistani Foreign Minister. Despite no identified national security harm, officials used the SBU designation and \"deliberative process\" exemption to withhold information. The American Bar Association urged the Attorney General to clarify FOIA officials on the designation of sensitive records. The designation of agency records as 'sensitive but unclassified' cannot be used to withhold documents from release. Legislative action has been taken to clarify the relationship of some SBU information to FOIA, such as tightening controls on geospatial information and expanding the use of remote sensing. The legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by limiting exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act for critical infrastructure information. It sought to prevent all industry-submitted critical infrastructure information from being broadly categorized as exempt from FOIA, allow sharing of records between government agencies, protect whistleblowers, and not restrict congressional use or disclosure of information. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security held a hearing on March 15, 2005 regarding oversight of FOIA and federal information classification. Senator John Cornyn addressed concerns about FOIA oversight and over-classification. The bill \"Openness in Government and Freedom of Information: Examining the Open Government Act of 2005\" was favorably reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, 2006. The \"Faster FOIA Act of 2005\" aimed to strengthen FOIA by creating an advisory commission to reduce delays in responding to requests. It was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 17, 2005, but no further action was taken in the House or Senate. During the 109th Congress, S. 1181 aimed to require any new FOIA exemptions to be explicitly stated in the bill, emphasizing that documents should be public unless Congress creates an exception. It would have restricted FOIA from applying to matters exempted by statutes enacted after July 1, 2005, that leave no discretion on withholding information or establish specific criteria for withholding. The Senate approved the bill \"Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005\" on June 24, 2005. The bill aimed to strengthen the biodefenses of the United States and establish a new agency exempt from FOIA. There has been opposition to the blanket exemption as no other federal agency has such universal exemption from FOIA. The revised bill, S. 2564, introduced on April 6, 2006, aimed to modify the FOIA to allow the release of information unless the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that disclosure of scientific or technical data related to countermeasures R&D could reveal vulnerabilities in existing medical or public health defenses against various threats. The House companion bill, H.R. 5533, which included this provision, passed the House on September 26, 2006. Questions remain about the definition of \"vulnerabilities.\" Federal agencies use the category SBU to share sensitive information, especially related to homeland security. Some agencies are developing policies and systems to control and transmit sensitive but unclassified information related to homeland security. They are also creating encrypted federal information systems for approved individuals, including first responders who must sign nondisclosure statements. Visualization analysis and automated processes are being used to identify and manage sensitive information. The National Laboratory, in cooperation with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, has developed an automated system called Mozart to identify sensitive information on websites using advanced algorithms. The Department of Energy also contracted with a research group at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to install the \"Homeland Security Classifier\" on 3,000 computers to sort electronic text documents for sensitive nonclassified information. Federal agencies use various labels to categorize sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information, such as FOUO, SSI, SHSI, CEII, OUO, LOU, and more. Different agencies have different methods to restrict public access to this information, with some using risk-based categorization while others rely on content or threat-based definitions. The Department of Homeland Security is an example of an agency that manages SBU information based on the level of risk associated with unauthorized access. The Department of Homeland Security manages sensitive but unclassified information based on risk levels, with no specific criteria for designation.OMB still refers to the concept of \"sensitive\" as defined in the Computer Security Act in its guidance for information security. The OMB circular dated November 28, 2000 incorporates requirements of the Computer Security Act of 1987 but does not mention the FISMA Act. It acknowledges the need for agencies to use broader NIST risk-based procedures for information security. The circular continues to refer to the CSA's concept of sensitive information, which is outdated with the passage of FISMA. The OMB provided specific guidance to agency Chief Information Officers to use FISMA processes for securing sensitive information in federal computer systems. It emphasized the need for determining the sensitivity of information and referenced NIST publications for system security planning. The guidance also highlighted the requirement for assessing risks and potential harm from unauthorized access to information systems. The Department of the Army and DOD, along with other federal agencies, base their concepts of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information on the CSA definition of \"sensitive\" information. Different agencies use varying approaches such as FISMA-based risk processes or their own definitions. Critics have raised concerns about the proliferation of SBU concepts leading to differences in implementation policies, making it challenging for stakeholders to understand and protect sensitive information. Representative Henry A. Waxman criticized the misuse of the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) designation by the DHS to withhold information from the public. He raised concerns about the increasing proliferation of \"pseudoclassification\" categories like SBU, stating that not all documents marked SBU pose legitimate threats to national security if released. Mr. Waxman criticized the misuse of the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) designation by the DHS to withhold information from the public. He raised concerns about the creation of new categories of 'sensitive but unclassified' information without a statutory basis, leading to more harm than good. Dr. Ron Ross noted the lack of consistency in defining \"sensitive unclassified information\" across the federal government. The federal government lacks a common understanding of sensitive unclassified information, leading to inconsistent protection and sharing of information. William J. Leonard criticized the lack of clarity in identifying and protecting sensitive information, emphasizing the need for a reasonable policy. William J. Leonard criticized the misuse of 'sensitive but unclassified' labels by officials lacking proper training, leading to confusion and a culture of withholding information in government agencies. He highlighted the need for a clear policy to promote information sharing and avoid uncertainty. William J. Leonard emphasized the importance of information sharing without a central authority making decisions on who should receive information. He called for consistent standards and a simplified framework for controlling and protecting unclassified information. A framework for controlling and protecting unclassified information was proposed, emphasizing specificity, limits on designating information, due-diligence standards, fixed time duration for control, and an appeal process. The ABA House of Delegates adopted a resolution in 2006 calling for standard policies for handling such information, recognizing the need for standardization in homeland security-related information. Congress mandated Presidential guidance on defining sensitive, unclassified information. The enactment of section 892 of P.L. 107-296 mandated Presidential guidance to define procedures for protecting sensitive but unclassified homeland security information. Guidelines have not been issued yet. Congress and federal agencies are working on generating uniform standards for designating, marking, and handling such information. The GAO assessed DHS's use of sensitive security information during the 108th Congress. The DHS's handling of sensitive security information (SSI) was scrutinized by Congress, focusing on categorization, removal of SSI label, review procedures, and organizational functions. Concerns were raised about the labeling of already public information as SSI and the lack of internal control procedures at TSA for SSI designation. The final report highlighted the need for clear policies and oversight in designating SSI. In 2005, Congress enacted legislation to clarify SSI policy and procedures, requiring the DHS Secretary to designate documents as SSI and provide clear guidance on what is SSI material. This was in response to concerns about insufficient management controls leading to unnecessary withholding of information from public scrutiny. In response to concerns about insufficient management controls, Congress enacted legislation in 2005 requiring the DHS Secretary to designate documents as SSI and provide clear guidance. The Secretary was also required to report on department-wide policies, auditing procedures, and the number of SSI coordinators and staff authorized to designate SSI documents. Additionally, the Secretary had to report the titles of all documents designated as SSI between October 1, 2005, and December 31, 2005, and provide examples of DHS guidance on SSI. The DHS Secretary was required to provide examples of DHS guidance on SSI markings and report on department-wide policies. The FY2007 DHS appropriations law limits excessive use of SSI labeling, requiring review of information labeled as SSI if requested for release. The DHS Secretary must provide examples of SSI markings and report on department-wide policies. The FY2007 DHS appropriations law limits excessive use of SSI labeling, requiring review of information labeled as SSI if requested for release. SSI categories will be released unless the DHS Secretary provides a reason not to. Access to SSI information is permitted for civil court proceedings. GAO released a report on sharing terrorism-related and sensitive but unclassified information in response to a request from various committee chairs. The GAO reviewed how federal agencies handle sensitive but unclassified information, finding that agencies use 56 different designations to protect critical information. There are no governmentwide policies on assigning these designations, leading to inconsistency across agencies. The GAO found that agencies face challenges in sharing sensitive information and lack policies for determining who can designate information as sensitive but unclassified. This lack of internal controls increases the risk of misapplication of designations, potentially leading to either unnecessary restrictions or inadvertent releases of sensitive materials. GAO recommended that the Director of National Intelligence assess progress and propose changes, while OMB should work with agencies on policies, procedures, and controls. The National Security Archive released a survey showing agencies' information labeling practices. GAO made recommendations for agencies to improve oversight and training on designating sensitive information. These findings were discussed at a hearing. At a hearing held in 2006, it was discussed that executive agencies lack standardized procedures for labeling sensitive information. The program manager for the Information Sharing Environment is working on establishing policies to share terrorist-related information and handle sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. Actions have been taken in response to a memo from the President regarding information sharing and development of standards for SBU. H.R. 2331, the \"Restore Open Government Act of 2005,\" aimed to end the use of SBU and FOUO terms without clear definitions. It sought to revoke previous memos, promote disclosure under FOIA, improve access to critical infrastructure information, address over-classification, and make it easier to challenge agencies withholding information. The Executive Branch Reform Act of 2006, H.R. 5112, introduced a bipartisan bill to improve access to information by banning \"pseudo\" classification designations not defined by federal statute or executive order. It directed agencies to report to the Archivist of the United States and specified congressional committees on their use of such designations. Some agencies have been slow to implement FISMA procedures to protect information, including sensitive information, based on risk of release. The delay may be due to confusion over the CSA definition of \"sensitive information\" becoming obsolete, despite still being referenced by major agencies like OMB and DHS. The E-Government Act extends to all types of information, not just what agencies categorize as SBU or sensitive information. Slow compliance with FISMA guidance may also be attributed to the time it took for NIST to release volumes in its FIPS series and for agencies to adjust procedures to adopt risk-based information control. Many agencies have been slow to incorporate a risk management program into their information security policies due to difficulties in implementing NIST's risk-based control procedures. Some are hesitant to adopt these standards as they fear they may be too lenient and lead to the release of sensitive information. Compliance with legislative mandates, such as the E-Government Act, is also hindered by the perceived high costs associated with implementation. Some agencies are hesitant to adopt NIST risk-based standards due to concerns about releasing sensitive information or the perceived high costs of compliance. Despite not being required by OMB, agencies may be reluctant to conduct risk analyses under FISMA, fearing it may be expensive or lead to over-categorization of information. The oversight issues related to federal agency compliance with FISMA and NIST-generated standards, as well as confusion regarding agency information security responsibilities, may require monitoring and potential updates to administrative procedures. Recommendations for improving SBU controls may be addressed by the executive branch. The executive branch may address recommendations for improving SBU controls, as many government officials can designate documents SBU, which has broader implications than national security classification policies. The Department of Homeland Security allows employees and contractors to designate information as For Official Use Only (FOUO) within broad categories, with managers having the authority to designate additional information. There is oversight through the Information Security Oversight Office, but no oversight for the new FOUO policy. One suggestion is to limit the number of individuals who can designate information as SBU to formalize the process similar to national security classification procedures. The President's December 16, 2005 memo centralized the development of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) policies with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), potentially leading to more restrictive information control policies. There have been proposals to establish a central authority in other federal agencies to develop SBU information guidelines. The report by the Heritage Foundation and the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested centralizing information control policies to inventory sensitive information. Currently, there is no systematic review of government information that could be used by terrorists, and no designated authority for evaluating this at a national level. The Department of Homeland Security lacks leadership in developing voluntary standards for private sector information disclosure. There is no designated authority at the national level for determining information distribution policies, including common standards for weighing benefits and risks. Steven Aftergood, editor of Secrecy News, has also raised concerns about the lack of oversight in agencies' public disclosure policies. The 2004 Federation of American Scientists' report suggested that oversight of SBU information designations and policy could benefit from coverage in ISOO or ISCAP. It recommended expanding ISOO's portfolio to include sensitive but unclassified information, which would require additional personnel and resources. Additionally, ISCAP could be tasked with evaluating challenges to controls on unclassified information. This may require judicial action or congressional intervention to define clearer standards for information disclosure. To address concerns about the restrictive nature of SBU information labeling, critics emphasize the need for an appeals process similar to the mandatory declassification review. They argue that requesters should have alternatives to court challenges and suggest implementing time limits for information protection. Gansler and Lucyshyn recommended time limits for protection of sensitive information, suggesting declassification after a certain period. They proposed an appeals process for individual decisions on releasing information. Questions remain about communication between intelligence and scientific communities and whether SBU controls function as a classification system. The text discusses the impact of SBU controls on scientific and technical information, questioning the withholding of such data and its effects on research and policymaking. It also raises concerns about access to information produced by universities and the potential impact of DHS's controls on technology development. The use of risk-based procedures to balance access and control is also considered. The text raises questions about the cost and effectiveness of SBU information control systems, including the use of risk-based procedures. It also discusses the need for monitoring the impact of governmental and private sector information control procedures on scientific communication. The text discusses the need for monitoring the impact of governmental and private sector information control procedures on scientific communication. It highlights the challenges of balancing security and access to scientific information in the face of competing stakeholder demands. Agencies are working to develop codes of conduct and control procedures to adapt to the continuous growth of scientific knowledge and emerging threats. Some agencies use the CSA definition of sensitive information, based on content rather than risk of release. The Department of Homeland Security cited the CSA in a management directive, but does not necessarily endorse its use. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Appendix III establishes minimum controls for federal automated information security programs, assigning agency responsibilities and linking security programs with management control systems. The criteria for designating sensitive information is not standardized across federal agencies. The OMB Circular No. A-123 establishes control systems for federal automated information security programs, linking security programs with management control systems. It acknowledges the need to use NIST-generated risk-based procedures to protect all information, not just sensitive information. The Department of the Army uses the term \"Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).\" The Department of the Army defines \"Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Not Subject to Public Disclosure\" to include various categories such as 'for official use only,' 'sensitive but unclassified,' 'sea sensitive information,' and more. This information is exempt from public disclosure according to DOD Directives and may be subject to export controls. Examples of such information include patent secrecy data, confidential medical records, and law enforcement data. The National Security Agency defines \"sensitive information\" as data that could adversely affect national interest or federal programs if lost or misused. This includes employee personal data, law enforcement data, and technical controlled unclassified information. The National Security Agency defines \"sensitive information\" as data that could adversely affect national interest or federal programs if lost or misused. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a policy in 2005 on protecting sensitive but unclassified information, including \"Computer Security Act Sensitive Information\" as defined in the Computer Security Act of 1987. The CDC defines various categories of sensitive but unclassified information, including \"Contractor Access Restricted Information,\" \"DEA Sensitive,\" and \"Privacy Act Protected Information.\" All CDC information must be reviewed for security and approved before release, with violations potentially leading to civil or criminal action. Healthcare information and public health data are exempt from this policy. The CDC defines sensitive but unclassified information categories, with violations potentially leading to civil or criminal action. Healthcare information and public health data are exempt from this policy. The U.S. section of the International Boundary and Water Commission issued a directive in 2005 on protecting sensitive information. The CDC defines sensitive but unclassified information categories, with violations potentially leading to civil or criminal action. Information exempt from disclosure under FOIA and the Privacy Act, information technology information, and USIBWC internal security measures are among the types of sensitive information. Protections are required for storage and transmittal, and penalties are imposed for disclosure. Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, funded by the Department of Energy, mentioned in 2003 that DOE. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), defined \"sensitive\" in a broader way than the CSA, encompassing information that could adversely affect national security or government interests. This includes matters related to national defense, foreign relations, and various government-derived information. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) uses FISMA guidelines to develop information security policies, including risk assessments and security programs based on the level of risk involved. The policies align with NIST guidance documents and do not specifically reference homeland security guidance materials. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) follows FISMA, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and OMB Circular A-130 for information security policies. Implementation procedures include background checks, nondisclosure agreements, and encryption. DHHS documents apply to all information systems regardless of sensitivity. The use of \"sensitive\" and CSA concepts was discontinued in 2004. The U.S. Joint Forces Command is studying the implementation of SBU information policies in military programs. DOD guidance states that unclassified information must be reviewed before release, and if not released according to laws, it should be stamped FOUO. Controlled unclassified information lacks clear definition and only the originator can authorize disclosure. The analyst recommends using NIST documents for guidance. The analyst recommends using NIST documents for guidance on identifying CUI and conducting threat and vulnerability analysis. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are private organizations that collect, analyze, and share sensitive information on threats and vulnerabilities to protect critical infrastructures. Established in response to Presidential Directive 63 in 1998, ISACs help public and private sectors share information on physical and cyber security to safeguard U.S. critical infrastructures. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 updated the directive in 2003, establishing a categorization scheme for unclassified government data and ISAC member data based on sensitivity levels. The most restrictive level, Level 3, requires a thorough background check every three years. Agencies like USDA and a DOE-affiliated agency use mixed models of the CSA definition and risk-based guidelines. USDA requires its agencies to identify \"sensitive security information\" that could harm security if disclosed. This includes information on building vulnerabilities, select agent pathogen locations, computer infrastructure details, and more. Recertification is required every three years. The USDA requires identification and protection of sensitive security information related to potential threats to American livestock and poultry from biological agents. Access to this information is restricted to those with a \"need to know\" and must be determined by an authorized holder of SSI. SSI information should be protected for up to 10 years unless specified otherwise. Requests for SSI information should be processed in accordance with specific guidelines. The USDA issued a protection policy for SBU information in accordance with specific guidelines and OMB Circular A-130. Employees and contractors with a \"need to know\" must sign a nondisclosure agreement. SBU information is to be protected and encrypted for transmission, and may be processed for FOIA claims. The Western Area Power Administration issued guidance for handling sensitive information in accordance with Department of Energy policy. \"OUO information\" must be unclassified and protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Documents should be marked and protected as directed in the DOE Manual. Even information releasable under FOIA should be protected if sensitive. Recommendations include posting a summary of the information online or providing information for requesting a copy of the document. Some agencies have unique definitions of sensitive information that do not follow standard guidelines. Department of Defense issued guidance on protecting information to determine legitimate need and prevent unauthorized disclosure. The Department of Defense uses the term SBU for sensitive information, with access criteria similar to FOUO information. Marking information as FOUO does not automatically exempt it from FOIA, and access is granted based on need. Unauthorized disclosure is punishable. The Department of the Army and Department of Energy have specific terms for sensitive information, with consequences for unauthorized disclosure. The Army uses \"Technical controlled unclassified information\" for critical technology, while the DOE uses \"official use only\" for sensitive unclassified information. The Department of Energy has established a new Official Use Only (OUO) Information Order to address 'Sensitive, But Unclassified Information'. Information marked as OUO must be unclassified, have the potential to damage interests if disseminated, and fall under FOIA exemptions two through nine. Access to OUO documents is limited to authorized personnel, and penalties may be imposed for improper handling. These provisions apply to all DOE elements and contractors. The Department of Energy has established provisions for handling Sensitive, But Unclassified Information, known as Official Use Only (OUO) documents. These rules apply to all DOE elements and contractors. Information categorized as SBU science and technology includes facilities, personnel, programs, materials, security, safety assessment, vulnerabilities, and a sensitive subjects list. Considerations for determining sensitivity include suitability, sensitivity, risk, and consequences. DOE also maintains a Sensitive Subjects List for national security purposes. The Department of Energy has established provisions for handling Sensitive, But Unclassified Information, known as Official Use Only (OUO) documents. This includes a list of sensitive information related to U.S. national security that requires an export license for foreign nationals. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued rules for \"Safeguards Information\" (SGI) to protect unclassified sensitive information. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued rules for \"Safeguards Information\" (SGI) to protect unclassified sensitive information, which includes rigorous standards for background checks and fingerprinting. SGI is considered to be sensitive unclassified information that requires protection similar to classified confidential information. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final rule outlining access procedures to critical energy infrastructure information (CEII), which is technical information submitted from companies and utilities during regulatory proceedings. CEII is exempt from public disclosure and is kept confidential to prevent terrorist attacks. The rule outlines access procedures to critical energy infrastructure information (CEII), which is exempt from public disclosure to prevent terrorist attacks. Federal agencies have developed information systems to share sensitive but unclassified information among themselves and with first responders, mandated by legal authorities such as the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act and executive orders. The government has taken steps to strengthen terrorism information sharing standards, including the establishment of a National Counterterrorism Center and the passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Government Accountability Office reported that federal agencies have developed networks to share information for homeland security functions, including the DHS's Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network. The government has established networks to share unclassified sensitive information for homeland security purposes. These networks restrict access to public disclosure and operate on a \"need-to-know\" basis. Additionally, new information systems like the Homeland Security Information Network are being developed for exchanging sensitive but unclassified information. DHS is developing the \"Homeland Security Information Network\" to share SBU and classified information with state and local personnel and the private sector. Other networks for SBU information exchange include the \"Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network\" and the \"Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) TTIC Online system.\" The \"Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange\" (MATRIX) covers 13 states. The \"Law Enforcement Online (LEO)\" system, part of the Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX), connects federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to share sensitive terrorism-related information. LEO has about 30,000 users and provides access to FBI intelligence products and reports at the Law Enforcement Sensitive classification level. The FBI uses LEO as the primary channel for sharing sensitive information with other agencies. DHS launched LLIS for state and local emergency officials to exchange preparedness tips and best practices online. FEDTeDS is a system created by the federal government to transmit security-sensitive acquisition material for solicitations. Vendors use this system to submit bids or proposals with sensitive information such as specifications, schedules, and procedures. Over 90 federal agencies use FEDTeDS to disseminate this information during the procurement phase to approved users. The FEDTeDS system, operational since February 19, 2003, facilitates procurement via the Internet for approved users. The National Intelligence Reform Act called for an \"information sharing environment\" to link systems for sharing information between agencies, levels of government, and the private sector. DHS's Homeland Security Advisory Council plans to enhance information exchanges between federal, state, local, and private sectors. Despite efforts, the GAO High Risk Series Report highlighted the need for further improvements in information sharing. The GAO High Risk Series Report emphasized the need for continued efforts to improve homeland security information sharing, including setting clear goals, standardizing federal structures, and enhancing capabilities for information analysis and dissemination."
