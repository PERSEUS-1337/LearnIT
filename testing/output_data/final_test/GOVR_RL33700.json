The budget for FY2011 requested $2,182,300,000 for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations, compared to $2,125,000,000 enacted for FY2010. The request also included amending the assessment cap on U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations in 2011 to 27.5%. On June 30, 2010, the House Subcommittee recommended $2,126,382,000 for the CIPA account to the full House Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the same amount in S. 3676 on July 29, 2010. The President's FY2010 supplemental request included $96,500,000 for U.S. contributions to the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti. On July 29, 2010, the President signed H.R. 4899, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010. The United Nations played a significant role in peacekeeping operations in the 1990s, with a total of 20 operations set up between 1988 and 1994. However, the pace of creating new peacekeeping operations dropped after 1994 due to strict criteria set by the U.S. in Presidential Decision Directive 25. This decision was also adopted by the U.N. Security Council. Between 1978 and 2010, the number of U.N. peacekeeping operations fluctuated, with 15 operations in place by the end of 2010. Costs for these operations increased from $202 million in 1978 to $3 billion annually in the mid-1990s, before decreasing to below $1 billion in 1998. The total U.N. peacekeeping costs fluctuated between 1995 and 2007, ranging from $1 billion to $4.7 billion annually. The number of personnel in U.N. peacekeeping operations varied from 16,700 in 1978 to 98,638 in 2010. U.S. contributions for assessed peacekeeping accounts increased from $36.7 million in 1988 to $991.4 million in 1994.

The request also included funding for international war crimes tribunals and language amending the assessment cap on contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations. The House Subcommittee recommended $2,126,382,000 for the Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account, while the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3676 for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2011. The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2011 recommended $2,126,382,000 for the CIPA account, $55,918,000 below the President's request. The amount was transferred to the Peacekeeping Operations account to cover assessed payments. President Obama's FY2010 supplemental request included $96,500,000 for U.S. contributions to MINUSTAH in Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental budget request included $45 million to support U.S. personnel in MINUSTAH in Haiti. The President signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, with the funding intact. Additionally, $2.26 billion was requested for U.S. assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations for FY2010. The FY2010 supplemental budget request included $45 million for U.S. personnel in MINUSTAH in Haiti. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $2,125,000,000 for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account, $135,000,000 lower than the request. The committee allocated funds for U.S. assessed contributions to support the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and urged assistance for Somalia from the PKO account. The committee allocated $55,000,000 for Somalia's assessed expenses and urged priority funding for UN peacekeeping operations in Central African Republic, Chad, and Congo. They directed the State Department to support OIOS oversight in all UN peacekeeping missions and requested a performance report on efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The committee emphasized the need for justice against peacekeepers involved in trafficking and exploitation, and addressed the 25% cap on peacekeeping assessments. The committee recommended $102,000,000 for peacekeeping activities in Somalia, with $55,000,000 for United Nations assessed costs. The House passed H.R. 3081 on July 9, 2009, and the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1434 on the same day, recommending $2,125,000,000 for the CIPA account, $135,000,000 below the President's request.

The conferees support the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services to identify waste, fraud, and abuse in peacekeeping operations. The Department of State is directed to ensure OIOS has enough resources for its mandate. The conference agreement includes a provision on Peacekeeping Assessment amending the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. President Bush requested funding for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations in his budget for FY2009, including $31,000,000 for war crimes tribunals and $247,200,000 for Peacekeeping Operations account. This account supports U.S. contributions to various peacekeeping efforts, including the Multilateral Force and Observers. President Bush requested additional funding for U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping efforts in his FY2009 budget, including $60 million for monitoring peace in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He also sought authority to cover up to 27.1% of U.N. peacekeeping operation costs from 2005 to 2009. The Administration requested additional funding for U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping efforts, including $60 million for monitoring peace in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. President Bush signed H.R. 2642, which included supplemental funding for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping accounts for FY2008 and FY2009. $373,708,000 was appropriated under the CIPA account, with $333,600,000 designated for the U.N.-African Union Hybrid Mission in Darfur. In July 2008, Congress appropriated additional funding for international peacekeeping missions, including $150,500,000 for the CIPA account and $95,000,000 for the PKO account. This money was designated for missions in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti, Liberia, and Sudan. The funding would be available from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009, and would not be used for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping assessed accounts. The committee recommended $1,650,000,000 in FY2009 appropriations to the CIPA account, $153,000,000 above the President's request. The committee criticized under-funding of peacekeeping activities and reliance on limited supplemental funds. The committee bill included language to adjust the authorized level of U.S. assessments for peacekeeping activities for calendar year 2009 and prior years. Future budget requests should include sufficient funding to support this authorization. The Department of State is directed to ensure proper training for peacekeepers to prevent violence against women and girls. The Secretary of State should work with the United Nations to address exploitation and violence issues. S. 3288 aimed to hold individuals who exploit or commit violence against women accountable, including prosecution in their home countries. The bill was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar but not considered on the Senate floor. President Bush signed H.R. 2638 into law as P.L. 110-329, providing appropriations for FY2009 at FY2008 spending levels until March 6, 2009. President Obama signed H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8), which included funding for U.S. assessed contributions to U.N. conducted peacekeeping operation accounts. The funds available for the CIPA during this period are $525,800,000, and for the PKO account, $97,366,613. Additionally, the CIPA account funding totaled $1,517,000,000, with an amendment to the Peacekeeping Assessment section. The joint explanatory statement directed the Department of State to \"provide full funding\" for the U.S. assessed contribution to the UN/African Union Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), ensuring that UNAMID personnel receive training on prevention of and response to violence against women. President Obama submitted a supplemental request for military and security efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, including an additional $836,900,000 under the CIPA account. The President requested up to $50,000,000 for peacekeeping in Somalia, with $454,529,000 for existing U.N. peacekeeping operations. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 provided $721,000,000 for the CIPA account and $185,000,000 for the PKO account. The Bush Administration requested $1,107,000,000 in FY2008 for U.S. assessed contributions. In FY2008, the Bush Administration requested $1,107,000,000 for U.S. assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations, including funds for war crimes tribunals. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,302,000,000 for the CIPA account and $293,200,000 for the PKO account, setting the peacekeeping assessment cap at 27.1%. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,302,000,000 for the CIPA account in FY2008, expressing concern over the Administration's lack of planning for International Peacekeeping activities. They noted a 3% cut below the previous year's budget and questioned the rationale behind the requested funding decrease. The Committee is worried about potential adverse effects on peacekeeping missions if the proposed funding level is enacted. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,302,000,000 for the CIPA account in FY2008, expressing concern over the Administration's lack of planning for International Peacekeeping activities. They noted a 3% cut below the previous year's budget and questioned the rationale behind the requested funding decrease. The committee noted that the Administration has voted for a seven-fold expansion of the UN's peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, expansion in Darfur, reauthorization in Haiti, and a renewed mission in East Timor. Concerns were raised about the U.S. debt to UN peacekeeping operations potentially reaching $1 billion and impacting countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The House passed H.R. 2764, Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2008, on June 22, 2007, approving funding recommendations for peacekeeping. On July 10, 2007, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding recommendations for the CIPA and PKO accounts, allocating $1,352,000,000 and $273,200,000 respectively. The committee criticized the President's request as being below projected requirements for U.S. contributions to peacekeeping and expressed concerns about under-funding peacekeeping activities. They proposed adjusting the authorized level of U.S. assessments for peacekeeping activities for fiscal year 2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding recommendations for the CIPA and PKO accounts, increasing the U.S. assessments for peacekeeping activities for fiscal year 2008 to 27.1 percent. President Bush later requested additional funding for the CIPA account to support the new U.N. peacekeeping operation in Darfur. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, which included funding for these initiatives. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided funding for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2008. It included across-the-board rescissions and allocated $1,700,500,000 for CIPA, with $468,000,000 designated as emergency for U.S. contributions to UNAMID. Additionally, $263,230,000 was allocated for the PKO account, including $25 million for the U.S. contribution to the MFO in the Sinai, with $35 million designated as emergency funding. President Bush had requested $1,830,600,000 for the CIPA account and $221,200,000 for the PKO account for FY2008. President Bush requested FY2007 supplemental funding for CIPA and PKO, including $200 million for unforeseen U.N. peacekeeping expenses. The PKO supplemental request of $278 million aimed to support peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, Chad, and Somalia. Transfer authority of up to $128 million was requested to fund U.N. peacekeeping missions or African regional security organizations. The House passed H.R. 1591 on March 23, 2007, providing funding for the CIPA and PKO accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for both accounts, with the authority to transfer funds between them. The Senate passed its amendment to H.R. 1591 on March 29, 2007, with provisions unchanged. A conference report filed on April 24, 2007, provided funding for the CIPA and PKO accounts. A conference report on H.R. 1591 was filed, providing $288 million for the CIPA account and $230 million for PKO, with $40 million available for Liberia. H.R. 1591 was vetoed by the President on May 1, 2007, due to Iraq-related language. Congress then passed H.R. 2206, a FY2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill, which included funding for CIPA and PKO accounts. H.R. 2206 provided funds for CIPA and PKO accounts, specifying allocations for UNIFIL, U.N. Mission in Timor Leste, and a potential operation in Chad. If funds are not used for Chad by August 15, 2007, State Department should consult on funding for other priority missions within CIPA. The Bush Administration requested funds for U.N. peacekeeping operations in the FY2007 budget, including contributions to war crimes tribunals and voluntary contributions for peacekeeping operations. The House proposed $170 million in the FY2007 Foreign Operations Act for peacekeeping efforts. The House proposed $170 million in the FY2007 Foreign Operations Act for peacekeeping efforts. In the State Department Appropriations Act, 2007, the House agreed to $1,135,327,000 for the CIPA account, $113,052,000 more than FY2006. The Senate recommended appropriations for the State Department and Foreign Operations, with $97,925,000 for the PKO account. President Bush signed a resolution extending appropriations through September 30, 2007, with specific figures for the CIPA account. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Act proposed $170 million for peacekeeping efforts. The State Department Appropriations Act, 2007 allocated $1,135,327,000 for the CIPA account, with an additional $113,052,000 compared to FY2006. The Senate recommended $97,925,000 for the PKO account. President Bush signed a resolution with specific figures for the CIPA account and the PKO account. United States U.N. peacekeeping requests were funded at a 25% assessment level from FY1997 to FY2001. U.S. policy since 1992 aimed to reduce the U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25%. Since October 1, 1995, U.S. peacekeeping payments were limited to 25% based on congressional requirements, leading to arrearages for U.N. peacekeeping accounts. Amendments increased the cap from 25%, with significant arrearages remaining for the U.S. until 2000. In December 2000, the U.N. reduced the U.S. regular budget assessment level to 22%, gradually decreasing the U.S. assessment for peacekeeping contributions to 25%. The U.S. peacekeeping payments were limited to 25% until 2000, leading to arrearages. Congress passed S. 248 to amend the legislation, changing the peacekeeping assessment level to 28.15%. In 2002, Congress raised the cap for peacekeeping payments to a range of 28.15% to 27.4% for CY2001 to CY2004. This enabled U.S. peacekeeping assessments to be paid in full. In 2004, the cap for assessments made during CY2005 was continued at 27.1%. The FY2006 legislation did not include a provision on the cap for assessments, which returned to 25% for CY2006. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported S. 600, the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act, which aimed to set a permanent ceiling of 27.1% on U.S. payments to U.N. peacekeeping accounts. Senator Richard Lugar proposed an amendment to strike this provision, citing concerns about reducing U.S. leverage in negotiating for a 25% assessment rate. Senator Joseph Biden introduced an amendment to maintain the U.N. peacekeeping assessment rate at 27.1% for calendar years 2005, 2006, and 2007. The Senate rejected this amendment and agreed to drop a section that would have made the change permanent. Senator Biden later introduced a bill to set the assessment cap at 27.1% for CY2005 and CY2006. The President's budget request for FY2007 also included language to keep the cap at 27.1% for CYs 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. The Senate rejected Senator Biden's amendment to maintain the U.N. peacekeeping assessment rate at 27.1% for CYs 2005, 2006, and 2007. Biden later introduced a bill to set the cap at 27.1% for CYs 2005-2008. Senator Biden introduced a bill to set the U.N. peacekeeping assessment rate at 27.1% for calendar years 2005-2008, aiming to pay dues and arrears to U.N. peacekeeping operations. The bill was favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by raising the cap, the bill would allow the department to pay the U.N. an additional $157 million for arrears in 2006, 2007, and 2008. The Senate did not act on the bill, but the Omnibus Appropriations Act set the peacekeeping assessment cap at 27.1% for 2008. The FY2009 budget requested authority to pay up to 27.1% of U.N. peacekeeping operation assessments from 2005-2009. The enacted Appropriations Act, 2009 set the cap at 27.1%. The FY2010 budget set the cap at 27.3% for assessments in 2010. The FY2011 budget requested authority to pay up to 27.5% for assessments in 2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee set the cap at 27.3% for assessments in 2010 and 2011. Since 1997, Congress has required the Secretary of State to notify 15 days before supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution for peacekeeping operations. This notification must include cost, mission length, national interest served, and exit strategy. Reprogramming requests for funding sources are also necessary, with committees sometimes placing holds on reallocations if deemed unacceptable. Committees are to be notified of U.N. assessments received by the United States. The United Nations has taken action to prevent trafficking in persons, exploitation, and illegal sexual exploitation by U.N. employees and peacekeeping forces. Funds for peacekeeping expenses are only available after certification that American manufacturers have equal opportunities. Peacekeeping involves military personnel performing non-military functions in a country. Peacekeeping operations involve military personnel performing non-military functions in a country, such as supervision of agreements, border patrol, and removal of arms. The term was coined in 1956 with the creation of the U.N. Emergency Force. The U.N. Security Council establishes peacekeeping operations based on certain principles, including agreement by all parties involved and consent of the host government(s). U.N. peacekeeping operations involve the provision of personnel on a voluntary basis by member countries, with a mandate to operate within specific parameters and not interfere in the host government's internal affairs. The conditions for using armed force are outlined in Council resolutions or rules of engagement. These operations can take the form of peacekeeping forces or observer missions, each with distinct mandates or functions. Peacekeeping forces are larger in numbers, equipment, and cost than observer missions. They are lightly armed and funded through a special assessed account created by the U.N. General Assembly. Each operation has a separate budget approved by the General Assembly. The U.N. General Assembly decided to change the budget cycle for peacekeeping operations from January-December to July 1-June 30, effective by July 1, 1996. The increase in peacekeeping operations since 1948 led to strain on the U.N. Secretariat's capacities and donor fatigue among troop-contributing countries. The U.N. General Assembly changed the budget cycle for peacekeeping operations in 1996. The hesitation to provide personnel for U.N. peacekeeping operations continues today. Current U.N. statistics show a surge in peacekeeping with almost 100,000 personnel deployed in 18 operations worldwide in 2006. Troops, police, and military observers are provided by contributing countries. Deployment numbers are expected to increase in 2007 with new peace operations being established. The United Nations has increased support for peace operations, including peacekeeping missions and special political missions. They are also assisting regional actors in developing their peacekeeping capabilities, such as supporting the African Union Mission in the Sudan. The term \"peace operations\" originated from the Brahimi Panel report and is part of the U.N. Security Council's role in maintaining international peace and security. The U.N. peace operations encompass conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peace-building activities. Data on personnel involved in peace operations includes both uniformed personnel and civilians, unlike U.N. peacekeeping operations which only track uniformed personnel. Currently, there are 15 deployed peacekeeping operations. The U.N. peace operations involve conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peace-building activities. Currently, there are 15 deployed peacekeeping operations, with one additional peace operation in Iraq. The U.S. has historically provided goods, services, and military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping tasks. As of November 30, 1995, 3,254 U.S. military personnel served under U.N. control in eight operations. By April 1996, the number decreased to 712 with the end of the U.N. Mission in Haiti. As of December 31, 2010, 89 U.S. personnel served under U.N. control in six operations. The United States currently contracts with outside firms to provide U.S. civilian police for U.N. peacekeeping operations. As of December 31, 2010, a total of 98,638 uniformed personnel from 115 countries served in 15 U.N. peacekeeping operations, prompted by internal instabilities and disasters in various regions. The UN Security Council has modified the principle of nonintervention to allow for humanitarian assistance in countries like Iraq. This shift was seen in resolutions like 688 and 687, which imposed requirements on Iraq. The Council has now approved humanitarian assistance as a major function of peacekeeping operations, as seen in Somalia. The UN Security Council has expanded the mandate of peacekeeping operations to include humanitarian protection in countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, there have been instances where peacekeepers failed to protect civilians, such as during the genocide in Rwanda and the fall of Srebrenica in 1995. These failures have prompted a reevaluation of peacekeeping strategies by UN officials and member states. The difficulty of implementing an effective U.N. response to genocide in Darfur, Sudan, has raised concerns among U.N. officials and member states, especially the Security Council. Calls have been made for the United Nations to supervise elections in various countries, although historically, the organization has been hesitant to do so in the peace and security domain. The U.N. General Assembly authorized the Electoral Assistance Division to oversee U.N. electoral assistance activities, including in special peace and security situations. Examples include Namibia, Western Sahara, and East Timor, where elections were part of conflict settlement arrangements. The U.N. has also conducted elections monitoring in independent member states like Cambodia. The U.N. conducted elections in Cambodia as part of a political settlement to end the conflict. In Nicaragua and Haiti, election monitoring was authorized by the U.N. General Assembly. The U.N. Observer Mission in Nicaragua involved civilian observers, while the United Nations Observer Group in Haiti included a security component. Congress may finance U.S. involvement in such missions. Congress may finance U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations through Department of State authorization and appropriation bills. This includes assessed contributions to peacekeeping operations and funding for specific U.N. operations like the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. The U.S. contribution to UN peacekeeping operations, including the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, is funded through Department of State authorization and appropriation bills. Funding for U.S. contributions to UNFICYP has shifted from the Military Assistance account to the State Department's CIPA account. Additionally, Congress funds U.S. contributions to some U.N. observer peacekeeping operations as part of its regular budget payment to the United Nations. The U.S. funds its contributions to UN peacekeeping operations through various methods, including reprogramming from other international affairs budgets, transferring funds from the Department of Defense, and requesting appropriations from Congress for new operations. President Clinton also proposed funding for peacekeeping operations under Chapter VII of the Charter in 1994 and 1995. The U.S. proposed financing peacekeeping operations under Chapter VII of the Charter through the Defense Department, but Congress did not support this. As peacekeeping gained importance post-Cold War, efforts were made to strengthen the U.N.'s response to peace and security challenges. The Secretary-General presented a 24-page report on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, and peacekeeping to the Council on June 14, 1992. He emphasized the importance of clear mandates, cooperation of parties, support from the Security Council, contributions from Member States, effective command, and adequate support for peacekeeping operations. He recommended greater use of the Stand-by Arrangements System and improved training programs for peacekeeping. The Secretary-General presented a report on preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, and peacekeeping to the Council, emphasizing clear mandates, cooperation, support, effective command, and adequate resources. He recommended increased use of the Stand-by Arrangements System, improved training programs, and special personnel procedures for peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Security Council undertook an in-depth examination of the report from October 1992 to May 1993, issuing statements on its recommendations. The Council President issued a statement in May 1994 addressing criteria for new operations, ongoing operations review, communication with non-members, stand-by arrangements, civilian personnel, training, command and control, and financial/administrative issues. This statement aligned with the U.S. Presidential Decision Directive on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations. Security Council follow-up on Agenda for Peace initiatives continued until 1998, with input from the U.N. General Assembly and its Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. The Working Group ceased meetings in 1996, while the Special Committee reviewed the report and made recommendations for action. The Special Committee reviewed a report and made recommendations for action, resulting in changes to U.N. peacekeeping operations such as creating a 24-hour operations center, transferring the Field Operations Division to the Department for Peacekeeping Operations, establishing a Peacekeeping Reserve Fund, adopting a Convention on Protection of U.N. personnel, creating a military planning cell, improving major departments related to peacekeeping, and forming a Task Force on United Nations Operations. The Special Committee made recommendations for improving U.N. peacekeeping operations, including creating a 24-hour operations center and increasing staff levels in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. A report issued by a special Panel on United Nations Peace Operations presented recommendations to enhance the U.N.'s peace and security capabilities, some of which have been implemented while others requiring Member State commitments have not been fully carried out. Since 2004, reform efforts for U.N. peacekeeping have been ongoing. Since 2004, U.N. peacekeeping reform has been part of the overall review of the organization's capabilities. The need to improve deployment options was highlighted in reports by a High-Level Panel and Secretary-General Annan in 2004 and 2005, emphasizing the demand for personnel exceeding supply. The call for enhanced efforts in peacekeeping operations remains a priority to avoid past failures. In March 2005, Annan proposed reforms for improved deployment options and the establishment of a peacekeeping system with regional partnerships. He addressed allegations of misconduct by U.N. administrators and peacekeepers, emphasizing the importance of respecting international law and human rights. A report on sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeeping personnel was also issued. The Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in UN Peacekeeping Operations was endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2005. The World Summit Outcome in the same year called for the development of enhanced rapidly deployable capacities for peacekeeping operations, including the creation of a standing police capacity. In 2005, the UN General Assembly endorsed the Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in UN Peacekeeping Operations. A Conduct and Discipline Team was established in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) to address conduct and discipline issues in peacekeeping operations. Conduct and Discipline Teams were also set up in seven peacekeeping operations and in U.N. missions in Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Afghanistan by the end of 2006. The Conduct and Discipline Teams in UN missions are responsible for advising on and addressing misconduct issues, enforcing UN standards of conduct, investigating allegations of misconduct including sexual exploitation and abuse, and providing training on these standards. On May 29, 2007, U.N. Under Secretary-General for Peacekeeping announced discussions with member states on standards for peacekeepers to ensure a common understanding of acceptable behavior. Some countries opposed these standards, leading to the adoption of U.N. standards of conduct in Resolution 61/291 on July 24, 2007. The revised draft model memorandum of understanding (MOU) for U.N. peacekeeping personnel includes language on professional conduct, respect for local laws and customs, impartiality, integrity, and reporting of sexual exploitation and abuse. U.S. Acting U.N. Representative expressed concern over reports of misconduct in some U.N. missions during a Security Council meeting in January 2007. The U.N. has implemented guidelines and policies to address sexual exploitation and abuse by personnel in peacekeeping operations. Member states are responsible for enforcing standards of behavior for their personnel. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a Comprehensive Strategy on Assistance to Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. U.S. Adviser David Traystman expressed satisfaction with this decision. The United States is pleased with the General Assembly's action on addressing sexual exploitation and abuse by UN staff. The international community strongly condemns such acts and supports the Secretary-General's zero tolerance policy. Mr. Traystman highlighted the work of Conduct and Discipline Teams in implementing rules to prevent misconduct. The United States supports measures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse by UN staff, including enforcement of UN standards and disciplinary actions. Discussions on U.N. reform in peacekeeping focus on addressing these issues. The U.N. reform in peacekeeping aims to enhance the organization's capacity to manage peace and security operations. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proposed restructuring the Department of Peacekeeping Operations into two departments: the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Field Support. The latter would handle administration, management of personnel, procurement, technology, and finances for U.N. peace operations, allowing the former to focus on strategic direction and management of peacekeeping operations. The Secretary-General proposed restructuring the Department of Peacekeeping Operations into two departments: the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Field Support. The latter would handle administration, management of personnel, procurement, technology, and finances for U.N. peace operations, allowing the former to focus on strategic direction and management of peacekeeping operations. The Special Representative or Head of Mission will have a single, clear reporting line to the Secretary-General through the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations to ensure unity of command and integration of effort at the field and Headquarters levels. The Secretary-General proposed restructuring the Department of Peacekeeping Operations into two departments: the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Field Support. The new units would handle media relations, departmental publicity, external relations, corporate messaging, information management capacity, conduct and discipline, and secretariat support for senior field leadership selection process. The Department of Field Support would manage administration, personnel, procurement, technology, and finances for U.N. peace operations. The Department of Management would retain final authority for budget submissions to the Assembly. Ban intended to delegate procurement authority to the Department of Field Support and establish a common vendor database and procurement manual. The U.N. General Assembly supported the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, including the establishment of the Department of Field Support. On June 29, 2007, the U.N. General Assembly approved the restructuring plan, establishing the Department of Field Support. Secretary-General Ban appointed Susana Malcorra to head the Department in March 2008, replacing Jane Holl Lute. President Clinton supported collective security through the United Nations and called for a genuine U.N. peacekeeping headquarters with adequate funding and resources. President Clinton signed a policy directive in May 1994 to strengthen U.N. management of peacekeeping operations and reduce the U.S. assessment from 31.7% to 25%. U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke presented reform proposals in 2000 to enhance U.N. peacekeeping capacities and change financing methods. The State Department commended the U.N. Panel on Peace Operations for its work in August 2000. In December 2004, Congress mandated the establishment of a bipartisan Task Force on the United Nations chaired by Newt Gingrich and George J. Mitchell. The Task Force aimed to make the UN more effective in achieving its Charter goals. The report, American Interests and U.N. Reform, issued in March 2005, provided comments and recommendations on UN peacekeeping. The Task Force on the United Nations recommends that member states increase the availability of capable forces for rapid deployment to peace operations and enhance coordination of contributions to the Stand-By Arrangements system. This is crucial for ensuring the success of UN peacekeeping efforts. The Task Force recommends that the United States upgrade its participation in the United Nations Stand-By Arrangements system by providing more detailed information about the support it can offer. This includes supporting the creation of a senior police force management unit, assessed funding for quick-impact projects in peace operations, and adopting two-year budgets for peacekeeping support. The Task Force urged the United States to strongly support reform measures in peace operations to address sexual exploitation and abuse, increase deployment of women, improve training programs, impose accountability, provide victim assistance, and enhance supervision. The Task Force recommended increasing staff for better supervision and organizing recreational activities for peacekeepers. It also suggested that states failing to ensure discipline among their troops should not contribute to peacekeeping missions. Congress has used authorizations and appropriations bills to oversee U.S. involvement in United Nations peacekeeping operations, adjusting contributions based on U.N. reform efforts and other actions. In 1991 and 1992, Congress provided funding for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations and arrearages. Senator Paul Simon introduced a bill to explore new funding sources for U.S. contributions to the United Nations. Senator Paul Simon introduced a bill to explore new funding sources for U.S. contributions to the United Nations, suggesting financing from the defense budget. Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to use up to $300 million from defense appropriations for peacekeeping if funding is not available from the State Department. President George Bush sent a report to Congress on the proposals in \"An Agenda for Peace,\" but in 1993, Congress did not provide all the funding requested for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping. Congress appropriated $401.6 million of the $619.7 million requested for U.N. peacekeeping in the State Department Appropriations Act, FY1994. The Foreign Operations Act included $75,623,000 for Peacekeeping Operations. Congress did not approve the $300 million requested for DOD peacekeeping support. Congress expressed concerns about peacekeeping operations and recommended a review of the current process and limiting assessments to 25%. The United States will not accept peacekeeping assessments greater than 25% for new or expanded commitments. The State Department must include a three-year projection of peacekeeping costs in its budget submission and provide a detailed plan to address policy and structural deficiencies. The Secretary of State must notify appropriations committees 15 days in advance of any U.N. Security Council vote on new peacekeeping operations, including cost estimates, mission objectives, and funding sources. Similar requirements were included in the Defense Appropriations Act, FY1994. In 1994, various legislation including the Defense Appropriations Act and National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for peacekeeping and peace support efforts. The State Department appropriations bill included funding for the CIPA account and supplemental appropriations. The foreign operations appropriations legislation also provided funding for peacekeeping efforts and training of other countries' troops for U.N. peacekeeping duty. However, the FY1995 National Defense Authorization bill and DOD Appropriations Bill did not include the requested funds for U.S.-assessed contributions to three U.N. operations. In early 1996, Congress responded to the President's request for funding U.S.-assessed contributions to three U.N. operations by appropriating $359 million for FY1996 CIPA funding and $70 million for the PKO account. Congress also provided $352.4 million for U.S. assessments to U.N. peacekeeping accounts in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY1997, including $50 million for U.S. peacekeeping arrears. The FY1997 Act (P.L. 104-208) allocated $50 million for U.S. peacekeeping arrears from 1995, contingent on U.N. cost-saving measures and budget reductions. Up to $20 million was earmarked for African crises, with funds subject to Committee review. Congress also mandated notification for any new or expanded U.N. peacekeeping missions. The appropriate committees are notified at least 15 days before a U.N. Security Council vote, providing details on cost, mission length, and exit strategy. Congress appropriated $65 million for the PKO account, with funds to be obligated through regular notification procedures. In 1997, Congress allocated $256 million for FY1998 CIPA and $77.5 million for FY1998 PKO account. In FY1998, Congress appropriated $231 million for U.S. assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations and $76.5 million for international peacekeeping activities.

The legislation required timely U.N. reimbursement for U.S. goods and services over $3 million per fiscal year. It also provided for U.S. arrears payments of $819 million to the United Nations for FY1998, FY1999, and FY2000, and forgiveness of $107 million in owed amounts for peacekeeping troops. In 2000, Congress appropriated $846 million for the FY2001 CIPA account, in response to the President's request of $738.6 million for FY2001. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns over the Administration's tendency to extend missions without Congressional input or funding availability. The $134 million requested for the FY2001 PKO account was reduced to $127 million in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill (P.L. 106-429). President Bush signed legislation amending the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000-2001 (P.L. 107-46) on October 5, 2001.
