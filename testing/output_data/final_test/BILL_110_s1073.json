    "content": "The \"Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act of 2007\" is also known as the Clean Air Act. It focuses on fuel with low lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The \"Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act of 2007\" defines key terms related to greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. It also defines lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions as the total emissions per unit of fuel from production to use, major oil company, and motor vehicle. The \"Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act of 2007\" defines greenhouse gas emission reductions from fuels available for motor vehicles. The Administrator will establish a determination process for lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuels and determine the average quantity per unit of energy delivered to a motor vehicle based on fuels available in 2007. The Administrator will consider greenhouse gas emissions from fuel production, distribution, transportation, and end use efficiency, as well as changes in land use and net climate impacts affecting energy and agriculture sectors. Other relevant matters will also be taken into account as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuels, make information available to consumers, label fuels with low emissions, and provide information on adverse impacts on land, water, soil, air quality, and public health. The Administrator will determine the average quantity of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy delivered to motor vehicles based on available fuel. Regulations will be established for a credit trading program to address emissions from fuels used in motor vehicles. The Administrator will regulate major oil companies, refiners, and fuel importers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels used in motor vehicles by 3% below baseline levels in 2015 and every fifth year thereafter. The major oil companies, fuel refiners, and fuel importers must demonstrate annually that their fuel mix meets the required reductions in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, using credits if necessary. The regulations allow providers of fuel exceeding required greenhouse gas emission reductions to generate credits based on the quantity of fuel and the difference in emissions reductions achieved. The intent of Congress is to create incentives for using fuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, promoting their improvement, availability, and competitiveness in the marketplace to contribute to an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \"Congress aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles.\" The Administrator determines greenhouse gas emissions baseline for vehicles sold in 2002 and subsequent emissions annually. Required reductions in emissions from automobiles are mandated. The Administrator mandates reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles by requiring manufacturers to decrease emissions per vehicle mile by 30% for model year 2016 and specify further reductions for every fifth model year thereafter. The Administrator determines reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for each fifth model year preceding the specified model year. SEC. 3. OPTIMIZED DUAL FUELED VEHICLES. Optimized Dual Fueled Automobiles: An optimized dual fueled automobile is capable of operating on alternative fuel and gasoline or diesel fuel. It can satisfactorily operate exclusively on alternative fuel throughout a Federal testing procedure. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency determines the capacity of optimized dual fueled automobiles. When operated on alternative fuel, these vehicles must achieve at least 20 percent greater fuel economy compared to gasoline or diesel fuel. Amendments to Section 32905 of title 49, United States Code, outline the fuel economy calculation for these vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency measures fuel economy for dual-fueled automobiles manufactured between 2011 and 2015 by dividing 1.0 by a sum that includes fuel economy measurements on gasoline and diesel fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency measures fuel economy for dual-fueled automobiles manufactured between 2011 and 2015 by dividing 1.0 by fuel economy measurements on gasoline, diesel fuel, and alternative fuel. The values are determined based on actual fuel usage and the total number of dual-fueled vehicles. Section 32906(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended accordingly. The code is amended to update fuel economy measurements for dual-fueled vehicles manufactured between 2011 and 2015. Additionally, regulations are to be promulgated to increase consumer awareness of flexible fuel vehicles. The code requires manufacturers of alternative fuel vehicles with low greenhouse gas emissions to use green fuel caps for identification. Manufacturers are prohibited from using green fuel caps on vehicles that do not use low greenhouse gas-emitting alternative fuels."
