    "content": "The \"Landfill Reduction Act of 2000\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that solid waste discards in the United States are projected to increase by 10 percent between 2000 and 2010, costing consumers and businesses an estimated $1 billion annually. The cost of disposing municipal solid waste is rising at a 7 percent annual rate, leading to regional shortages of disposal capacity and contentious siting of new facilities. Interstate disputes are already arising over waste management efforts. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 prioritizes source reduction and reuse over recycling to handle waste. Efforts are being made globally to regulate solid waste shipment and reduce packaging waste. It is crucial to emphasize source reduction and reuse without imposing new federal regulations or taxes, as the industry can significantly decrease packaging waste, benefiting the environment and conserving disposal capacity. Efforts are being made globally to regulate solid waste shipment and reduce packaging waste, emphasizing source reduction and reuse to benefit the environment and conserve disposal capacity. The Act aims to provide tax incentives for using reusable wooden and plastic pallets and containers to reduce solid waste, improve environmental quality, boost economic productivity, and address interstate waste transportation issues. It also offers a nonregulatory approach to environmental problems. The amendment to Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code allows for increased expensing for qualified reusable pallets and containers, with a minimum limitation of $500,000 or the cost of the property placed in service during the taxable year. The term 'qualified reusable pallet and container property' refers to property exclusively designed for manufacturing reusable pallets and containers, or used solely for transporting items produced by the taxpayer under a return arrangement for reuse. The term 'qualified reusable pallet and container property' includes property designed for inspecting, repairing, cleaning, maintaining, and enhancing the efficiency of reusable pallets and containers, as well as modifying displays for retail sale. The term 'reusable pallet and container property' refers to wooden or plastic pallets and crates that are repeatedly returned to the initial purchaser for long-term reuse. This definition excludes vehicles like automobiles, vessels, and trucks. The amendment allows for the long-term reuse of reusable pallet and container property, with an effective date for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
