    "content": "Congress has been actively establishing federal agricultural policy since the 1930s, revisiting it regularly through farm legislation to address a wide range of areas including conservation, rural development, nutrition assistance, trade, and support for farmers. The House approved H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, covering farm and food policy for FY2019-FY2023 with a vote of 213-211 on June 21, 2018. The House approved H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, covering farm and food policy for FY2019-FY2023 with a vote of 213-211 on June 21, 2018. The bill addresses agriculture and food policy across 11 titles, including commodity support programs, nutrition assistance, and rural infrastructure. The Congressional Budget Office projected that spending on mandatory programs under H.R. 2 would total $867 billion over a 10-year period, superseding the current farm programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill. Certain programs like crop insurance would continue without new legislation, but other programs for commodity support would be governed by permanent laws if the current farm law expires. The current farm law could expire, leading to the activation of permanent laws from the late 1930s and 1940s. These laws emphasize supply controls to raise prices of farm commodities. A shift in farm policy could disrupt farmers, input suppliers, exporters, manufacturers, and consumers. Without successor legislation, programs like conservation and rural development would cease to function. Congress has historically extended existing policies when faced with expiring farm legislation. The report provides a summary of the policies and provisions in H.R. 2, comparing them with current law. It includes analyses of budget implications and major changes in each of its 11 titles. The House adopted amendments to the bill during the floor debate, listed in Table A-1. Farm bills authorize funding for mandatory outlays and set parameters for discretionary programs. Mandatory programs typically drive farm bill policy. The budgetary impact of mandatory spending proposals in the farm bill is measured relative to the CBO baseline, which projects future federal spending on mandatory programs. Changes that increase spending relative to the baseline have a positive score, while those that decrease spending have a negative score. Budget enforcement uses these baselines and scores to follow budget rules like \"PayGo.\" The CBO released a baseline for farm bill programs with mandatory spending, projecting costs of $867 billion over the next 10 years. 77% of this cost is for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), with the remaining $203 billion for agricultural programs. The CBO estimates that H.R. 2 is budget neutral over a 10-year period. The bill, H.R. 2, would increase mandatory spending by $458 million over 10 years, offset by $465 million in revenue from fees paid by contractors in the SNAP EBT program. The baseline for the nutrition, crop insurance, and commodities titles is projected to remain close to current law. The conservation title would see a $795 million reduction over 10 years due to repealing the Conservation Stewardship Program, offset by increases in other conservation programs. The nutrition title's baseline would increase by $463 million over 10 years, including a 3% reduction in benefits. The overall nutrition title increase of $463 million is offset by a projected $465 million increase in revenue. Bioenergy programs funding is eliminated by $517 million over 10 years. Animal disease and preparedness programs receive new mandatory funding of $450 million. Farm safety net program outlays remain flat, with crop insurance reductions nearly offsetting increases in farm commodity programs. H.R. 2 in the 2014 farm bill provides new mandatory funding for various programs, including research, trade, and food insecurity. Title I commodity programs support dairy, sugar, and other commodities, with programs like PLC, ARC, and MAL. The dairy program protects margins between milk and feed prices, while the sugar program offers price support and border protection. The sugar program in H.R. 2 provides price support, border protection, and production allotments. Additionally, four disaster assistance programs focus on livestock and tree crops, offering federal aid for recovery from natural disasters like drought and floods. Title I includes administrative provisions such as payment limits, adjusted gross income thresholds, and details on program eligibility. H.R. 2 extends authority for commodity programs with modifications for covered commodities, dairy, and agricultural disaster assistance. H.R. 2 extends the sugar program and makes changes to payment limits and AGI limits for producer exemptions. The program changes make PLC more appealing than ARC for producers, with an escalator provision increasing the effective reference price by up to 115%. Producers in PLC affected by severe drought can update their program yields, while those in ARC are ineligible for certain benefits. The county-level ARC program and individual farm-level ARC program would be ineligible for crop insurance coverage under H.R. 2. The MAL program would be retained, but program benefits would be exempt from payment limits and AGI limits. H.R. 2 also changes how certain corporations are treated, defining a \"qualified pass through entity\" to include partnerships, joint ventures, LLCs, and S corporations. This allows each owner of a QTPE to have their own payment limits. H.R. 2 expands payment limits for qualified pass-through entities (QTPE) in family farming operations, including first cousins, nieces, and nephews. It also amends agricultural disaster assistance programs, waiving the AGI requirement for producers with majority income from farming. The bill expands livestock loss payments and coverage choices under the Dairy Risk Management Program (DRMP). Under H.R. 2, the USDA is required to study feed cost ratios and report alfalfa hay prices in top milk-producing states. The Dairy Risk Management Program (DRMP) lowers the catastrophic margin to $4.00/cwt and allows dairy producers to select a margin protection level and coverage percentage. The Dairy Risk Management Program (DRMP) offers margin coverage levels from $4.00/cwt. to $8.00/cwt. and coverage percentages from 25% to 90% of historical milk production. Premiums vary based on coverage levels and production tiers. Producers can make a one-time election for coverage lasting the duration of the farm bill. Premiums for Tier I margins are adjusted, with additional margin levels available at $8.50/cwt. and $9.00/cwt. Premiums for Tier II remain unchanged under DRMP. H.R. 2, part of the farm bill, would repeal the Dairy Product Donation Program and make amendments to various dairy programs. It also adjusts the formula for calculating the Class I skim milk price. Additionally, USDA administers agricultural conservation programs that assist landowners with natural resource concerns, which H.R. 2 also amends. H.R. 2 focuses on amending conservation programs, particularly working lands, land retirement, and easement programs. It reauthorizes current conservation programs except for the largest one, CSP, which is repealed. New spending on conservation is projected to increase by $656 million over five years but decrease by nearly $800 million over 10 years. Working land programs provide assistance to farmers for land management practices, with EQIP and CSP being the largest programs. H.R. 2 amends conservation programs, repealing CSP and increasing funding for EQIP. CSP contracts will be completed by FY2023, leading to a decline in conservation spending. EQIP options for irrigation entities are expanded, with overall funding increasing to $3 billion by FY2023. Land retirement and easement programs provide federal payments to private agricultural operations. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) under H.R. 2 is reauthorized and amended to increase enrollment to 29 million acres by FY2023. Payments to participants would be reduced, early termination of select CRP contracts allowed in FY2019, and incentives for continuous contracts and reenrollment decreased. Other changes aim to expand grazing and commercial uses on CRP acres. The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) under H.R. 2 is reauthorized and amended to provide financial and technical assistance through two types of easements: agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements. Changes focus on agricultural land easements, allowing USDA to partner with eligible entities to purchase easements from landowners. H.R. 2 provides additional flexibilities, removes planning requirements, waives the AGI requirement, allows mineral development and participation in environmental markets, and increases funding to $500 million annually. The farm bill created the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) to enroll land through existing conservation programs in partnership with eligible partners. Partners define project scope and location, provide 50% or more of project cost, and work with landowners to enroll in conservation programs. H.R. 2 expands funding for RCPP and existing conservation programs, allows longer partnership agreements and project renewal options. The trade title addresses U.S. international food aid and agricultural export programs, including Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and the McGovern-Dole program for education and child nutrition. H.R. 2 reauthorizes international food aid programs like Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and the McGovern-Dole program. The bill removes a minimum monetization requirement for Food for Peace and increases the minimum requirement for nonemergency programs. The programs can now purchase food locally or provide cash/vouchers to recipients. H.R. 2 reauthorizes international food aid programs like Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and the McGovern-Dole program. It increases the funding for nonemergency programs to $365 million and requires food vouchers, cash transfers, and local procurement of non-U.S. foods to avoid market disruption. The bill also extends authority for other related international programs and combines U.S. export promotion programs into a single International Market Development Program (IMDP). The International Market Development Program (IMDP) under H.R. 2 would receive $255 million annually from the Commodity Credit Corporation for FY2019-FY2023. Funding allocations include $200 million for promotional activities, $35 million for generic commodities, $9 million for specialty crop groups, and $10 million for emerging markets. The bill also establishes the Biotechnology and Agricultural Trade Program to address trade barriers for biotechnology products. H.R. 2 reauthorizes direct credits for agricultural exports to emerging markets, proposes changes to SNAP and related programs, and increases spending by $463 million over 10 years. The bill also includes policies impacting SNAP eligibility and benefit calculation. The bill proposes changes to SNAP eligibility and work requirements, aiming to reduce spending by over $5 billion in 10 years. Approximately 400,000 households and 265,000 children could lose SNAP eligibility and access to free meals. The proposed changes to SNAP eligibility and work requirements aim to reduce spending by $9.2 billion over 10 years. The new requirements would apply to 18- to 59-year-olds, including parents of children six years and older, and states must offer employment or training opportunities to those affected. Funding for SNAP Employment and Training would increase significantly under the proposal. The proposed work-related changes to SNAP benefits would reduce spending by $9.2 billion over 10 years. Approximately 1.2 million recipients would no longer receive benefits, with an average annual benefit loss of $1,816 per recipient. LIHEAP payments would no longer affect benefit calculations under the new provision. The proposal includes changes to SNAP benefits such as reducing benefits for 560,000 households by an average of $84 per month. It also increases asset limits, changes how vehicles and savings accounts are counted, amends income calculations, and requires cooperation with child support enforcement. Additionally, measures are included to address fraud, improve payment accuracy, and make changes to the EBT system. Funding for performance bonuses would be repealed under the bill. The bill proposes policy changes for SNAP's EBT system and benefit redemption, including funding increases for bonus incentives for fruits and vegetables. It also authorizes a pilot for retailers to receive federal funding for bonus incentive projects. Changes are proposed for USDA's operations and funding of nutrition education programs. The bill extends food distribution programs through FY2023 and increases funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program. The bill proposes changes to nutrition programs, including renaming the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to the Fruit and Vegetable Program. It also includes provisions for farm loan programs and the Farm Credit System, as well as reauthorizing the State Agricultural Loan Mediation Program through FY2023. H.R. 2 proposes changes to farm loan programs, including reducing the requirement for three years of farming experience for beginning farmers to qualify for loans. It also raises the maximum loan size for guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans to $1.75 million per borrower. Additionally, the bill makes technical corrections and updates references for the Farm Credit System. H.R. 2 expands the Farm Credit System's jurisdiction, increases acreage exception for FarmerMac loans, directs studies on loan risks, and deletes compensation limit for FCS bank boards. It also reauthorizes the State Agricultural Loan Mediation Program until FY2023. The Rural Infrastructure and Economic Development title of H.R. 2 proposes a new Subtitle A, Improving Health Outcomes in Rural Communities. It allows the Secretary of Agriculture to reprioritize rural development loans and grants for rural health emergencies. 10% of funds for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program would be used to treat individuals affected by the emergency. Subtitle B of H.R. 2 focuses on enhancing broadband services in rural areas by setting minimum standards, developing future projections, and providing incentives for reaching isolated areas. It also includes provisions for broadband infrastructure loan guarantees. Subtitle C of the bill focuses on provisions for rural communities, business development, and rural infrastructure. It prioritizes project applications that support strategic plans on a multi-jurisdictional basis, increases the maximum loan amount for water and waste water projects, and reduces reporting requirements for borrowers. Subtitle D of the bill reauthorizes programs under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, expands 911 access in rural areas, and extends the rural economic development loan and grant program. Subtitle E amends and reauthorizes agricultural energy programs from the 2014 farm bill, extending most through FY2023 with discretionary funding. Subtitle F reauthorizes the Value-Added Grants program and increases its discretionary funding authorization. Subtitle G of the bill repeals unfunded programs like the Rural Telephone Bank and makes technical corrections to certain provisions of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. USDA is authorized to conduct agricultural research and provide support for education programs through FY2023. H.R. 2 authorizes funding for agricultural research and extension activities through FY2023. It includes a new scholarship program for 1890 land-grant institutions and prohibits additional entities from receiving formula funding under certain acts. Indirect cost recovery for federal funding would increase to 30%. New research areas designated as high priorities include macadamia tree health, national turfgrass research, fertilizer management, cattle fever ticks, and laying hen and turkey research. The bill also reauthorizes the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative with increased funding levels. The Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI) would receive increased mandatory funding levels of $30 million annually for FY2019-FY2023. SCRI would be reauthorized through FY2023 and expand program eligibility to include new production practices and technologies. The forestry title in H.R. 2 reauthorizes and modifies existing assistance programs, establishes new programs, and addresses management of federal forest land. H.R. 2 reauthorizes and modifies existing forestry assistance programs, establishes new programs, and addresses management of federal forest land under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The bill would amend two forestry assistance programs by setting authorization limits through FY2023 and establish new assistance programs with explicit statutory authorization and congressional direction. The bill H.R. 2 reauthorizes funding for the National Forest Foundation and addresses federal and tribal forest management issues. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to exempt dead trees in California from export prohibition for 10 years and amends the Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Act of 2000. The bill also changes how the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management comply with environmental regulations for specified management activities. H.R. 2 authorizes Indian tribes to enter into agreements with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management for forest management activities on NFS lands. It also reauthorizes farm bill provisions supporting specialty crops, organic agriculture, and local foods sectors, including grants, support for farmers markets, food safety education, and organic certification. Other provisions amend regulatory requirements for federal actions. H.R. 2 amends regulatory requirements under federal statutes, changes funding for farmers markets and local foods promotion, and makes changes to USDA's National Organic Program. It reauthorizes discretionary appropriations for these programs at $30 million annually for FY2019-FY2023, with no mandatory funding beyond FY2018. The bill also enacts provisions from H.R. 3871, including limiting types of operations excluded from NOP certification, requiring electronic import documentation, and increasing USDA accreditation. H.R. 2 amends regulatory requirements under federal statutes, changes funding for farmers markets and local foods promotion, and increases USDA accreditation authority over certifying agents. It reauthorizes discretionary appropriations for the National Organic Program at $24 million by FY2023 and provides funding for technology upgrades to improve tracking of organic imports. The bill does not reauthorize mandatory funding for the National Organic Certification Cost Share Program. CBO estimates a total budget authority of $850 million for programs in the Horticulture title under H.R. 2. Under H.R. 2, CBO estimates an increase in mandatory spending of $10 million (FY2019-FY2023) for programs in the Horticulture title, covering data collection and technology updates under NOP. Provisions for specialty crop and certified organic sectors are spread across various titles of the law, including research, nutrition, and trade. For example, there is an estimated increase of $101 million (FY2019-FY2023) for the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative in the Research title. Other programs like SCRI would maintain current funding levels exceeding $320 million (FY2019-FY2023). Title IX of H.R. 2 includes exemptions from regulatory requirements for specialty crops, certified organic agriculture, and local foods sectors. It amends various acts such as FIFRA, the Clean Water Act, the Plant Protection Act, and OSHA. The bill clarifies federal and state roles in pesticide regulation, exempts certain pesticide discharges from permitting requirements, and eliminates the need for EPA consultation with other federal agencies for pesticide registrations. H.R. 2 would enact H.R. 1029, amending FIFRA to extend pesticide fee collection authority. It also amends the Plant Protection Act and OSHA, exempts agricultural retailers from safety management requirements, and modifies the federal crop insurance program to cover various losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as modified by H.R. 2, would decrease authorized spending by $70 million over FY2019-FY2023. Savings come from eliminating crop insurance education programs, increasing administrative fees, and cutting research and development funding. H.R. 2 would save $70 million by cutting crop insurance education programs, increasing administrative fees, and reducing research and development funding. It also expands coverage for forage and grazing, allowing separate crop insurance policies for dual-use crops. Redefining \"beginning farmer or rancher\" would result in federal subsidy benefits for whole farm insurance plans. H.R. 2 clarifies requirements for FCIC approval of reimbursement for developing new insurance plans and modifies old ones. It includes seven subtitles covering various aspects such as Livestock, Beginning Producers, Textiles, and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program. The Livestock subtitle establishes the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program. H.R. 2 includes funding for new programs to address animal pests and diseases, prioritize foot-and-mouth disease vaccine acquisition, operate the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and support the National Aquatic Health Plan. It also authorizes appropriations for veterinarian training, requires a study on food safety guidance for meat processing plants, and provides funding for outreach to socially disadvantaged and veteran farmers. H.R. 2 prioritizes youth agricultural programs, establishes a Commission on Farm Transition, and creates a Textile Trust Fund to support domestic users of imported cotton and wool fabric. The Textile Trust Fund in H.R. 2 supports domestic users of imported pima cotton and wool fabric with annual transfers from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, the bill provides funding for wool research, promotion, and strengthening the U.S. sheep industry. The United States Grain Standards Act restores exceptions in grain inspection regulations, and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program expands crop eligibility and coverage options. The Protect Interstate Commerce subtitle prohibits state or local governments from interfering with interstate commerce. The Protect Interstate Commerce subtitle in H.R. 2 would prevent states from imposing standards on agricultural commodities from other states if they comply with federal or state laws. It allows various entities to challenge these standards in court. The Other Matters subtitle includes technical amendments due to USDA reorganization, creates a Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison, a Century Farms Program, and other initiatives. The subtitle in H.R. 2 includes provisions for a Century Farms Program recognizing farms operating for over 100 years, a National Agriculture Imagery Program, and regulations against slaughtering dogs and cats for human consumption. It also mandates reports on dog importation, natural stone promotion, agriculture innovation, and amends hiring rules for cotton classification employees. Additionally, South Carolina is added to the Virginia/Carolina region of the Peanut Standards Board."
