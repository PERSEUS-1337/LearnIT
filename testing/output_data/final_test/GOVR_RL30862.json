    "content": "Reconciliation is a process established under Section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to align revenue and mandatory spending levels with budget resolution policies. It is used to reduce the deficit through spending cuts, revenue increases, or a combination of both. Reconciliation involves two steps: first, reconciliation instructions are included in the budget resolution to direct committees to develop legislation that changes spending or revenues as specified. The reconciliation process involves two steps: committees receive instructions to submit legislation to the Budget Committee, which is then combined into an omnibus budget reconciliation measure. This measure is then considered in the House and Senate under expedited procedures, leading to the enactment of the policies outlined in the budget resolution. Reconciliation has been used since 1980, with 20 bills enacted into law. Since 1980, 20 reconciliation bills have become law, with four being vetoed. Initially, reconciliation legislation included extraneous provisions, leading to the adoption of the Byrd rule in 1985 and 1986 to curb such practices. Named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, the rule has been modified over the years to prevent non-budgetary items from being included in reconciliation bills. This report aims to outline the legislative history, current features, and implementation of the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule was implemented in 1985 to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills. Initially consisting of two components, it was merged into the Congressional Budget Act in 1990 as Section 313, making it permanent. No further changes have been made since then. The Byrd rule, established in 1985 to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills, has remained unchanged since 1990. Senator Robert C. Byrd introduced the rule to protect the reconciliation process and maintain the Senate's deliberative nature. The Byrd rule, established in 1985 to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills, has remained unchanged since 1990. Senator Robert C. Byrd introduced the rule to protect the reconciliation process and maintain the Senate's deliberative nature. Currently, there are concerns about the abuse of the reconciliation process with 122 extraneous items in the bill. Action must be taken to stop this misuse and preserve the integrity of the budget reform process. The Byrd rule, established in 1985 to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills, has been expanded and revised over the years. It was included in COBRA of 1985 and became effective on April 7, 1986. The rule was set to expire on January 2, 1987, but has been extended through resolutions and laws. On December 19, 1985, the Senate adopted a resolution to extend the rule's application to conference reports and amendments between the two houses. The Byrd rule, established in 1985 to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills, was extended through resolutions and laws. S.Res. 286 and S.Res. 509 modified the rule, and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 extended its expiration date to January 2, 1988. Further changes were made in 1987, including modifications to procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 was modified by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997, which made revisions to the Byrd rule and incorporated it into the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Byrd rule was extended through various resolutions and laws to prevent non-budgetary items in reconciliation bills. The Byrd rule, a complex rule under the BEA of 1990, allows Senators to remove extraneous matter from reconciliation legislation through amendments or points of order. It applies to reconciliation bills and resolutions under Section 310 of the CBA of 1974. The Byrd rule allows Senators to remove extraneous matter from reconciliation legislation through points of order or amendments. A point of order can be raised against single or multiple provisions or amendments, and once material is struck under the Byrd rule, it cannot be offered again as an amendment. Waiving the Byrd rule requires a three-fifths affirmative vote. The Byrd rule allows Senators to remove extraneous matter from reconciliation legislation through points of order or amendments. A single waiver motion can apply to the Byrd rule and other provisions of the Congressional Budget Act, involving multiple provisions or amendments. The Senate Budget Committee must submit a list of potentially extraneous matter for the record when a reconciliation measure is considered, but this list is advisory and does not bind the chair in ruling on points of order. The Senate Budget Committee determines budgetary levels for enforcing the Byrd rule, which defines extraneous matter as unrelated to deficit reduction goals in reconciliation. A provision is considered extraneous if it doesn't impact outlays or revenues. The Byrd rule defines extraneous matter in reconciliation as provisions that impact outlays or revenues, including those outside the committee's jurisdiction, producing deficit increases beyond the budget window, or recommending changes to Social Security. This complements the ban on Social Security recommendations in reconciliation legislation. The Byrd rule in reconciliation prohibits extraneous provisions that impact outlays or revenues, including those outside the committee's jurisdiction, producing deficit increases beyond the budget window, or recommending changes to Social Security. The rule also allows for exceptions if provisions reduce outlays or increase revenues in certain circumstances. The Byrd rule in reconciliation prohibits extraneous provisions that impact outlays or revenues, including those outside the committee's jurisdiction, producing deficit increases beyond the budget window, or recommending changes to Social Security. The rule also allows for exceptions if provisions reduce outlays or increase revenues in certain circumstances. The full text of the Byrd rule is provided in the Appendix. Congress and the President considered 24 omnibus reconciliation measures between 1980 and 2015, with 20 enacted into law and four vetoed. The Byrd rule has been in effect for the last 19 of these measures. The Byrd rule was applied during the consideration of 15 out of 19 reconciliation measures. It was partially in effect during the first bill, COBRA of 1985. A total of 70 points of order and 57 waiver motions were made during this period. During the consideration of 15 out of 19 reconciliation measures, the Byrd rule was applied, resulting in 70 points of order and 57 waiver motions. The actions favored those opposing the inclusion of extraneous matter in legislation. The Byrd rule has been applied during the consideration of reconciliation measures, resulting in numerous points of order and waiver motions. The most common basis for points of order was that the provision or amendment did not change outlays or revenues. It has been primarily used during initial consideration of reconciliation measures and only invoked five times during consideration of a conference report. In a conference report, extraneous matters were rejected by the chair, with rulings upheld upon appeal. Motions to appeal were defeated by identical votes. Various instances in 1995, 1997, and 2005 required further amendments between chambers. Points of order and waiver motions under the Byrd rule were more frequent in the 1990s compared to other decades. The mid-1990s were particularly active in this regard. In the 1990s, there were 70 points of order raised and disposed of under the Byrd rule, with 60 being sustained. The most active year was 2010 with 20 points of order and waiver motions. Points of order were successful in striking extraneous matter from legislation and barring consideration of extraneous amendments. In the 1990s, 70 points of order were raised and disposed of under the Byrd rule, with 60 being sustained. The most active year was 2010 with 20 points of order and waiver motions. A total of 57 motions to waive the Byrd rule were offered and disposed of by the Senate, with only nine being approved. Successful waiver motions were used to protect committee-reported language in the bill or language in the conference report. In the 1990s, 70 points of order were raised and disposed of under the Byrd rule, with 60 being sustained. The most active year was 2010 with 20 points of order and waiver motions. A total of 57 motions to waive the Byrd rule were offered and disposed of by the Senate, with only nine being approved. Successful waiver motions were used to protect committee-reported language in the bill or language in the conference report. The Senate exceeded the required 60-vote threshold for motions by an average of nearly 12 votes, with 19 unsuccessful waiver motions garnering at least 51 votes. The two committees would establish a \"deficit reduction account\" as per their instructions. Section 6(b) waived the Byrd rule for legislation reported under a specific procedure. References in Section 6(b) were to legislation that established and extended the Byrd rule before its permanent inclusion in the CBA of 1974. Table 4 provides detailed information on points of order and waiver motions under the Byrd rule from 1985 to 2015. The Senate considered four reconciliation measures without actions under the Byrd rule. In 1985 to 2015, the Senate considered four reconciliation measures without taking actions under the Byrd rule. Notably, in 1989, the Senate used an amendment instead of the Byrd rule to address extraneous matter in a bill. In 2001, no actions were taken under the Byrd rule during consideration of a revenue-reduction measure. The Byrd rule was not invoked during the consideration of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 due to the inclusion of \"sunset\" provisions limiting tax cuts. In 2007, the Byrd rule was not invoked for the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. In 2005, points of order were raised successfully under the Byrd rule for two reconciliation bills, but no actions were taken in 2006 as the Senate completed action on the tax measure. The Senate completed action on the tax measure, with the Byrd rule sometimes causing controversy between the House and Senate. In 1993 and 1994, the rule significantly influenced the reconciliation act and deliberations of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. Senator Pete Domenici inserted a list of potentially extraneous matters in the Congressional Record. The Senate leadership directed a review of S. 1134 to identify provisions violating the Byrd rule, resulting in many deletions during the House-Senate conference stage. Senator James Sasser discussed the process of clarifying and removing items that might be subject to the rule. Senator James Sasser spent over a week clarifying and removing items from the bill that might violate the Byrd rule. Despite some confusion among House colleagues, provisions subject to the rule had to be removed during the House-Senate conference. During House consideration of the conference report, Democratic Members criticized the Byrd rule for stripping out provisions that would have improved the Medicare Program. Representative Dan Rostenkowski expressed concerns about the rule removing over 80 pages of statutory language, including bipartisan-supported minor and technical provisions. Staff wasted time ensuring nothing would upset the Senate, leading to frustration over the rule's impact on legislation. Controversy over the Byrd rule persisted in late 1993 and into 1994, with concerns raised about its impact on the reconciliation process. Representative Martin Olav Sabo criticized the widespread use of the rule as destructive and stated that it distorts the balance of power between the House and Senate. The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress was expected to make recommendations on congressional reform, including changes to the budget process. The Byrd rule, criticized for distorting power balance between House and Senate, requires delegation of power to unelected Congress employees. Chairman Sabo attached documents highlighting problems caused by the rule, including restrictions on reconciliation provisions and drafting techniques. Senate Members recommended clarifying provision in final report on congressional reform. The Organization of Congress recommended making the 'Byrd rule' permanent, requiring sixty votes to waive, and applying it to extraneous matters in a reform bill. House Members did not include recommendations on the Byrd rule in their report or legislation. Chairman Sabo introduced H.R. 4780 to address issues caused by the rule. During the 106th Congress, budget resolutions for FY2000 and FY2001 included reconciliation instructions for substantial revenue reductions totaling $142 billion and $150 billion over five years. No instructions were given for spending reductions. During the 106th Congress, budget resolutions for FY2000 and FY2001 included reconciliation instructions for substantial revenue reductions totaling $142 billion and $150 billion over five years. The use of reconciliation procedures was controversial in the Senate due to concerns about worsening the federal government's fiscal posture. Some Senators argued that reconciliation should only be used to reduce deficits or increase surpluses, while others maintained that reconciliation is neutral in its orientation. The CBA of 1974 focuses on changes in spending and revenue amounts to expedite budget legislation. Senators debated the impact of the Byrd rule on tax-cut legislation, which may run afoul if recommending permanent tax cuts. The Byrd rule was successfully used during the consideration of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999 and the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000. During the first session of the 107th Congress, the Senate debated using reconciliation for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, discussing the inclusion of a 10-year \"sunset\" provision to comply with the Byrd rule. Some Senators argued for permanent tax changes under reconciliation, while others valued the ability to review significant budget policy modifications in the future. The sunset provision was included in the final version of the legislation, as Section 901 of P.L. 107-16. In 2003, the Byrd rule influenced revenue reconciliation directives in the FY2004 budget resolution. House and Senate leaders initially aimed for a conference agreement to reduce revenues through reconciliation by $550 billion for FY2003-FY2013 and $350 billion for the same period, but faced opposition from Senators. The use of dual reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution would allow passage of the budget resolution with the possibility of reaching a compromise on revenue reductions greater than $350 billion. However, passing a revenue reconciliation measure consistent with a $350 billion reduction could violate the Byrd rule if a compromise exceeding $350 billion is later considered. The FY2004 budget resolution instructed committees to reduce revenues by $550 billion over FY2003-FY2013, but a point of order in the Senate limited revenue reductions to $350 billion. Waiving the point of order required a three-fifths vote of the Senate. The FY2004 budget resolution instructed committees to reduce revenues by $550 billion over FY2003-FY2013, but a point of order in the Senate limited revenue reductions to $350 billion. Senator Max Baucus questioned the directive to the committee, whether it should be $350 billion or $550 billion. Ultimately, Senator Charles Grassley agreed to adhere to the $350 billion level in the conference on the reconciliation measure. The reconciliation measure (H.R. 2) in 2003 included $349.7 billion in revenue reductions and became the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. During the 109th Congress, separate revenue and spending reconciliation bills were considered, with a revenue reconciliation bill reducing revenues by up to $70 billion over FY2006-FY2010. The conference agreement on the revenue reconciliation bill, H.R. 4297, recommended significant revenue reduction beyond the budget window. The conferees recommended significant revenue reduction beyond the budget window by extending current capital gains and dividends provisions through December 31, 2010. The total revenue loss over 10 years was estimated at $69.084 billion. The measure became P.L. 109-222, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. President Barack Obama proposed a legislative agenda focusing on health care reform at the beginning of the 111th Congress in 2009. The Democratic leadership in the Senate considered using the reconciliation process for health care reform to avoid a filibuster by Republican opponents. However, concerns were raised about potential challenges under the Byrd rule and other enforcement procedures, which could weaken the legislation. Congressional leaders ultimately decided to pursue health care reform through the regular legislative process, while including reconciliation directives in the FY2010 budget resolution. The Democrats considered using reconciliation for health care reform due to a 60-seat Senate majority. The FY2010 budget resolution included reconciliation directives for health care and education reform. The House and Senate passed separate health care reform bills in late 2009. In early 2010, the Democratic leadership in the Senate faced a dilemma as they no longer held the 60-seat majority necessary to thwart a filibuster for the health care reform legislation. The special election in Massachusetts resulted in a changeover to Republican control of a Senate seat, reducing the Democratic majority to 59 seats. The Democratic leadership faced a dilemma in early 2010 when they no longer had a 60-seat majority in the Senate for health care reform. To resolve this, they passed the Senate version of the legislation and a reconciliation measure to amend it, ensuring a simple majority vote in the Senate. This allowed for comprehensive health care reform without concerns about challenges under the Byrd rule. Additionally, education reform provisions were included in the reconciliation measure. Education reform provisions were included in the reconciliation measure, which was narrower in scope compared to the comprehensive health care reform bill. The House adopted a special rule to clear the bill for the President, passing the reconciliation measure by a close vote. The Senate also passed the measure after considering it over several days, despite Republican opposition and failed attempts to amend the bill. During Senate consideration of the reconciliation measure, several amendments were defeated by points of order raised under the Byrd rule. Senator Judd Gregg successfully raised two points of order, removing provisions related to the Pell grant program. The Senate then returned the measure to the House for further action. The House agreed to a special rule for the consideration of a motion to concur in the Senate amendment to H.R. 4872, clearing the measure for the President. President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law on March 23 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 into law on March 30. Section 313 addresses extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for the removal of extraneous material from a bill or resolution if a point of order is made by a Senator and sustained by the Chair. Extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills are those that do not result in changes to outlays or revenues. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for the removal of extraneous material from a bill or resolution if a point of order is made by a Senator and sustained by the Chair. Extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills are those that do not result in changes to outlays or revenues, as determined by specific criteria outlined in the Act. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for the removal of extraneous material from a bill or resolution if a point of order is made by a Senator and sustained by the Chair. Extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills are those that do not result in changes to outlays or revenues, as determined by specific criteria outlined in the Act, including violations of Section 310(g) and provisions that do not produce a net reduction in the deficit. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for the removal of extraneous material from a bill or resolution if a point of order is made by a Senator and sustained by the Chair. Extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills are those that do not result in changes to outlays or revenues, as determined by specific criteria outlined in the Act, including violations of Section 310(g) and provisions that do not produce a net reduction in the deficit. Provisions must show a reduction in the deficit, substantial reduction in outlays, or increase in revenues in future fiscal years, or have the potential to do so through new regulations, court rulings, or economic triggers. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for the removal of extraneous material from a bill or resolution if a point of order is made by a Senator and sustained by the Chair. Provisions in reconciliation bills must result in changes to outlays or revenues to avoid being considered extraneous. The Committee on the Budget of the Senate is responsible for identifying and listing extraneous materials during the reporting or discharge of a reconciliation bill. The Senate Budget Committee must submit a list of extraneous material in reconciliation bills. The Presiding Officer does not determine extraneousness. Conference reports with extraneous material can be struck if a point of order is sustained. The Senate may consider whether to recede from its amendment and concur with a further amendment or concur in the House amendment with a further amendment. Any motion in the Senate on this matter is debatable for 2 hours. A Senator can raise a point of order if multiple provisions of a bill violate this section. The Presiding Officer may sustain a point of order if provisions of a bill violate a section. If sustained, only those provisions will be struck. Senators can move to waive the point of order before a ruling. The ruling can be appealed by any Senator. If the Presiding Officer rules on a point of order, any Senator can appeal the ruling as it applies to some or all provisions."
