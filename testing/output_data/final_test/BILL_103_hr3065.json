    "content": "The \"Medical Cost Containment Act of 1993\" is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, introducing Section 125A for Medical Care Savings Benefits. The \"Medical Cost Containment Act of 1993\" added Section 125A for Medical Care Savings Benefits to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A medical care savings benefit includes a Health Plan with a Medical Care Savings Account, where a portion of the premium differential from a Qualified Higher Deductible Health Plan is credited to an employee to pay for medical care. Any remaining amount is deposited into a section 408(A) medical care savings account for the participant. Payments from the account balance in a Medical Care Savings Account may be limited to actual contributions. Employers must provide quarterly statements to participating employees. Limitations on benefits are outlined in the section. The maximum annual contribution to a participant's benefit account in a Medical Care Savings Benefit plan is determined by the cost of the Health Plan for the participant's coverage type, plus a cost of living adjustment based on the CPI-Medical cost of living component. If an employer had a Health Plan before adopting the Medical Care Savings Benefit, different rules apply compared to other employers. The contribution limit for a Medical Care Savings Benefit plan is determined based on the 67th percentile of per employee health plan expenditures, adjusted annually for cost of living. The overall contribution cannot exceed the deductible amount of the Qualified Higher Deductible Plan. A Qualified Higher Deductible Plan is a Health Plan that covers benefits beyond a specified deductible limit, not exceeding $5,000 in 1993 and adjusted annually for inflation. Coordination with Health Flexible Spending Accounts is also addressed. Coverage under the health flexible spending account is limited to 100% of the deductible under the Qualified Higher Deductible Plan, minus the amount credited to the Employee's Medical Care Savings Benefit Account. Contributions to Health Plans can be determined based on types of coverage and reasonable classifications of employees. Employees within separate lines of business are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The term 'employee' includes individuals employed by an Employer, including former employees. Types of coverage include self-only and coverage other than self-only. Preventative Health Care allows medical expenses payable from a medical care savings benefit to promote good health. Employees are encouraged to use the medical care savings benefit to promote good health, preventative procedures, and seek second opinions. Policies under this benefit do not duplicate expenses covered by it, and the deductible in the insurance policy may be increased by benefits from other health programs. SEC. 3. MEDICAL CARE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. Amends Chapter 1 by adding a new section for Medical Care Savings Accounts. Medical care savings accounts, also known as Medical IRAs, are trusts created for the exclusive benefit of an individual, their dependents, or beneficiaries. Contributions must be in cash, the trustee must be a bank or insurance company, and trust funds cannot be invested in life insurance contracts. Medical care savings accounts are trusts where funds cannot be invested in life insurance contracts, the individual's interest is nonforfeitable, and assets are not commingled. The accounts are tax-exempt unless they cease to be a medical care savings account, with earnings being taxable. Medical care savings accounts are tax-exempt trusts unless a prohibited transaction occurs, causing the account to lose its exemption and be treated as distributing all its assets. Medical care savings accounts may lose their tax-exempt status if a prohibited transaction occurs, resulting in the account being treated as distributing all its assets. If the account is used as security for a loan, the portion used is considered distributed to the account holder. Additionally, commingling account funds in certain trust or investment funds may have implications. Common trust funds and investment funds holding medical care savings account assets remain tax-exempt even if assets from a tax-exempt trust are included. Distributions from a medical savings account are generally taxable, except for those used for medical expenses as defined by section 213(d). Distributions from a medical savings account are subject to a 10 percent additional tax for early withdrawals before age 59\\1/2\\. Rollover contributions can be made without being included in gross income if certain requirements are met. The individual must ensure that any payment or distribution from a medical care savings account is deposited into their account within 60 days to avoid penalties. This rule does not apply if the individual has received similar payments within the past year. Additionally, inherited accounts are not eligible for rollover treatment. Inherited medical savings accounts are exempt from certain rules, including the exclusion of amounts received and the treatment as a medical care savings account for rollover contribution purposes. Inherited medical savings accounts are exempt from certain rules, including rollover contributions. The term 'bank' for subsection (a)(2) includes a bank, insured credit union, and a corporation under state laws. A corporation subject to state banking laws and supervision is exempt from certain rules. The amendments made by this Act will apply to years starting after December 31, 1993. This Act does not change the current tax treatment of employer-provided coverage under accident and health plans."
