The \"Small Business Welfare Benefits Protection Act\" amends the exception for 10-or-more employer plans by specifying that a plan does not maintain an experience-rating arrangement if all plan assets are available as a single pool for all covered employees. Additionally, benefits must be available to all covered employees under the same formula for the exception to apply. The plan benefits all employees aged 21 or older, working 1,000 hours annually, with at least 1 year of service. Benefit formulas must provide a uniform multiple of compensation for all participants, except for highly compensated employees who may receive lower benefits. Upon employer termination, all eligible employees are covered. The plan ensures that all eligible employees receive a share of assets and benefit payments, including former eligible employees terminated within 24 months of employer termination. There must be a ratio of non-owner employees to owner-employees participating in the plan, with at least 3 non-owner employees for each owner-employee. The distribution of benefits and plan assets in a 10 or more employer plan is subject to certain conditions, including no assets reverting to any employer, no loans to employees, and restrictions on terminating employer participation in the trust. The distribution of benefits and plan assets in a 10 or more employer plan is subject to conditions such as all employees receiving a pro rata share of benefits, limitations on severance benefits, and restrictions on employer participation in the trust. In 10 or more employer plans, plan assets for post-retirement medical benefits can only be used for those benefits. If a participant dies before using all benefits, the unused amounts go back to the trust. If a business owner leaves the plan due to specific events, assets for post-retirement medical benefits must be handled accordingly. In 10 or more employer plans, assets for post-retirement medical benefits must remain in the plan until paid out as medical expense reimbursements. Rollover to a similar plan is allowed, and benefit limitations apply, including minimum death benefit amounts. The benefit amounts are determined by the plan formula or the minimum issue amounts set by the life insurance provider. Severance benefits are capped at 200 percent of annual compensation not exceeding the limit under section 401(a)(17). Post-retirement medical benefits cannot be paid before normal retirement age, which is the year of eligibility for Medicare. Assets funding post-retirement medical benefits revert to the plan if not paid prior to death to a participating eligible employee. Assets used to fund post-retirement medical benefits are payable to the estate of a deceased eligible participating employee to pay any uncovered medical expenses of the deceased employee participant's estate. Deductions for contributions to a 10 or more employer plan trust shall not exceed for insured death benefits. The plan trustee is the sole life insurance policy owner for insured death benefits, with different premium types based on the type of insurance policy. Severance benefits are determined using actuarial principles to fund the purchase of assets. The plan trustee uses actuarial principles to fund the purchase of benefits, with restrictions on excess funding and forfeiture of contributions in certain circumstances. The amendment allows for the forfeiture of contributions in certain circumstances, with a provision for the use of assets in a nondiscriminatory manner for participating employees in a 10 or more employer plan. The effective date of the amendment is upon the first committee action, with a 24-month compliance period for plans to adjust contributions to the new rules."
