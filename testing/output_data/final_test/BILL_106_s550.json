    "content": "The Act titled \"State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1999\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to tax enforcement. Congress finds that the United States Supreme Court has established States' right to collect State taxes on purchases from Indian tribes, but this has been impeded by tribal immunity claims. Failure of tribes or tribal members to collect State taxes is also noted. The United States Supreme Court has affirmed States' right to collect State taxes from Indian tribes, but tribal immunity claims have hindered this. Failure of tribes or tribal members to collect State taxes deprives States of essential revenue needed for infrastructure improvements and citizen welfare, creating a disadvantage for non-tribal businesses and potentially forcing some out of business. The United States Supreme Court has affirmed States' right to collect State taxes from Indian tribes, but tribal immunity claims have hindered this. Failure to collect State taxes deprives States of essential revenue needed for infrastructure improvements and citizen welfare, creating a disadvantage for non-tribal businesses. Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code is amended to allow Indian tribes to collect qualified state taxes on goods or services like tobacco products and motor fuel. The definition of Indian tribe includes governing bodies and tribal corporations, addressing issues of tribal immunity hindering state tax collection. The term 'qualified State tax' refers to nondiscriminatory excise, sales, or transaction taxes imposed by a State on purchases from a tribal retail enterprise by non-tribal members. Exceptions apply if the tribal retail enterprise existed before the State Excise, Sales, and Transaction Tax Enforcement Act of 1999. The tribal retail enterprise is exempt from collecting and remitting state tax if the associated Indian tribe imposes an equivalent tax. The tribal retail enterprise may be exempt from state tax if there is an agreement between the enterprise and a State that exempts it from the tax. The term 'tribal retail enterprise' refers to any entity owned or operated by an Indian tribe or member of an Indian tribe engaged in business. Tribal immunity is the immunity of an Indian tribe from federal court jurisdiction or judicial review. The owner or operator of a tribal retail enterprise must collect and remit applicable state taxes. States can seek declaratory judgments on tax applicability or legality in district courts. States can also take legal action against tribal retail enterprises or the Indian tribe or member operating them. In district court, tribal retail enterprises must comply with state tax collection. Tribal immunity can be waived for legal actions to enforce tax collection. The amendments made by section 3 apply to sales of goods or services under section 1362(b) of title 28, US Code, after the enactment of this Act."
