    "content": "The \"Protecting Veterans Credit Act of 2018\" aims to address inaccurate reporting of medical debt in consumer reports of veterans resulting from delayed or inappropriate payments for non-Department of Veterans Affairs medical services. The \"Protecting Veterans Credit Act of 2018\" defines veteran's medical debt as medical collection debt owed to non-VA healthcare providers submitted to the VA for payment. It also includes debt wrongfully charged by the VA. The Act excludes veteran's medical debt from credit reporting. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include provisions related to a veteran's medical debt, such as information on medical services rendered within one year and fully paid or settled debts. This amendment aligns with the Protecting Veterans Credit Act of 2018, which defines and excludes veteran's medical debt from credit reporting. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include provisions regarding a veteran's medical debt, such as the right to dispute the debt's inclusion and the removal of such debt from consumer reports. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to allow veterans to dispute their medical debt with the Department of Veterans Affairs for inclusion on consumer reports. The Department of Veterans Affairs must notify a veteran within 30 days of assuming liability for their medical debt. Consumer reporting agencies must delete all information related to the veteran's medical debt from their file within 30 days of receiving proof of liability, at no cost to the veteran. SEC. 4. VERIFICATION OF VETERAN'S MEDICAL DEBT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a database for consumer reporting agencies to verify veteran's medical debts within one year of the Act's enactment. The database features will be overseen by the Secretary to ensure accurate verification. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a database to provide consumer reporting agencies with detailed information to verify veteran's medical debts, access to verification data in a secure electronic format, timely access to information, and other features promoting efficient delivery. Security and confidentiality measures will be ensured in maintaining and accessing the database. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a database for consumer reporting agencies to verify veteran's medical debts. Stakeholder input will be sought before establishing the database, and once fully functional, consumer reporting agencies must use it to identify a veteran's medical debt. The amendments made by this Act will take effect one year after its enactment."
