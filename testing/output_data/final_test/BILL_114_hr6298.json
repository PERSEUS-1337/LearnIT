The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has systematically targeted Israel with politically motivated assaults on its legitimacy, including a commercial boycott at its 31st session in 2016. Congress has a history of combating anti-Israel boycotts and discriminatory activities. The recent action of the UNHRC is reminiscent of the Arab League Boycott, promoting a boycott against Israel and companies trading with Israel. Congress passed anti-boycott legislation to combat discriminatory activities. Congress recently passed anti-boycott measures in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. These measures oppose boycott, divestment, and sanctions targeting Israel and require the US to use trade negotiations to combat such activities. Reporting requirements on foreign countries or international organizations' actions are also included. The recent anti-boycott measures passed by Congress oppose trade barriers imposed by foreign countries or international organizations on US companies in or with Israel. Congress opposes the UN Human Rights Council resolution urging countries to pressure companies to divest from Israel and create a blacklist, viewing it as a boycott of Israel. Additional prohibitions on foreign boycotts are outlined in the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Administration Act of 1979 opposes restrictive trade practices or boycotts imposed by foreign countries or international governmental organizations against the United States or its citizens. The Export Administration Act of 1979 opposes restrictive trade practices or boycotts imposed by foreign countries or international governmental organizations against Israel or countries friendly to the United States. The Export Administration Act of 1979 opposes foreign boycotts imposed by international governmental organizations against Israel or countries friendly to the United States. The Export Administration Act of 1979 prohibits support for any boycott imposed by international governmental organizations against Israel or friendly countries. The Export Administration Act of 1979 prohibits support for boycotts imposed by international governmental organizations against Israel or friendly countries, and requests to impose restrictive trade practices or boycotts by foreign countries. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include fines for violations of section 8(a) and its regulations, orders, or licenses. These amendments take effect upon enactment and apply to actions taken after the enactment date. SEC. 5 amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit actions opposing Israel. SEC. 6 provides a rule of construction. SEC. 6 clarifies that the Act and its amendments are focused on countering boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israel, without affecting U.S. policy on Arab-Israel conflict issues. SEC. 7 of the Act defines \"boycott of, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel\" as politically motivated actions intended to penalize or limit commercial relations with Israel or Israeli-controlled territories. \"Politically motivated\" refers to actions that aim to coerce political action or impose policy positions on Israel."
