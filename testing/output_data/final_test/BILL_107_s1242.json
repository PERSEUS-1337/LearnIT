    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Consumer Credit Score Disclosure Act of 2001\" and includes definitions. Section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include definitions related to credit scores for consumer credit applications secured by a dwelling. The term 'credit score' refers to a numerical value predicting credit behaviors, excluding mortgage scores or automated underwriting system ratings. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to include definitions related to credit scores for consumer credit applications secured by a dwelling, considering factors beyond credit information such as loan-to-value ratio, down payment amount, or financial assets. Key factors affecting credit scores are listed in order of importance. Consumer reporting agencies are required to disclose credit scores under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Consumer reporting agencies must disclose credit scores for consumer credit applications secured by a dwelling, including the current score, possible score range, key adverse factors, score creation date, and the entity providing the score. Consumer reporting agencies are not required to provide credit scores if they do not typically distribute scores used for real estate credit or develop scores to help creditors assess general creditworthiness. Consumer reporting agencies are not obligated to disclose credit scores unless requested by the consumer. Consumer reporting agencies are required to provide consumers with their credit file upon request, and if the consumer asks for the credit file but not the credit score, they must also be informed that they can request and obtain a credit score. The agency must supply the consumer with a credit score derived from a widely distributed credit scoring model in connection with any credit secured by a dwelling, or a credit score that helps the consumer understand the credit scoring assessment. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires consumer reporting agencies to provide consumers with their credit file upon request, including a credit score that helps understand credit scoring assessment and predictions about future credit behavior. Section 609(a)(1) of the Act is amended to clarify exceptions. Users of credit scores have specific duties outlined in Section 4. Users of credit scores have specific duties outlined in Section 4, including providing disclosures to consumers who use credit scores for securing credit for consumer purposes. Users of credit scores must provide specific disclosures to consumers if they obtained the credit score information from a third party. This includes providing a copy of the credit score information and a notice explaining credit scores, their use, and the data sources used to generate them. This requirement does not mandate the user to explain the information to the consumer. The obligation of a user of a credit score is limited to providing a copy of the information received from the consumer reporting, excluding certain disclosures and limitations on the number of disclosures per credit transaction. The Fair Credit Reporting Act limits the liability of credit score users for information received from consumer reporting agencies. Section 615 is amended to include credit scores. SEC. 5. CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to void any contract provision prohibiting the disclosure of a credit score. Users of credit scores are not liable for disclosing them. SEC. 6. RELATION TO STATE LAWS. SEC. 6. RELATION TO STATE LAWS. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to include new subparagraphs related to the disclosure of credit scores by consumer reporting agencies and the duties of users to disclose credit score information to consumers. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment."
