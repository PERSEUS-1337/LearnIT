The Joint Resolution approved on March 24, 1976 is amended to include a new section regarding the labeling of textile fiber and other products. No product can be labeled as 'Made in USA' unless specific criteria are met, including fair wages and compliance with labor laws. The amended Joint Resolution of March 24, 1976 includes a new section on labeling textile fiber products. Products must meet criteria such as fair wages and compliance with labor laws to be labeled as 'Made in USA'. The section also prohibits the use of indentured servitude in the production of textile fiber products. Noncompliance results in misbranding under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. The term 'servitude' in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands refers to labor under an employment contract with a sole employer who controls the worker's stay. Termination of the contract occurs if the employer is displeased, leading to the worker leaving the Commonwealth. \"SEC. 8. MINIMUM WAGE.\" Section 503(c) of the Covenant states that the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage provisions apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The minimum wage starts at $3.55 per hour and increases by $1.00 every six months. The minimum wage in the Mariana Islands will be equal to the rate set in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and will increase as necessary to remain equal to that rate. \"SEC. 9. CONDITIONS FOR DUTY-FREE AND QUOTA-FREE TREATMENT.\" Conditions for products from the Northern Mariana Islands to enter the US customs territory include paying workers fair wages, complying with federal labor laws, not employing individuals under indentured servitude.

Penalties will be imposed on exporters who willfully falsify information. If an exporter willfully falsifies information about the origin of a product from the Northern Mariana Islands, duty-free treatment will be denied for 2 years. Definitions for direct labor and indentured servitude are provided in this section. An indentured alien worker in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is bound by an employment contract with a specific employer who controls their stay. If the worker displeases the employer, the contract is terminated, and the worker must leave the Commonwealth. \"SEC. 10. APPLICABILITY OF IMMIGRATION LAWS.\" Section 506 of the Covenant applies Immigration and Nationality Act to the Northern Mariana Islands as if it were a State, superseding local laws on alien admission and removal. The Attorney General can adjust the status of certain aliens to lawful permanent residence. The Attorney General can adjust the status of certain aliens in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to lawful permanent residence if they meet specific criteria, including being physically present in the Commonwealth, being admissible to the United States, demonstrating good moral character, not engaging in unauthorized employment, and maintaining lawful status. The Attorney General can adjust the status of certain aliens in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to lawful permanent residence if they demonstrate exceptional hardship, were authorized to work in the Northern Mariana Islands, or are the spouse or child of such an alien. The Attorney General can adjust the status of certain aliens in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to lawful permanent residence without reducing immigrant visas or charging fees. The definitions in the Immigration and Nationality Act apply, and this provision does not affect the Attorney General's authority in immigration matters. Eligibility for permanent residence under this provision does not prevent seeking status under other laws. The United States-Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Human Dignity Act allows certain aliens in the Northern Mariana Islands to adjust their status to lawful permanent residence. This provision does not affect the Attorney General's immigration authority and does not prevent seeking status under other laws.

The contractor or subcontractor must pay all employed mechanics and laborers. The subcontractor must pay all employed mechanics and laborers directly on the work site, at least once a week, without any deductions, at wage rates specified in the contract. The contractor must post the wage scale at the work site in English and the workers' predominant language. Accrued payments may be withheld from the contractor as necessary. The contracting officer may withhold accrued payments from the contractor to ensure that laborers and mechanics are paid the required wage rates specified in the contract, and not the lower rates they actually receive. SEC. 6. STUDY; REPORT. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study on human and labor rights violations in the Northern Mariana Islands, including forced labor. A report on the study's results must be submitted to the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources within one year. Local officials and organizations involved in human and labor rights may be consulted during the study. The amendments made by this Act will not change the requirements of the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act."
