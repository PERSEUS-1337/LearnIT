The \"Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2005\" repeals the windfall elimination provision and introduces a new formula for calculating benefits for individuals with non-covered employment, specifically addressing those who become eligible for monthly periodic payments after 1985. The \"Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2005\" repeals the windfall elimination provision and introduces a new formula for calculating benefits for individuals with non-covered employment, specifically addressing those who become eligible for monthly periodic payments after 1985. The primary insurance amount of an individual's concurrent entitlement to monthly periodic payments and old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be computed or recomputed under this paragraph, excluding certain types of payments. The Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2005 introduces a new formula for calculating benefits for individuals with non-covered employment. The primary insurance amount of an individual's concurrent entitlement to monthly periodic payments and old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be computed or recomputed under this paragraph. The Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2005 introduces a new formula for calculating benefits for individuals with non-covered employment. An individual's primary insurance amount is determined by multiplying their primary insurance amount from paragraph (1) by a fraction of their average indexed monthly earnings, rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10. The individual's average indexed monthly earnings for determining insurance amount is based on all service performed after 1950, excluding noncovered service as a member of a uniformed service. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish a method for calculating wages from post-1950 service for this purpose. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish a method for calculating wages from post-1950 service for the purpose of determining insurance amount, including reliance on employment records and other information to secure evidence of earnings for noncovered service. The Commissioner of Social Security may accept reasonable extrapolations as evidence of earnings for noncovered service if satisfactory evidence is not available. Other federal agencies are authorized to provide employment records and information to assist the Commissioner in performing their functions. The Commissioner of Social Security may accept reasonable extrapolations as evidence of earnings for noncovered service if satisfactory evidence is not available, including written attestations corroborated by another individual or average earnings information for the same period. The Commissioner of Social Security may accept reasonable extrapolations as evidence of earnings for noncovered service if satisfactory evidence is not available. If requirements are not met, the primary insurance amount will be computed under a different subparagraph. The primary insurance amount for an individual is computed under different subparagraphs, with adjustments made for noncovered service performed after 1956. The primary insurance amount for an individual is determined based on the proportionate number of years of noncovered service and entitlement to monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The amount is calculated as the larger of two computed amounts, with a specified percentage based on the year of eligibility. The primary insurance amount for an individual is determined based on the proportionate number of years of noncovered service and entitlement to monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The amount is calculated as the larger of two computed amounts, with a specified percentage based on the year of eligibility. Any periodic payment meeting requirements but paid on a non-monthly basis will be allocated as a monthly payment equivalent. If a payment is reduced for a survivor's benefit, it will be deemed as such. For individuals with 30 years or more of coverage, this paragraph does not apply. For those with more than 20 years but less than 30 years of coverage, the specified percentage for calculation purposes will be adjusted accordingly. Periodic payments include lump sum payments if they substitute for regular payments. For individuals with less than 30 years of coverage, the applicable percentage for calculation decreases as the number of years of coverage decreases. The term 'year of coverage' is defined as provided in paragraph (1)(C)(ii), with adjustments for calculation purposes. The primary insurance amount is calculated based on the number of years of coverage, with adjustments for individuals with less than 30 years of coverage. The calculation percentage decreases as the years of coverage decrease. Certain exceptions apply, such as for individuals covered under specific agreements or employed by nonprofit organizations without a waiver certificate. The text discusses the extension of social security coverage to employees of organizations without a waiver certificate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Amendments were made to ensure coverage for employees previously covered under terminated waiver certificates. Conforming amendments were also made to section 215(d)(3) of the Act. Amendments were made to section 215(f)(9)(A) of the Act to update subparagraph references. The amendments made by this Act will apply to monthly insurance benefits starting from the 12th month after the enactment date. The Commissioner of Social Security will adjust primary insurance amounts as needed to implement the changes."
