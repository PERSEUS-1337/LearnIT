    "content": "Since the 18th century, prizes have been offered by various organizations to reward achievements in science and technology. Napoleon's government offered a prize for food preservation technology, which was won by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois Appert in 1809 for his method of canning food. In 1919, businessman Raymond Orteig offered a prize for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris, won by Charles Lindbergh in 1927. The Orteig Prize is credited with advancing commercial aviation. The Orteig Prize in 1927 advanced commercial aviation and inspired the Ansari X-Prize over 70 years later to lower the risk and cost of commercial space travel. Prizes can be categorized into innovation inducement prizes and recognition prizes, with the former aiming to encourage scientific and technical goals. Prize competitions discussed in this report focus on innovation inducement prizes, which are seen as a complement to federal support for research and innovation. Prizes are seen as a complement to federal grants and procurement contracts, offering advantages such as attracting a wider range of participants, leveraging financial resources, shifting risks to contestants, and educating the public. During the Obama Administration, prize competitions were described as beneficial for the federal government, allowing payment only for success, establishing ambitious goals without predicting the winning team, increasing diversity in problem-solving, stimulating private-sector investment, and maximizing taxpayer dollars. Prize competitions are seen as valuable tools for federal agencies, with potential high payoffs if properly designed. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 allows federal agencies to conduct prize competitions to stimulate innovation. Key aspects of successful prize competitions include determining the right cash prize size, transparent rules, and proper treatment of intellectual property rights. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, amended by P.L. 111-358, defines prize competitions for federal agencies, addressing liability, intellectual property, judging, and funding sources. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329) allows agencies to request funds for prize competitions from various entities. Federal agencies are required to advertise prize competitions widely to encourage broad participation, including publishing a notice on a government website. The notice must include the subject of the competition, rules for participation, registration process, prize purse amount, and winner selection process. Eligibility to win a federal prize is also outlined. To be eligible to win a federal prize competition, individuals or groups must be US citizens or permanent residents, not federal employees, and comply with all competition rules. Private entities must be US-based and meet competition requirements. Participants must register, assume risks, and waive claims. Liability insurance is required, but can be waived by the agency. The government cannot gain an interest in the prize. A federal agency can waive the insurance requirement for a prize competition. The government cannot gain an interest in intellectual property without the participant's written consent. Judges must be appointed transparently and without conflicts of interest. Funding for competitions can come from federal, state, local, or private-sector entities. Federal agencies can solicit funds from various sources and must have all funds appropriated before announcing a competition. Federal agencies can partner with private-sector or government entities to administer federal prize competitions. Prizes over $50 million require 30 days notice to Congress. Awards over $1 million need agency head approval. The OSTP Director must report biennially to Congress on prize competition use. Some agencies, like the Department of Defense, have explicit authority for prize competitions. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Department of Energy have the authority to award prizes for research and technology development that can benefit the military missions and energy-related missions, respectively. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy were granted this authority through specific legislation. The Department of Energy was authorized to conduct the Hydrogen Prize and the Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize to stimulate innovation in hydrogen energy technologies and solid-state lighting products. NASA was granted the authority to award cash prizes to stimulate innovation in research and technology. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) were authorized to award cash prizes for promoting innovation and research in various fields, including biodefense medical countermeasures and biomedical science advancements. In 2007, the America COMPETES Act authorized NSF to create prize competitions for basic research. In 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act allowed DOT to use funds for research prize competitions. In 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act directed DOC to conduct prize competitions to accelerate innovation. The America COMPETES Act authorized federal agencies to conduct prize competitions to improve spectrum efficiency. The number of active prize competitions has increased over time, with a total of 63 in FY2016. The total amount of prize money offered by federal agencies has also increased. The amount of prize money offered by federal agencies has increased over time, with a total of $247,000 in FY2011 and over $30 million in FY2016. The average value of prize money offered by competitions has also increased significantly. More than half of prize competitions were conducted in partnership with other entities. The broad partnerships in prize competitions under P.L. 111-358 are highlighted by OSTP. Federal agencies have increasingly utilized prize competitions to spur innovation and achieve their missions. Under P.L. 111-358, 73% of competitions engaged in formal partnerships, compared to 30% under other authorities. Since 2010, over 840 prize competitions have been held, offering $280 million in prize money. However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness and impact of these competitions, with only a small number being evaluated. Members of Congress may conduct oversight to gain insight into existing federal prize competitions. Federal agencies have increasingly used prize competitions to drive innovation and achieve their goals. However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness and impact of these competitions. Questions for congressional consideration include whether the technology or innovation would have been developed without the competition, if it shortened the development timeframe, and if it was cost-effective. Other considerations include the benefits gained, comparing to traditional tools like grants or contracts, potential for more effective designs, and appropriate metrics for success evaluation. According to a 2017 report, measurement, assessment, and learning are crucial for successful prize competitions. Experts agree that both quantitative and qualitative information is needed to assess success. Members of Congress may examine metrics and data collected on federal prize competitions, including efforts to standardize data collection. The design and implementation of prize competitions are seen as crucial for success, with federal agencies increasing expertise in this area. In FY2016, 8 agencies had department-wide policies on prize competitions, 5 had dedicated personnel, and 10 had distributed networks of prize managers. In FY2016, federal agencies increased expertise in prize competitions with department-wide policies, dedicated personnel, and distributed networks of prize managers. GSA facilitated a federal community of practice and published a prize and challenges toolkit. InnoCentive advocates for outsourcing prize competition design and administration to support innovation management industry growth in the private sector. Members of Congress may want to establish new federal prize competitions through legislation, considering whether the legislation should be general or specific in outlining prize goals and competition instructions for federal agencies. The curr_chunk provides detailed instructions to federal agencies regarding prize competitions, including timeframe, award amount, participant eligibility, administration, contest rules, judges, intellectual property rights, liability, and program evaluation. It raises questions about the prize topic, selection process, program goals, technological advancement, education, public awareness, time limits, monetary awards, publicity, intermediary prizes, and eligibility criteria for participants. The curr_chunk discusses key questions regarding the administration of prize competitions, including eligibility of federal agencies, foreign entities, program administration, judging criteria, and success metrics. It emphasizes the importance of input from the science and technology community and experienced administrators. In the 115th Congress, over 20 bills have been introduced to authorize prize competitions in federal agencies, reflecting the evolving state of science and engineering. See the appendix for a list of proposed legislation and recent actions taken."
