    "content": "The U.S. Constitution grants Congress powers over the Armed Forces, including the ability to regulate military forces. Congressional oversight of Department of Defense policies intensified in 2004 due to concerns about military sexual assault. Senator E. Benjamin Nelson expressed alarm over reports of sexual assaults on service women and the military's inadequate response to victims' needs. The military systems failed to respond to victims' needs, especially women facing sexual attacks. Congress enacted laws to address sexual assaults in the military, with over 100 provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act since 2004. The potential threat of sexual violence against military servicemembers has been a topic of debate regarding women serving in the military and combat roles, as well as registering for selective service. Incidents of military sexual misconduct have garnered congressional attention, highlighting the internal threat of assault within the military. In 2003, a sexual assault scandal at the Air Force Academy brought public attention to sexual assault in a training environment. Allegations of sexual assaults in combat theaters raised concerns about the prevalence of sexual violence. More men than women in the military report experiences with unwanted sexual contact. The exposure of sexist comments and nonconsensual sharing of explicit images among the Marines United social media group has also been a concern. The sharing of sexually explicit images in the Marines United social media group raised concerns in Congress about the impact of service culture on sexism and sexual violence. Sexual violence is a widespread issue, with national surveys suggesting high rates of assault in the civilian sector. Congress is interested in addressing society-wide issues through legal reforms, but unique aspects of military service may require different policy solutions. Sexual assault in the military can have severe physical and psychological effects on victims, especially when the perpetrator is within the same unit. The impact extends beyond the assault itself, affecting the victim's community and work environment. This can impair unit cohesion and ultimately impact mission success. Military sexual assault requires unique policy solutions due to the distinct nature of the military justice system. Since 2006, Congress has made significant changes to the UCMJ articles regarding major criminal sexual violence offenses in the military. DOD policies define sexual assault as intentional sexual contact involving force, threats, or abuse of authority. This report focuses on sexual assaults involving uniformed servicemembers as victims or perpetrators, including active component members, cadets, midshipmen, and Reserve Component members. The Department of Veterans Affairs handles health care needs for former servicemembers with trauma related to military sexual assault, often termed Military Sexual Trauma (MST). This report does not address policies and programs specific to the U.S. Coast Guard or sexual assault at the Merchant Marine Academy. The Marine Academy, under the Department of Transportation, is included in congressional efforts to combat sexual harassment in the military. The process for handling sexual harassment complaints within the Department of Defense is separate from sexual assault allegation processes. Sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination and falls under DOD military equal opportunity policies overseen by the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity. CRS offers a framework for analysis and oversight to help congressional staff understand the legislative and policy landscape, link proposed policy solutions with potential impact metrics, and identify possible gaps that remain unaddressed in the area of military sexual assault. Congressional oversight on military sexual assault can be categorized into DOD management and accountability, prevention, victim protection and support, and military justice and investigations. DOD management involves organizing and evaluating prevention efforts. Prevention aims to reduce sexual assaults in the Armed Forces. Victim protection focuses on supporting victims post-assault. Military justice addresses holding perpetrators accountable. The Secretary of Defense has authority over the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense has authority over the Department of Defense, including developing military personnel policies and programs. Congress has shown interest in the effectiveness of DOD's sexual assault prevention and response initiatives, questioning accountability, organization, and data collection processes. The Secretary of Defense established the Care for Victims of Sexual Assault Task Force in response to allegations of sexual assault from servicemembers in Iraq and Kuwait. The Task Force found inconsistencies in sexual assault prevention and reporting policies across military services, leading to the recommendation for a single defense-wide point of accountability. In October 2004, the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response was established to develop a new DOD-wide sexual assault policy as directed by Congress. The FY2005 NDAA established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) under the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services (SAMS). The SAMS Task Force made recommendations in December 2009 to enhance DOD SAPR programs and policies, including improving coordination among stakeholders and staff expertise levels in SAPRO. The task force recommended revising the SAPRO structure to appoint a director at the general or flag officer level, active duty military personnel from each Service, and an experienced judge advocate. Subtitle A of the FY2011 NDAA formalized the role and functions of the SAPR office and programs, with statutory requirements and roles outlined in Section 1611. The SAPRO Director oversees the implementation of the comprehensive policy for the Department of Defense sexual assault prevention and response program. The FY2012 NDAA formalized the Department of Defense sexual assault prevention and response program, requiring officers from each Service to be assigned to the SAPRO office. The law also mandated that the SAPRO director be a general or flag officer. The SAMS Task Force 2009 report recommended creating a comprehensive sexual assault prevention strategy for standardization and coordination. The FY2011 NDAA mandated the development of a sexual assault prevention and response strategy by the Department of Defense. The plan included five key areas: Prevention, Investigation, Accountability, Victim Assistance and Advocacy, and Assessment. The strategic plan was updated in January 2015 and December 2016. The Department of Defense updated its strategic plan in 2015 and 2016 for 2017-2021, including measurable metrics and non-metrics to assess progress in sexual assault prevention and response. These metrics are used for data gathering and reporting, supporting oversight by DOD leaders and Congress. Non-metrics focus on descriptive aspects of the military justice process. The military justice process is addressed in the non-metrics used for data gathering and reporting. Congressional oversight can be aided by these non-metrics, which may indicate potential issues or trends within the military justice system. In 2015, Congress required the Department of Defense to develop a plan to prevent and respond to cases of male sexual assault in the military. The Department of Defense (DOD) released a plan in August 2016 to address male sexual assault in the military. The plan includes objectives such as developing a communications plan, improving understanding of sexual assault against men, ensuring support services meet male victims' needs, and developing metrics to assess prevention and response efforts. A working group has been established to oversee progress, and DOD provides annual reports to Congress on sexual assault data. The SAMS Task Force report in 2009 highlighted issues with data precision and terminology inconsistencies in DOD's annual reporting. Recommendations were made for improvements, leading to statutory changes in reporting requirements over the past decade. Congress mandated additional case details in FY2013 and analysis of sexual assault offenses in FY2015. Stakeholders use the annual report to analyze trends and evaluate the effectiveness of the SAPR program. Gathering data on sexual assault prevalence and trends is challenging due to underreporting, with only 34% of rapes and sexual assaults reported to police in 2014. Reasons for underreporting include embarrassment, lack of trust in the justice system, and fear of reprisals. Comparisons of military sexual assault statistics are cautioned against by some researchers. Some researchers caution against comparing military sexual assault statistics with civilian data due to differences in population demographics and risk factors. Inconsistent terminology and metrics among organizations make data collection and analysis challenging. For example, the FBI's previous definition of forcible rape excluded male victims and other sexual offenses. The Government Accountability Office highlighted these difficulties in a 2016 report. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed inconsistencies in defining and collecting data on sexual assault across federal agencies like DOD, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Justice. These agencies have multiple data collection efforts with varying terminology, measurements, and methodology, leading to challenges in standardization. DOD's definitions and data collection methods for sexual assault have changed over time, prompting the need for a uniform definition mandated by Section 577 of the FY2005 NDAA. Changes to the UCMJ in 2012 affected categorization of incidents, creating challenges for comparisons over time. DOD uses surveys, focus groups, and the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) to collect and manage sexual assault data. Congressional actions in 2004 required DOD to enhance the collection of reported sexual assault incident data, leading to the implementation of a centralized database. The Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) was implemented in 2012 to collect and maintain information on sexual assaults in the Armed Forces. It tracks reported incidents, case details, and outcomes of legal proceedings. DSAID serves as a case management system, supports victims, and facilitates program administration for SAPR programs. The Defense Assault Incident Database Form is used to collect sexual assault incident data, completed by a SAPR responder. Victims can choose to submit a restricted or unrestricted report, with personally identifiable information included in the latter. The GAO conducted a review in 2016, and DOD plans to spend $8.5 million to improve DSAID. DOD plans to spend $8.5 million over fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to improve DSAID, with a total expenditure of approximately $31.5 million since its initial development. Surveys and focus groups are used to collect data on sexual violence prevalence and attitudes, providing feedback on prevention and response programs. Additional surveys for sexual assault victims have been introduced to understand their experiences with support programs and military processes. NDAA mandates include gender and assault in servicemember surveys on harassment and discrimination. The FY2013 NDAA mandated surveys on sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination in the military every two years. DOD's Office of People Analytics administers the Workplace and Gender Relations Survey to measure prevalence. However, the survey has limitations and cannot accurately reflect the number of sexual assault incidents. The Workplace and Gender Relations Survey measures unwanted sexual conduct but does not align with UCMJ definitions of sexual assault. DOD contracted with RAND Corporation to review the survey methodology and assess sexual assault and harassment. RAND conducted two surveys to assess sexual assault, harassment, and gender discrimination in the military. The new survey methodology found a higher number of self-reported assaults, especially penetrative sexual assaults, with a significant increase in the number of assaults reported by men. The FY2016 survey by RAND showed a large difference in the number of assaults reported by men compared to previous surveys. Men were more likely to label sexual assaults as \"hazing.\" To be classified as a sexual assault, three criteria must be met: specific actions by the perpetrator, intent behaviors, and coercive mechanisms. Prevalence rates in 2016 were 4.3% for women and 0.6% for men, slightly lower than rates in 2014. The 2016 WGRA survey by DOD addressed higher rates of sexual assault in LGBT populations compared to non-LGBT members. Section 532 of the FY2007 NDAA required annual assessments of service academy policies on sexual harassment and violence. The military conducts focus groups at academies every other year to supplement annual assessments. Starting in 2015, focus groups for active duty servicemembers were included in the assessment cycle. The Survivor Experience Survey (SES) began in 2014 to gather information on sexual assault survivors' awareness and experiences with DOD's reporting process and support services. The Military Investigation and Justice Survey (MIJES) is an anonymous survey conducted by DOD to gather feedback from sexual assault survivors on their experiences with SAPR victim assistance, the military health system, and the military justice process. It was first administered between August 31 and December 4, 2015, and continues to be administered on a rolling basis. The MIJES survey focuses on military servicemembers who reported sexual assault and had the case closed during a specific time period. The QSAPR survey evaluates the effectiveness of DOD's sexual assault responder programs by gathering feedback from SARCs and VAs. The survey aims to capture the experiences and perspectives of sexual assault responders to identify resource needs and assess program effectiveness. The report discusses primary prevention of sexual assault, focusing on population-based and system-level strategies to prevent sexual violence. The CDC identifies four types of risk factors that contribute to the initiation of sexual violence. The CDC has identified four types of risk factors correlated with sexual assault: individual, relationship, community, and societal. Despite a \"zero tolerance\" philosophy in the military, the potential for assault exists due to individuals' diverse backgrounds shaping their attitudes and behaviors. The Department of Defense (DOD) focuses on reducing risk factors for sexual assault through prevention actions. Congressional concerns include the training and accountability of military leaders in developing a culture that reduces these risk factors. Additionally, questions arise about the timeliness and effectiveness of sexual assault prevention training programs in the military, as well as the screening and deterrence of potential perpetrators. The military's organizational culture varies across services and within services by occupational specialty. Command climate at the unit level plays a significant role in shaping organizational culture. Policy changes to improve culture are initiated at a DOD-wide level, but implementation is the responsibility of unit commanders. Commanders may face unique community risk factors for sexual violence. Research suggests that workplace culture is crucial in sexual assault prevention within the military. Factors such as unit makeup, gender composition, and types of units can contribute to environments conducive to sexual harassment and assault. It is essential for sexual assault response coordinators and victim advocates to collaborate with commanders to address these issues and reduce the incidence of such incidents. In 2016, 73% of servicemembers who reported experiencing sexual assault stated it occurred at a military location, emphasizing the importance of addressing workplace attitudes to prevent such incidents. The workplace culture in the military influences servicemembers' off-duty actions and can lead to sexual assaults. The continuum of harm includes actions like sexist jokes and cyber bullying that support an environment tolerating sexual violence. Military commanders can use data to identify leading indicators of sexual assaults and take action to reduce risk factors. Studies show a correlation between sexual assault incidence and environments permissive to sexism and harassment. The prevalence of sexual harassment in the military is high, with women experiencing it at a much higher rate than men. A 2003 military study found a strong link between sexually hostile work environments and increased odds of rape. In 2016, 8.1% of active duty members reported experiencing a sexually hostile work environment. Despite this, formal complaints of sexual harassment are lower than the actual rates experienced by servicemembers. In 2010, a majority of servicemembers believed their immediate supervisor made efforts to stop sexual harassment, but 41% felt people in their workgroup could get away with it. 601 formal complaints of sexual harassment were reported, but an estimated 8% of servicemembers experienced sexual harassment. Many choose not to report incidents due to not being taken seriously. Congress and DOD have implemented measures to address sexual harassment in the armed forces, including requiring the Secretary of Defense to develop a policy to prevent and respond to sexual harassment. Commanders are now required to document substantiated incidents of sexual harassment in servicemembers' performance evaluations. A DOD survey found that 9% of servicemembers who experienced sexual assault also experienced stalking prior to the assault. Stalking behaviors, also known as \"grooming,\" are often linked to sexual harassment and violence. Stalking involves repeated unwanted attention or harassment that instills fear in the victim. Federal and state laws prohibit stalking, with varying penalties for offenders. Stalking activities can include nonconsensual communication, following the victim, making threats, and using technology like social media for surveillance. Stalking, also known as \"grooming,\" involves repeated unwanted attention or harassment that instills fear in the victim. Examples include video-voyeurism, posting threatening information in public forums, and using spyware or GPS tracking systems. In the FY2006 NDAA, stalking was added to the punitive articles in the Uniform Code of Military Justice to enhance prosecution of offenses related to sexual assault. A servicemember guilty of stalking engages in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to fear death or bodily harm, including sexual assault. Hazing and sexual assault are linked, with surveys showing a significant percentage of victims describing their experience as \"hazing.\" The Department of Defense defines hazing as conduct that causes physical or psychological harm to military members or civilians without a proper purpose. Hazing is prohibited in the military and Department of Defense civilian organizations. It is associated with initiation rituals that can lead to physical and psychological harm. Some view these traditions as harmless, while others argue they can result in injuries. A 2015 report found that 20% of surveyed servicemembers had heard of initiation activities that could be seen as sexual. Recently, Congress has taken measures to address hazing in the military, with a provision in the FY2013 NDAA requiring service secretaries to report on hazing and recommended changes to the UCMJ. The Senate report emphasized that preventing and responding to hazing incidents is a leadership issue. The FY2015 NDAA also included measures to address hazing in the military. The FY2015 NDAA included a provision requiring a GAO report on hazing in the armed services. The GAO noted a lack of oversight in policy implementation. Congress included provisions in the FY2017 NDAA to establish a hazing database and improve training. Alcohol use is a risk factor for both perpetrators and victims of hazing. Alcohol consumption raises the risk of sexual assault, impairs consent and judgement, and can be used as a weapon by predators. Military servicemembers have higher rates of binge drinking compared to civilians, putting them at increased risk. Data shows a correlation between alcohol use and sexual assault among military personnel. Alcohol consumption is often involved in reported incidents of sexual assault among military servicemembers. DOD and the services encourage commanders to address alcohol use as part of their prevention strategies, including setting examples for responsible alcohol consumption and creating environments where bystanders can intervene in risky situations. In a 2009 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, interventions to prevent sexual assault involving alcohol include teaching young people to intervene in predator-type behavior, such as stopping strong drink mixing for young girls and taking care of each other to avoid risky situations. Commanders also implement policies like reducing alcohol sales hours and increasing prices to address alcohol-related incidents. The military has implemented policies to address alcohol use, including limiting alcohol in barracks and banning it in certain areas. Efforts are being made to fund research on alcohol's role in sexual assault cases. Congress holds military leadership accountable through climate assessments for preventing sexual assaults. The Defense Equal Opportunity Climate Survey is used to measure factors related to sexual harassment and assault prevention. The DEOCS is used for command climate assessment in the military, tracking progress and compliance with requirements. The FY2014 NDAA imposed additional requirements on the assessment, including dissemination of results and inclusion in commanders' evaluations. Commanding officers are responsible for creating a climate where sexual assault allegations are managed properly. The FY2014 NDAA imposed requirements for command climate assessment in the military, emphasizing the importance of creating a climate where sexual assault allegations are managed properly. Senior officers should evaluate commanding officers on their performance in establishing a safe reporting environment. Sexual assault education and training are key components of DOD's prevention activities. The military sexual assault training should be tailored to the roles and responsibilities of the audience and meet the same standards across military departments. The 2009 report highlighted deficiencies in the curricula, design, and leadership involvement in SAPR training, recommending tailored courses to address the needs of new recruits, responders, leadership, and peers. Congressional actions and DOD policy changes have addressed many concerns raised by the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services. In response to concerns raised by the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services, Congress required DOD to develop tailored sexual assault prevention training for specific audiences and new modules for professional military education. This included consulting experts, implementing consistent training across military departments, and enacting additional training requirements for commanders and recruits in the FY2012 and FY2013 NDAA. In response to congressional actions, sexual assault prevention training requirements were expanded for service academy cadets, midshipmen, and ROTC instructors. Commanders are responsible for ensuring training completion to reinforce zero tolerance stance and clarify reporting processes. Services have monitoring processes in place to track mandated training completion. The FY2014 NDAA mandated DOD to review and report on SAPR training adequacy. DOD policy requires submission of SAPR training elements for consistency. New commanders must fulfill statutory training requirements to prevent sexual assault. The FY2014 NDAA mandated DOD to review and report on SAPR training adequacy, including elements such as definitions of sexual assault and harassment, recognizing sexual assault, bystander intervention strategies, penalties for offenders, and dispelling rape myths. DOD also implemented specialized leadership sexual assault prevention training for all military services as part of its 2015 strategic plan. The FY2014 NDAA mandated DOD to review and report on SAPR training adequacy, including elements such as definitions of sexual assault and harassment, recognizing sexual assault, bystander intervention strategies, penalties for offenders, and dispelling rape myths. Available resources for those who have been assaulted and information on the impact of sexual assault on victims, units, and operational readiness are also provided. Pre-deployment sexual assault prevention training includes instruction on the local history, culture, and religious practices of foreign countries and coalition partners. Military training programs have adopted best practices for prevention programs. The study found that the Air Force improved its training program between 2005 and 2014, but a lack of evaluation processes hindered judging effectiveness. Research suggests individuals with a history of coerciveness are at high risk of future assaults. DOD recognizes the risk of \"sexually coercive behavior\" among servicemembers. Training aims to address this issue. Training aims to help individuals with coercive tendencies identify appropriate behavior and dissuade them from committing sexual violence. In some cases, training may not be enough, and other approaches may be needed to remove potential perpetrators from the applicant pool. Section 504 of Title 10 United States Code prohibits certain individuals from enlisting in the armed forces, but exceptions can be made in meritorious cases. This authority, historically known as a moral waiver, allows for exceptions based on conduct or character. The military granted moral waivers to new recruits with criminal histories, including traffic or drug offenses, non-traffic misdemeanors, and felony convictions. Concerns were raised about the safety of other servicemembers, but a 2009 report found no evidence of increased risk. The Defense Task Force report found no evidence of increased disciplinary problems due to waivers for criminal offenses in military recruits. Congress enacted provisions to prohibit moral waivers for individuals convicted of certain felony sexual offenses. Additionally, Congress focused on providing protection and support services for victims of sexual assault in the military. Congressional actions have focused on protecting and supporting victims of sexual assault in the military, including ensuring victim privacy and safety, providing medical and mental health services, offering legal assistance programs, and preventing retaliation. Military victims of sexual assault have been found to be hesitant to report incidents. The military implemented policies to improve confidentiality and support for sexual assault victims, including a restricted reporting option introduced in 2005. This allows victims to access necessary services while maintaining privacy. Restricted reporting allows victims of sexual assault in the military to access confidential medical, mental health, and victim advocacy services without notifying their commander or law enforcement. The data is reported to SAPRO for statistics, and victims can later choose to make an unrestricted report, triggering a formal investigation by the Military Criminal Investigative Office. The availability of restricted reporting has been praised by victims, health practitioners, and advocates. In a 2009 hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on Victim Support and Advocacy, a rape victim advocate expressed support for the increase in reports of sexual assault in the military, stating that it indicates more individuals are receiving services and feel safe to come forward. Challenges faced by the DOD in protecting victims' right to choose restricted reporting include state mandatory reporting laws and jurisdictional issues. The FY2016 NDAA included a provision preempting state laws that conflict with restricted reporting options. The NDAA provision (Section 536) preempts state laws requiring sexual assault victims to disclose personally identifiable information, except in cases of serious and imminent threat. Congress aims to protect victims by encouraging policies for humanitarian transfers and military protective orders. Victims making a restricted report cannot receive a military protective order or expedited transfer, but can do so with an unrestricted report. Congress noted in 2004 the lack of standard policies in the DOD for these situations. In 2004, Congress highlighted the lack of standard policies in the DOD for the removal or transfer of sexual assault victims from units where the alleged attacker is part of the same unit or the victim's chain of command. In 2010, Representative Jane Harman suggested transfers as a way to protect victims from retaliation. The FY2011 NDAA added a provision for expedited transfers for victims of sexual assault to address situations where victims feel unsafe or uncomfortable, such as experiencing ostracism and retaliation. The Expedited Transfer policy aims to help sexual assault victims by moving them to a new location where they are not known. Transfers can be temporary or permanent to a different duty location, with the option to include dependents and spouses. If a transfer request is denied, the individual can appeal to a higher-ranking officer. Advocacy groups support the transfer option but have raised concerns about delays and denials in implementation. Some advocacy groups have raised concerns about delays and denials in the Expedited Transfer policy for sexual assault victims. Congress sought to clarify the military commander's ability to transfer alleged perpetrators to another unit following a sex-related offense report. The FY2014 NDAA authorized DOD to establish guidelines for expedited transfers of military offenders accused of sex-related offenses. Commanders can also take actions like pre-trial confinement or issuing military protective orders. The number of requested expedited transfers for victims has been increasing since FY2012. Military protective orders (MPO) prohibit contact with the victim, while civilian protection orders (CPO) have jurisdiction on military installations. MPOs are not enforceable by civilian law. Congressional concerns about the lack of enforceability of military protective orders (MPOs) by civilian authorities have led to legislation encouraging coordination between military and civilian authorities. The FY2009 NDAA required DOD to notify civilian authorities when an MPO is issued, and installation commanders can develop agreements with local police to detain individuals who violate an MPO until military police can respond. Since FY2010, DOD has been required to track the issuance of MPOs in each sexual assault case. Congress has raised questions about the adequacy of medical care for victims of sexual assault in the military, including whether military medical professionals are properly trained and equipped to address the health needs of different victim populations. Additionally, concerns have been raised about whether the medical and mental health services provided to victims align with evidence-based best practices for treatment and rehabilitation. Military members are eligible for a range of medical and mental health services through TRICARE, both immediately following a sexual assault and for longer-term care. Retired military personnel can continue to receive military health services, while those discharged before retirement may be eligible for care through the VA. According to DOD's 2014 Survivor Experience Survey, a significant percentage of victims of sexual assault in the military have interacted with medical and mental health providers. Caregivers at military or civilian medical facilities are often the first point of contact for victims, providing urgent medical assistance and conducting sexual assault forensic examinations. Provisions in the Violence Against Women Act ensure that victims are not charged for these exams. In 2006, Congress authorized TRICARE coverage for forensic examinations following sexual assault or domestic violence, ensuring victims are not charged for \"rape kits.\" Evidence from the exams must be saved for five years. Victims may need long-term care for physical and psychological effects like STDs, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Negative behavioral changes like increased substance use or poor work performance can also occur. The FY2011 NDAA mandated DOD to establish protocols for providing medical care to military members or beneficiaries who are victims of assault. The FY2012 NDAA required a review of women-specific health services in DOD, including services for female victims of sexual assault. The resulting GAO report found availability and standardization issues, recommending improved guidance for care providers in providing comprehensive and consistent medical services in deployed environments. DOD's current regulations include instructions for combatant commanders to ensure victims of sexual assault in deployed locations are transported to an appropriate evaluation site for treatment. The House called for a review of DOD's policies for providing medical and mental health care for male servicemembers who are victims of sexual assault. The GAO report found that DOD has not systematically evaluated the extent to which male or female victims of sexual assault receive gender-specific care. DOD has ongoing efforts to provide gender-specific treatment for male and female victims of sexual assault, including male-only therapy groups and enhanced medical staff training. Congress mandated the assignment of sexual assault forensic examiners to military medical treatment facilities to ensure availability of trained examiners. Recent DOD survey data indicates progress in meeting these requirements. Recent survey data from DOD shows high satisfaction levels with military medical and mental health care for sexual assault survivors. The 2014 Survivor Experience Survey reported over 75% satisfaction with services at MTFs, with positive experiences with providers. DOD launched the \"Safe Helpline\" in 2011, offering 24/7 confidential crisis support for adult servicemembers. The \"Safe Helpline\" offers various ways for sexual assault survivors in the DOD community to interact with Helpline staff, including phone, text, online chat, and a self-care app. SAPRO oversees the helpline's operation through a contract with RAINN. DHRA has allocated around $4 million annually to operate the Helpline in recent fiscal years. DHRA has allocated approximately $4 million annually to operate the Safe Helpline. In 2016, helpline usage increased by 67% due to expanded DOD outreach efforts. Half of the assault reports in 2016 were from individuals who had not disclosed the event to a military authority. Men were more likely than women to make their first disclosure on the Helpline. Strengthening support for sexual assault victims includes enhancing legal assistance and victim advocate services. Pursuing accountability for perpetrators through the criminal justice system can be challenging. In 2005, DOD established a victim care response system with support roles like sexual assault response coordinator (SARC) and sexual assault prevention and response victim advocates (SAPR-VA). Despite providing valuable victim support, concerns persisted about uneven implementation, lack of awareness of victim rights, inconsistent training, and difficulty in recruiting volunteers for these roles. Congress enacted provisions in the FY2011 NDAA to provide entitlements for members of the armed services. In the FY2011 NDAA, Congress enacted provisions to provide legal assistance and support services to victims of sexual assault in the armed services. This includes assistance from special victims' counsel, SARCs, and SAPR-VAs. The legislation requires notification of these services to victims regardless of their report status and mandates a minimum number of SARCs and SAPR-VAs per brigade. A 2015 survey found variations in the number of personnel served by SARCs and SAPR-VAs, with the Army having more per servicemember. The FY2012 NDAA requires standardized training for these roles. The FY2012 NDAA mandated standardized training for SARCs and victim advocates in the DOD to improve services for sexual assault victims. The D-SAACP manages certification with an annual budget of $1 million. The Victim Assistance Leadership Council advises the Secretary of Defense on various victim assistance programs. The Judicial Proceedings Panel (JPP) reviewed special victims counsel programs in 2014 and expressed concerns about statutory requirements, reporting structures, quality standards, geographic availability, and metrics for evaluating the SVC program. Congress made changes to the SVC program in response to these concerns through the FY2015 and FY2016 NDAAs, expanding eligibility for certain reserve component servicemembers. In response to concerns raised by the Judicial Proceedings Panel, Congress expanded eligibility for SVC services in the FY2015 and FY2016 NDAA. This included access for reserve component members and DOD civilians, as well as establishing standardized training and program enhancements for SVCs. Key enhancements include guiding principles for SVC program, performance measures, and client satisfaction standards. The FY2016 NDAA expanded the role of Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) to provide legal consultation and assistance to victims with complaints against the government, Freedom of Information Act requests, and correspondence with Congress. Retaliation against individuals who report crimes or protected communications can have negative psychological impacts on sexual assault victims. Sexual assault victims may be reluctant to report incidents due to fear of retaliation, which can hinder accountability for perpetrators. Concerns about retaliation from the perpetrator, peers, or supervisors have been identified as barriers to reporting. The Department of Defense acknowledges the detrimental impact of retaliation on organizational trust in its prevention and response strategy. The Department of Defense's prevention and response strategy emphasizes the harmful effects of retaliation on victims, bystanders, and military readiness. Congress has taken steps to enhance whistleblower protections and oversight of retaliatory actions in recent years. The FY2014 NDAA required DOD to create regulations prohibiting retaliation against those who report a criminal offense, with specified punishments under Article 92 of the UCMJ. The Secretary of Defense was directed in 2015 to develop a DoD-wide strategy to address this issue. The Secretary of Defense directed the development of a DoD-wide strategy to prevent retaliation against military members who report crimes, including reprisal, ostracism, and cruelty. Retaliation is defined as taking unfavorable personnel actions for making a protected communication. Examples include promotion interference and poor performance evaluations. The most common forms of reprisal for military whistleblower cases include assignment or reassignment, poor performance evaluations, and disciplinary action. Ostracism, also known as social retaliation, involves exclusion from social acceptance or privileges to discourage reporting of criminal offenses. It can include bullying, exclusion from group activities, or denial of privileges. Ostracism in the military involves exclusion from social acceptance or privileges with the intent to discourage reporting of criminal offenses. It can include bullying, exclusion from group activities, or denial of friendship. Identifying and proving ostracism may be challenging due to limited information during investigations. Maltreatment is defined as abusive treatment by peers or others that is unnecessary for any lawful purpose. The 2016 report by the Judicial Proceedings Panel (JPP) found the military's definition of maltreatment problematic and recommended revising it to include behaviors that are cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning, or harmful. Retaliation in the military, including ostracism, can discourage reporting of criminal offenses and may be punishable under the UCMJ as criminal retribution. The UCMJ articles provide commanders with tools to address social retaliation, including actions like cruelty, assault, stalking, and obstruction of justice. Victims of sexual assault can report retaliation through hotlines, victim advocates, counselors, and military commanders outside their chain of command. The Department of Defense Inspector General handles reprisal cases, while other forms of retaliation are investigated by military criminal investigative organizations, law enforcement, or commanders. In FY2014, Congress enhanced protections for military whistleblowers and required IG retaliation investigations to include those reporting violations related to sexual misconduct. Concerns were raised about the quality and independence of DODIG investigative processes for reprisal cases. The DODIG lacked a process for documenting independent investigations outside the military chain of command. Delays and lack of standardization were noted in whistleblower reprisal investigations. Congress expanded whistleblower protections in the FY2017 NDAA to address issues raised in a GAO report, including prohibiting personnel actions against whistleblowers. The FY2017 NDAA expanded whistleblower protections in the DOD, requiring uniform conduct standards for investigators and updates on investigation status. Self-reported data showed retaliation against sexual assault victims, with two-thirds of female members perceiving retaliation from peers, coworkers, or chain of command. The 2016 WGRA survey data indicated that about half of sexual assault victims perceived some form of retaliation, but less than one-third met definitional criteria. DOD lacked centralized processes for monitoring and reporting retaliation cases until a data-call was issued in March 2015. The 2016 WGRA survey found that half of sexual assault victims perceived retaliation, but only a third met definitional criteria. DOD lacked centralized processes for monitoring retaliation until a data-call in March 2015. In May 2015, the Judicial Proceedings Panel requested data on alleged retaliation cases from the services, prompting the need to modernize DSAID for better data collection. The military justice system, governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, prosecutes uniformed members for sexual assault crimes to promote justice, maintain discipline, and strengthen national security. The military justice system aims to punish offenders and deter future crimes, with specific rules and consequences for Armed Forces members. Recent legislation focuses on reforming investigative and judicial processes for sexual assault cases within the military. Jurisdictional issues between civilian and military law enforcement complicate the investigation and resolution of these cases. In reported sex-related offenses falling within the military's jurisdiction, Military Criminal Investigative Organizations (MCIOs) lead investigations. Congressional concerns include the responsiveness of investigations, protection of alleged victim's rights, training of MCIOs, adherence to policies, and fairness, timeliness, and transparency of investigations. The FY2014 NDAA requires commanding officers to refer reports of sex-related offenses to MCIO investigators. The FY2014 NDAA mandates that commanders refer sex-related offenses to MCIO investigators, prohibiting internal investigations on sexual assault allegations. MCIO investigators must follow specific processes for sexual assault cases, including notifying a SARC, retaining investigation reports for 50 years, and providing data for the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database. Concerns have been raised by Congress, advocacy groups, and the media about potential flaws in the military's handling of sexual assault cases. The DOD Inspector General found that 99% of MCIO investigations met standards in 2013, an improvement from 2010. After completing an investigation, the MCIO shares a report with the staff judge advocate for review and recommendations to the disposition authority, usually a military commander. The disposition authority, typically a military commander, has the power to review investigation results and decide on the case's outcome, such as submitting it for court-martial proceedings. In some cases, the commander may lack legal authority to prosecute a crime, or the investigation may not yield enough evidence for a sexual assault charge. Factors like victim refusal to participate or statute of limitations expiration can also impact command action. The disposition authority, usually a military commander, decides on the case's outcome, including court-martial proceedings, dismissal of charges, or other actions like nonjudicial punishment. If probable cause is found, court-martial charges may be preferred. The FY2014 NDAA mandates an Article 32 hearing before a general court-martial, focusing on probable cause, jurisdiction, and formality. The disposition authority, typically a military commander, decides on the case's outcome, including court-martial proceedings, dismissal of charges, or other actions. In cases that proceed to court-martial, the outcome can vary from a completed trial to charges being dismissed or the perpetrator being discharged. Data from FY2016 shows that 59% of sexual assault cases with sufficient evidence led to court-martial initiation, with a 33% conviction rate for those that went to trial. Commander's discretion in deciding punitive or administrative actions based on investigation results has been a debated aspect of military sexual assault investigations. The FY2014 NDAA addressed concerns about unfair bias in military sexual assault investigations by modifying Rule 36 of the Manual for Courts-Martial to remove the character and military service of the accused from considerations for disposition decisions. Congress has questioned the broad discretion given to commanders in these cases. Some argue that commanders' authority in military sexual assault cases supports good order and discipline, citing their qualifications and experience. However, concerns have been raised that commanders may misuse their discretion to handle cases through non-judicial punishment or discharge rather than imposing more serious penalties. Some argue that commanders' authority in military sexual assault cases supports good order and discipline, citing their qualifications and experience. However, concerns have been raised about commanders potentially misusing their discretion to handle cases through non-judicial punishment or discharge rather than pursuing courts-martial. There are also worries about unlawful command influence compromising the accused servicemember's rights in the judicial process. General Amos has shown strong leadership in supporting victims of sexual assault in the military. However, recent legislative changes have limited military commanders' discretion over cases, leading to cases being thrown out due to unlawful command influence. Since June 28, 2012, DOD policy requires all unrestricted reports of adult sexual assault offenses to be reviewed by a special court-martial convening authority for the initial disposition decision. In FY2014, Congress enacted provisions limiting military commander discretion in sexual assault cases. The bill emphasized court-martial over non-judicial punishment and required review of decisions not to refer charges for trial in sex-related offense cases. A panel was tasked with reviewing systems for investigating and prosecuting adult sexual assault crimes. The Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel cautioned against further limitations of convening authorities under the UCMJ, stating that removing convening authority from senior commanders may not reduce sexual assault incidence or improve investigations and prosecutions in the Armed Forces. Proposed systemic changes to the military justice system should be carefully considered in light of recent reforms. The Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel recommended repealing Section 1744 of the FY2014 NDAA, which required Secretary-level review of decisions not to refer charges to court martial. Congress amended this requirement in the FY2015 NDAA to require review by the Secretary if requested by the chief prosecutor. Congressional action between 2012 and 2015 focused on judicial processes, with reforms including increased protections and rights for victims in court-martial proceedings. Some areas of reform in the military justice system include increasing evidence retention requirements, eliminating statute of limitations for certain offenses, imposing minimum sentences for sex-related offenders, and making changes to the Military Rules of Evidence. Concerns have been raised about the complexity of implementing these changes and the significant alterations to the trial process for sexual assault crimes. The Judicial Proceedings Panel (JPP) was established by Congress in 2012 to review military judicial proceedings for adult sexual assault cases. The panel analyzed 1,761 cases from FY2012-FY2014, evaluating punishment consistency, defense counsel training, and special victims capabilities. The Judicial Proceedings Panel (JPP) analyzed 1,761 judicial cases from FY2012-FY2014 involving sexual assault offenses. The analysis found that factors like military service, rank of accused, and victim status did not affect the likelihood of conviction. A Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces was established as per FY2015 NDAA Section 546. The Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces was established on February 18, 2016, as required by the FY2016 NDAA. Its duties include advising the Secretary of Defense on sexual misconduct cases and submitting annual reports to Congress. Congress may question the impact of reforms on addressing sexual assault in the military. The SAPR program focuses on the preparedness and well-being of military servicemembers. Evaluating the impact of legal and policy changes on sexual assault rates is challenging due to recent data collection improvements. Congress and others may analyze reported incident rates to identify trends, but caution is advised due to the limited historical data available for comparison. The SAPR program focuses on evaluating the impact of legal and policy changes on sexual assault rates in the military. Self-reported anonymous survey data is considered a more accurate indicator of the actual rate of sexual assault. Changes in survey methodology limit the ability to observe trends over a longer period of time. Reforms have been implemented to encourage reporting of assault incidents. Reported incident rates may increase in the short term, indicating negative trends. In the short term, an increase in reported incidents could indicate a positive change as more individuals feel comfortable reporting assaults. For example, in FY2013, DOD reported 627 incidents involving male victims, while in FY2014 and FY2015, the numbers were 921 and 821 respectively. However, the estimated prevalence of male sexual assault in 2014 was about 10,500 members. Congress may expect both estimated prevalence and incident rates to decrease in the long run. The convergence of incident reporting and prevalence estimates may indicate positive changes in command climate and victim awareness of reporting processes. It is challenging to determine the impact of prevention programs on reducing sexual assaults. DOD has implemented standardized sexual assault training, and evidence suggests compliance with best practices. In 2016, 95% of services' training curricula aligned with best practices in adult learning. In 2016, 95% of men and women in the services received training on sexual assault topics. Feedback on training effectiveness was positive. While implementation data shows training reaching targeted audiences, there is less evidence on program outcomes. Congress may monitor servicemember awareness and satisfaction with training. Opportunities exist to compare prevention program implementation and share best practices among DOD services and other programs. The services have adopted active bystander training with slightly different programs. Navy personnel were more influenced by bystander training in intervening in sexual assault situations. Congress could fund research on effective sexual violence prevention programs. DOD and Congress recognize the importance of organizational culture in preventing sexual harassment. Servicemembers are more willing to prevent sexual harassment in supportive command climates. Policies and programs promoting open dialog and trust in leadership may help prevent sexual harassment. Congress monitors DOD programs for associated risk factors and interventions, such as research on alcohol's role in assault cases. Reforms focus on providing military victims with immediate, confidential support services throughout the recovery process. The Department of Defense (DOD) has seen positive trends in the rate of restricted reports converted to unrestricted reports, indicating servicemember trust in the reporting system. Over 73% of servicemembers who made unrestricted reports of sexual assault reported satisfaction with their interactions during the military judicial process. The majority of victims felt well-informed by SVCs during the military judicial process, with 83% reporting satisfaction. However, less than 50% felt informed by their unit commander or enlisted advisor. Congressional oversight is needed for training and standardization of victim support functions."
