The Andean Adjustment Act of 2001 allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to become lawful permanent residents, with specific criteria and deadlines outlined. The Andean Adjustment Act of 2001 allows eligible aliens with certain orders to apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate the order. If the application is granted, the order is canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. Aliens from Colombia or Peru present in the US since December 1, 1995, for at least 1 year can apply for adjustment of status. Absences totaling 180 days are allowed without breaking continuous physical presence. The Attorney General can allow aliens with deportation orders to seek a stay. The Attorney General can authorize aliens in deportation proceedings to seek a stay based on an application for adjustment of status. Aliens applying for adjustment of status may be allowed to work in the US. The Attorney General can authorize aliens to work in the US during the pendency of their application for adjustment of status. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, the Attorney General must authorize employment. Additionally, spouses and children of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence may also have their status adjusted. The alien must establish physical presence in the US for at least 1 year, apply for adjustment while present in the US, and meet eligibility criteria for an immigrant visa and admissibility for permanent residence. The alien must establish physical presence in the US for at least 1 year to apply for adjustment of status. Absences from the US totaling 180 days or less will not break continuous physical presence. The Attorney General must provide administrative review rights to adjustment of status applicants. Aliens in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act are subject to final determinations by the Attorney General regarding their status adjustment. When an alien is granted lawful permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply unless specified otherwise in this Act. The Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement will not be affected by the eligibility of an alien for permanent residence status under this section. Aliens can still seek permanent residence status under other laws they may qualify for."
