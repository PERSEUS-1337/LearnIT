    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trade Adjustment Assistance for Industries Act of 2005\". Congress finds that Trade Adjustment Assistance helps workers and agricultural producers affected by trade-related job losses by providing retraining and new job opportunities. The cost of providing this assistance is minimal compared to the overall economic gains from trade liberalization. Import competition due to trade agreements or unfair practices can have widespread effects on domestic industries, warranting eligibility assessments for assistance. Assessing eligibility for trade adjustment assistance on a plant-by-plant basis is inefficient and can lead to unfair and inconsistent results. SEC. 3. OTHER METHODS OF REQUESTING INVESTIGATION.
