    "content": "The \"Endangered Species Management Self-Determination Act\" defines ESA as the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Congress finds that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has not achieved its goal of recovering species, with less than 1 percent of listed species being removed due to data errors or other factors. There is a lack of comprehensive studies on the costs and benefits of the ESA, as well as a lack of accountability for the expenses incurred by the Federal Government and State and local governments in implementing the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes costs on the private sector without accountability. Landowners bear conservation costs for endangered species habitat. The ESA listing process hinders infrastructure projects, impacting economic growth. Litigation and settlements have made the ESA unworkable for species protection. SEC. 4. DETERMINATIONS OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THREATENED SPECIES. Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require the consent of the Governor of each State where the endangered or threatened species is present. This includes changes to subsections (a) and (b) of the Act. Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to require the Governor of each State's consent where the endangered or threatened species is present. This includes redefining the term 'joint resolution' and adding a definition for 'best scientific and commercial data'. The Secretary of the Interior must submit lists of endangered and threatened species to Congress for approval through a joint resolution before they take effect. The lists must include scientific and common names of the species. The Secretary of the Interior must submit lists of endangered and threatened species to Congress for approval through a joint resolution. The lists include scientific and common names, specify the status of the species over its range, and any critical habitat. The approved lists are published in the Federal Register. After 5 years, species listed on the joint resolution-approved list are automatically removed unless relisted through a petition. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Governor of each State, may submit a list to Congress that includes species previously removed. The list requires Congressional approval before taking effect. Additionally, a provision is added to specify when a species can be removed from the list. In subsection (j), species can be removed from the list with Congressional approval. The Secretary's authority is limited in subsections (f)(1), (g)(1), and (h) except as provided in subsection (j). In subsection (j), the Governor of a State is defined for intrastate endangered species or threatened species. The Governor of a State can regulate intrastate endangered or threatened species present only within the State. The Governor of a State has exclusive authority to manage intrastate endangered or threatened species, including promulgating regulations, designating critical habitats, issuing permits, developing recovery plans, and establishing goals. The Governor of a State has the authority to regulate intrastate endangered or threatened species listed after a certain date, subject to state law. The Governor of a State has the authority to regulate intrastate threatened species, with limitations on judicial review. SEC. 5. COST ACCOUNTING. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended by inserting after section 12 the following: \"SEC. 12A. COST ACCOUNTING REPORT.\" In this section, definitions of direct costs and indirect costs are provided, including various cost components such as Federal agency obligations, staffing costs, foregone power generation costs, and replacement power costs. The cost of compliance is discussed for certain regulated species by specific administrators. The Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Power Administrations must include in monthly billing statements the costs incurred by customers related to complying with the Act. The Bureau of Reclamation will assist in identifying these costs. Administrators must submit a report to Senate and Natural Resources Committees annually. The Senate and House Committees will receive a report estimating costs related to the Western Area Power Administration on a project-by-project basis, and for other Administrations on a systemwide basis. \"SEC. 12B. PROPERTY RIGHTS.\" The owner or lessee of real property can submit an application to the Secretary of the Interior for proposed use. Within 90 days, the Secretary will determine if the proposed use violates any provisions of the Act. If no response is given within the 90-day period, the proposed use is considered not to violate any provisions. The owner or lessee of real property can rely on a determination that a proposed use will not violate any provisions of the Act as an affirmative defense. If the Secretary of the Interior determines that a proposed use will violate the Act, the owner or lessee may be compensated. The owner or lessee of real property can seek compensation under subsection (b) for agency actions that diminish the property's fair market value by at least 50% for the intended use. The owner or lessee of real property affected by an agency action can receive compensation equal to 150 percent of the fair market value within 180 days. The fair market value is determined according to specific guidelines. The fair market value is determined by 2 licensed independent appraisers, one chosen by the Secretary and the other by the owner or lessee. If they fail to agree, an additional appraiser is jointly selected to determine the value. The licensed independent appraiser determines the fair market value within 270 days of the agency action. The Secretary is responsible for all costs related to the determination of fair market value. SEC. 6. PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT.\n\nAmends Section 11(g)(4) of the Endangered Species Act by removing \"attorney and\".\n\nSEC. 7. CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\nAmends Section 6(d)(1) of the Endangered Species Act by removing \"the status of candidate species pursuant to subparagraph (C) of section 4(b)(3) and\"."
