    "content": "The USDA operates programs to support farmers during low prices and natural disasters. The farm safety net includes crop insurance, revenue support, and disaster assistance. The 2014 farm bill changed some programs, but funding differences for specific commodities remain. The Congressional Budget Office projects disparities in payments and support levels across program crops in their June 2017 baseline projections of USDA program outlays through 2027. Peanuts receive the highest support rate at $288 per acre, followed by rice at $135 per acre. Other program crops receive an average annual payment rate below $30 per acre. This report uses historical data to show the distribution of commodity-specific outlays under the farm safety-net programs of the 2014 farm bill. The report provides statistical context for evaluating the distribution of farm program payments under the 2014 farm bill. It describes the U.S. agricultural sector, discusses commodity-specific support, and compares outlays for different crops in the first three years of the bill. The report analyzes commodity-specific outlays in the first three years of the 2014 farm bill, comparing market price protection for program crops. U.S. agricultural production value averaged $385.1 billion during this period, with field crops and milk production accounting for a significant portion. The average value of program commodity production in the U.S. is $155.5 billion, representing 40.3% of agricultural production. Federal agricultural policy aims to ensure abundant output and safeguard resources, but varying program outlays across crops can lead to unintended consequences. Payment-to-crop linkage can influence market incentives and resource allocations for producers. The payment-to-crop linkage can impact producers' crop choices based on program payments. Variations in support levels across program crops can have regional implications due to diverse agro-climatic settings in the U.S. The substantial annual U.S. farm program outlays increase the risk of unintended consequences, with over $500 billion spent by the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation since the 1930s. Since 1996, over $188 billion in commodity support payments have been made to major field crops like feed grains, cotton, wheat, and soybeans. The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 established a public-private partnership for crop insurance, with over $80 billion in premium subsidies paid by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. The 2014 farm bill shifted agricultural disaster assistance programs to focus on livestock, orchards, and vineyards instead of traditional farm program crops. Market prices play a key role in allocating resources in a market-based economy. U.S. farm commodity programs aim to provide a safety net for farmers. The USDA's farm commodity programs provide a safety net for farmers, but critics argue that federal support payments may keep resources in the agricultural sector that could move to other sectors. Proponents believe public intervention is necessary due to producer vulnerability to weather uncertainty and global market conditions. Critics suggest that producers have private sector risk-management tactics available. Critics question the equity of U.S. farm programs, citing funding disparities and potential unintended incentives that may alter producer behavior. Some argue that the focus on feedstuffs in federal farm support has reduced meat costs for consumers. U.S. farm policy has lowered meat costs for consumers by subsidizing grains and protein meals, while fruits and vegetables remain unsubsidized. Critics argue that federal crop insurance subsidies have encouraged production on environmentally sensitive land. Regional specialization in the U.S. Corn Belt due to agro-climatic variations. The U.S. Corn Belt, stretching from Indiana to Kansas, is a productive region for corn and soybean cultivation. The Cotton Belt in the southern U.S. and the Hard Wheat Belt in the plains states also play significant roles in agriculture. Irrigation has allowed for successful farming in arid regions like California and livestock activities vary based on resources and climate. The most marginal lands support cow-calf operations, while hog, poultry, and cattle operations are influenced by feed availability, market proximity, land costs, and environmental factors. Funding disparities for program crops raise questions about equitable use of federal resources. USDA's farm safety-net components are funded through the CCC and FCIC. Data tables in the report focus on crop-specific safety-net outlays, excluding CCC spending on conservation, trade, energy, and rural development. Figure 1 shows all farm safety-net outlays since 1996. The CCC and FCIC fund USDA's farm safety-net programs, excluding spending on conservation, trade, energy, and rural development. CCC-funded programs include the MAL, ARC, and PLC programs for commodity support. The outlays for these programs are summarized in tables and discussed in the report. The MAL, ARC, and PLC programs are authorized by the 2014 farm bill for 26 farm commodities, with 22 \"covered commodities\" eligible for ARC and PLC programs. Covered commodities include wheat, oats, barley, corn, soybeans, peanuts, and other oilseeds. Notably, upland cotton is not eligible for CCC revenue programs. Upland cotton was removed from eligibility for CCC revenue support programs under the 2014 farm bill due to a WTO ruling. However, cotton producers can still receive cotton-specific program payments. The MAL program provides interim financing for loan commodities, including upland cotton, wool, mohair, and honey, by offering a nonrecourse loan based on the commodity loan rate. The MAL program offers interim financing for loan commodities like upland cotton, wool, mohair, and honey. Producers have options to repay the loan based on market prices, including receiving a marketing loan gain, a loan deficiency payment, or using commodity certificates to repay at a lower price. The MAL program offers interim financing for loan commodities like upland cotton, wool, mohair, and honey. Producers have options to repay the loan at the lower local market price and avoid program payment limits. They can also forfeit the pledged crop to USDA at the end of the loan period to keep any price gains. MAL benefits are based on the entire crop produced, with no benefits in case of crop loss. ARC and PLC programs make payments based on historical acres and yields, decoupled from current production choices. ARC and PLC use annual prices in their payment formulas, while PLC payments make up the difference between a crop's reference price and its national season average farm price, and ARC payments make up the difference between a crop's reference price and its national season average farm price. The ARC-CO program and PLC payments are based on historical data for national season average farm prices and county yields. Producers had a one-time choice in 2015 between PLC and ARC programs for protection against crop price or revenue declines. Eligible producers with base acres for program crops could choose between the two programs. The 2014 farm bill introduced the ARC-IC guarantee as an alternative to PLC and ARC-CO for farmers, combining all covered crops into a single revenue guarantee. Upland cotton was excluded from PLC and ARC payments, renamed as \"generic\" base eligible for ARC and PLC payments based on planted crops. Producers must consider program payments, market conditions, and crop rotations when choosing crops for generic base. Producers of upland cotton remain eligible for MAL benefits and receive EAAU payments and cotton storage cost reimbursements under the 2014 farm bill. EAAU payments are made to domestic users monthly at $0.03 per pound, totaling about $49 million per year. CTAP was established as compensation for the loss of ARC and PLC program eligibility for upland cotton producers. Under CTAP, upland cotton producers received payments on a percentage of former cotton base acres for crop years 2014 and 2015, totaling $484 million. In 2016, USDA offered a one-time cotton ginning cost-share program worth $328 million. Milk production is supported by the Margin Protection Program (MPP) and the Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) under the 2014 farm bill. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) provides payments to farmers based on a formula involving national milk and feed costs. Producers can select an insured margin between $4.00 to $8.00 per hundred pounds. Participation in MPP requires an annual fee and premium payments based on coverage levels and milk volumes. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) offers payments to farmers based on national milk and feed costs. Producers may face MPP costs without benefits if margins are not triggered. Current farm law supports sugar prices through various measures, resulting in minimal CCC outlays. U.S. producers of sugar and milk receive price support through tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), funded by domestic consumers. Specialty crop and livestock producers receive little direct government support but benefit from federal investments in research and nutrition programs. Specialty crop and livestock farms manage risks through business diversification, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) directs and finances federal crop insurance programs, with the largest cost being federal subsidies on producer premiums. The federal government has paid an average of 62% of all crop insurance premiums from 2014 to 2016, with premium subsidies being crop-specific and covering a wide range of commodities. Federal crop insurance programs protect producers against losses for major farm program crops, accounting for over 90% of federal premium subsidies. Revenue guarantees are established early in the year based on market conditions, unlike commodity programs with fixed protection levels. From 1996 to 2017, farm safety-net program outlays averaged $16 billion per year, including spending on commodity programs, disaster assistance, and crop insurance. Between 2006 through 2013, USDA commodity programs averaged $12.3 billion per year, with $8.6 billion for revenue support programs and $3.8 billion for crop insurance premium subsidies. CCC-funded program outlays decreased while FCIC support for crop insurance expanded during this period, due to their opposing cyclical behavior. Since 2014, farm prices have declined, leading to an increase in CCC outlays compared to FCIC outlays. The 2014 farm bill's safety-net programs cover the 2014-2018 crop years, with combined CCC and FCIC outlays totaling $38.1 billion over the first three years. Commodity-specific outlays are estimated at $12.7 billion per year, with CCC programs accounting for 59% and FCIC outlays for 41% of the total costs. The majority of farm safety net costs under the 2014 farm bill are attributed to a few major crops, including corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, rice, and peanuts. These crops account for 94% of CCC and FCIC payments from 2014 to 2016, despite only representing 28% of total farm receipts. Corn is the largest crop in terms of planted acres and output value in the United States. The largest crops in value terms in the U.S. are corn, dairy, and soybeans, accounting for 34% of total agricultural output value. Sugar crops have the highest per-acre valuation, followed by rice and peanuts. Corn has the most acres eligible for government payments due to its large planted and base acres. Soybeans, pulse crops, minor oilseeds, other feed grains, and wheat have average returns per acre below the national average. Corn has the most acres eligible for government payments, with significant differences between actual planted acres and base acres for soybeans, rice, pulses, and minor oilseeds. Cotton base acres were renamed \"generic base\" and made eligible for potential payments if a covered crop is planted on the farm. Under the 2014 farm bill, there are 260 million base acres eligible for payment under the ARC or PLC programs, with corn, soybeans, and wheat accounting for 83% of total base acres. FCIC payments vary with planted acreage and market prices, while CCC payment distribution depends on market prices and coupling degree. MAL payments are determined by planted acres across program crops and local market conditions. Under the 2014 farm bill, corn producers have received an average of $5.81 billion per year in federal farm support payments, compared to $2 billion per year for wheat and soybeans. Corn support represents 46% of annual CCC and FCIC commodity-specific payments, largely due to its extensive planted and base acres. The top three program crops - corn, soybeans, and wheat - account for 77% of annual CCC and FCIC commodity-specific payments. Under the 2014 farm bill, peanuts, rice, and cotton receive the highest federal farm support payments due to their large share of planted and base acres. Peanuts and rice producers receive well above the average payment rate for all other program crops, with peanuts averaging $341.19 per acre in annual payments. Under the 2014 farm bill, peanuts receive $341.19 per acre, rice gets $238.47 per acre, and cotton receives $104.56 per acre in federal support payments. Corn producers receive $63.96 per acre, while soybean and pulse crops receive $23.40 and $17.86 per acre, respectively. Sugar program support appears low but excludes potential import protection value. The USDA reported $1.4 billion in import price protection for U.S. sugar in 2014. The dairy sector in the U.S. has not received measurable direct support, unlike other program crops. Dairy producers have paid premiums to participate in the MPP program, but program payments have failed to offset these costs. Cotton programs were also mentioned earlier. The CTAP and CGCS programs, available temporarily, will not continue under the 2014 farm program without congressional action. Farmers support basing commodity support on the cost of production to ensure business sustainability. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 uses input prices to determine support prices. The 1973 farm bill adjusted target prices based on changes in COPs and productivity efficiency. The current farm policy no longer includes cost of production (COP) as a determinant of support. Economists argue against basing support on COPs due to the self-inflating nature of payments as COPs rise, leading to higher farm payments. This is because specialized inputs like land, buildings, and machinery have costs dependent on farm output value, causing subsidies to be capitalized into input prices. The problem of choosing cost categories and levels for farm support payments is crucial, with COPs being a key metric for competitiveness. Linking farm support to market conditions is favored to avoid market distortions. Support may be justified during temporary market price drops to prevent resource misallocations. Federal support levels for program crops like peanuts, rice, and sorghum are higher compared to other crops when expressed as a percentage of variable and total COP. Corn, the largest crop in the US, also receives support but at lower levels. The largest crop in the US, corn, receives lower support levels compared to peanuts, rice, and sorghum when expressed as a percentage of variable and total COP. Dairy ranks last in COP measures with no net support payments under the 2014 farm bill. The farm safety net's development involves various stakeholders and political pressures. The farm safety net's development involves various stakeholder groups, political pressures, and inputs from the research community and other experts. Industry, trade, and producer groups representing major program crops have seen increased cost structures due to higher commodity prices and competition from global markets. Extreme weather events like the 2012 U.S. drought have also impacted farm operations, leading to calls for an expanded safety net with a stable revenue support target. The farm safety net's development involves various stakeholder groups, political pressures, and inputs from the research community and other experts. Many farm groups consider COPs as the reference point for setting target prices, while economists argue for support prices below trend market prices to provide a safety net. Currently, support levels under PLC and MAL are fixed without considering market price trends. This approach aims to provide cash flow to farmers when market prices deviate substantially below trend levels. The USDA proposed setting MAL rates at 85% of the five-year Olympic average market price for covered crops in the 2007 farm bill. The WTO ruling in 2005 suggested aligning price support levels with market context to comply with WTO rules. Current support prices are compared to market price trends using three measures, including MAL loan rates and PLC reference prices under the 2014 farm bill. The level of \"price protection\" under the MAL and PLC programs is measured as the percent of monthly farm price observations below the MAL loan rates and PLC reference prices established under the 2014 farm bill for each program crop. An extended nine-year period from January 2008 through May 2017 is used to evaluate this measure. Monthly market price data are used to assess the policy parameters needed to achieve equal levels of price protection across program crops since January 2008. MAL loan rates and PLC reference prices are expressed as a percentage of monthly average farm prices (MAFPs) under the 2014 farm bill. Comparing MAFPs with MAL loan rates provides a sense of the relative price protection across program crops for the crop years 2014 through 2016. The MAL program evaluates upland cotton and rice prices against monthly averages of their respective AWPs. MAL loan rates for program crops range between 29% and 99% of the MAFPs or AWPs. Some crops have higher loan rates compared to their AWPs or MAFPs, while others have lower rates during the 2014-2016 period. Loan rates for barley, chickpeas, mustard seed, and rapeseed are lower as a percentage of monthly prices. A comparison of MAFPs with PLC reference prices shows the level of relative price support across program crops. PLC program uses 12-month SAFP to calculate payments, capturing more variation than monthly prices. Peanuts have a reference price at 131% of MAFPs, with canola at 123%. Some program crops have PLC reference prices lower than their average farm prices. The frequency of monthly AWPs or MAFPs falling below loan rates determines eligibility for MAL benefits. When the marketing loan rate exceeds the market price, it acts as a support price. Evaluating price protection under MAL and PLC programs using data from January 2008 to May 2017. MAL loan rates set in 2008 have not been adjusted despite market price increases. Market prices rose from 2006 to 2013, consistently above MAL loan rates for most program crops since January 2008. Only upland cotton had prices below its loan rate in 8% of observations. The three-year period of high prices from 2011-2013 likely influenced the establishment of high PLC reference prices in the 2014 farm bill. Percentage of MAFPs falling below PLC reference price varied from 0% for soybeans to 78% for peanuts from January 2008 to May 2017. The percentage of monthly average farm prices falling below PLC reference price varied from 0% for soybeans to 78% for peanuts. Adjusting MAL loan rates or PLC reference prices could establish parity in price protection across program crops, based on market price trends. The choice of threshold for price protection is arbitrary. The comparison of monthly market price trends for different commodities reveals variations in price protection levels. Three price protection rates (20%, 25%, and 30%) are analyzed for MAL loan rates, showing adjustments needed to achieve parity. This approach focuses solely on price protection aspects of each program, ignoring other policy reasons for setting support levels. The comparison of monthly market price trends for different commodities reveals variations in price protection levels. Table 2 presents adjustments needed to achieve parity at 20%, 25%, and 30% price protection rates. MAL loan rates would need significant increases for all program crops to achieve price protection parity. Barley would require a 133% increase, soybeans 91%, corn 83%, and sunflowers 78%. Cotton and peanuts already have substantial price protection. The comparison of monthly market price trends for different commodities shows adjustments needed to achieve price protection parity at various levels. For a 40% price-protection rate, PLC reference prices would need to be adjusted for peanuts, canola, sorghum, and rice. Other major program crops would also require adjustments to achieve parity. This report compares federal support rates across program crops. The report compares federal support rates across program crops using various analytical approaches. Disparities in support levels among crops can impact resource allocations and market decisions, potentially leading to unintended consequences. Critics question the justification for subsidies, but support levels are important in congressional debates. The report evaluates federal support rates for program crops from January 2008 to May 2017. Peanuts and cottonseed receive higher price protection under the MAL and PLC programs compared to other crops. Canola, sorghum, and rice also have greater support levels. Soybeans and pulse crops receive lower price protection. Loan rates and reference prices used in the analysis are arbitrary but show consistent outcomes. Results from past market conditions may not predict future outcomes. Changing market circumstances in the future could lead to different support payments for program crops compared to past outcomes."
