    "content": "The Act titled \"South Dakota Tribal Nursing Facilities Act of 2002\" is established for the purpose of improving nursing facilities in tribal communities. The South Dakota Tribal Nursing Facilities Act of 2002 aims to address the lack of nursing facilities on Indian reservations in South Dakota, where the highest rate of poverty is found. This lack of facilities hinders access to long-term health care for Indian elders, who are increasingly becoming a significant part of tribal communities in the state. The great distances between reservations and off-reservation nursing facilities further discourage their use by the elderly. There is a critical need for nursing facilities on Indian reservations in South Dakota to meet the elderly and assisted-living needs of tribal members. A South Dakota law imposes a moratorium on licensing new nursing facilities in the state, impacting access to care for Indian elders. The South Dakota moratorium on nursing facility licensure hinders Indian tribes from developing needed facilities on reservations. The United States aims to support tribes in providing nursing facilities for elderly members. This Act aims to facilitate the development of nursing facilities owned by Indian tribes despite State law impediments. The Act aims to support Indian tribes in developing nursing facilities on reservations in South Dakota, despite State law obstacles, to ensure access to healthcare for tribal members under the Medicaid program. ELIGIBILITY OF CERTAIN NURSING FACILITIES FOR MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT. Eligible nursing facilities can receive Medicaid reimbursement if they meet specific conditions and have an approved plan. Eligible nursing facilities seeking Medicaid reimbursement must submit a plan to the Secretary, including evidence of licensing by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, and agreement to perform state functions under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days or request additional information. The term \"applicable nursing facility\" refers to a nursing facility owned or operated by an Indian tribe or tribal organization in South Dakota unable to obtain a state license due to a moratorium. The terms \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" are defined as per the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act."
