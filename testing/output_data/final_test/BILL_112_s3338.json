    "content": "The Act titled \"Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2012\" aims to enhance healthcare quality by improving the safety and precision of medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures, reducing duplication of services, and lowering costs. It amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. Effective 42 months after enactment, personnel performing medical imaging or radiation therapy must be fully qualified with current certification from a designated organization. Personnel performing medical imaging or radiation therapy must have current State licensure or certifications within the scope of practice defined by the State. The authority of a State to define requirements for licensure, certification, or registration, and the scope of practice of personnel, shall not be diminished. The Secretary shall not require State licensure for personnel performing the technical component of medical imaging or radiation therapy procedures. Exemptions from qualification standards and payment provisions for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants in radiation therapy procedures. Individuals currently enrolled in nuclear medicine or radiation programs are excluded. The Secretary will designate certification organizations for medical imaging and radiation therapy. Individuals in training programs must become fully qualified within 6 months of program completion. The Secretary will consult with experts to establish a program for therapy services related to medical imaging and radiation. Factors considered include the organization's process for integrating new services. The certification program of an organization is evaluated based on factors such as education requirements, nonprofit status, examination prerequisites, and continuing education for certified individuals. The certification organization's accreditation is evaluated based on factors like fees, timely application reviews, and approval by the Secretary. The term 'accrediting body' refers to a nonprofit organization with accreditation programs for certification examinations, establishing standards for recordkeeping and conflict of interest prevention. The Secretary will provide a process for individuals with equivalent education, training, and experience through regulation. The Secretary will establish a process for individuals with equivalent education, training, and experience to demonstrate their qualifications in imaging modalities or radiation therapy procedures. This process may include documenting years and types of experience, settings where experience was obtained, and verification by supervising physicians or qualified hospital personnel. Eligibility criteria will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a process for individuals to demonstrate qualifications in imaging modalities or radiation therapy procedures. Eligibility requires prior experience in performing or planning technical components. Regulations for certification organizations will be promulgated within 12 months, with designations and a list provided within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary will review certification organizations applying for designation and publish a list. Periodic reviews will be conducted, and the list may be modified. Approval may be withdrawn by the Secretary. The Secretary may withdraw approval of a certification organization if it no longer meets requirements. Individuals certified by a removed organization within 12 months will still be recognized. Individuals certified by a certification organization that is removed from the approved list will still be considered certified for the remaining period of their certification. The chief executive officer of a State can request alternative standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy in rural or underserved areas. The Secretary may waive standards for rural areas or health professional shortage areas. Individuals providing medical imaging for mammograms must meet regulations under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. Medical imaging refers to procedures used for detecting, diagnosing, treating, or impacting disease progression in humans. The term 'perform' in medical imaging or radiation therapy involves exposing a patient to radiation or positioning them for the exposure. The term 'plan' refers to preparing for the procedure by evaluating. The performance of a procedure on a patient involves evaluating site-specific information to customize the procedure, based on radiation dose distribution analysis or direct measurement of dose. Radiation therapy is defined as any procedure intended for disease treatment through radiation emission. Standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy are outlined in Section 4. Standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy are outlined in Section 4 of the Social Security Act, specifying requirements for individuals performing technical components of medical imaging examinations or radiation therapy procedures. Payment under this section is contingent on meeting established standards. Individuals must meet the standards set by the Secretary under Section 355 of the Social Security Act for medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to specific committees on the effects of the Act, including the impact of standards on diagnostic accuracy and patient safety for individuals qualified to perform medical imaging or radiation therapy services. Reimbursed entities must contribute data for the report."
