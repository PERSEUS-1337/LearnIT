    "content": "The \"Asthma Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Asthma Act\" highlights the rising prevalence of asthma in the US, affecting 14.6 million Americans, with 4.4 million being children. Pediatric asthma rates have increased by 76% since 1982, especially among African American and Hispanic children. Asthma is the third leading cause of preventable hospitalizations, with 1.6 million ER visits in 1995. Improper diagnosis and management can be life-threatening, leading to 5,667 deaths in 1996. The rising prevalence of asthma in the US has led to significant costs, with over $6 billion in 1990. Early recognition and proper management, along with public health interventions, can help control asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) aims to raise awareness about asthma management. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) aims to increase awareness of asthma as a chronic disease and promote effective management through education. Despite knowledge of effective management strategies, current federal policy and funding for asthma education and treatment are inadequate. Additional federal support is needed to educate patients on managing asthma and address environmental factors affecting the disease.

Additional federal support is needed to educate patients on managing asthma and address environmental factors affecting the disease. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) is set to receive additional funding of $4,100,000 annually from 2000 to 2004 to expand the program. A coordinating committee will report to Congress on the scope of the asthma problem in the United States.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, will conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on asthma prevalence, severity, and management. This includes telephone surveys and health care facility surveillance. Data on the prevalence of children with asthma in each State and childhood mortality rates associated with asthma will be compiled and published annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will receive additional funding of $8,200,000 annually from 2000 to 2004 for asthma surveillance nationally and in each State. SEC. 5. Grants for community outreach on asthma information, education, and services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to nonprofit private entities for community outreach projects providing asthma information, education, and referrals to health programs. Preference is given to projects in communities identified by grant applicants.

Grant recipients must evaluate project effectiveness. $4,100,000 is allocated annually for this initiative from 2000 to 2004. States are required to develop action plans for asthma and may receive financial incentives for children's health insurance programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will carry out a program to encourage states to assist children with asthma. States may receive grants to implement activities for children's asthma if their plan under the Children's Health Insurance Program meets the Secretary's satisfaction. Matching funds are required for the costs.

The Secretary of Education may provide grants to local educational agencies for asthma-related activities at elementary and secondary schools in low-income communities. The Secretary of Education may provide grants to local education agencies and State public health officials to collaborate on asthma management programs in schools.

The Secretary of Education may provide grants for asthma management programs in schools, including purchasing equipment, hiring nurses, training personnel, and simplifying medication access. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" are based on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. $4,100,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004 for this purpose. Sense of Congress regarding hospitals and managed care plans includes encouraging hospitals to provide asthma education to patients and families upon discharge, establish telephone services for patients, and communicate with primary health providers. Managed care organizations should disseminate asthma clinical guidelines, collect asthma data, and offer education to patients and families. Congress emphasizes the importance of promoting asthma guidelines and recommendations from the Public Health Service in all federal, state, and local activities. Collaboration with medical, educational, and environmental organizations, as well as advocates for those affected by asthma, is essential in designing these initiatives."
