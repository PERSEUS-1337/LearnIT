    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 84506.5 of the Government Code in California is amended to require that advertisements supporting or opposing a candidate through independent expenditures must include a disclaimer stating it was not authorized or paid for by the candidate or their committee. Mailed advertisements must also have the disclaimer located close to the recipient's name and address. The disclosure statement in advertisements must be clearly visible with specific design requirements, including font size and color contrast. Amendments to Government Code sections 84507 and 84511 specify the formatting and presentation of disclosure statements for clarity and accessibility. Section 84511 of the Government Code is amended to apply to committees making expenditures for individuals appearing in advertisements supporting or opposing ballot measures. Committees must file a report within 10 days of the expenditure, identifying the measure in the advertisement. The advertisement expenditure must include details such as the measure, date, amount, recipient's name, and occupation. A disclosure statement is required for committees stating the spokesperson's payment source. An advertisement paid for by a committee must include a disclosure statement stating that individuals portrayed are compensated spokespersons. The disclosure statement can be omitted if the occupation identified in the report is similar to the one portrayed in the advertisement. The committee must provide documentation of the individual's license or training for the occupation in the advertisement. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes. The bill aims to further the Political Reform Act of 1974 by ensuring transparency in advertisement disclosures to protect Californians' right to vote. It is deemed urgent for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety, emphasizing the importance of an informed electorate."
