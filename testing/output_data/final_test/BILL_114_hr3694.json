    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act\" or the \"STOP Organ Trafficking Act\". Congress finds that approximately 10 percent of transplanted kidneys worldwide are illegally obtained, often from vulnerable individuals or prisoners. The World Health Assembly and the United Nations have urged member-states to protect the poor and vulnerable from organ traffickers due to a lack of adequate laws. The European Union and the United States have taken steps to combat organ trafficking by adopting rules and ratifying protocols to prevent exploitation. A United Nations report highlights the economic and social disparities that contribute to illicit organ trade. The illicit organ trafficking market preys on vulnerable individuals who are poor, unemployed, and easily deceived or extorted. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress acknowledges that the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs, especially from children, is a violation of human rights and ethical standards. This practice contradicts the principles of ethical behavior and goes against internationally accepted medical ethics. Establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems with strong enforcement mechanisms is crucial in combating trafficking of persons for organ removal. The United States policy aims to combat international trafficking of persons for organ removal, promote voluntary organ donation systems with enforcement mechanisms, and uphold human dignity and security. Additionally, the Act allows for the revocation or denial of passports to individuals involved in organ trafficking. The Secretary of State has the authority to deny or revoke passports for individuals convicted of organ trafficking offenses under the National Organ Transplant Act. Additionally, amendments to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 are made. Amendments to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 include defining trafficking of persons for organ removal as a criminal offense. The Secretary of State can deny or revoke passports for those convicted of organ trafficking under the National Organ Transplant Act.

REPORTING. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress on trafficking of persons for organ removal, including sources, practices, and prevention efforts by the Department of State and other countries.

The Secretary of State may include any necessary reports or information sources in the annual report on trafficking of persons for organ removal. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
