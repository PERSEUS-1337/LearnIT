    "content": "The \"Education Opportunity Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. Congress acknowledges that the academic rigor of a student's high school curriculum significantly impacts their likelihood of completing a college degree. Some schools fail to offer challenging coursework, disproportionately affecting students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. To address these disparities and improve college readiness, it is essential to provide all students with access to a rigorous curriculum. Providing grants to capable students from low-income families will increase access to challenging coursework, leading to success in college or the workplace. Education Opportunity Grants for eligible low-income secondary school students are being introduced through an amendment to the Higher Education Act of 1965. This initiative aims to provide financial assistance to students from low-income families, enabling them to access challenging coursework and ultimately succeed in college or the workforce. The Secretary can award grants to low-income secondary school students for eligible courses at institutions of higher education, providing postsecondary academic credit. Eligible courses must not be remedial in nature and can be taken at the institution, secondary school, or through telecommunications. The term 'eligible low-income secondary school student' refers to a junior or senior enrolled in a secondary school with a family income below 185 percent of the poverty line, making satisfactory progress towards graduation. The Secretary can award grants for eligible courses at institutions of higher education, not remedial in nature, for postsecondary academic credit. The Secretary awards grants to eligible low-income secondary school students for tuition costs of eligible courses, capped at $4,050 per academic year. Tuition costs are the lesser of the institution's charges or $1,200. The Education Opportunity Act allows eligible low-income secondary school students to receive grants for tuition costs of eligible courses, capped at $4,050 per academic year. The grants supplement other non-Federal funds and do not affect future eligibility for Federal Pell Grants. The Education Opportunity Act provides grants for low-income secondary school students for tuition costs, capped at $4,050 per academic year. An authorization of $50,000,000 is allocated for the grant program for five fiscal years, separate from Federal Pell Grants funding."
