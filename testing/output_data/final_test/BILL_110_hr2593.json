The Congress finds that the United States-Mexico border area contains valuable protected Federal lands, and collaboration between the two countries is needed to address conservation and security issues. Federal lands along the border have suffered damage from unauthorized activities. Increased coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and Federal land management agencies can help protect Federal lands along the United States-Mexico border from unauthorized activities while improving border security. The purpose of this Act is to provide the highest protection possible for Federal lands and resources from unauthorized immigration, smuggling, and border enforcement activities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"protected land\" refers to land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned, who is defined as the Secretary of Homeland Security. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF BORDERLAND ENVIRONMENT. Border Protection Strategy: By May 30, 2008, the Secretaries of Homeland Security, Interior, and Agriculture must develop a strategy to protect various types of land along the U.S. border, including National Parks, National Forests, Tribal lands, and other relevant areas under their jurisdiction. The Secretary, in consultation with Tribal officials, will develop a border protection strategy for tribal lands along the United States-Mexico border. Required training includes Federal land resource training for Customs and Border Protection agents on protected land and cultural resource training for agents on tribal lands. Coordination with relevant agencies of the Department of the Interior or Agriculture is necessary to ensure appropriate training. The Secretary, in consultation with Tribal officials, will develop a border protection strategy for tribal lands along the United States-Mexico border. Required training includes Federal land resource training for Customs and Border Protection agents on protected land and cultural resource training for agents on tribal lands. Coordination with relevant agencies of the Department of the Interior or Agriculture is necessary to ensure appropriate training. The Secretary concerned shall develop an inventory of costs incurred relating to illegal border activity and enforcement activities, including infrastructure, equipment, training, maintenance, construction, restoration of resources, recapitalization, and operations. Recommendations for a cost recovery mechanism will be developed jointly with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. The Secretary will submit recommendations to congressional committees regarding a cost recovery mechanism for items related to illegal border activity by May 30, 2008. SEC. 5. BORDER BARRIER CONSTRUCTION. The amendment to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 involves providing fencing, vehicle barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, sensors, and other surveillance tools on public lands in consultation with various federal and local officials. The amendment involves updating the year from 2007 to 2008 and prioritizing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, sensors, and other border enforcement techniques on federal lands. Additionally, Section 102(c) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is repealed. The amendment updates the year and prioritizes the use of border enforcement techniques on federal lands. The Secretary of Homeland Security is prohibited from starting fencing construction on lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior until the Border Protection Strategy is submitted to Congress. SEC. 6. BORDERLANDS CONSERVATION FUND. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects related to improved management of ecologically sensitive species, wildlife habitat, and mitigating impacts of border enforcement. Grants will be awarded to eligible organizations for conservation efforts. The Borderland Conservation Fund aims to sustain viable populations of species in the US-Mexico borderlands by supporting wildlife management and habitat protection. Project proposals for species conservation can be submitted by local wildlife management authorities in the US or Mexico to the Secretary of the Interior. The Borderland Conservation Fund supports wildlife management and habitat protection in the US-Mexico borderlands. Project proposals can be submitted by local wildlife authorities in either country, as well as by experienced non-governmental organizations. Proposals must include a concise statement of the proposed action, methods to achieve goals, applicant information, cost estimate, and mechanisms for project oversight. The Secretary establishes a protocol for reviewing proposals for Borderland Conservation Fund monies and calls for proposals annually. Projects must enhance wildlife conservation and habitat, involve local stakeholders, have necessary endorsements, and disclose funding sources. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing conservation efforts for wildlife species and their habitat by developing scientific information on population trends, threats, and habitat improvement methods. It also includes implementing conservation plans and promoting cooperation among local citizens and wildlife. The curr_chunk emphasizes promoting cooperation among local citizens, wildlife, and habitat management agencies to implement approved programs under the Act. It also aims to build local capacity for scientifically sound wildlife and habitat management programs. Additionally, the Secretary gives preference to projects with matching non-Federal funds and requires recipients to submit reports outlining project accomplishments, deviations, and financial expenditures. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on achievements in borderland conservation under the Act. A separate Borderland Conservation Fund is established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, funded by transfers, appropriations, and interest earned. The Secretary can request funds from the Borderland Conservation Fund for approved purposes. The Borderland Conservation Fund allows the Secretary to determine necessary amounts for projects without further appropriation. Administrative expenses are limited to 3% or $80,000 annually. At least 30% of funds must be used for projects in Mexico. The Treasury Secretary will invest excess fund amounts. The Borderland Conservation Fund allows the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interest-bearing US obligations. Investments can be made on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any obligations acquired can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the fund. Transfers of required amounts to the fund must be made at least annually. The fund is transferred monthly from the Treasury's general fund based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments are made for any excess or shortfall in prior estimates. The Secretary can accept donations for assistance under section 4, which are then transferred to the Treasury. $5,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to the fund annually from 2009 to 2013 through the Secretary."
