    "content": "The virtual agent learns language in a 2D maze-like world by interacting with images, listening to a virtual teacher, and taking actions for rewards. It learns language through sentence-directed navigation and question answering, simultaneously learning visual representations, language, and action control. The agent can interpret new word combinations by transferring new words from language prediction answers. The proposed model outperforms comparison methods for interpreting zero-shot sentences and demonstrates human-interpretable outputs. Behaviorism theory emphasizes social interaction in language development, with feedback from parents playing a crucial role. This paper explores these ideas in a 2D virtual world for interactive language acquisition. In a 2D virtual world, language acquisition occurs through interactive settings, emphasizing dynamic interactions with environments. The model aims to ground language by linking words to environment concepts, allowing words to have specific meanings in context. This approach goes beyond traditional language learning methods by focusing on procedural semantics and the ability of words to pick out referents. The goal of the paper is to acquire \"in-context\" word meanings for language learning in AI systems. It is important for the agent to generalize and interpret zero-shot sentences containing new words. This approach goes beyond traditional methods by focusing on procedural semantics and linking words to environment concepts. The paper aims to acquire word meanings in AI systems by focusing on zero-shot sentences and generalization. A 2D maze-like world called XWORLD is used as a testbed for interactive language acquisition and transfer learning. The agent in the XWORLD environment has two language use cases: navigation (NAV) and question answering (QA). NAV involves navigating to correct places based on language commands, while QA requires generating single-word answers to questions. These tasks test language comprehension and prediction simultaneously. The agent must answer questions while navigating, and sessions end when the target is reached or time is up. Word meanings are transferred from single-word answers to sentences through a common concept detection function, linking grounding and prediction. The model's novelty lies in grounding and prediction through a common concept detection function. It enables the agent to understand new objects in questions without retraining, and navigate to new objects without retraining the navigation pipeline. The challenges include a vast state space and intra-class variance, requiring accurate perception of the environment. The environment demands accurate perception and language generalization from the agent, with a vast goal space and complex language commands. The agent must interpret zero-shot sentences and ground new words in familiar contexts. The recent work BID14 BID4 addresses ZS1 but not ZS2 sentences, describing an end-to-end model for the agent to acquire language from scratch without assumptions of language semantics or syntax. Interaction involves learning from the teacher and the environment, avoiding hard-coded syntax or semantics like early systems. The model learns visual representations, language, and action control from RGB images, sentences, and rewards. It is evaluated on randomly generated XWORLD maps with over 1.6 million distinct sentences. The language is grounded, allowing words to pick out referents in the environment. The agent shows good generalization ability for zero-shot sentences, with high success rates and accuracies. The model achieves high QA accuracies of 97.8% for ZS1 and 97.7% for ZS2 in a zero-shot setting. It incorporates two objectives: maximizing NAV reward and minimizing QA classification cost. The model uses reinforcement learning for NAV and supervised setting for QA training. It takes inputs of images and sentences, focusing on language grounding to link language with actions. The agent must link language concepts to environment entities to take action based on instructions in the current visual context. A common approach is to encode the sentence with an RNN and the image with a CNN, then combine the representations using multimodal, action, and prediction modules. Different implementations use vector concatenation or element-wise product for fusion, with the fusion point varying throughout the process. The model processes input data through blackbox computations, with the agent at the center for navigation actions. Predicted answer, navigation action, and critic value are generated. Language grounding and computational routines are intertwined, posing challenges for processing new words in complex entanglement. The approach aims to disentangle language grounding from other computations in the model by defining language grounding as concept detection problems, where each word is treated as a detector. This allows for transferring word meanings from language prediction to grounding. The model architecture is illustrated in Figure 2, defining grounding as the process of linking a sentence to an image representation. The new framework proposed, DISPLAYFORM0, emphasizes explicit grounding strategy in language-vision fusion. This strategy allows only essential information to flow downstream, enhancing the model's performance in concept detection tasks. The new framework DISPLAYFORM0 emphasizes explicit grounding strategy in language-vision fusion to improve concept detection tasks. This strategy abstracts irrelevant input signals and guarantees consistent performance based on grounding results x for tasks like NAV and QA. It disentangles language grounding from subsequent computations, making them language-independent routines. The new framework emphasizes explicit grounding strategy in language-vision fusion to improve concept detection tasks by abstracting irrelevant input signals and guaranteeing consistent performance. It disentangles language grounding from subsequent computations, making them language-independent routines. The roles played by individual words in grounding are interpretable, providing a link between language grounding and prediction. The paper discusses the decomposition of x cube into low-rank matrices and the relaxation of grounding definitions for differentiability. It introduces the roles of x loc for spatial attention, x feat for feature map selection, and modulation of h by x feat. Additionally, it mentions a paper proposing early modulation of visual processing based on linguistic input. The paper introduces a novel approach to grounding parameters of a CNN on linguistic input, emphasizing the difference from existing visual attention models. It discusses violations of definitions in previous works and proposes a pipeline for image spatial attention computation. The focus is on language prediction and concept detection functions related to spatial-relation words.

It discusses violations of definitions in previous works and proposes a pipeline for image spatial attention computation. The focus is on language prediction and concept detection functions related to spatial-relation words. The concept detection operates by sliding over the spatial domain of the feature cube h, using parametric feature maps to learn spatial features. The attention cube x cube illustrates how x loc attends to image regions and x feat selects feature maps for accurate answers based on the linguistic input.

It introduces a pipeline for image spatial attention computation, focusing on language prediction and concept detection functions. The detection function operates by sliding over the spatial domain of the feature cube h, using parametric feature maps to learn spatial features. The scoring is based on \u03c7 indicating the detection response of the feature vector. The prediction outputs a word given a question and an image, with M generating a score vector over the lexicon. The paper discusses a novel approach to grounding CNN parameters based on linguistic input, focusing on language prediction and concept detection functions. The scoring is based on \u03c7 indicating the detection response of the feature vector. To predict an answer, x feat selects relevant feature maps for the question. Different feature maps encode various image attributes. x loc is built on the detection function \u03c6, computing score maps of individual words and merging them. The sequence function \u03c4 selects and organizes words in a sentence. A 2D convolution involves flipping and cross correlation. The attention map of \"northwest\" is used as an offset filter for \"apple.\" The aggregation function \u03a5 combines score maps of individual words.\u03c6 enables the transfer of new words. Neural module networks rely on labeled trees for training, but we propose learning based on word attention to bypass the need for structured data. A sentence is fed to a bidirectional RNN to generate a sentence embedding and word context vectors. An interpreter meta controller is used iteratively to process the sentence. The interpreter meta controller computes word attention using cosine similarity and gated recurrent units. It then feeds the attended word to a detection function and aggregates the score map using convolution and sigmoid functions. The interpreter outputs the location of the word, enabling the agent to reason about spatial relations in an egocentric manner. The agent utilizes a spatial-relation word attention map as a 2D convolutional offset filter to attend to specified regions. The channel mask x feat is determined solely from the sentence itself. XWORLD focuses on grounded language acquisition, similar to MaseBase. The problem of grounded language acquisition and generalization is emphasized in the current work, drawing inspiration from AI roadmap. Unlike other settings focused on visual perception and control, this setting incorporates multiple perceptual modalities for meaning. Several end-to-end systems also address language grounding problems in a simulated world with deep RL. The recent work on zero-shot multitask learning treats language tokens as labels for identifying skills. The problem of grounding language in perception can be traced back to early work. The language learning problem is related to learning to ground language in images and videos. The navigation task is relevant to robotics navigation under language commands. The question-answering task is relevant to image question answering. The interactive setting of learning to accomplish tasks is similar to learning to play video games from pixels. The experiments involve learning to play video games from pixels, with language data including NAV commands, QA questions, and answers. The environment configurations are randomly generated from numerous possibilities on a 7x7 map. The model is evaluated on various navigation commands and question-answering tasks. The experiments involve learning to play video games from pixels, with language data including NAV commands, QA questions, and answers. The model is evaluated on various navigation commands and question-answering tasks. Four comparison methods and one ablation method are described, including a variant of the model with a contextual attention model and an adaptation of a model proposed for VQA. The model is trained on XWORLD using a CNN and LSTM architecture adapted from previous models for VQA and image captioning. An ablation study without the QA pipeline shows the model trained only on navigation tasks. In experiments, all six approaches are trained with a small learning rate and batch size, with testing done on 50k sessions for navigation and question answering tasks. Training and testing sentences are sampled from the same distribution, showing low rewards for VL and CE approaches. The approaches VL and CE have low rewards without convergences, possibly due to not using spatial attention. CA and SAN perform slightly worse than the approach being discussed. The ablation NAVA shows varying performance, with rewards ranging from high to low. The QA pipeline shows effective training of the NAV pipeline, with high accuracies despite different results. QA is easier than NAV due to stronger training signals and absence of control module learning. The ability of interpreting zero-shot sentences is a key question, with comparison to CA and SAN in a zero-shot setting. In a zero-shot setting, two language conditions were tested by excluding word pairs from NAV commands and QA questions. Different types of word combinations were considered, and a percentage of words were randomly held out during training. The evaluation focused on zero-shot sentences containing the held-out words, with results shown in FIG5. Three conclusions were drawn from the results, highlighting the sensitivity of generalization to the amount of held-out data. The results in FIG5 show that ZS1 sentences are easier to interpret than ZS2 sentences. Neural networks have inherent capability for this. ZS2 sentences are challenging for CA and SAN, with significant drops in navigation success rates and QA accuracies. Our model maintains consistent results until a high percentage of held-out data. It achieves impressive success rates and accuracies even with a high number of new object words. Comparing success-rate curves with accuracy curves in ZS2 reveals interesting insights. In ZS2, the agent generalizes better on QA than on NAV, confirming that QA is an easier task. Evaluating NAV is necessary as it requires additional language grounding. An outlier command type, nav bw obj, shows less sensitivity to changes in X. CA learns to cheat by identifying image regions with specific patterns for this command. Neural networks exploit data in unexpected ways without constraints. The model demonstrates strong generalization on both ZS1 and ZS2 sentences. The model shows strong generalization ability on challenging ZS2 sentences, hinting at scalability to larger language spaces. Future goals include adapting the model to a 3D world for more complex vision-related computations. Key elements include attention cube x cube for language grounding, channel mask x feat, and attention map x loc. The interpreter relies on score maps \u03c7 computed from word embeddings and feature cubes. A more advanced definition of \u03c6 is needed for 3D object detection. Spatial attention transformation is modeled as a 2D convolution, but a better method is required for 3D spatial relations on 2D images. A working memory like an LSTM in the action module is crucial for navigation in a partially observable 3D environment. Despite the necessary changes, the explicit grounding strategy and common detection function show promise for adaptation. The end-to-end model of a virtual agent for language acquisition in a 2D world shows promising results in generalization and adaptation. The agent can interpret new word combinations and extrapolate to zero-shot sentences. A shared detection function between language grounding and prediction supports this generalization ability by transferring word meanings during testing. This work aims to shed light on language acquisition and generalization. The curr_chunk discusses a list of various objects and animals in a 3D world, obtained from the 2D XWORLD. The work aims to shed light on language acquisition and generalization in a 3D world. The curr_chunk discusses the channel mask x feat, allowing the model to select feature maps from a feature cube h and predict answers to questions. It involves sampling 10k QA questions and computing x feat for each using the grounding module L. The channel mask x feat allows the model to select feature maps from a feature cube h and predict answers to questions. The 10k QA questions are divided into groups based on different answers, and an Euclidean distance matrix is computed to analyze the distances between question features. The model can look at different subsets of features for questions of different topics, demonstrating the organization of feature maps according to image attributes. The interpreter organizes feature maps based on image attributes. Word context vectors are visualized and projected to a 2-dimensional space using PCA and t-SNE. The visualization shows how the interpreter differentiates content words from grammatical words. The interpreter differentiates content words from grammatical words by organizing feature maps based on image attributes. Word context vectors are visualized and projected to a 2-dimensional space using PCA and t-SNE. The attention map x loc is computed from the word context vectors, showing successful selection of content words by the interpreter. The computation of the attention map x loc is visualized, with some intermediate attention maps discarded based on the update gate \u03c1 i. The environment terrain map x terr perfectly detects objects and blocks, guiding the agent to navigate successfully. The agent has 28 steps to reach a target, with 1 to 5 objects and 0 to 15 wall blocks on the map. Positive reward for reaching the correct location is 1.0, while hitting walls incurs a negative reward of 0.2 and stepping on non-target objects incurs a negative reward of 1.0. Each step carries a time penalty of 0.1. The environment terrain map helps the agent navigate by detecting objects and blocks. The agent has 28 steps to reach a target, with rewards and penalties for different actions. The teacher in the environment has a vocabulary size of 185, with various spatial relations, colors, object classes, and grammatical words. Each object class has 3 different instances, randomly sampled when the environment is reset. There are 16 types of sentences the teacher can speak, including NAV commands and QA questions. The teacher in the environment has a vocabulary size of 185, with spatial relations, colors, object classes, and grammatical words. There are 16 types of sentences the teacher can speak, including NAV commands and QA questions, with a total of 1,639,015 distinct sentences. Each sentence type corresponds to a specific task the agent must learn to accomplish. The environment image is a 156\u02c6156 egocentric RGB image, with a CNN having four convolutional layers. An additional parametric cube is appended to enable the agent to reason about spatial-relation words. The parametric cube, initialized with zero mean and standard deviation, aligns with CNN output channels. For navigation, x loc is the target on the image plane, but the agent must also consider walls and other objects in the environment. An environment terrain map x terr is computed by M A using a parameter vector f and sigmoid \u03c3 to detect navigation-relevant blocks. x terr is environment-dependent and unrelated to specific commands. After combining x loc and x terr, they are fed into another CNN with two convolutional layers and an MLP with three layers for action determination. The action module A consists of a two-layer MLP with 512 ReLU activated units in each layer. Adagrad BID9 with a learning rate of 10\u00b45 is used for stochastic gradient descent. The reward discount factor is 0.99 and parameters have a weight decay of 10\u00b44\u02c616. The model is trained end to end with a maximum interpretation step of 3. Baselines in Section 4.3 include an RNN with 512 units and a CNN with four convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected layer of size 512. The RNN in the current chunk has 512 units and goes through a three-layer MLP with 512 units each for QA or NAV. It follows the same configuration as VL with an RNN of 256 units. The agent has one million exploration steps with a linear decrease in exploration rate from 1 to 0.1. Experience replay is used to stabilize learning, storing inputs, rewards, and actions in a replay buffer. During training, experiences are stored in a replay buffer and sampled using a rank-based sampler. The gradient is computed to maximize expected reward and minimize TD error. Importance ratios are ignored for implementation simplicity. Curriculum learning is used to increase environment complexity gradually. During training, experiences are stored in a replay buffer and sampled using a rank-based sampler to maximize expected reward and minimize TD error. Curriculum learning is employed to gradually increase environment complexity by adjusting various quantities such as the size of open space, number of objects, wall blocks, object classes, and lengths of commands and questions. This curriculum is found to be crucial for efficient learning, supported by the idea that gradual changes aid in faster learning, as seen in children learning new words. In experiments, the curriculum is applied during training with 25k sessions, while testing is done without any curriculum at maximum difficulty."
