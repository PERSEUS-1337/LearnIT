    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Government Shutdowns Act\" and includes provisions for the automatic continuation of federal funding. The \"Stop Government Shutdowns Act\" allows for the automatic continuation of federal funding in the event of a lapse in appropriations, ensuring projects and activities from the previous fiscal year can continue without interruption. The \"Stop Government Shutdowns Act\" ensures that appropriations and funds for projects or activities will remain available until the enactment of an appropriation for the project, the enactment of the applicable appropriation Act for the fiscal year without provisions for the project, or the end of the fiscal year. SEC. 3. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.\n\nAppropriations made by section 2(a) shall be available to the extent and in the manner provided by the applicable appropriation Act. Appropriations and authority granted under this Act cover all obligations or expenditures for any project during the period funds are available.\n\nSEC. 4. USE OF FUNDS. No new projects can be initiated or resumed without available funds from the previous fiscal year. Appropriations from this Act can be used without time limitations for apportionments, but other laws still apply. Some programs may have high operation rates or complete distribution of funds within the specified period. The Act limits high initial rates for program operations and distributions of funds to avoid impinging on final funding prerogatives. Only limited funding actions permitted by the Act can be taken to ensure project continuation. Amounts for civilian personnel compensation can be apportioned to prevent furloughs within departments or agencies. The Act allows for funds to be used in accordance with the previous fiscal year's appropriation Act, with restrictions on non-personnel administrative expenses. It also ensures that the pay rate for members of the Armed Forces will not be decreased. Additionally, funds appropriated by the Act can be used despite certain authorization requirements from other laws. SEC. 5. ADJUSTMENT OF ACCOUNTS. Expenditures made under this Act will be charged to the appropriate funding source upon enactment of the corresponding bill into law. SEC. 6. ENTITLEMENTS AND OTHER MANDATORY PROGRAMS. Activities under certain programs will continue at current levels as authorized in previous appropriation Acts until the expiration of appropriations under the current Act. Obligations for mandatory payments may continue to be made within 30 days after the expiration of appropriations."
