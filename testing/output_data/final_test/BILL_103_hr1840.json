Section 402(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to provide that aid under the plan shall not be payable for children under 6 years old without written verification from a physician. The amended Section 402(a) of the Social Security Act requires children under 6 years old to be immunized every 6 months until 19 months, and then annually thereafter, following Surgeon General recommendations. States must also provide education and outreach on immunizations. The text chunk discusses outreach activities to increase awareness of preventive health care and immunizations for pre-school children, including informing the public about available services and support. Child may receive immunizations free or at a reduced charge. AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT. Section 658E(2) of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is amended to include a requirement for child care providers to ensure that each child receiving services is immunized according to recommendations from the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service. Child care providers must follow immunization requirements recommended by the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and provide written notice to parents of each child receiving services. Child care providers must notify parents of a child who fails to meet immunization requirements, giving them 30-45 days to correct the issue before terminating child care services. The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service will issue recommendations for immunizing children under 6 years of age based on the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recommendations will include contraindications and remedial actions. The Act and its amendments will take effect on the date of enactment, with specific provisions for payments to individuals and states under the Social Security Act. Amendments related to fiscal years will not apply before the enactment date."
