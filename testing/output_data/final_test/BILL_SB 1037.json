    "content": "Section 5343.5 of the Food and Agricultural Code in California is amended to require a notice to be posted at inspection stations near the state border regarding firearm regulations for residents and new residents. Residents are informed about state and federal laws governing the transportation and acquisition of firearms. Contact information for the California Department of Justice or local law enforcement is provided for questions or assistance. Section 803 of the Penal Code is amended to state that the limitation of time for prosecution is not tolled or extended, except when the same person is being prosecuted for the same conduct. The limitation of time does not start until the discovery of certain offenses, such as fraud, theft, or misconduct by a public officer. The Penal Code lists various offenses that can lead to prosecution, including grand theft, forgery, bribery by public officials, welfare fraud, insurance fraud, and violations of specific code sections related to business, professions, health, and safety. The Penal Code includes offenses such as grand theft, forgery, bribery, welfare fraud, insurance fraud, and violations of specific code sections related to health and safety, which may lead to prosecution. This includes violations of Section 103800 of the Health and Safety Code, Section 529a, and subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 368, with provisions for prosecution if the defendant is out of state at the time of the offense. The limitation of time for offenses under specific code sections does not start until the offense is discovered or could have reasonably been discovered. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person alleging they were a victim of certain crimes while under 18 years of age. This applies if the limitation period specified in certain sections has expired and the crime involved substantial sexual conduct. Independent evidence must corroborate the victim's allegation, especially if the victim was 21 or older at the time of the report. This evidence cannot include mental health professionals' opinions and must be admissible in trial. In criminal investigations of crimes against children, the limitations period is tolled during litigation challenging a grand jury subpoena until the final disclosure of evidence. (g) (1) A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of suspect's identity being conclusively established by DNA testing for certain crimes described in subdivision (c) of Section 290. DNA analysis must be completed within specific timeframes depending on the date of the offense. For crimes where evidence was seized under a warrant but is unavailable to the prosecuting authority due to evidentiary privilege or attorney work product claims, the time limit for filing a criminal complaint is tolled until the evidence is disclosed. This does not affect the definition or applicability of any evidentiary privilege or attorney work product. A criminal complaint can be filed within one year of discovering a hidden recording related to certain violations. In cases where a person flees the scene of an accident causing death or serious injury, a complaint can be filed within a specified time period or one year after the person is identified as a suspect, but not later than six years after the offense. (k) If a person flees the scene of an accident, a criminal complaint can be filed within one year of the person being identified as a suspect, but not later than six years after the offense. \n(l) The limitation of time for certain offenses involving bribery to public officials does not start until the offense is discovered.\n(m) The limitation of time for certain offenses does not start until one year after the discovery. The limitation period for certain firearm violations is within five years of the offense or discovery of the violation."
