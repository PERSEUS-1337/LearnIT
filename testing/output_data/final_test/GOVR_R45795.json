    "content": "U.S.-Iran relations have been adversarial since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran's support for armed factions in the Middle East is seen as a threat to U.S. interests. The U.S. has focused on constraining Iran's nuclear program and preventing its acquisition of new weaponry. In 2018, the Trump Administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement, citing concerns about Iranian behavior and nuclear development. The Administration's policy aims to apply maximum pressure on Iran's economy. The Trump Administration's policy aims to apply \"maximum pressure\" on Iran's economy to renegotiate the JCPOA and deny Iran revenue for strategic capabilities. Tensions escalated with the designation of the IRGC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in April 2019. Iran continues to support various terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and Al Qaeda operatives residing in Iran. The US ended sanctions exceptions for countries to purchase Iranian oil and has revoked waivers under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act. The Trump Administration accelerated the deployment of military forces to the Persian Gulf region in response to potential threats from Iran or its allies. Secretary of State Pompeo invoked emergency authority to approve over $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to deter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran responded to U.S. pressure by demonstrating its ability to harm global commerce and raise concerns about its nuclear activities. Tanker attacks in May 2019 were attributed to the IRGC, causing international pressure on the Trump Administration to reduce sanctions on Iran. On June 13, 2019, two Saudi tankers in the Gulf of Oman were attacked. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo attributed the attacks to Iran based on intelligence and previous Iranian actions in the region. Iran's allies in the area have also been involved in attacks, raising tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The United States holds Tehran responsible for actions of its regional allies. In mid-2019, Iran-linked forces carried out significant attacks, including a rocket fired into the \"Green Zone\" in Baghdad and a rocket attack on Saudi pipeline infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. These incidents led to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The Houthis claimed responsibility for attacks on Saudi targets, including an airport in Abha and energy installations. Despite their claims, U.S. and Saudi officials believe the attacks did not originate from Yemen. Secretary of State Pompeo accused Iran of a car bombing in Afghanistan, but experts doubt Iranian involvement. U.S.-Iran tensions escalated into direct hostilities following these incidents. On June 20, 2019, Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone near the Strait of Hormuz, leading to tensions between the two countries. President Trump ordered a strike on Iranian sites but called it off to avoid Iranian casualties. The U.S. later launched a cyberattack on Iranian equipment. On July 18, 2019, U.S. forces downed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. On July 4, 2019, authorities from Gibraltar impounded an Iranian tanker, the Grace I, for allegedly violating an EU embargo on oil to Syria. Iran termed the seizure an act of piracy. The IRGC Navy attempted to intercept a UK-owned tanker, the British Heritage, but was driven off by a British warship. On July 19, the IRGC Navy seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, near the Strait of Hormuz, claiming various reasons for the seizure. On July 22, 2019, the UK pursued diplomacy with Iran to resolve the Stena Impero seizure while sending naval vessels to secure UK shipping. Gibraltar released the ship, renamed Adrian Darya 1, despite US sanctions concerns. The ship delivered oil to Syria, leading to new US sanctions on related entities. Iran released the Stena Impero on September 22, 2019, amidst escalating tensions with the US and UK over tanker seizures and attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure. The US accused Iran of staging the attacks, despite claims by the Houthi movement in Yemen. The attacks on Saudi energy infrastructure by Iran escalated tensions with the US and Saudi Arabia. President Trump expressed a desire to avoid conflict with Iran and opted for modest increases in US forces in the region and new sanctions on Iran. The attacks raised questions about US security guarantees to Gulf states and Iran's military capabilities. The Trump Administration increased economic pressure on Iran through executive orders to block property of entities conducting transactions with Iran's key sectors. Sanctions were imposed on senior Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. On September 4, 2019, the United States offered up to $15 million to disrupt the financial operations of the IRGC and its Qods Force. The Trump Administration imposed additional sanctions on Iran's Central Bank and the National Development Fund of Iran in September 2019. The U.S. officials aimed to extend the arms transfer ban on Iran to prevent Russia and China from selling arms to Iran, increasing its military threat. Iranian officials have refused to renegotiate the JCPOA since the U.S. withdrawal in 2018. Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif emphasized the need for compensation for Iran to uphold the JCPOA, threatening to resume pre-agreement nuclear activities if not met. Iran threatened to resume pre-agreement nuclear activities if compensation for upholding the JCPOA was not provided. Despite several meetings, Iran has not firmly committed to the agreement, citing inadequate efforts by remaining JCPOA participants. In May 2019, Iran announced it had stopped some JCPOA measures but did not withdraw, including not transferring LEU or heavy water out of the country to maintain stockpile limits. Iran no longer sees itself bound by JCPOA limits on LEU and heavy water. Iran has exceeded JCPOA-mandated limits on heavy water stockpile, centrifuges, LEU stockpile, and uranium enrichment. Tehran is also conducting prohibited research and development activities. On January 5, 2020, Iran announced the final step in reducing its JCPOA commitments. Iran announced the final step in reducing its JCPOA commitments by setting aside the restriction on the number of centrifuges. The statement did not provide details on concrete changes to Iran's nuclear program, but mentioned readiness to resume commitments if sanctions are removed. President Rouhani characterized the actions as a withdrawal from commitments in an equal scale, waiting for the US and P4+1 to fulfill their obligations under the JCPOA. Iran is prepared to return to full commitments under the JCPOA if the US and P4+1 do the same. Iran's cooperation with the IAEA may be reduced if actions by the US and P4+1 harm the JCPOA. In December 2019, Iran was reportedly supplying short-range missiles to allied forces in Iraq, leading to indirect fire attacks on Iraqi military facilities where US forces are present. Secretary Pompeo warned of a decisive US response to any attacks by Iran or its proxies that harm Americans or allies. On December 27, 2019, a rocket attack in northern Iraq killed a U.S. contractor, leading to U.S. retaliatory airstrikes on Iran-backed Iraqi armed group Kata'ib Hezbollah. Iraqi leaders criticized the strikes as a violation. Iran sought to maintain political influence amidst protests in Iraq, leading to the resignation of Abd Al Mahdi. The U.S. announced sanctions on Iran-linked Iraqi groups, emphasizing cooperation with Iraqi leaders for the country's interests. Qasem Soleimani was involved in Baghdad's government transition process. Qasem Soleimani's involvement in Baghdad's government transition process is seen as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty by the U.S., leading to tensions and the storming of the U.S. Embassy by Iran-backed militias. On January 3, 2020, a U.S. drone strike killed IRGC-QF Commander Qasem Soleimani, leading to tensions between the U.S. and Iran. President Trump warned Iran of consequences for the attack. The head of the Popular Mobilization Forces and influential Iranian figure, Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Iraq's CoR voted to remove foreign troops from Iraqi soil. Soleimani was seen as a key figure in Iran with a direct line to Khamene'i. Some view him as crucial to Iran's regional influence, while others see him as just following government policy. The U.S. aims to avoid further escalation with Iran. On January 8, 2020, Iran retaliated for the killing of Soleimani with a ballistic missile strike on two Iraqi bases. The United States reported no casualties and had advanced warning of the attack. President Trump stated that Iran appeared to be standing down. Subsequently, about 110 U.S. military personnel were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. Iran's missile strike on Ayn al-Asad resulted in 110 U.S. military personnel diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, mostly concussions. Iran's growing missile capabilities, including precision targeting, have raised concerns in the region, prompting Israeli attacks on Iranian and Iran-allied targets in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. In March 2020, tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated after a rocket attack on Camp Taji in Iraq killed two U.S. military personnel and one British medic. The U.S. retaliated by striking sites near Baghdad used by Kata'ib Hezbollah for storing weapons. Despite the strikes, three U.S. service personnel were injured in another rocket attack. Three U.S. service personnel were injured in a rocket attack on Camp Taji, with two seriously wounded. Iraqi military personnel were also injured. The U.S. did not retaliate. The hostilities in Iraq coincided with political struggles to form a new government. Iran's efforts to unite factions in Iraq were evident, as well as ongoing tensions between Iran and the U.S. In April 2020, Iran resumed provocations in the Persian Gulf, including forcibly boarding a Hong Kong-flagged tanker. On April 22, President Trump instructed the U.S. Navy to shoot down Iranian gunboats if they harass American ships at sea. The IRGC also announced the launch of a military satellite into orbit, prompting a warning from Secretary of State Pompeo. On May 6, 2020, Gen. Mark Milley expressed concerns about Iran's satellite launch, highlighting worries about missile technology and security implications. U.S. partners and U.N. officials have called for de-escalation of tensions. The EU countries have not joined the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against Iran, but have urged Iran to negotiate a new JCPOA with limits on missile development. Some U.S. allies are working to deter Iran from attacking shipping in the Gulf. The U.S. and Iran lack diplomatic relations, with no high-level talks since the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA. Various third country leaders have tried to facilitate direct talks between Tehran and Washington. In 2019, efforts were made by several countries to facilitate direct talks between Tehran and Washington to ease U.S.-Iran tensions. Gulf countries and European leaders, including French President Macron, attempted to mediate but did not result in U.S.-Iran talks. President Trump expressed willingness to meet with Iranian President Rouhani during the U.N. General Assembly meetings. In September, President Trump considered supporting a French proposal to provide Iran with a credit line for talks, but Supreme Leader Khamenei rejected any U.S.-Iran dialogue. Rouhani and Zarif insist on lifting U.S. sanctions before negotiations. The U.S. increased military presence in the Persian Gulf region, adding 14,000 troops to the existing 60,000 forces. The United States increased military presence in the Persian Gulf region by deploying additional forces to military facilities in the Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The deployments included Patriot and THAAD missile defense systems, with some forces stationed at Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. In March 2020, U.S. forces in Iraq were redeployed from smaller bases to larger ones. In 2020, U.S. forces in Iraq were redeployed from smaller bases to larger ones due to a decreased threat from the Islamic State and to defend against attacks by Iran-backed militias. Some forces were withdrawn to other locations in the region. The U.S. also withdrew Patriot air defenses and combat aircraft from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf in early May 2019, denying any change in the assessment of the Iran threat. A new U.S.-led military operation called \"Operation Sentinel\" was formed to protect commercial shipping in the Gulf, Bab el-Mandeb Strait, and Suez Canal in response to Iran's naval actions. Operation Sentinel, now known as the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), involves the US, UK, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Albania, and Australia operating four sentry ships in the Gulf. Israel expressed interest in joining but is not listed as a participant. China also considered joining but has not made an announcement. The IMSC complements existing Gulf naval operations targeting smuggling, piracy, terrorism, and other threats. The United States, France, India, and Japan have separate maritime security missions in the Gulf to protect commercial ships. The Trump Administration's core objective is to contain Iran's hostile actions and prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The military is a tool to advance national objectives. The United States aims to contain Iran's hostile actions through various means, including increasing military presence and potentially using force to change the regime. However, military action may not be the best approach and could escalate the crisis. Some question the effectiveness of military power against Iran, considering China and Russia as more significant strategic challenges. The United States has been deploying additional military assets to the CENTCOM area to deter Iran's provocative actions and defend U.S. interests. However, there are concerns that deploying more assets may not necessarily deter Iran from using military force. Military inaction also poses risks, especially if Iran acquires a nuclear weapons capability. The United States is deploying military assets to deter Iran's actions, but there are concerns that more assets may not deter Iran. Military inaction poses risks if Iran acquires nuclear weapons capability. Additional policy options for military action against Iran's allies or proxies are being considered. The United States is considering military action against Iranian allies through air, ground, special operations, or cyber warfare. Retaliatory strikes against Iranian targets like IRGC Navy vessels, nuclear facilities, and military bases are also options. Another possibility is establishing a naval blockade of Iran. The United States is considering military action against Iranian allies through air, ground, special operations, or cyber warfare. Options include retaliatory strikes against Iranian targets like IRGC Navy vessels, nuclear facilities, and military bases. Another possibility is establishing a naval and/or air quarantine of Iran to prevent threats to vital waterways. Invasion of Iran to oust its regime is also among the options, although currently far from consideration due to potential risks and costs. The potential military actions against Iran include retaliatory strikes on Iranian targets, establishing a naval and air quarantine, and even invasion to change the regime. However, the occupation of Iran would require a significant number of U.S. forces due to Iran's large population and military strength. The fiscal costs of any military campaign are difficult to assess without a detailed plan and confidence in the outcome. The factors influencing the costs and logistics of potential military operations in the Persian Gulf or CENTCOM theater include the number of additional forces and equipment deployed, the mission set and intensity, potential facility upgrades or new construction, and the time required to achieve objectives. Combat operations would likely result in significant supplemental requests, especially if ground combat or post-conflict stabilization is involved. The time required to achieve U.S. objectives in military operations in the Persian Gulf or CENTCOM theater is crucial for cost analysis. President Trump mentioned in October 2019 that Saudi Arabia would pay for additional U.S. troops deployed for territorial defense and deterring Iranian aggression. This could potentially offset some U.S. costs, as seen with contributions from Persian Gulf states in the past. Negotiations between U.S. and Saudi officials are ongoing for cost-sharing on new deployments in the region. Congress has responded to tensions with Iran and questions on military force authorization. Recent events like attacks on tankers, Saudi oil facilities, and U.S. drone shoot down have raised concerns. Legislation passed by Congress specifies that authorization for the use of force against Iran is not granted. Congress has not prohibited the use of funds for operations against Iran, despite legislation specifying that authorization for the use of force against Iran is not granted. President Trump claimed broad authority to initiate military action without congressional approval, citing past administrations' practices. Secretary Pompeo suggested that the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against those responsible for 9/11 could potentially apply to Iran due to its ties with Al Qaeda. In June 2019, the Administration clarified that the 2001 and 2002 AUMF did not authorize military force against Iran, except for defense purposes. The killing of IRGC-QF Commander Soleimani in January 2020 raised concerns about the authority used and the potential for further military action. Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the Administration for launching the strike that killed Soleimani without Congressional authorization. President Trump later submitted a notification to Congress, but it only contained classified information, which Pelosi deemed as \"highly unusual.\" National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien claimed the 2002 AUMF authorized the strike on General Soleimani in Iraq. The House passed the No War Against Iran Act to repeal the 2002 AUMF. Legislation was introduced both supporting and condemning the strike, including resolutions to end U.S. involvement in conflict with Iran. On January 8, 2020, the House adopted a resolution under the War Powers Resolution to limit the use of US Armed Forces in hostilities against Iran. Questions have been raised about the constitutionality of such resolutions. Senator Tim Kaine introduced S.J.Res. 68 on January 9, 2020, to terminate the use of US armed forces for hostilities with Iran. The resolution to limit the use of US Armed Forces in hostilities with Iran was adopted by both the Senate and the House, but President Trump vetoed it on May 6, 2020. The Senate failed to override the veto the next day. President Trump criticized the resolution as an \"insulting\" election ploy by Democrats and argued that his constitutional authority to use military force is not limited to defense against imminent attack. Members are expected to continue assessing the congressional role in decisions regarding Iran. Congress is evaluating its role in decisions regarding potential hostilities with Iran. Key considerations include whether the President needs prior authorization from Congress, the implications of initiating hostilities without authorization, and how this affects Congress's status as an equal branch of government. The Iranian government's aggressive actions may pose challenges for the United States, leading to potential retaliatory strikes without a U.N. Security Council mandate. Congress needs to consider the costs and implications of increased military activity in the region, including the need to reconstitute forces post-conflict. The potential challenges posed by Iranian government's aggressive actions for the United States, including the need to reconstitute forces post-conflict and the impact on U.S. deficits and government spending."
