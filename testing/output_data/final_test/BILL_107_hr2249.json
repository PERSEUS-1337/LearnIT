    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gasoline Access and Stabilization Act of 2001\" and includes a national requirement for reformulated and oxygenated gasoline. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a national formula for reformulated and oxygenated gasoline, ensuring compliance with specific requirements for all states. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a national formula for reformulated and oxygenated gasoline, ensuring compliance with specific requirements for all states. The formula mandates a single type of oxygenate to be used, with winter oxygen levels at 2.7 percent and summer oxygenate levels at 2.0 percent by weight. The Administrator establishes a national formula for reformulated gasoline, considering toxicity, fuel additives' effects on water quality, crude oil supply, and other relevant factors. Approved reformulated gasoline for a State satisfies the requirements. States can opt-in to the national reformulated gas program. The Governor of any State may elect to have any area within the State, or the entire State, be treated as a covered area for purposes of the national reformulated gas program by notifying the Administrator. The regulations for reformulated gasoline and oxygenated gasoline will take effect for sales after a specified date. The Administrator will start a rulemaking process under section 211(p) of the Clean Air Act promptly after the enactment of this Act. Gasoline variations in states and localities are prohibited after December 31, 2004, except for California or states opting into California's standards. California's reformulated gas standards under section 211(p) of the Clean Air Act may not enforce controls on gasoline characteristics or additives that differ from the regulations. Section 211(c)(4)(A) is amended to include purposes other than motor vehicle emission control. States must amend their implementation plans under the Clean Air Act in response to these regulations. States must submit revisions to the Administrator within 3 months of receiving notification under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act is amended to eliminate the sulfur reduction phase-in requirement for motor vehicle diesel fuel, setting a maximum sulfur concentration of 15 ppm and specific cetane and aromatic content requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency is required to implement and enforce these regulations within 12 months of the Act's enactment."
