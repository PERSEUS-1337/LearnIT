The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 amends the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 by increasing the required cord blood inventory to at least 150,000 units. It also includes provisions for expanding cord blood unit collections at existing sites, establishing new collection sites, and submitting annual plans to the Secretary for approval. The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 requires annual plans for achieving self-sufficiency in cord blood unit collection and banking operations.

The Act also amends Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary to submit an annual report on program activities to Congress and to support studies and projects aimed at increasing cord blood unit donation from a genetically diverse population. The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 aims to expand cord blood unit collection sites and ensure strict confidentiality to protect patient and donor identities. The Health Service Act is amended to allocate $30,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014 and $33,000,000 for fiscal year 2015. A report on increasing cord blood unit donation and collection is required to be submitted by the Comptroller General of the United States within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The report aims to increase cord blood unit donation and collection for the National Cord Blood Inventory to ensure a high-quality and genetically diverse inventory. It includes a review of studies, demonstration programs, and outreach efforts to address challenges in expanding collection sites, such as cost, regulatory requirements, and capacity of cord blood banks. The report focuses on improving cord blood unit collection for the National Cord Blood Inventory by exploring innovative technological advances, enhancing provider education, estimating the number of collection sites needed, and establishing partnerships for sustainable collection. The report suggests partnerships with medical facilities for cord blood unit collection, incentives for hospitals to participate, and recommendations to lower costs and improve efficiency without compromising quality."
