    "content": "The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA; P.L.107-71) includes a security screening opt-out provision allowing airports to use private screeners instead of federal screeners with TSA approval. Airports can opt out of the federal screening program starting November 19, 2004. Airport operators decide on private screening, while TSA handles oversight and monitoring. The opt-out provision allows airports to use private screeners with TSA approval, sharing responsibilities between the federal government, airport operators, and private screening firms. Private screening systems in Europe are efficient. Successful implementation in the US depends on TSA's policies and guidelines. The implementation of the opt-out provision of ATSA is crucial and will be closely monitored by Congress. Screening contracts under this provision will be determined and managed by TSA, maintaining federal responsibility for airport security screening. This program does not shift oversight to airport operators or airlines, ensuring it is not a return to the pre-ATSA security structure. The opt-out program under ATSA establishes a federally funded and managed framework for security screening at airports, allowing airport operators to decide on private screening operations. This provision offers flexibility in implementation, with TSA having the final say on airport security measures. The ATSA opt-out program allows airport operators to choose private screening operations, with TSA having the final say on security measures. Airlines' role in private screening implementation is not clearly defined, leaving it up to TSA. FAA first mandated passenger security screening in 1973, with the Air Transportation Security Act of 1974 requiring screening of all passengers and their carry-on items. The FAA mandated passenger security screening in 1973, following a large number of hijackings on domestic flights in the 1960s and 1970s. By the 1990s, air piracy incidents in the US had significantly decreased. Despite identified deficiencies in pre-board screening practices, the FAA and airline industry considered screening as an effective deterrent. In the 1990s, the FAA and airline industry saw pre-board screening as effective against hijackings. The threat of aircraft bombings led to policy debates on aviation security. The Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 was passed in response to the growing threat of terrorist acts against aircraft. The Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 increased FAA's role in aviation security intelligence and required federal security managers at Category X airports to oversee security operations. The legislation did not change the existing system of airline-managed screening operations. The Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 increased FAA's role in aviation security intelligence and required federal security managers at Category X airports to oversee security operations. Proposals to federalize security screening operations or make airport operators responsible were evaluated but ultimately dismissed due to logistical complexities and diffusion of responsibility concerns. Airport operators believed this would erode security and increase the risk of terrorist infiltration. The American Association of Airport Executives summarized airports' opposition to airport or federal employee involvement in passenger screening, citing concerns about continuity and security measures being evaded. They argued that airline-managed screening is effective because it allows for a single entity to control the process, unlike multiple hand-offs with government employees. The FAA decided to maintain airline-controlled screening operations but increase federal involvement in research, acquisition of screening technologies, and oversight of screening companies. This approach was supported by both airlines and airports, leading to the FAA being directed to certify screening companies and develop uniform performance standards for increased federal oversight. Before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FAA was in the process of implementing certification standards for screening operations. Airlines were responsible for pre-board screening, often carried out by private security firms with varying standards and high turnover rates. In 1999, there were 66 private screening companies operating at commercial passenger airports. Before the 9/11 attacks, private security firms with high turnover rates operated screening operations at passenger airports. In 2000, FAA reported low wages and high turnover rates for screeners, with no uniform standards in place. The White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security recommended standardization, leading to the inclusion of certification requirements in the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996. The Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 included certification requirements for airport security screening. After the 9/11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) with federal airport security screening. Debate in the 107th Congress focused on federal involvement in screening operations. The House proposed legislation required federal employees to supervise screening, while the Senate bill proposed a federal screening workforce. The Senate bill proposed establishing a federal screening workforce within the Department of Justice. Airport managers shifted their perspective on airport-managed screening operations after 9/11, viewing their role in aviation security more significantly. Following the events of September 11, 2001, airports recognized the increased responsibility for implementing security programs and the need for close coordination with the TSA. The president of AAAE emphasized the importance of shared responsibility between airports and the TSA in developing cost-effective security solutions. Airports prioritize safety and security over profits, serving the community and national aviation system. They advocate for a cooperative approach with the TSA to address security issues effectively. ATSA allowed for future airport involvement in security screening through shared responsibilities with the TSA under the opt-out provision. It established a pilot program for private screening operations at five airports and allowed airports to request the use of private screening entities two years after the federal screening force is fully deployed, subject to TSA approval. The ATSA allowed for airport involvement in security screening through the opt-out provision, giving TSA the authority to approve requests for private screening operations. Airport operators are cautiously optimistic about the potential benefits of private screening but are still uncertain about the costs and implications due to a lack of specific program details from TSA. Over 50 airports are participating in an initiative by ACI-NA to gather information and provide input on private screening. The initiative by ACI-NA involves 50 airports gathering information and providing input for the opt-out program. It is expected that 20 to 30 airports, about 4% to 7% of all commercial airports with federal screeners, will pursue private screening options. ACI-NA believes that with addressed concerns, the number of airports opting out could increase to 50 to 100, roughly 11% to 22% of airports with federal screeners. Research suggests even higher interest among airports in private screening, with 47% expressing interest and 26% considering privatizing screening depending on program details. Some airport directors are interested in opting out of the federal screening program to have more control over security contracts. Their concerns include the impact of federal screening on airport facilities and services, TSA's effectiveness, and addressing local factors. Some airport directors, like George Doughty of Lehigh Valley International Airport, are concerned about the federally controlled screening process impacting airport operations and passenger safety. They view themselves as major stakeholders in aviation security policies and are interested in opting out of the TSA federal screening program for private screening contracts. The opt-out program for airports aims to improve screening quality, flexibility, uniformity, and customer service. Most airports are waiting for more details before deciding on private screening contracts. The TSA is developing an implementation plan for the opt-out provision, expected to be released by May 19, 2004. Assessments have shown no significant cost or performance differences between private screening contracts and federal screening operations. The DHS Inspector General and GAO found that private screeners performed similarly to federal screeners, but more data is needed to conclusively determine any differences. Both groups were noted to be below performance expectations. The GAO found that the pilot program for private screening did not allow for a meaningful assessment of performance differences between federal and private screeners. This was disappointing for airports hoping for useful data. The ACI-NA supports expanding the opt-out provision and has identified key issues to address, such as control over screening operations and funding. Airports seek flexibility in managing screening operations, including the option to conduct screenings themselves or use a hybrid model with private screeners. This would allow for increased staff flexibility and better workforce management during peak periods. The current opt-out program's limitations on such arrangements are unclear. Airports want flexibility in scheduling and deploying private screeners, as current TSA screener scheduling is inefficient. They also have concerns about liability exposure if they opt for private screening under the existing program. Airports may face liability exposure if they pursue private screening operations, even though the TSA would oversee the process. Some airport officials suggest amending the opt-out provision to limit liability. Concerns also exist regarding funding allocations for airport screening. The issue of funding allocations for airport screening extends beyond the opt-out provision to screening operations in general. Airports are seeking an agreed-upon index to determine funding allocations based on various factors such as passenger numbers, checked bags processed, airport layout, and projected passenger demand. The index will also need to consider specific airport projects that may impact screening operations. Congress may debate the opt-out program and potential legislative actions to address issues raised by airports. The debate may focus on the level of federal involvement in screening operations and consider options to repeal, amend, expand, or encourage participation in the program. Key considerations include screening efficiency, security levels, and the appropriate federal role in aviation security. The debate over the appropriate federal role in aviation security, particularly regarding screening activities, may be revisited by Congress in evaluating the opt-out provision. This issue is related to the ongoing debate over federal involvement in critical aviation functions that impact safety and security. Some members of Congress argue for direct government participation in safety-related aviation functions to prevent outsourcing to private entities. The debate revolves around federalized air traffic operations, with one side arguing for government control due to safety concerns, while the other side believes air traffic services can be privatized, as seen in other countries. Various safety critical aviation functions are carried out by private entities, including pilots, flight attendants, and aircraft maintenance workers. In the current environment of heightened concern over threats to homeland security, airport screening operations are considered to have a unique importance linked to national security objectives. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the federalization of airport screening functions was argued to be crucial for preventing further terrorist attacks and protecting citizens and property. Following the 9/11 attacks, there was a push for federalization of airport screening operations to enhance homeland security. Public opinion favored government personnel conducting screening activities over private companies. Polls showed that 69% of likely voters felt safer with trained federal screeners, compared to only 5% feeling less safe. The federal government opted out of using private companies for baggage screening operations before September 11, 2001. The current administration does not consider activities like air traffic control and airport security screening to be inherently governmental, promoting competitive sourcing instead. The federal government considers aviation security screening functions as not inherently governmental, supporting the use of private screeners. Federal security screener positions within the TSA are designated as commercial in nature under the FAIR Act. The TSA security screener positions are currently exempt from public-private competition but will no longer be exempt as of November 19, 2004, due to the opt-out provision in ATSA. Congress may need to modify existing statutes to determine if maintaining a federal force of airport security screeners is in the best interest of aviation security. The debate over the role of the federal government in operational functions like passenger screening is ongoing. Privatizing screening operations in airport security can potentially lead to cost savings and eliminate conflicts of interest when the federal government serves as both a service provider and regulator. Advocates argue that the TSA's dual role may compromise airport security due to self-regulation. The TSA, as both regulator and provider of aviation security, is seen as having a conflict of interest that may hinder identifying and correcting deficiencies. Privatization advocates suggest focusing on developing security specifications, research, intelligence sharing, and oversight, while leaving day-to-day airport security operations to private firms. The federal government's oversight of privately operated airport security systems may not ensure better accountability. Concerns have been raised about the FAA's ability to provide adequate resources for overseeing aircraft operators and maintenance stations, leading to questions about staffing levels and training. Similar concerns were raised when the FAA oversaw airline-managed screening operations. The DOT Office of the Inspector General found significant financial oversight issues with TSA's transition from airline-managed screening to federal screening operations, leading to overcharges and improper billing by screening companies. TSA contracted with the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Defense Contract Audit Agency for oversight before deploying federal screeners. While problems have not been observed with TSA's oversight of pilot program contracts at 5 airports, concerns remain about the adequacy of oversight. The oversight of private screening contracts under the opt-out provision of ATSA may be an issue for congressional scrutiny. Developing a comprehensive plan for monitoring contractor operations is crucial for effective private screening options. Congress may need to debate whether screening performance can be assured under a federally-managed contract screening system, potentially requiring legislative action to repeal the opt-out provision. The House introduced H.Con.Res. 275 expressing Congress's support for federal employees to continue airport screening functions. While this resolution may influence the use of federal screeners, it does not revoke the opt-out provision. Congress may debate limiting the scope of the opt-out program and establishing criteria for airports to participate. Congress may consider establishing stringent criteria for airports to opt-out of federal security screening programs. They could offer incentives for airports to choose private screening options or increase flexibility in the opt-out program. More aggressive options include abandoning the current opt-out provision. The proposal suggests establishing a comprehensive privatization program for airport screening at all commercial passenger airports. Some airports with infrequent flights using small aircraft may be able to utilize private screeners. Currently, certain airports are exempt from federal screening requirements due to limited daily flights using small commuter aircraft. Some airports without federal screeners may benefit from private screening for cost-effective physical screening of passengers and property. However, it is unclear if these airports are eligible for private screening under the opt-out program. Additional budget resources would be needed to implement private or federal screening at these airports. Congress may debate including these airports in the private screening program. Private screening operations at airports could provide cost-effective physical screening for passengers and property. There is a need to examine the costs of implementing private screening at airports currently not budgeted for federal screening. Additionally, private screening may offer increased flexibility in staffing to screen airport workers, although federal statutes do not require screening for these individuals. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns regarding this issue. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about airport workers bypassing screening checkpoints. Airports could potentially use private contractors to screen workers, but the cost may deter many airports from implementing this option. Leveraging funds for private screening through savings from flexible staffing could be a possibility. Under the opt-out program, airports may save costs by using more flexible staffing at checkpoints and reducing overhead expenses. One proposal is to combine federal and private screeners for screening airport workers, allowing for better scheduling and addressing seasonal traffic demands. Clarification may be needed from Congress on this mixed-model approach. The TSA and airports may seek clarification from Congress on the mixed-model of private screeners alongside federal screeners under the opt-out program. Airport liability risk is a concern, with airports potentially having indirect involvement in private screening implementation. The level of airport authority involvement would vary based on the opt-out program's specifics, with some airports seeking minimal involvement and others wanting to manage screening operations directly. Liability for screening failures would depend on the degree of airport involvement. The liability risk for airports in private screening operations under the opt-out program is uncertain and depends on the level of specificity required by the TSA. Airport operators will consider liability exposure and insurance costs when deciding whether to participate. The liability risk and insurance costs influence airports' decisions on private screening under the opt-out program. Concerns include the requirement for U.S. owned security firms and the lack of liability protection proposals from Congress. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, foreign-controlled airport security firms were not allowed to resume private screening operations under the opt-out provision. U.S.-owned security firms have the potential to provide screening at up to 10% of commercial passenger airports where federal screeners are deployed. These firms are expected to keep up with demand for private screening in the short term, with the capacity to grow as the opt-out program evolves. Some advocates argue that the prohibition on foreign ownership of security screening entities should be reconsidered under the opt-out provision. They believe that allowing foreign participation could benefit from the expertise of security firms in allied countries with experience in aviation security. Some privatization advocates propose amending the opt-out provision to allow firms owned by U.S. allies to participate in the war against terrorism. Concerns have been raised about differences in benefits between private screeners and federal screeners in the security screening pilot program. Only one of the five private screening pilot airports offers a defined-benefit pension plan, while the others only provide participation in a 401(k) retirement program. In Jackson Hole, Wyoming, private screeners at four pilot airports only have access to a 401(k) plan, lacking a defined-benefit pension plan. Congress is concerned about ensuring private screeners receive proper benefits and may debate the impact of organized labor on screening operations. TSA screeners are not allowed to join labor organizations or engage in collective bargaining activities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a new human resources management system for the Department of Homeland Security to be more flexible and responsive. However, the TSA has broad authority to make determinations regarding screener participation in labor organizations, stating that mandatory collective bargaining is not compatible with the flexibility needed to combat terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted TSA the authority to restrict collective bargaining for screeners, citing the need for flexibility in combating terrorism. The policy has been challenged in court by AFGE, with the FLRA ruling in favor of the prohibition. AFGE has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the issue remains under review by the federal courts. The TSA lacks statutory authority to prevent private screeners under the opt-out program from unionizing and engaging in collective bargaining. The TSA may need Congress to expand its authority to include setting employment standards for private screeners. The TSA may need Congress to expand its authority to include setting employment standards for private screeners, who may be allowed to join unions and engage in collective bargaining. This issue could become significant as the opt-out program evolves, potentially affecting morale among federal screeners compared to private screeners. The ATSA established a pilot program using private screeners at five airports to examine cost and effectiveness. The TSA established a pilot program using private screeners at five airports, known as the \"PP5\". The program has faced criticism for its limited scope, potentially affecting the evaluation comparing private screeners to federal screeners. The pilot program using private screeners at five airports raises concerns about the limited scope for evaluating the effectiveness of private screening compared to federal screening operations. The small sample size and selection of airports may not accurately represent differences between the two screening methods. The pilot program using private screeners at selected airports may not provide a representative sample for evaluating private screening effectiveness compared to federal screening operations. Advocates suggest expanding the program to include 5-10 percent of commercial passenger airports for a more meaningful evaluation. The pilot program with private screeners at 5 airports may offer valuable insights for evaluating private screening operations and comparing them to federal screening. The TSA-sponsored comparison study aims to match these airports with similar ones using federal screeners to address concerns about unique local factors influencing the results. The evaluation compared 5 pilot program airports to comparable airports with federal screeners based on security characteristics. Comparison airports were selected from the same risk category with similar passenger volume, staffing levels, and equipment types. The pilot program has been criticized for lacking differentiation from TSA's federal screening practices. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the lack of differentiation in the pilot program airports' operating procedures compared to TSA's federal workforce. This limited flexibility hinders the ability to compare the cost and benefits of passenger screening by private security firms at these airports. The House Appropriations Committee directed the TSA to review the policy of using private security firms at pilot program airports for passenger screening. The TSA was recommended to provide operational flexibility to these locations to assess the advantages and disadvantages of private screening approaches. The TSA emphasized the need for standardized core security functions while allowing for innovative solutions such as new scheduling software and customer service training for screeners. The TSA emphasized the need for standardized security functions and supported staffing initiatives like split-shifts and part-time screeners. At San Francisco International Airport, skycaps with background checks were used to move checked baggage, improving efficiency. The GAO found that private screening contractors in the pilot program had limited operational flexibility. Private screening companies utilized various practices to enhance efficiency, such as using baggage handlers for screening and assessment centers for pre-screening applicants. The TSA limited contractors' ability to innovate beyond minimum requirements. A comparative evaluation found few differences between private and federal screening in terms of effectiveness, cost, and impact on customers and stakeholders. Private screening was found to be essentially indistinguishable from federal screening in terms of effectiveness and cost. Costs were comparable at pilot program airports, with a slight trend suggesting private screening may be more cost advantageous at larger airports. However, results were inconclusive due to unique airport characteristics affecting cost. The evaluation of the pilot program found that private screening at TUP was largely due to the contractor having more screening staff than expected for a federal operation. Customer satisfaction varied at larger airports, with shorter wait times at SFO and MCI, but mixed satisfaction levels compared to airports with federal screeners. Complaint numbers were similar between pilot program airports and comparison airports with federal screeners. Overall, the evaluation found little difference between private screening and federal screening. The pilot program evaluation found little difference between private screening and federal screening operations, limiting the ability to draw conclusions on effectiveness and cost. The ambiguous findings may lead to inappropriate conclusions by advocates for privatizing screening operations. Advocates for privatizing screening operations may highlight the lack of demonstrated performance differences between federal and private screeners, emphasizing potential efficiency improvements. On the other hand, advocates for retaining a federal screening workforce argue that privatization is unnecessary due to the lack of benefits in performance, efficiency, and cost. The pilot study results were inconclusive and lacked adequate metrics for comparing federal and private screening operations. This poses a challenge for the TSA to meet the requirements of the opt-out provision of ATSA, which mandates that private screening services must meet or exceed federal standards. The TSA faces a challenge in developing standard metrics to compare private screening entities with federal screeners. Multiple metrics and methods of analysis are needed to assess screening performance effectively. The TSA is integrating screening effectiveness metrics into their Performance Management Information System (PMIS) and developing a screening performance index. The GAO cautioned in November 2003 about the need for more effective methods to measure screening effectiveness. The GAO cautioned in 2003 that the TSA is not fully utilizing methods to measure the effectiveness of its passenger screening program. One reason airports consider private screening is to better accommodate passenger demand. Throughput metrics at screening checkpoints are important for meeting passenger expectations and minimizing security risks. The TSA aims to keep passenger wait times under 10 minutes to reduce security risks and human errors. Airport managers may focus on keeping wait times below 30 minutes to prevent missed flights and passenger dissatisfaction. Airport managers may need to examine data on 90th or 95th percentile wait times to address passenger dissatisfaction. The 95th percentile wait times system-wide are around 30 minutes, but can be longer at certain airports. Some operators aim to maintain consistent wait times throughout the day and week to meet passenger expectations. Different criteria for passenger throughput exist based on local factors and priorities, which cannot be determined by mean wait times alone. Mitigating local factors can have significant impacts on security. Mitigating local factors such as average ticket counter wait times and airport layout can impact security screening throughput. Airports consider the ability to meet passenger demand when evaluating opt-out programs. Demand for air travel is projected to surpass pre-9/11 levels by 2005. The ability to meet current and future throughput demand at checkpoints is crucial for implementing the pilot program for private screening. Airport operators see the opt-out program as a way to increase screener staffing flexibility, but have concerns about potential differences in assessing staffing requirements. TSA must ensure that private screening programs provide equal or better screening performance compared to TSA-operated screening. To successfully implement the opt-out program for private screening, TSA needs robust metrics to assess screening performance at airports. They must develop a system to evaluate private screening firms that can certify equivalent security to federal screening. Legally defensible data on screening performance is necessary to justify any adverse actions taken against private screening firms. TSA needs robust metrics to assess screening performance at airports for the opt-out program for private screening. They must develop means to evaluate screening performance at the airport level with sensitivity and validity. Various metrics are available, including data on confiscation of prohibited items, covert testing results, and computer projected images to test screener performance. A composite assessment using these metrics will be needed to evaluate private screening operations thoroughly. To meet ATSA requirements for private screening operations, robust metrics are needed to demonstrate equivalence with federal screening. Confiscation of threat objects is a key metric, but total numbers do not reflect effectiveness. Additional metrics are necessary to assess the detection rate of threat objects at screening checkpoints. The effectiveness of airport security checkpoints in detecting hard-to-detect objects is difficult to compare over time or between airports due to changes in prohibited items and testing methods. Prior to the establishment of the TSA, the FAA relied on different screening measures. Since the establishment of the TSA, covert testing has been conducted to assess screener performance at airport checkpoints. However, the GAO noted in 2003 that only a small percentage of TSA screeners had been tested, raising concerns about the representativeness of the results. Additional baseline data on federal screener performance will be needed for meaningful comparisons with private screeners. The TSA plans to double its covert testing staff and conduct more tests this year. Recent analyses show poor performance by screeners during these tests, with failure rates comparable to those in 1987. However, the TSA states that current testing methods are more advanced than those used in the past. Evaluating private vs. federal screening performance using covert testing is challenging due to evolving testing procedures. The limitations of covert testing procedures include the challenge of evolving testing methods over time, making it difficult to compare performance across different tests. This tradeoff between maintaining operational relevance and consistency in evaluation procedures must be considered when designing screening assessment tools. Threat Image Projection (TIP) was introduced by the FAA in 1999 to evaluate private screening companies. After 9/11, TIP was discontinued due to concerns about increased delays in security. Threat Image Projection (TIP) was reintroduced with an expanded database of threat images to evaluate screener performance. The TSA views TIP as a valuable tool for assessing screener alertness and detection capabilities during x-ray monitoring of carry-on items. However, TIP is limited in scope and does not provide data on all aspects of screening operations. The TSA faces challenges in conducting comparative evaluations of private screening operations to ensure security levels are equal to federal screening. Developing a composite index and establishing a baseline for comparison are key tasks. The TSA encounters difficulties in comparing private screening operations to federal screening to ensure security parity. Time-series analyses can be used to assess screening performance before and after private entities take over, but changes in screening techniques and operations over time may complicate the comparison. The difficulty in quantifying the impact of different screening operations on performance metrics makes comparing private and federal airport screening challenging. Unique airport characteristics can skew results in cross-sectional comparisons, making it hard to identify and quantify factors affecting security performance. Both time series and cross-sectional assessments have limitations in drawing inferences on screener performance. The implementation of private screening operations may require a combination of techniques to effectively compare performance with federal screeners. Agreed upon policies and protocols for data collection and comparison will be essential, along with the development of a screening performance index by the TSA. This index will evaluate screener performance, unit costs, and customer satisfaction through various metrics. The security screening opt-out provision aims to increase flexibility in work scheduling and deployment of personnel, reducing operating costs. Private screeners must receive identical pay and benefits as federal screeners, limiting potential cost savings. Congressional oversight will focus on comparing performance of private screening contracts to federal operations. The opt-out program aims to save costs through modified work scheduling and reduced overhead. Private screening entities may cut costs by streamlining hiring processes and using part-time screeners, but TSA faces challenges in recruiting and retaining part-time staff, especially in areas with tight labor markets and high living costs. GAO identified airport location, lack of accessible and affordable parking or public transportation, and high living costs as factors contributing to TSA's inability to hire new staff, particularly part-time staff, at large Category X airports. Implementing private screening under the opt-out program may lead to cost savings through efficient use of part-time staff and increased flexibility in scheduling. However, TSA's current difficulties in meeting staffing needs suggest that this may be a significant challenge, especially at larger airports. Airports may find merit in the opt-out program if it results in identifiable cost savings for the airport. Implementing private screening operations under the opt-out program can lead to cost savings for airports by reducing space demands and improving passenger and baggage throughput. This can result in increased revenue from retail shops and restaurants, as well as improved passenger satisfaction with airport operations. Increasing screening efficiency can also boost public confidence in airport security, leading to higher consumer satisfaction and likelihood of choosing air travel over other transportation options. These indirect cost savings directly benefit airports. In 2003, $30 million was allocated for third-party screening contracts, in addition to $100 million in contract recoveries for private screening. Private screening contracts made up nearly 5% of total TSA funding for passenger and baggage screening. In FY2004, screening pilots at five airports received $119 million, about 3.81% of total appropriations. The pilot program airports may have slightly higher appropriations than expected based on originating passenger statistics. The number of originating passengers is the main factor in determining screener workforce at an airport, with a strong correlation between the two. Unique factors at pilot program airports, such as layout and screening lanes, may also contribute to differences in operating costs for screening functions. The pilot program airports have unique logistic factors that may result in higher costs for private screening compared to federal screening. Costs associated with administering the pilot program are included in private screening activities. A formal assessment of comparative costs was provided by Bearing Point and Abt Associates, comparing actual costs for contract screening operations to estimated costs with federal screeners at pilot program airports. The cost assessment found that private screening costs were slightly lower than federal screening costs across five pilot program airports. However, the difference in cost was within the margin of error, making it difficult to draw specific conclusions. Private screening companies were required to provide wages and benefits equivalent to federal screeners, limiting potential cost savings. The cost assessment compared private screening costs to federal screening costs at pilot program airports, with private screening costs slightly lower but within the margin of error. Restrictions were imposed on the program, limiting flexibility in staffing levels and cost-saving innovations. TSA is exploring incorporating elements of the A-76 process into the evaluation process for the security screening opt-out program. The TSA is examining federal contract programs like the FAA's contract tower program to improve the security screening opt-out program. The FAA's program has achieved cost savings compared to federally operated air traffic control. Incorporating desirable attributes from the FAA program into the opt-out program may be limited. The DOT Office of the Inspector General found that contract towers are 79% cheaper to operate compared to federal towers, mainly due to lower labor costs and staffing levels. Cost savings in the security screening opt-out program may need to come from increased flexibility in work scheduling and use of part-time screeners. Unlike the FAA contract tower program, the security screening opt-out program is open to all airports regardless of passenger volume. The security screening opt-out program allows all airports, regardless of size or risk factors, to choose private screening over TSA. Airport operators, not TSA, decide on pursuing private screening. TSA will provide information, like pilot program results, for airports to evaluate opting for private screening."
