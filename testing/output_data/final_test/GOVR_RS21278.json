The Farm Credit System (FCS) is a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that provides benefits like federal guarantees and tax exemptions to overcome market barriers. FCS is a direct lender, unlike other GSEs such as Fannie Mae. It is not explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government but enjoys tax benefits, including exemptions from federal, state, and local taxes on real estate profits. These tax benefits were estimated to be over $1 billion in 2011. FCS bonds offer tax-exempt interest, making them attractive to investors and ensuring a steady flow of funds for loans.

The system has evolved to cover larger regions and offer a wide range of farm and rural credit programs and services. The Farm Credit System (FCS) offers various loan programs and services with an extensive portfolio. Consolidation may lead to diversified portfolios and lower interest rates for customers. However, it may weaken the original cooperative concept of local borrower control. Each FCS association has a specific charter territory to ensure local service and control.

Congressional oversight of FCS is provided by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, with recent hearings focusing on agricultural credit and nominees for the Farm Credit Administration board of directors. The Farm Credit System (FCS) is overseen by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), an independent agency responsible for ensuring the safety of FCS institutions. FCA is led by a three-member board appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Board members serve six-year terms and are funded through assessments on FCS banks. The annual agriculture appropriations act sets a limit on FCA's administrative expenses. The Farm Credit System (FCS) faces competition from commercial banks, leading to ongoing contention over congressional oversight and statutory jurisdiction.

FCS defends its mandate to serve agricultural borrowers in all circumstances. Recent disputes involve the characteristics of borrowers and the purposes of FCS loans. The policy-related issue is the purpose and extent of the statutory authority for \"similar entity lending\" that certain FCS banks have used to participate in loans to borrowers that would otherwise be ineligible for direct FCS loans. The authority to make \"similar entity loans\" was added to the Farm Credit Act in 1994, allowing the FCS to participate in loans originated by commercial banks to borrowers not eligible for FCS loans but for similar purposes. The Farm Credit System (FCS) faces competition from commercial banks due to its tax advantages, leading to disputes over similar entity loans. These loans aim for diversification in the FCS portfolio but are criticized for being large and risky. Despite legality, questions have been raised about their appropriateness and perception. The Farm Credit System (FCS) has faced competition from commercial banks over entity loans, despite questions about their legality and appropriateness. The FCA issued guidance in 2016 to address reputation risk. Recent statutory changes have been minor, with the 2014 farm bill focusing on compensation disclosure for FCS executives. The 2008 farm bill allowed Farmer Mac to participate in rural utility loans and made technical changes to premiums paid by FCS banks. The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Company (Farmer Mac) was established in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 as a secondary market for agricultural loans. It purchases and pools qualified loans, sells them as securities, and is considered a separate GSE. Farmer Mac is an investor-owned corporation with voting stock owned by banks, insurance companies, and FCS institutions, and nonvoting stock owned by any investor. Its board of directors includes members from the FCS, commercial banks, and the public. Farmer Mac operates two programs: Farmer Mac I. Farmer Mac operates two programs: Farmer Mac I (loans not guaranteed by USDA) and Farmer Mac II (USDA-guaranteed loans). Farmer Mac I involves the sale of long-term standby purchase agreements, guaranteeing loans against default risk. Farmer Mac II purchases the USDA-guaranteed portion of loans, accepting interest rate risk but no default risk."
