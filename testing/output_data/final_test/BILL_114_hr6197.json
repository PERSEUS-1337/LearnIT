Loan refinancing is added to the Higher Education Act of 1965, creating the Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan Program. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as eligible private education loan, Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan, private educational lender, and qualified borrower. These definitions are crucial for understanding the Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan Program added to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term 'qualified borrower' refers to an individual with an eligible private education loan who has made timely payments for the 6 months prior to applying for refinancing. The borrower must also be in good standing on the loan, not in default on any loans, and meet eligibility requirements. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized to carry out a program for refinancing under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue a loan to qualified borrowers with eligible private education loans to pay off the remaining balance, including principal, interest, and late charges, to the private educational lender. The Secretary will require qualified borrowers to undergo loan counseling before refinancing their private education loan as a Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan with similar terms as a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan. Borrower eligibility must be met within 180 days. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant authorities, will establish eligibility requirements within 180 days to ensure qualified borrowers in good standing can access the Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan program without inequities or windfall profits for private lenders. The interest rate for a Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan is determined based on the rate for Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans issued to undergraduate students for a specific 12-month period. The rate of interest for the loan is fixed for the loan's duration. This section does not impact a borrower's ability to qualify for loan repayment. The borrower's ability to qualify for loan repayment under specific sections is highlighted. Private educational lenders must include a notice about potential eligibility for the Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan program with each billing statement sent to the borrower. SEC. 4. YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS BUSINESS CENTER. The Small Business Act is amended to include a new section for a Young Entrepreneurs Business Center. A Young Entrepreneurs Business Center is established within the Administration to certify small business start-ups, identify distressed areas, and approve loan cancellation for founders in those areas. Small business start-ups must submit a 5-year business plan and employee numbers for certification. The young entrepreneurs business center certifies small business start-ups based on founder's recent graduation, employee composition, and yearly hiring plans. The center also identifies distressed areas every 3 years. The Administration website lists distressed areas based on income and unemployment criteria for small business start-ups. Loan cancellation is available for founders in these areas. Loan cancellation is approved for founders of small business start-ups in distressed areas if they meet specific criteria, including location certification, and continuous operation for at least 5 years. Loan cancellation is available for founders of small business start-ups in distressed areas who meet certain criteria, including operating for less than 5 years and making 24 payments while employed as a founder. Definitions include \"institution of higher education\" and \"small business start-up\" as per the Higher Education Act. The amendment allows for the exclusion of discharged federal student loans from gross income, as per the Higher Education Act. This applies to loan cancellations after the enactment of the Act."
