    "content": "NATO's mission in Afghanistan, known as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), is a test of allies' military capabilities and political will to sustain a commitment in a distant land. Since the 1999 Washington NATO Summit, allies have aimed to create a more global NATO to combat emerging threats like terrorism and WMD proliferation. ISAF, established by UN Security Council Resolution 1386 in 2001 and initially led by the US, reflects NATO's shift towards addressing security threats beyond its traditional European theater. The ISAF mission in Afghanistan, established by UN Security Council Resolution 1386 in 2001 and later led by NATO, aims to provide security, promote governance and development, reform the justice system, train national forces, and address the narcotics industry. By October 2009, ISAF had 71,000 troops from 42 countries, with the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Poland contributing the largest deployments. The NATO/ISAF mission in Afghanistan, led by U.S. General Stanley McChrystal, aims at stabilization and reconstruction. The operation faces challenges from Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents, Afghanistan's lack of a well-functioning central government, and difficult terrain. Stabilization and reconstruction efforts must continue alongside combat operations. The ISAF mission in Afghanistan is crucial for NATO's future, serving as a test case for allies' ability to counter security threats. Despite differing views on the threat of international terrorism, there is growing opposition to the war in Europe. Significant progress in stabilizing Afghanistan is deemed necessary in 2010 to maintain allied solidarity. The ISAF mission in Afghanistan is a crucial test for NATO's future capabilities and commitments. Differences in opinion on future commitments, like Afghanistan, could lead to serious disagreements within the Alliance. This conflict continues to challenge NATO's military commanders. The Taliban's increasing attacks in Afghanistan have posed a significant challenge to NATO's military commanders. The violence escalated in 2008 and continued in 2009, making it the deadliest year for allied forces. Suicide attacks and insurgent violence have been on the rise. In 2009, insurgent attacks in Afghanistan escalated, but the anticipated large-scale spring/early summer offensive did not materialize as expected. Possible reasons included uncertainty among Taliban leaders due to the deployment of additional U.S. troops and a significant offensive against the Taliban in Pakistan's SWAT Valley. The Pakistan military launched an offensive against the Taliban in the SWAT Valley region, disrupting their planning for the spring offensive in Afghanistan. The Taliban delayed their major offensive until August to disrupt national elections. In July, violence escalated but a major push by the Taliban did not happen. Allies like the US and UK launched operations in Helmand province to root out Taliban strongholds before the elections. Forces from the US, UK, Canada, and the Netherlands bore the brunt of the fighting in the southern region. The inequity of burden-sharing in combat operations within the alliance remains a point of contention, especially in states with the greatest combat burden. Turmoil in neighboring Pakistan has complicated ISAF's mission, with concerns about the merging of Pakistani and Afghan Taliban militants and al Qaeda's facilitation of insurgency in Afghanistan and unrest against the Pakistan government. The United States increased missile attacks on Taliban hideouts in Pakistan due to the government's inability to control insurgents. This led to strained U.S.-Pakistan relations and anti-U.S. sentiments in Pakistan. Evidence of Pakistan's ISI aiding militants was presented in 2008. The new Pakistani government deployed military units to combat Taliban forces in tribal areas. In October 2008, Pakistan armed anti-Taliban tribal militias in the northern region to control Taliban activity. In early 2009, the government allowed the Taliban to enforce Sharia law in Swat Valley in exchange for ending support for military operations. However, this ended abruptly when the Taliban continued anti-government activity, leading to a major military operation by Pakistan. The offensive resulted in serious casualties on the Taliban and the securing of large areas once controlled by them. The Karzai government in Afghanistan faced criticism for corruption and inefficiency. The Afghan government faces criticism for corruption and security issues, with warlords exerting influence and the narcotics industry posing a threat. NATO allies stress the need for a strong Afghan government to provide services for success. President Karzai's reelection in flawed elections led to a run-off being canceled. The Obama Administration's decision in late 2008 regarding U.S. leadership in NATO's mission in Afghanistan is also significant. The Obama Administration's decision in late 2008 to send additional troops to Afghanistan tested U.S. leadership in NATO. Some European capitals saw it as a relief, but there were concerns that it would lead to less involvement from other nations. Despite this, NATO allies did contribute 5,000 troops for the national elections and training Afghan security forces. President Obama's decision in 2010 to send more troops raised questions about European support for the ISAF mission. The U.S. government faced a challenge in increasing European support for the ISAF mission due to a decline in European public opinion towards U.S. leadership since 2002. This decline complicated allied governments' efforts to sustain public support for the mission, with some in Europe viewing the NATO effort in Afghanistan as a proxy war for the U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates acknowledged the political implications of this situation. In February 2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates expressed concern about Europeans confusing the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The former Bush Administration developed a white paper before NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008 to outline a strategic vision for Afghanistan, emphasizing a long-term commitment, governance improvement, a comprehensive approach for stabilization, and increased engagement with Afghanistan's neighbors. The white paper before NATO's Bucharest summit in April 2008 outlined a strategic vision for Afghanistan, emphasizing a long-term commitment, governance improvement, comprehensive approach for stabilization, and increased engagement with Afghanistan's neighbors, especially Pakistan. The allies believed the US needed to provide leadership and resources to counter destabilizing influences from neighboring states. The incoming Obama administration ordered a complete review of US and NATO strategy in Afghanistan after the 2008 election. The Obama administration sought input from allies and others for a new Afghanistan/Pakistan strategy. Meetings with NATO Foreign Ministers and the North Atlantic Council were held to gather Europe's ideas. President Obama announced the strategy in March 2009, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, improving Afghan government, developing Afghan security forces, and involving the international community. The new strategy announced by President Obama in March 2009 aimed to bolster resources for stabilization efforts in Afghanistan. It included deploying 17,000 additional U.S. combat troops to secure the south and east, as well as 4,000 personnel to train the Afghan National Security Forces. The goal was to increase the Afghan National Army to 134,000 troops by 2011. The strategy also emphasized involving the international community, with a leadership role for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). The new strategy announced by President Obama in March 2009 aimed to increase Afghan National Army troops to 134,000 by 2011. It emphasized the need to strengthen the Afghan government and increase civilian expertise to combat corruption. The strategy called for more U.S. civilian advisors and international support through UNAMA. The Obama Administration strategy aimed to combat corruption in the Afghan government and support reconciliation efforts with moderate Taliban members. However, Mullah Omar and his aides aligned with al Qaeda were excluded from any reconciliation deal. Afghan President Karzai expressed willingness to reconcile with Omar, but Omar did not respond to his overtures. The Obama Administration's strategy included provisions for stronger cooperation between the United States, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. This involved military assistance for counter-insurgency operations in Pakistan, increased economic aid, governance reforms in militant-operated areas, and support for foreign investment in key sectors of the Pakistani economy. The Obama Administration introduced legislation for \"Reconstruction Opportunity Zones\" (ROZ) to promote Afghan-Pakistan economic cooperation with preferential duties for imports to the US. The strategy emphasized regional and international collaboration, including the establishment of a \"Contact Group\" involving NATO allies, Central Asian states, Gulf nations, Iran, Russia, India, and China. President Obama presented his new strategy for Afghanistan to NATO allies and other partners, seeking their contributions in troops, economic aid, and civilian mentors. The strategy aimed to gain allied endorsement and support during his visit to Europe in April 2009. U.S. and NATO officials used the NATO summit to reaffirm allied unity behind the new strategic approach for the Afghan mission. The NATO allies welcomed the renewed U.S. focus on Afghanistan, especially the regional approach involving Pakistan and potential engagement with Iran. They supported efforts to improve civilian capacity and institution-building in Afghanistan, as well as the reported decision to reconcile with local leaders and Taliban supporters renouncing violence. The allies reiterated their commitment to the strategic vision for Afghanistan based on principles laid out in 2008. The 2009 Summit Declaration emphasized the need for greater civilian and military resources to develop Afghan capacity for delivering justice. The NATO allies supported efforts to improve civilian capacity and institution-building in Afghanistan, emphasizing the importance of developing Afghan capacity to deliver justice, basic services, and employment. They also pledged to strengthen NATO efforts to enhance cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani governments and increase engagement with all countries in the region. U.S. officials refrained from publicly requesting specific allies to increase troop contributions at the April summit, but hoped to gain short-term troop commitments for the upcoming elections. Reported allied commitments fulfilled the minimum request for four to five battalions. In 2009, there were concerns about the \"Americanization\" of the mission in Afghanistan due to significant U.S. troop increases compared to temporary European deployments. The Obama Administration urged broader allied engagement in the Afghan mission, focusing on financial assistance, development efforts, police training, and support for the Afghan National Army. The NATO Training Mission - Afghanistan (NTM-A) was formed with an initial commitment of 300 French constabulary forces to provide mentoring and training for the Afghan National Army and Police. Additionally, $100 million was committed to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund to support NATO's efforts. The Afghan National Army Trust Fund was created in 2007 to support NATO's goal of growing the ANA to 134,000 by 2011. U.S. officials aimed to secure $500 million for the fund. NATO allies increased commitments to Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams embedded with the ANA. Europe's view of U.S. leadership improved during the Obama Administration, evident during President Obama's visit to Europe. This shift in attitude was seen as a test for NATO's mission in Afghanistan. The Obama approach has gained support from allies for the war in Afghanistan, with some countries willing to keep extra forces longer. However, public opinion in Europe remains unchanged, and as U.S. public opinion turns negative, European leaders may face more pressure. Despite plans for troop withdrawals by the Dutch and Canada, the August elections were seen as a modest success, raising hopes for political reform and economic development under a potential second Karzai government. President Obama announced sending 30,000 additional U.S. military forces to Afghanistan in 2010, with a potential draw-down by mid-2011 if conditions allow. NATO leaders support this decision as a step towards stabilizing the country and ending the conflict. NATO Secretary General supports President's plan for Afghanistan, pledges 5,000 more troops in 2010. Congress mostly backs Administration's policies, but some concerns raised about costs and opposition to additional military forces. Several hearings held on Afghanistan strategy and funding requests approved. The Administration's requests for supplemental funding for the war effort have been approved. Congressional committees are calling for a more coherent plan to coordinate international efforts in support of the Obama strategy for stabilization and reconstruction. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was created by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 in 2001, with NATO taking over command in Afghanistan in 2003. Security Council Resolution 1883 in 2008 calls upon NATO to disarm militias, reform the justice system, train a national police force and army, provide security for elections, and combat the narcotics industry. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was created by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 in 2001, with NATO taking over command in Afghanistan in 2003. NATO, in consultation with the Afghan government, has refined the resolution's provisions into active policy. The ISAF includes troops from all 28 NATO member states and some non-NATO nations. NATO commanders implemented four stages to bring all of Afghanistan under NATO's operational responsibility, starting with moving into the northern and western parts of the country in 2003-2005. The ISAF, led by NATO, aimed to bring stability to the southern part of Afghanistan, where the Taliban was active. Stage Three began in July 2006, followed by Stage Four in October 2006, with the US transferring troops to ISAF. The goal was to replace OEF forces with NATO forces in a stabilizing environment. The allies faced new challenges in stabilizing Afghanistan, particularly in the south where the Taliban was active. Poppy farming was widespread in Helmand and Uruzgan provinces. ISAF realized the need for greater combat capability as it expanded its operations throughout Afghanistan. NATO planned five phases for ISAF operations, with the final three focusing on stabilization, transition, and. In 2006, Afghanistan completed its stabilization phases, with ISAF operating in Phase III by 2009. NATO officials were discussing transitioning security responsibility to ANSF, cautioning that the shift may vary geographically and happen gradually. Troop-contributing countries may rush to redeploy if ISAF announces the transition phase. In the initial stages of the ISAF mission, key issues included the use of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, overcoming caveats from allies, and managing counter-narcotics efforts. Later stages focused on refining the mission statement, organizational structure, securing more troops, and prisoner treatment. NATO leaders faced challenges in persuading member states to contribute forces, and issues arose with how deployed forces operated. Many allies in the NATO operation imposed national caveats on their forces, causing trouble for ISAF commanders. These restrictions vary from lack of equipment to limitations on deployment and combat participation. NATO commanders have accepted troops from 42 governments but face challenges in utilizing them effectively. NATO commanders have faced challenges in utilizing troops from 42 governments due to national caveats. Efforts to minimize restrictions on forces dedicated to ISAF have had mixed success, with some allies limiting their troops' effectiveness. At the NATO summit in Riga, political leaders aimed to reduce caveats in Afghanistan, particularly in highly unsettled areas where combat forces are needed. Progress has been made over time in addressing these limitations. Some progress has been made in persuading NATO members to adopt more flexible rules of engagement, but nations with higher risk burdens still seek relief. At the Bucharest summit in 2008, NATO leaders pledged to work on removing limitations on troops, with Germany criticized for restrictions on their troops in Afghanistan. Former NATO SACEUR General Jones also complained about German restrictions. Former NATO SACEUR General Jones criticized German restrictions on troop deployment in Afghanistan, but there have been some improvements. France, Italy, and Spain have reduced their caveats and allowed their forces to assist in emergency situations, although there are still uncertainties about the decision-making process. Since 2006, NATO/ISAF combat forces have engaged in offensive operations in Afghanistan, including Operation Medusa in 2006 and operations in Helmand province in 2007. NATO forces increased offensive operations in 2008 in response to Taliban activities, with major offensives launched by British and U.S. forces in 2009 to secure parts of Helmand province and disrupt Taliban plans. In July 2008, the European Parliament debated a report on Afghanistan emphasizing the need for increased political will and commitment to provide combat troops without national caveats. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are civilian-military units aimed at extending government authority, providing security, and boosting the Afghan economy through projects like infrastructure development. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are key in stabilizing Afghanistan, with 26 ISAF-led PRTs in operation. They consist of U.S. forces, civil affairs officers, representatives of various agencies, and Afghan government personnel. U.S. PRTs support Afghan security forces training and reconstruction projects, often co-located with combat troops in restive regions. In March 2008, U.S. funds supported 54 completed PRT development projects and 199 ongoing projects valued at $20 million. Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, France, Turkey, and the Czech Republic have taken over key PRTs in various provinces in Afghanistan to focus on reconstruction and security efforts. In March 2008, the Czech Republic established a PRT in Lowgar Province, and South Korea took over the U.S.-run PRT at Bagram Air Base. There is a move to transition the lead in U.S.-run PRTs to civilians, starting with a civilian-led PRT in the Panjshir Valley in early 2006. PRTs are often military-dominated and aim to engage local governments and citizens to show tangible results, but they have received mixed reviews and criticisms for lacking a clear concept of operations. The PRTs operate without a clear concept of operations, lack coordination, and face challenges with civilian relief organizations. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates emphasized the need for a broader international and interagency approach in Afghanistan. The keys to success in Afghanistan include more trucks, teachers, judges, foreign investment, alternative crops, sound governance, and rule of law. U.S. PRTs are composed of military and civilian personnel, but some believe there is a lack of expertise in key areas like agriculture. The United States government controls the funds for its PRTs. The United States government controls funds for its PRTs in Afghanistan to prevent corruption and ensure money goes to designated projects. European-led PRTs may have fewer personnel and different funding approaches, with some being minimally funded or providing little supervision. The Dutch give funding directly to the Afghan government, while the French have declined to lead a PRT. The French have declined to lead a PRT in Afghanistan, questioning NATO's role. Witnesses in Congress urge strengthening PRTs by increasing funding for State Department, AID, and Agriculture. The Obama Administration's strategy emphasizes a larger role for civilian agencies in reconstruction efforts. Allies struggle to combat Afghanistan's opium production, which supplies a significant portion of the world's opium. Afghanistan's poppy crop is a major factor in the country's economy and stability, with reports suggesting it supplied up to 93% of the world's opium in 2007. The Taliban derives a significant portion of its funds from the drug trade, estimated at around 40% or close to $100 million annually. NATO/ISAF mission does not directly engage in counter-narcotics efforts but provides assistance to local authorities. Britain leads the coordination of counter-narcotics operations, providing training and support to Afghan forces to destroy poppy fields and opium labs. The Afghan government's efforts to destroy poppy fields and opium labs have been criticized for being too random and ineffective. There are concerns that the government targets crops of the poorest farmers while leaving those of influential families untouched. The US initially suggested spraying herbicide on the fields, but this was rejected due to health and environmental concerns. Other allies also opposed aerial spraying to avoid alienating local populations dependent on poppy cultivation for income. The U.S. Congress prohibited the use of counter-narcotics funds for aerial spraying of poppy fields in FY2008. The UNODC suggested ISAF should expand support for Afghanistan's counter-drug efforts by targeting opium labs and drug distribution networks. NATO leaders agreed to focus on major drug traffickers and border drug trade. At a NATO meeting in Budapest in 2008, leaders authorized ISAF forces to combat opium labs funding the Taliban. Some nations objected due to legal constraints and concerns about negative impacts on Afghan communities. Despite this, ISAF's efforts have led to 18 opium-free provinces in Afghanistan. Since 2007, the number of opium-free provinces in Afghanistan has increased to 18. ISAF conducted 37 counter-narcotics operations in 2009, seizing over 100 tons of poppy seed and 40 tons of opium. The Afghan government lacks the necessary law enforcement and judicial system to effectively combat the narcotics trade, leading to widespread corruption and societal harm. The drug trade in Afghanistan fuels corruption at all levels of government and funds insurgents and warlords. Efforts to combat narcotics involve persuading farmers to switch to alternative crops, but the high income from poppies makes it challenging. The police and judicial systems are also hindered by corruption and lack of training and resources. The Afghan police, lacking training and transport, are crucial for stabilizing the country by destroying poppy fields. Initially trained by the Germans, the program faced challenges due to low pay and recruitment issues. Criticisms were raised by U.S. and European officials regarding Germany's management of the Afghan National Police force training. The EU took over training Afghanistan's police in 2007, with some issues reported such as corruption and inadequate progress. In 2008, NATO noted that the Afghan police still lacked capability. In 2009, the EUPOL mission in Afghanistan had around 177 international trainers and 91 local staff. Turkey's actions, due to disputes with the EU, have hindered NATO's support for the Afghan police. The court system in Afghanistan is still developing, with Italy leading efforts to build a professional judicial system. The Rome meeting in 2007 pledged $360 million for developing a legal system in Afghanistan, focusing on transparency and accountability for officials. The Bush Administration proposed merging ISAF and OEF functions in 2005, with allies hesitant to take on counter-insurgency responsibilities. In December 2005, allies announced a mission statement for ISAF's Stages Three and Four, focusing on extending Afghan government authority through development of PRTs, training Afghan security forces, and supporting counter-narcotics efforts. They also agreed on guidelines for dealing with prisoners. The mission statement for ISAF's Stages Three and Four emphasized reconstruction and stabilization, with minimal focus on military threats. The Taliban's quietness in response to the allies' communiqu\u00e9 in April 2006 was attributed to winter weather or their efforts to strengthen. British and German officials expressed hopes of deploying forces without combat, highlighting NATO's limitations in counter-terrorism operations. The Dutch parliament debated sending forces to ISAF, with some members opposing combat operations. In spring 2006, events in Afghanistan highlighted the need for rapid military response capabilities for rescue operations. An attack on the Norwegian-Finnish PRT in Meymaneh revealed the lack of NATO combat forces in the region. General Jones urged NATO governments to pledge forces capable of combat operations for ISAF. In spring 2006, General Jones pushed for NATO forces capable of combat operations for ISAF. NATO governments adjusted rules of engagement to allow for combat operations in Stage Three. General Richards emphasized the blurred line between counter-terror and counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan. The debate over the ISAF mission in southern Afghanistan continued despite the handover to ISAF in 2006. NATO struggled to persuade member governments to provide adequate forces, with U.S. Defense Secretary Gates calling for an additional 7,500 troops in 2007. In 2007, U.S. Defense Secretary Gates called for 7,500 additional troops for ISAF in Afghanistan, with 3,500 as trainers for the Afghan army and 16 more helicopters. However, political problems in some NATO allies hindered the increase in force levels due to reluctance following the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The 2006 attack on the Norwegian-Finnish PRT highlighted the ongoing threat of instability. The Norwegian-Finnish PRT raised awareness of the threat posed by insurgency, leading to the availability of rapid-response forces. Canada, Britain, and the Netherlands pledged troops for Stage Three operations in Afghanistan. Canada designated 2,300 troops until February 2009, most sent to Kandahar province. Britain initially promised 3,600 troops for Helmand province, now at 8,300. Germany sent 200 troops to replace Norwegian forces in the north. The U.S. deployed the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit to southern Afghanistan in February 2008. The Dutch parliament debated sending troops to ISAF in southern Afghanistan, with the population initially opposing the idea. Despite this, the Netherlands eventually committed 1,700 troops for ISAF operations. In 2007 and 2008, increased violence led U.S. and NATO commanders to request three more brigades (20,000 troops) for stabilization efforts in the southern sector. At the April 2008 NATO Summit, allies aimed to persuade other governments to send more forces to Afghanistan, agreeing to a shared long-term commitment but not promising an equitable share of combat forces. At the 2008 NATO Summit, allies aimed to persuade governments to send more forces to Afghanistan, with Canada threatening to withdraw troops if allies didn't commit 1,000 new combat troops. Former President Bush pledged to increase U.S. forces by 5,000 troops, France agreed to send 720 combat troops, and Germany also agreed to deploy troops. At the 2008 NATO Summit, allies aimed to persuade governments to send more forces to Afghanistan. France agreed to send 720 combat troops, and Germany agreed to deploy an additional 1,000 troops pending approval. Other allies pledged smaller contingents, addressing Canadian concerns. U.S. and NATO conducted strategy reviews to address security deterioration in Afghanistan, focusing on preventing militants from crossing the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. More forces were deemed necessary. In September 2008, former President Bush announced the deployment of at least 5,000 additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan by early 2009. General McKiernan suggested the need for about 25,000 more troops, while the Obama administration considered sending an additional 20,000-30,000 troops. President Obama committed 17,000 troops upon taking office, and the new Administration hinted at asking partner countries for more forces or equipment for the ISAF mission. Initial reactions in Europe were not positive. In December 2008, U.K. Prime Minister indicated he could only contribute 300 British troops in 2009. Italy and Spain also stated they could not increase troop commitments to Afghanistan. Critics suggested that if NATO member countries each contributed 200-400 additional troops, ISAF could deploy 5,000-10,000 new assets. Critics questioned why countries like Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, with large armed forces, only contributed less than 500 troops each to the ISAF mission. They also criticized Turkey for only providing 800 troops despite having a significant military presence in northern Cyprus. The reluctance of NATO allies to commit more troops was attributed to opposition from European citizens and budget constraints worsened by the global economic crisis. These factors complicated the U.S. Administration's efforts to improve conditions in Afghanistan. The NATO allies were expecting President Obama to request more troops at the April 2009 NATO summit in Germany and France. Additional European forces were pledged to ISAF, with the British committing 700 troops, Germans 600, Italy 450, France 300, and Spain 400. These forces were to assist in training Afghan security forces and preparing for the August presidential election. The NATO allies expected President Obama to request more troops at the April 2009 NATO summit. Additional European forces were pledged to ISAF to help train Afghan security forces and prepare for the August presidential elections. Some allies believed combat forces were necessary to stabilize the southern sector and reverse the deterioration in other areas. General McChrystal's assessment called for 40,000 more combat troops and trainers, leading to President's decision to send additional U.S. combat troops. The NATO allies were critical of U.S. abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, leading to a contentious debate over NATO operations in Afghanistan. They insisted on addressing the issue of prisoner treatment in the final communiqu\u00e9. The NATO allies debated addressing prisoner treatment in Afghanistan, with the final document stating support for international detention standards. Some allies preferred prisoners be handed over to the Afghan government, not the United States. Allegations of Afghan officials torturing detainees received attention. ISAF, led by U.S. General Stanley McChrystal, operates in Afghanistan with NATO's political direction. ISAF oversees five Regional Commands led by various generals. NATO discusses command structure for future stages in Afghanistan, emphasizing counter-insurgency tasks. Some European governments were reluctant to engage in counter-insurgency tasks in Afghanistan, leading to disagreements on ISAF's mission. The Bush Administration pushed for allies to take on more responsibilities in fighting insurgents and terrorists. There was a proposal to merge ISAF and OEF under one command, but Britain, Germany, and France opposed it for various reasons related to their mission focus and capabilities. The French government supported combat operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan but was concerned about the US using NATO for broader global objectives. Despite US assurances of maintaining forces in Afghanistan, France decided to increase its combat contingent in the region. Nicolas Sarkozy decided to increase France's combat contingent in Afghanistan to address practical problems with the command structure of ISAF and OEF operations. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates considered placing all U.S. troops under General McKiernan's NATO/ISAF command to improve rapid response capabilities. After Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government took power in October 2005, they initially showed a strong commitment to stabilizing Afghanistan. However, there were differing views among allies on how to accomplish ISAF's mission due to increased Taliban activity. This led to a divergence in opinions from the December 2005 NATO communiqu\u00e9. After Chancellor Merkel took power in 2005, Germany supported military engagement in Afghanistan but advocated for a shift towards civilian projects and training activities. The previous government under Schroeder had opposed combat operations, limiting integration with NATO allies. Under Merkel, German forces can engage in combat for defense but not counter-insurgency operations. Germany has approximately 4,000 troops in ISAF trained for stability operations in the northern part of Afghanistan, leading two PRTs in Kunduz and Feyzabad. Critics argue that German forces rarely venture beyond their PRTs, do not go on extended patrols, and do not always respond to local security incidents, hindering NATO's active approach to rebuilding and gaining Afghan trust. German forces in Afghanistan are facing increased danger from Taliban operations, with instances of civilian and soldier casualties. They are authorized for combat but not for counter-insurgency operations. Germany agreed to assist allied forces in emergencies at NATO's 2006 Riga summit and deployed Tornado aircraft for surveillance in 2007. Chancellor Merkel rejected NATO's appeal to keep German forces in Afghanistan in 2007. In Afghanistan, German Chancellor Merkel rejected NATO's request to send forces to the south for stabilization operations. Public support for the Afghan mission in Germany has declined, with only 34% supporting German involvement in 2007. Support for combat operations against the Taliban also decreased to around 36%. Despite criticism, Germany announced plans to increase troop levels by up to 1,000 in June 2008. In October 2008, the German government extended troop commitment to Afghanistan by sending an additional 1,000 troops. The German Bundestag approved this decision, specifying that no further troop increase would be allowed. Approximately 600 troops were deployed to boost Germany's efforts in northern Afghanistan, focusing on training Afghan troops. Berlin also pledged 3 million euros to support the Afghanistan police force through the United Nations-backed Trust Fund. The German government extended troop commitment to Afghanistan in October 2008 by sending an additional 1,000 troops, with a focus on training Afghan troops. Low public support and political opposition dampened expectations for an increased German role in Afghanistan beyond 2009. Chancellor Merkel won reelection in 2009 and continues to support the war effort, with the possibility of sending additional troops to Afghanistan in the future. The Dutch government debated sending troops to Afghanistan, with concerns over rules of engagement and reluctance to align closely with U.S. forces. Dutch forces were concentrated in Uruzgan province, a Taliban hotspot. The Netherlands played a key role in NATO discussions on allied treatment of terrorism. The Dutch government initially opposed sending troops to Afghanistan but eventually deployed significant levels for duty in ISAF operations. In December 2007, the Dutch parliament agreed to keep troops in Afghanistan but start a withdrawal in August 2010, with all forces withdrawn by December 1, 2010. The parliament expressed dismay at the lack of allied support in southern Afghanistan and emphasized reconstruction over combat operations. The Dutch government emphasized reconstruction over combat operations in ISAF missions in Afghanistan. Dutch troops are willing to use force to subdue the Taliban to create stability for reconstruction projects. They have engaged in combat alongside U.S. troops since late summer 2006, resulting in casualties. The Netherlands has provided F-16s for missions in ISAF and OEF, with a focus on engaging regional countries like Pakistan, India, and Iran for stability in Afghanistan. The Dutch government prioritizes reconstruction over combat in Afghanistan, advocating for stability through engagement with regional countries like Pakistan, India, and Iran. They propose a general fund to compensate victims of NATO's mistaken attacks and stress the need for a common approach in addressing the drug trade. Some argue that security is essential for reconstruction, emphasizing the clearance of the Taliban before economic development can progress. The Dutch support building infrastructure to boost the Afghan economy and provide hope for the future. The Dutch prioritize reconstruction in Afghanistan, advocating for stability through engagement with regional countries. They believe the Afghan government should take responsibility for planning and implementing projects to promote good governance. The Dutch provide direct assistance in projects like clean water and alternative crops. Some U.S. officials criticize the Dutch approach of funding the Afghan government directly, fearing misuse of funds. The governments of Britain and Canada, along with the United States, have similar views on how ISAF should fulfill its mission in Afghanistan. They have sent combat forces, maintained PRTs in unstable areas, and engaged the Taliban aggressively. British and Canadian forces arrived in Afghanistan in spring 2006 for Stage Three, working under OEF command before being rebadged as NATO forces for ISAF's mission. U.S. officials believe ISAF should undertake tasks from peacekeeping to combat operations against the Taliban and warlords, while OEF focuses on counter-terrorism against al Qaeda. The line between the two operations is often blurred. In July 2007, NATO announced a new policy to limit civilian casualties during combat operations in Afghanistan. President Karzai criticized air strikes for causing civilian deaths, which he believed alienated the population. Despite efforts to minimize harm, civilian casualties remain a major concern for the Afghan government. The British government has adopted a more aggressive stance in Afghanistan due to increased Taliban activity, with approximately 9,000 ISAF troops deployed throughout the country, mainly in the south. British forces in Helmand province focus on clearing areas of Taliban and undertaking reconstruction projects. Recently, they launched a massive offensive operation in northern Helmand. The British government has launched a massive offensive operation in northern Helmand to clear out insurgents. They have a vested interest in ISAF's stabilization mission due to concerns about terrorist activity and heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to the UK. The debate in Britain revolves around balancing combat missions with reconstruction efforts, with a focus on reconciling elements of the insurgency with the Karzai government. The Brown government faced political and economic strain after the Bucharest summit in April 2008. There were calls for early general elections, and some suggested Brown step down as leader of the Labor Party. Despite some recovery due to actions taken during the global economic crisis, sending additional troops to Afghanistan reflected ongoing opposition to the war in the UK. Public skepticism grew over the adequacy of supplies for British forces in Afghanistan. The UK's new army chief, General David Richards, supported the U.S. call for more allied troops in Afghanistan. Canada and the Netherlands plan to withdraw troops by 2010, which could impact the 2010 elections in Britain. Canadian forces are involved in combat operations against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan and aim to transfer operations to the Afghan National Army. Canada's involvement in Afghanistan has been a topic of debate, with public support for the mission decreasing over time. In 2006, the Canadian parliament approved sending 2,300 troops to ISAF until 2009, but by 2007, support had dropped to 52%. The need for combat operations in Afghanistan has eroded support for the ISAF mission. Canada's commitment to the ISAF mission was extended until 2011, with approximately 2800 troops deployed. Additional support includes helicopters and unmanned aerial-recon units. The French government emphasizes the need for a combat force to aid Afghan governance, with 3100 troops deployed as of October 2009. France has deployed 3,100 troops in ISAF for combat and stabilization missions. French President Nicolas Sarkozy supports Paris's commitment to ISAF, with Mirage fighter bombers and C135 tankers aiding in intelligence and air support missions. France has built operational \"OMLTs\" and participates in joint combat forces with other allies. At the NATO Bucharest summit in April 2008, President Sarkozy pledged 720 combat troops for Afghanistan, operating under U.S. command in the east where Taliban activities are high. The Socialist Party in France criticized Sarkozy's decision to increase French forces in Afghanistan, accusing him of supporting the American war effort in Iraq. President Sarkozy pledged 720 combat troops for Afghanistan at the NATO Bucharest summit in April 2008, despite French public opposition to the Iraq war. Troops were sent as part of a NATO strategy to counter global terrorism. Criticism increased after a French patrol was ambushed by Taliban forces, but the French Parliament voted to continue supporting French participation in Afghanistan. Additional 100 troops were announced to be sent by President Sarkozy. President Sarkozy announced the deployment of 100 additional troops, helicopters, and drones to Afghanistan. French forces are following more restrictive rules of engagement to minimize civilian casualties and have visual recognition of targets before attacking. France's support for NATO's mutual security clause was influenced by the 9/11 attacks, leading to significant changes in French NATO policy. After the 9/11 attacks, France shifted its stance on NATO's responsibilities, embracing a global security role to combat terrorism and WMD proliferation. French officials prioritize ISAF as NATO's key mission and have made progress in developing deployable forces, including strategic lift and special forces capabilities. French aerial tankers support not only their own aircraft but also those of allies like the U.S. and Dutch in Afghanistan. French aerial tankers refuel not only French aircraft in the Afghan theater, but also U.S., Dutch, and Belgian aircraft. This contributes to the integration of NATO forces in Afghanistan and the ability of ISAF and OEF to share capabilities and command. French forces are praised for their ability and willingness to fight, although President Sarkozy has been hesitant to commit more troops. French officials emphasize the need for a long-term effort to eradicate the opium industry in Afghanistan, as it fuels terrorist groups and affects western societies. They believe that the Afghan government must learn to govern the country themselves, with assistance from NATO and partner states. France believes that the Afghan government must govern the country themselves and build good governance to gain the confidence of its people. They do not think PRTs can play a significant role in Afghanistan and do not agree with the idea that NATO's role includes building democracy in the country. France also believes that the EU, U.N., and World Bank are better suited for development projects than NATO. The European Union has focused on providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan, contributing approximately \u20ac1.65 billion since 2002. EU aid is aligned with Afghanistan's National Development Strategy, shifting towards strategic Annual Action Programs. \u20ac700 million was programmed for 2007-2010, with an additional \u20ac420 million expected for 2011-2013. The EU allocated \u20ac700 million for 2007-2010, with an additional \u20ac420 million expected for 2011-2013. Funding focused on governance (40%), rural development (30%), and health (20%). In 2009, an Election Observation Mission was established for the Afghan elections. The EU also contributed \u20ac35m to the UN Fund for Electoral support. EUPOL training mission for Afghan police began in 2007 but faced challenges in recruiting qualified personnel. The EUPOL training mission in Kabul has faced delays in recruiting personnel and strained relations with NATO. Observers noted that half of the allocated personnel were not deployed, and no Afghan police had been trained. Turkey's actions, blocking intelligence sharing and protection agreements with NATO, were linked to its dispute with the EU. EU officials plan to expand the mission, potentially doubling the training team. Turkey's actions, seen as a result of its dispute with the EU, have affected intelligence sharing and protection agreements with NATO. In the 111th Congress, there is bipartisan support for the Afghanistan mission, but some members are concerned about the increasing number of U.S. troops and rising costs. The Afghan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorizes U.S. aid for various efforts in Afghanistan, with over $200 billion appropriated since 9/11. Administration officials stated that the U.S. spends around $2 billion per month in Afghanistan. In 2009, the United States spent $2 billion a month in Afghanistan on troops and reconstruction. The President's commitment of 17,000 troops increased the figure, with 30,000 more troops arriving in 2010. Senator Biden and Senator Lugar introduced a bill to increase non-military aid to Pakistan for counter-terrorism efforts. The new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan introduced by President Obama contained elements of the Biden/Lugar approach. Congressional hearings during the 111th Congress addressed various Afghanistan-related issues, including troop levels, command arrangements, counter-narcotics efforts, and PRTs. Committees pressed for a detailed accounting of ISAF's operations and urged allies to contribute more forces. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established reporting requirements. The Act for Fiscal Year 2008 established reporting requirements for progress in Afghanistan, including reports on security, stability, and Afghan National Security Forces. Congress approved $4.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2009. Hearings in 2009 and 2010 will focus on the conflict, NATO commitment, Kabul government authority, and border security. The House passed H.R. 1886, providing $4.5 billion for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Reconstruction Opportunity Zones Act aimed to establish U.S. trade preferences. Afghanistan's political transition has been slow, with challenges in governance and security persisting. According to a March 2008 report by the Atlantic Council, the situation in Afghanistan has reached a strategic stalemate. Efforts to eliminate the Taliban threat militarily have been hindered by their sanctuary in Pakistan, and civil development initiatives have not been successful. Calls have been made for reaching out to moderate Taliban forces for a potential cease-fire and coalition government. Meetings between the Kabul government and some Taliban elements have taken place, but the movement appears too fragmented for significant progress. The Taliban is too disjointed for a political settlement. President Obama's strategy includes engaging moderate elements of the Taliban. The Karzai government faces challenges like warlords, corruption, and the Taliban. NATO aims to support the government while pushing for better governance. Former NATO General Carl Eikenberry notes the weakness of Afghan state institutions. President Karzai's popularity has declined, with concerns about his leadership. President Karzai faced criticism for losing Afghan people's confidence due to slow reconstruction and lack of international support. General Butler highlighted the need for visible progress to maintain public consent, emphasizing governance over the Taliban insurgency. The 2009 national elections saw opposition to Karzai from former government officials. U.S. and NATO leaders navigated a delicate balance during the campaign amidst ongoing war efforts. NATO faced challenges in assisting the newly reelected Karzai government, needing to address corruption and insurgency while also promoting reconstruction and alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers. The mission required a delicate balance between forceful measures against the narcotics trade and building trust with the Afghan people. NATO officials deny burning poppy fields, but provide support to Afghan security forces. Progress has been made in training Afghan officials and building a professional army. The ANA is expected to reach 134,000 troops by 2011. Efforts are being made to reform the judicial system. The international community is working on reforming the judicial system and building an effective police force in Afghanistan. Italy has urged donor nations to provide more funding for these efforts. The EU is responsible for training the police, but progress has been slow. NATO faces challenges in its ranks and on the ground in Afghanistan, with allies differing on the means and resources needed for stabilization. NATO commanders struggle to persuade allies to contribute forces to ISAF. Despite difficulties persuading allies to contribute forces to ISAF or provide necessary equipment, only modest troop increases are expected. The issue of military equipment remains unresolved, with many allied forces lacking essential resources. The global economic crisis has hindered the ability of some militaries to acquire needed equipment. NATO governments continue to send forces ill-suited for combat tasks. At the April NATO summit, allies were hesitant to send forces to confront the Taliban and warlords. Some believe combat operations and addressing the drug trade can prevent the return of extremist groups, while others focus on winning hearts and minds through economic development for stability. Good governance and reconstruction are seen as crucial for building a viable Afghan state, with a need for more road building to extend Kabul's reach and provide infrastructure. Former Deputy Commander in Afghanistan, now U.S. Ambassador to Kabul, General Karl Eikenberry, emphasized the importance of investing in road infrastructure over deploying more troops for stability. NATO Secretary General and international institutions are also calling for increased funds for reconstruction in Afghanistan. Political differences within the alliance have subsided with the Obama Administration's strategy taking hold. The allies view Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) as crucial for stabilization efforts. Some Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan are effective in building infrastructure and gaining local confidence, while others are seen as mere showcases. NATO member countries believe it will take years to establish a market economy and governance, with ongoing economic assistance required. However, global economic challenges have delayed the actual disbursement of pledged funds for Afghanistan's development strategy. Key allied governments express commitment to remaining in Afghanistan. Many allied governments express commitment to stabilizing Afghanistan for years, but face public fatigue and declining support for the ISAF mission. President Obama addressed concerns about potential attacks on Europe during his trip to Europe in April 2008. President Obama's trip to Europe in April 2008 addressed concerns about potential attacks on Europe by al Qaeda. However, European public support for the Afghanistan mission is waning, complicating the implementation of the new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Netherlands and Canada have set dates for the withdrawal of their forces from Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Additional NATO allies may follow suit if the situation in Afghanistan does not improve by mid-2010. The Afghanistan mission is a test of NATO's capability and political will. Several NATO allies are considering setting withdrawal timetables if the situation does not improve by mid-2010. A United Nations conference is scheduled for January 2010 to discuss restoring stability in Afghanistan and potential exit strategies for the military engagement. President Obama's suggestion of an exit strategy is expected to spark a lively debate at the conference. The NATO allies in Afghanistan aim to stabilize the country and prevent terrorism. However, the resurgence of the Taliban and lack of progress by the Afghan government have led to doubts among allies about a long-term commitment. The NATO allies in Afghanistan are facing wavering commitment due to doubts about the long-term stability of the country. Observers predict that stabilization efforts may take at least five more years, leading to potential public pressure on allied governments to reduce military commitments. Public opinion surveys show declining support for combat operations against the Taliban in Europe and the United States. Recent polls in the United States and Europe show declining support for combat operations against the Taliban. The stalemate in Afghanistan poses a dilemma for NATO allies, with doubts about long-term stability leading to potential pressure to reduce military commitments. Negative public opinion in some allied nations is partly attributed to the previous Bush Administration's foreign policy, with observers noting a more positive international effect from the new U.S. Administration. The Obama Administration's renewed emphasis on Afghanistan has led to mixed pressure on NATO allies. Debate over sending more troops has resumed, with the US urging allies to lift restrictive national caveats for more flexibility. Increased military engagement is seen as necessary for rapid development of Afghan infrastructure and institutions. NATO's exit strategy for Afghanistan involves supporting economic development, providing security for the government, and addressing issues like violence and corruption. The success of the mission will test the United States' leadership and commitment to leading NATO, with external factors like Iran and Pakistan playing a significant role in stabilization efforts. The success of NATO's mission in Afghanistan will test the United States' leadership and commitment to leading the alliance, impacting its future cohesiveness and Washington's ability to shape NATO's direction."
