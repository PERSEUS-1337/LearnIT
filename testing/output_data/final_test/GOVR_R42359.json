    "content": "Approximately 28.7 million taxpayers reported pass-through business income totaling over $687 billion in 2011. The average amount reported was $26,011. The distribution of pass-through income by adjusted gross income (AGI) is analyzed, with taxpayers earning $100,000 or more accounting for 84% of pass-through income. In 2011, 23% of returns reported pass-through income, with a significant portion going to upper-income earners. Taxpayers with AGI over $250,000 received 63% of pass-through income, while those with AGI over $1 million earned 32%. Sole proprietorship income was more evenly distributed across income groups compared to partnership and S corporation income. In 2011, a significant portion of pass-through income went to upper-income earners, with taxpayers earning over $100,000 receiving nearly 48% and those with AGI over $1 million earning about 52% of S corporation income. Net losses for partnerships and S corporations were concentrated at the lower end of the income distribution, potentially due to start-up or failing businesses. Some losses in partnerships and S corporations may be due to failing businesses, with a distinction between active and passive income. Active income is exempt from the 3.8% net investment tax and results from active participation in a business, while passive income is from a business where the taxpayer did not materially participate. Passive income is earned by silent partners with no active involvement in the business, while active income is earned by those actively managing the business. Sole proprietor income is mostly active. Partnership income is 76% active and 24% passive, while S corporation income is 90% active and 10% passive. Passive income is more common among higher income individuals. Tax reform discussions have considered reducing tax rates on pass-through entities. Recent tax reform discussions aim to lower tax rates on pass-through income, with proposals limiting the maximum tax rate to 25%. The House and Senate majority party leaders, along with the Trump Administration, have issued a tax reform framework. Other proposed changes include adjustments to the tax treatment of depreciable assets, business interest, and potential restrictions on business deductions and credits. Lowering the maximum statutory tax rate on pass-through income could stimulate investment in the short-run and impact the economy's performance. Tax experts have raised concerns about the incentive for individuals to characterize labor income as business income and the complexity of the tax system based on business organization. Lowering the maximum statutory tax rate on pass-through income could stimulate investment in the short-run, but may not be as effective as other proposed tax reforms like expensing new investments. A rate reduction may provide windfall gains for old investments and the longer-term economic impact is uncertain, especially if deficits increase leading to higher future interest rates and potential tax hikes. Lowering taxes on pass-through income could stimulate the economy in the short-run, but may reduce the progressivity of the tax code. However, the long-term impact is uncertain without more details on overall tax reform. Most pass-through income is earned by high-income individuals, so the benefits of tax cuts would likely favor the wealthy. Lowering taxes on pass-through income may benefit upper-income individuals, making the tax system less progressive. The assumption that pass-throughs represent small businesses is incorrect, as the majority of businesses are small. Large firms also contribute significantly to pass-through employment. If the goal is to assist small businesses, tax policies should be based on accurate data. Tax policies aimed at assisting small businesses should be based on firm size rather than legal form. Lowering the tax rate on pass-through business income may lead to income recharacterization to reduce taxes. The Unified Framework and the Better Way propose a 25% maximum tax rate on pass-through income, while labor income would be taxed at 35% and 33% respectively. This discrepancy may incentivize individuals to classify labor income as business income to benefit from the lower tax rate. A comprehensive tax reform should address the discrepancy in taxation between corporate and non-corporate businesses. Simply reducing the tax burden on pass-through income would not solve the issue of different tax treatment for similar businesses based on legal structure. Special tax incentives like exclusions, credits, and deductions contribute to the complexity of the tax system. Policymakers need to consider these factors when designing tax policies for small businesses. Policymakers have not proposed detailed plans to reduce business tax incentives in exchange for rate cuts. The Tax Policy Center estimates a revenue loss of $769.6 billion over ten years for limiting pass-through income tax rate to 25%. The Better Way proposal would lose $412.8 billion over the same period due to rate reductions. The discrepancy in estimates is partly due to how labor income is classified under the Better Way proposal. The Tax Foundation analyzed the Better Way plan, estimating a cost of $515 billion over ten years for pass-through income rate reduction using static modeling, and $388 billion using dynamic modeling. The TPC also provided a dynamic estimate for the Better Way plan. As of now, estimates for the Unified Framework are not available from these groups. Estimators caution that current revenue estimates for draft proposals are based on assumptions due to missing details in legislative language, which could significantly change with the release of more plan details."
