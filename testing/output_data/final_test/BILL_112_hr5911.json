The term 'lead-based paint' refers to paint or surface coatings containing lead exceeding specified levels. Postabatement clearance testing is also defined.

The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to require a study on lead exposure in renovation and remodeling activities in buildings constructed before 1978. The study aims to assess the risks of lead exposure and paint hazards created during such activities in different building types. The timeline for the study completion is specified within 4 years. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to exempt emergency renovations from regulations and clearance testing requirements. Additionally, the Administrator is required to promulgate regulations for target housing owners within 60 days. The Administrator must create regulations allowing owners of target housing to authorize contractors to bypass renovation requirements if the owner resides in the dwelling and provides a written certification. The written certification must confirm that the renovation project is at the owner's residential dwelling, no pregnant woman or child under 6 lives there, and the contractor is exempt from renovation regulations. The contractor cannot ignore renovation regulations if they know a pregnant woman or child under 6 lives in the residential dwelling. The contractor is not liable for the owner's misrepresentation unless they are aware of it. The Administrator will recognize and publish in the Federal Register notice of a qualifying test kit for use under this title. If no qualifying test kit is recognized within 1 year, enforcement of certain regulations may be suspended. The Administrator will recognize and publish a qualifying test kit for use under this title, and may not enforce post-1960 building renovation regulations for a specified period after recognition. The Administrator will publish a notice in the Federal Register regarding the recognition of a test kit for post-1960 building renovation regulations. Enforcement of these regulations will resume after a specified period, except for residential dwellings with pregnant women or children under 6. A qualifying test kit for lead-based paint must have a low false positive and false negative rate, be commercially available, and easy to use without special training. Post-1960 building renovation and remodeling regulation defines regulations for target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings constructed after January 1, 1960. Any regulation requiring documentation submission must provide an exemption from penalties. The regulation allows for an exemption from penalties for first-time documentation submission with minor errors, as determined by the Administrator. Accredited recertification courses are exempt from hands-on training requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency requires completion of renovation and remodeling activities by certified individuals under this title."
