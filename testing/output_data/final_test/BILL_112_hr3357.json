    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Marriage Violates the Human Rights of Girls Act of 2011\". The findings are also included in the Act. Child marriage, also known as forced or early marriage, deprives girls of their human rights. It violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by not ensuring free and full consent. An estimated 60 million girls in developing countries were married before 18, with projections of 100 million more in the next decade. Child marriage has negative effects on girls' health, including increased risk of maternal death, obstetric fistula, sexually transmitted diseases, and infant mortality. Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, lack of educational opportunities, parental concerns, the dowry system, and the devaluation of girls. Girls' schooling, safe community spaces, and skills building programs for out-of-school girls are effective strategies to prevent child marriage and empower girls by addressing poverty, low status, and harmful norms. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasizes that ending child marriage is crucial for achieving goals like primary education, improved health, and sustainable economic development for girls. Child marriage is defined as the marriage of a girl or boy below the minimum age for marriage in their country or under 18 if no such law exists.

The sense of Congress is that child marriage is a violation of human rights and should be a foreign policy goal of the United States.
