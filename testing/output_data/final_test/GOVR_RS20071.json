    "content": "The United States Fire Administration (USFA), part of FEMA under DHS, aims to reduce fire-related deaths, injuries, and property loss. Despite progress, the US still faces a high fire death rate. In 2015, there were 1,345,500 fires and 3,280 civilian fire deaths. In 2015, the National Fire Protection Association reported 1,345,500 fires, 3,280 civilian fire deaths, 15,700 civilian fire injuries, and $14.3 billion in property loss. The USFA and FEMA's fire prevention efforts stem from the 1973 America Burning report, recommending a federal fire agency to reduce fire-related casualties and property damage. Congress established the agency within the Department of Commerce through the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974. The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (NFPCA) was established in 1974 under the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-498). In 1978, NFPCA was renamed USFA (P.L. 95-422) and placed under FEMA in 1979. The National Fire Academy (NFA) was opened in 1979 in Emmitsburg, MD, offering training to fire service personnel. In the early 1980s, there were attempts to eliminate USFA, leading to staff reductions and the separation of the Fire Academy. However, in 1991, the NFA was reorganized back into the USFA, where it remains today. The USFA is currently located at the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, MD. Programs include data collection through the National Fire Data Center (NFDC) and public education initiatives targeting vulnerable groups for fire safety awareness. The USFA offers educational opportunities for fire/EMS officers and allied professionals, focusing on fire prevention and life safety. They also conduct research to improve fire and life safety measures. The USFA focuses on fire prevention, life safety, and research on firefighter health and safety. President Trump appointed Chief G. Keith Bryant as the USFA Administrator in 2017. The USFA receives funding through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. The USFA, under the Department of Homeland Security, was restructured in 2005 and later transferred back to FEMA in 2007. The FY2017 budget proposed a decrease in funding for USFA, with allocations for facilities improvement and distance learning. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $44 million for USFA in the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017, matching the FY2016 level. The committee's report highlighted support for NFIRS and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. The House Appropriations Committee also approved its version of the Department of Homeland Security budget. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017, transferring the USFA budget into a broader \"Federal Assistance\" account in FEMA. The bill allocated $42.5 million for USFA under the Federal Assistance account and $1.5 million for National Fire Academy facility costs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 funded USFA at $44 million in FY2017, with $42.5 million for Education, Training, and Exercises and $1.5 million for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. The Administration requested $43.41 million for USFA in FY2018, slightly lower than the previous year. The FY2018 budget proposal requested $41.913 million for Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.497 million for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. The House Appropriations Committee approved the same funding levels. Additionally, the House passed a FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill that included an amendment adding $1 million for USFA's State Fire Training Assistance grants. The House passed a FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill that included an amendment adding $1 million for USFA's State Fire Training Assistance grants, bringing the total funding for USFA to $44.41 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $44.993 million for USFA in FY2019, with $43.493 million allocated for Education, Training, and Exercises and $1.5 million for the National Emergency Training Center. The Senate bill S. 3109 provides $44 million to USFA for the National Fire Academy and $1.5 million for the National Emergency Training Center. The House bill also allocates similar funding amounts for education, training, and exercises. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $45.679 million for USFA, with $1.5 million for the National Emergency Training Center. The FY2020 budget proposal includes $46.605 million for USFA, with $1.5 million for NETC campus renovations. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 reauthorized USFA through FY2008 at $63 million. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 reauthorized the USFA through FY2008 with increasing funding levels. It also reinstated the position of the U.S. Fire Administrator and directed the development of new firefighting technologies and standards. The Act required equipment purchased with fire grant money to meet or exceed voluntary consensus standards. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 reauthorized USFA through FY2008 with increasing funding levels. Provisions included authorizing National Fire Academy training program modifications, directing training on various incidents, entering into contracts for training delivery, upgrading the national fire incident reporting system, sponsoring research on fire prevention, and establishing a state and local fire service position at the National Operations Center within DHS. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2012, signed into law on January 2, 2013, reauthorized USFA through FY2017 with an annual budget of $76,490,890. It also allocated funds for technology evaluation and standards development, authorized the appointment of a Deputy Administrator, and granted the Administrator flexibility in decision-making. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2012 reauthorized USFA through FY2017 with a budget of $76,490,890 and granted flexibility to the Administrator. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 4661 sought to reauthorize USFA through FY2023 and was passed by the House on December 18, 2017. The House passed H.R. 4661 on December 18, 2017, and the Senate passed it on December 21, 2017. The President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98) on January 3, 2018, extending USFA authorization through FY2023 with consistent funding levels. The Fire Grant Program (P.L. 106-398) provides federal grants to local fire departments and EMS organizations for equipment, training, and firefighter-related needs. The SAFER program offers grants for firefighter hiring and retention. The program has been administered by various agencies over the years, with USFA now under FEMA. Congressional reports have emphasized USFA involvement in the program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that FEMA has not clearly defined USFA's role in the fire grants program, highlighting the need for formalized collaboration between the two organizations. The USFA's role and responsibilities need to be clearly defined and agreed upon to enhance collaboration with GPD in supporting fire grants programs. An agreement was signed in December 2016 between USFA and FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate to improve fire grants management. Concerns about future funding levels for USFA due to federal budget deficit. Debate over USFA budget focuses on whether funding is adequate for its mission, as appropriations have been consistently below authorized levels. The 116th Congress may review USFA's role. The 116th Congress may consider expanding the role of USFA, as seen in H.R. 1646, the HERO Act. There are ongoing concerns about the viability and status of USFA and the National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security. Since its establishment in March 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has faced opposition from fire service groups over actions taken regarding the US Fire Administration and National Fire Academy. This included the abolishment and subsequent reinstatement of the U.S. Fire Administrator position, proposed cancellations of NFA courses in 2003, and the transfer of the fire grant program to the DHS Office for Domestic Preparedness."
