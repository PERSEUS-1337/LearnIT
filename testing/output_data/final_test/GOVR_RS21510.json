    "content": "In February 2003, the United States requested NATO to provide Turkey with defensive systems in case of an attack by Iraq. France, Germany, and Belgium objected, citing concerns about the justification for war. NATO Secretary General invoked the \"silence procedure,\" leading to the U.S. request being blocked. The U.S. requested NATO to provide Turkey with defense systems. Turkey then requested consultations under Article IV of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Defense Planning Committee (DPC) granted the request, deploying AWACS, Patriot missiles, and other defensive systems to protect Turkey. Consensus in the NAC is crucial for important strategic issues within NATO. NATO's decision-making structure includes the North Atlantic Council (NAC) in Brussels, chaired by the Secretary General, with representatives from each of the 19 member states. The Military Committee (MC) makes key military proposals, chaired by a senior European military officer. France, while not part of the integrated military structure, has observer status in the MC but full representation in the NAC. The NAC has the authority to approve all key MC documents. The NAC, consisting of representatives from all 19 member states, approves key MC documents. A working group at the colonel level was established by the MC to plan NATO forces' deployment to Bosnia in the 1990s. After eight months of meetings, a document was drafted and approved by the MC, then refined and approved by all 19 NAC representatives. Consensus is reached when no government objects, allowing ample opportunity for member governments to influence NATO decisions. NATO does not require a formal vote for conflicts, but governments can object if they oppose a decision. The EU seeks unanimity on key issues, while NATO uses a \"silence procedure\" for consensus. This procedure allows governments to avoid confrontation and provides cover for those in opposition. The \"silence procedure\" in NATO allows governments to avoid explicit objections to policies by not sending a letter to the Secretary General within a specified time period. This procedure failed in defense planning for Turkey when multiple governments were in opposition. The DPC in NATO operates on the principle of consensus, with proposals sent to the Military Committee or NAC for approval. France's withdrawal from NATO is also mentioned. In 1992, NATO transferred decision-making to the NAC for military operations due to France's desire to participate. This set a precedent for future NATO operations, including SFOR, Operation Allied Force, and KFOR, all driven by France's involvement. France, Belgium, and Germany objected to military assistance to Turkey in 2003, with the US playing a key role. In February 2003, the United States played a key role in approving Turkey's request for military assistance under Article IV, raising concerns about weakening the principle of consensus within NATO. While most U.S. officials support consensus decision-making, some acknowledge the challenges in reaching consensus as NATO operations expand beyond traditional areas. Support for consensus is driven by the desire to maintain political solidarity for controversial measures, with the consent of 19 sovereign governments seen as a strong expression of solidarity. The decision to work with other governments in NATO can show solidarity but may come with political costs and delays in reaching consensus. An example was NATO's decision to go to war against Serbia in 1999, where the need for consensus outweighed the need for quick action. The Kosovo conflict highlighted the challenges of maintaining consensus within NATO. The Kosovo conflict in 1999 showcased the challenges of maintaining consensus within NATO. Critics, including some Members of Congress, questioned the target-selection process, with France receiving particular criticism for objecting to specific targets. NATO, including the United States, aimed to avoid civilian casualties without a U.N. resolution to legitimize their actions, leading to a decision to attack targets in three escalating phases. Each phase of the NATO target-selection process in the Kosovo conflict required consent from the NAC. Phase I targeted military targets like air defense systems and troop concentrations. Phase II focused on infrastructure like bridges and petroleum depots, while Phase III targeted significant sites associated with Serb repression, such as police headquarters involved in ethnic cleansing. The Pentagon, White House, and British government raised barriers and sought delays before attacking Phase II and III targets, with occasional objections from France and other governments. The Kosovo conflict highlighted political pressure on NATO's NAC to maintain consensus during military action, with France often singled out for objections. Different governments vary in their emphasis on civilian control of the military and reactions to civilian casualties. The US government has more confidence in its armed forces for target selection, while some allies, like France and Germany, impose greater restraints due to historical military involvement in political affairs or excessive force against civilians. The diversity of viewpoints in the NAC requires constant negotiation to provide authority to the SACEUR for military operations. Wrangling over document phrasing can clarify decisions or create vagueness for political cover. Changing the consensus principle as NATO considers new members raises questions about confidence in candidate states. Some US officials lack confidence in NATO candidates' ability to participate in decision-making, expressing displeasure with attempts to divide Europe. Concerns about marginalizing France and Germany and potential US unilateralism have been raised. The political complexities of NAC and MC debates complicate efforts to move away from the consensus principle. Some US officials suggest a new process for NATO decision-making, similar to the EU model of weighted voting based on population. Critics argue that NATO's focus on mutual defense requires a different approach, as decisions involve national interests and soldiers' lives. The EU's approach to decision-making, involving deal-making and sharing of sovereignty, may not be suitable for NATO. However, NATO is exploring the concept of \"committees of contributors\" from the EU for issues involving selected governments. The concept of \"committees of contributors\" in NATO involves governments with direct interests contributing troops and assets for military operations. These committees formulate plans and seek approval from the NAC to use NATO assets, endorsing members' right to act in their own interests. The concept of \"committees of contributors\" in NATO involves governments contributing troops and assets for military operations. These committees streamline decision-making and keep it within the interests of involved governments, avoiding the need to go through the DPC. France's involvement in key NATO military operations and its desire to participate in missions are highlighted, given its significant military forces and role in Eurocorps. Belgium, a small country in NATO, has minimal military capability to contribute to high-intensity conflicts. Some officials argue that small countries like Belgium could insist on NAC decision-making for out-of-area missions, as assets used belong to NATO as a whole."
