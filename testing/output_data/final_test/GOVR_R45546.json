    "content": "The Colorado River Basin covers over 246,000 square miles, running through seven U.S. states and Mexico. The Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior, manages the basin's waters, with a prominent role in the Lower Basin. Federal facilities provide water and hydropower supplies to users for agricultural irrigation and municipal purposes. Colorado River water is used for agricultural irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes, power production, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Basin waters irrigate 5.5 million acres of land and provide water supplies to nearly 40 million people. Storage and conveyance facilities allow for trans-basin diversions to areas outside the Colorado River Basin. Hydropower facilities can generate up to 42 gigawatts of electrical power. The Colorado River hydropower facilities can generate 42 gigawatts of power annually. The river supports various species and recreational opportunities. Flows in the basin are dependent on snowmelt and have decreased during the current drought since 2000. The dry conditions in 2018 were the driest in over 100 years of record keeping. The period from 2000 to 2018 was the driest in over 100 years of record keeping, consistent with past droughts identified through tree ring studies. Climate change may worsen prolonged drought in the Colorado River basin. Congress and the federal government have a significant role in managing the basin, funding Reclamation's operations and programs for endangered species. Congress also approves Indian water rights settlements. The report discusses Congress's role in managing Colorado River waters, including funding for drought mitigation and new authorities for Reclamation. It also provides background on trends and agreements since 2000, highlighting the challenges faced by local interests in the basin. The Colorado River presented engineering and economic challenges that prevented local or state groups from building necessary water infrastructure. Congress gave consent for states and Reclamation to apportion water supplies in 1921 to resolve conflicts and prevent litigation, leading to the Colorado River Compact and other agreements governing the river. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established a framework to divide water supplies between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states, with each basin allocated 7.5 MAF annually for consumptive use. The Lower Basin was granted an additional 1 MAF annually and required the Upper Basin to deliver 75 MAF over a 10-year period to the Lower Basin. Inter- and intrastate water allocations were left to future agreements and legislation. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 established water allocations between Upper and Lower Basin states, with each basin receiving 7.5 MAF annually. The Lower Basin was granted an additional 1 MAF annually, and the Upper Basin had to deliver 75 MAF over 10 years. The compact did not address intrastate water allocations or water for Mexico, which was addressed in later agreements. Congress approved and modified the compact in the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, allocating 4.4 MAF to California, 2.8 MAF to Arizona, and 300,000 AF to Nevada. The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 allocated water from the Colorado River, providing 4.4 MAF per year to California, 2.8 MAF to Arizona, and 300,000 AF to Nevada. The act also directed the Secretary of the Interior to oversee water use in the Lower Basin and authorized storage projects in the Upper Basin. California had to limit its water use to 4.4 MAF per year and not take more than half of any surplus waters, which was achieved through the California Limitation Act of March 4, 1929. Arizona ratified the Colorado River Compact in 1944 and began pursuing a federal project to bring Colorado River water to its primary population. In 1952, Arizona filed suit in the U.S. Supreme Court against California over Colorado River water rights. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Arizona, stating that each state would receive one-half of surplus flows from the river. The Supreme Court decision in 1963 established that the Boulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA) controlled water apportionment among Lower Basin States, prioritized Native American reservations on the Colorado River, and designated the Secretary of the Interior as water master. Subsequent decrees in 1964 and 1979 further clarified the ruling. Congress later authorized Arizona's Central Arizona Project (CAP) in the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968. In 1944, the United States signed the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty with Mexico to allocate water from the Colorado River and Rio Grande. The treaty requires the U.S. to provide Mexico with 1.5 MAF of water annually, with additional water during surplus conditions. The treaty also allows for reductions in water deliveries to Mexico during droughts. Additional agreements, known as minutes, have supplemented the treaty. The Upper Basin Compact of 1948 determined individual water allocations for states in the Upper Basin of the Colorado River. Colorado holds the largest entitlement at 51.75%, followed by Wyoming (14%), Utah (23%), and New Mexico (11.25%). Arizona received 50,000 AF in addition to its Lower Basin allocation. These allocations guide current water distribution in the basin. The Upper Basin Compact of 1948 determined water allocations for states in the Upper Basin of the Colorado River. The Upper Colorado River Commission was established to coordinate operations among Upper Basin states. The Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 authorized reservoirs and dams in the Upper Basin, including Glen Canyon, Flaming Gorge, Navajo, and Curecanti Dams. The act also created the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund for project costs. The 1968 CRBPA amended CRSP to authorize additional Upper Basin projects like Animas La Plata and Central Utah projects. The CRBPA of 1968 added more Upper Basin projects to the CRSP, prioritizing water releases from Lake Powell based on treaty obligations, compact requirements, and carryover storage. It established funds for Upper and Lower Basin development expenses using revenues from power generation. Basin water users can store up to 60 MAF due to large water storage projects. The Colorado River Basin has significant storage capacity at Glen Canyon Dam/Lake Powell and Hoover Dam/Lake Mead, totaling 52.3 MAF. Glen Canyon Dam regulates flows between Upper and Lower Basins, generates 5 billion KWh of electricity annually, and supplies power to 5.8 million customers. Other key storage projects in the Upper Basin include the Aspinall Unit in Colorado. The initial \"units\" of the CRSP in the Colorado River Basin include the Aspinall Unit in Colorado, the Flaming Gorge Unit in Utah, and the Navajo Unit in New Mexico. The Upper Basin also has 16 \"participating\" projects for various uses. In the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam is a key storage facility generating electricity and regulating flows, along with Davis Dam/Lake Mohave and Parker Dam/Lake Havasu. The 1944 Treaty established Parker Dam/Lake Havasu for water diversion into the Colorado River Aqueduct and CAP. Imperial Dam diverts water to the All-American Canal for California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys. Reclamation monitors reservoir levels and projects them 24 months ahead in monthly 24-month studies, informing future operating decisions. Storage conditions at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are expressed in feet above sea level. Lake Powell's elevation is measured in feet above sea level. The annual operating plan (AOP) is a report transmitted to Congress and basin states each year, outlining past and future water operations. Since 2007, Hoover and Glen Canyon Dams' operations have been tied to specific pool elevations at Lake Mead and Lake Powell. A shortage condition would be triggered if Lake Mead falls below 1,075 ft. Reclamation predicted a potential shortage at Lake Mead in 2020, with a small chance of Lake Powell dropping to minimum power pool by 2020 or 2022 due to improved hydrology in 2019. In 2022, there was a 15% increase in water supply. Efforts have been made to mitigate environmental impacts in the Colorado River Basin, particularly focusing on water quality and endangered species. Salinity control and water quality issues have been long-standing concerns in the basin due to salt-bearing shale in the Upper Basin. The 1973 agreement between the United States and Mexico set salinity standards for the Colorado River Basin, ensuring that Mexico's treaty deliveries have a limited salt content compared to water diverted at Imperial Dam. This agreement led to the passing of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 authorized desalting and salinity control facilities to improve water quality. The Yuma Desalting Plant, completed in 1992, has not operated at full capacity. The ESA was enacted in 1973, leading to the development of programs to protect and restore fish species in the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Upper Colorado Endangered Fish Recovery Program was established in 1988 to assist in the recovery of four species of endangered fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The program aims to reduce threats to species, improve their status, and eventually delist them from the ESA. Actions include providing instream flows, restoring habitat, reducing nonnative fish, stocking fish, and conducting research. Reclamation is the lead federal agency, providing most federal funds for implementation. The San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program, established in 1992, aims to assist in the recovery of ESA-listed fish species on the San Juan River. It focuses on the Razorback sucker and Colorado pikeminnow, with goals to protect genetic integrity, conserve habitat, reduce nonnative species, and monitor populations. The program is funded by various entities including federal funds, Upper Basin hydropower revenues, and contributions from states and water users. Coordination is done by FWS, while Reclamation operates projects to minimize impacts on fish populations. The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program, established in 1997, aims to operate the dam in a way that protects and improves the values of Grand Canyon National Park and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The program conducts experiments to study how water flows affect natural resources, with Reclamation modifying flows and the U.S. Geological Survey monitoring the effects. The Multispecies Conservation Program (MSCP) along the Lower Colorado River aims to conserve 27 species, including 8 listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Funded mainly by hydropower revenues from Glen Canyon Dam, the program involves multiple stakeholders to balance water and power supplies for various users. Established in 2005 through ESA consultation, the MSCP is a long-term initiative lasting at least 50 years to protect species and comply with federal regulations. The Multispecies Conservation Program (MSCP) along the Lower Colorado River, established in 2005, aims to create habitat for listed species, maintain water diversions and power production, and comply with ESA regulations. The program's total cost is approximately $626 million in 2003 dollars ($882 million in 2018 dollars), split evenly between Reclamation and the states of California, Nevada, and Arizona. The management of the Multispecies Conservation Program (MSCP) along the Lower Colorado River is overseen by Reclamation in consultation with stakeholders, including federally recognized tribes with water diversion rights. These tribes collectively have rights to 2.9 MAF per year of Colorado River water, but as of 2015, were using only half of their quantified rights. Increased water use by tribes and unresolved water rights claims may lead to heightened competition for basin water resources. In 2014, Reclamation initiated the 10 Tribes Study with 10 tribes on the Colorado River, estimating they could have reserved water rights to divert nearly 2.8 MAF per year. Approximately 2 MAF per year were decreed, with 785,273 AF unresolved. The tribes are currently using almost 1.5 MAF of their water rights. The majority of unresolved claims in the Upper Basin are associated with the Ute Tribe in Utah. The unresolved claims in the Upper Basin are mainly linked to the Ute Tribe in Utah, the Navajo Nation in Utah, and the Navajo Nation in Arizona. The Colorado River Compact assumed average annual flows of 16.4 MAF, but actual flows have averaged 14.8 MAF annually. Flows have decreased, while consumptive use has increased, leading to a significant drawdown of basin storage. The significant drawdown of basin storage levels is mainly due to the increased consumptive water use in the Lower Basin, which exceeds the mandatory releases from the Upper Basin. The structural deficit in the basin, exacerbated by the current drought, has caused additional stress on basin storage. The 19-year period from 2000 to 2018 saw some of the lowest flows on record in the Colorado River. Warmer temperatures have contributed to diminished flows, leading to concerns that future water supply risk is high. A 2012 study projected a long-term imbalance in supply and demand in the basin, noting that significant storage has helped mitigate impacts so far. In the coming decades, flows in the Colorado River are projected to decrease by 9% at Lee Ferry, with increased drought frequency. Demand for basin water supplies is expected to rise, reaching 18.1-20.4 MAF by 2050. Ways to address future shortages include alternative water supplies, demand management, and water banking. Some states are already storing unused Colorado River water. The Colorado River faces concerns about potential water supply impacts due to drought conditions. Uncertainties exist regarding potential shortages in the Lower Basin and compact calls on Upper Basin states. Efforts have been made to stabilize storage levels and ensure water supplies amidst water rights priorities and tribal claims. Prominent developments since 2000 aim to relieve pressure on basin water supplies. Since 2000, California reduced its Colorado River water use to 4.4 MAF under the QSA agreement, involving water contractors, conservation efforts, and agriculture-to-urban transfers. The QSA also addressed restoration and mitigation for the Salton Sea in Southern California. The Inadvertent Overrun and Payback Policy (IOPP) was implemented in 2004 as part of an agreement related to the Colorado River water use in Southern California. The policy requires water users in the Lower Basin to account for any overruns in consumptive use and make paybacks through extraordinary conservation measures. The 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act (AWSA) changed the allocation of CAP water in Arizona and led to discussions about water cutbacks in the state. The 2004 Arizona Water Settlements Act ratified three water rights settlements between the federal government, the State of Arizona, the Gila River Indian Community, and the Tohono O'odham Nation. It reduced the CAP water users' repayment obligation from $2.3 billion to $1.65 billion and allocated half of CAP's annual allotment to Indian tribes in Arizona. The act also authorized funds for infrastructure to deliver water to the tribal communities. The 2007 Colorado River Interim Guidelines were adopted to address drought and water shortages in the Southwest. The guidelines included criteria for releases from Lakes Mead and Powell based on trigger levels and curtailments for Lower Basin states at different operational tiers. Arizona and Nevada, with junior water rights, were affected by the guidelines. The 2007 Guidelines aimed to address drought and water shortages in the Southwest, impacting Arizona and Nevada with junior water rights. If Lake Mead levels fell below 1,075 ft, allocations for these states would decrease. The guidelines were set to expire in 2026 and introduced the Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) mechanism for storing conserved water in Lake Mead. ICS storage varied from 711,864 AF in 2015 to 1.261 MAF in 2017. In 2014, Reclamation and major basin water supply agencies funded voluntary conservation projects to develop new system water for storage in Lake Mead by 2019. Federal participation was authorized in 2015 and extended through FY2022 in 2019. Upper Basin agreements were restricted without further authorization. In mid-2018, Reclamation estimated that 194,000 AF of system water was conserved through various projects in the Upper and Lower Basin. In 2017, the US and Mexico signed Minute 323, replacing Minute 319, with provisions for water reserves and ecological support in the Colorado River Delta. The 2019 Drought Contingency Plans were established under Minute 319 and included additional cutbacks triggered by approved DCPs. After negotiations, Reclamation and the Colorado River Basin states finalized DCPs for both Upper and Lower Basins, requiring final authorization from Congress. Congress authorized the DCP agreements in the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan Authorization Act (P.L. 116-14) on April 16, 2019. The Upper Basin DCP aims to protect Lake Powell from reaching critically low elevations by storing conserved water and potentially implementing a Demand Management Program in the future. States agree to keep Lake Powell's surface above 3,525 ft to maintain hydroelectric operations, with other reservoirs adjusting storage levels to support this target. An Upper Basin DCP Demand Management Program would involve temporary paid reductions in water use to increase storage in Lake Powell, reducing the risk of low elevation impacting hydropower generation. The Lower Basin DCP requires Arizona, California, and Nevada to curtail water use to contribute to Lake Mead storage at specific elevations, while also encouraging voluntary conservation to raise lake levels. The Lower Basin DCP includes commitments for delivery cutbacks by California, starting at 200,000 AF (4.5%) in reductions at Lake Mead elevations of 1,040-1,045 ft, increasing to 350,000 AF (7.9%) at elevations of 1,025 ft or lower. These reductions are in addition to previous agreements and efforts to add 100,000 AF or more of system water within the basin. The Lower Basin DCP aims to add 100,000 AF or more of system water within the basin, with significant reductions in Arizona. The DCP decreases the chance of Lake Mead falling below 1,020 ft and reduces Lower Basin consumptive use by 241,000 AF to 1.375 MAF per year under shortage scenarios. Some Colorado River contractors supported the DCPs, but the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) did not approve due to concerns about the impact on the Salton Sea. IID filed a lawsuit alleging violations of environmental laws, raising questions about federal implementation without a new Environmental Impact Statement. The principal role of Congress in relation to storage facilities on the Colorado River is funding and oversight of operations, construction, and programs to protect endangered species. Congressional appropriations typically contribute to project budgets for facilities in both the Upper and Lower Basins. In FY2017, the Lower Colorado Region's operating budget was $517 million, with $119.8 million from discretionary appropriations. The rest came from power revenues and nonfederal partners. Congress has also allocated funds for the Colorado River Basin, including the Pilot System Conservation Plan. The Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund may see a decrease in revenues, affecting future funding availability. Congress may face funding decisions for Indian water rights settlements on the Colorado River, including infrastructure development and new settlements. For example, H.R. 244 in the 116th Congress would authorize the Navajo Nation Water Settlement in Utah. Additionally, states may seek tribal rights to more Colorado River water. In the 115th Congress, America's Water Infrastructure Act authorized Wyoming to fund a project to add erosion control to Fontenelle Reservoir, potentially allowing for an additional 80,000 acre-feet of water storage on the Green River. Congress may be interested in the success or failure of the DCPs in preventing further Colorado River cutbacks and their compliance with federal environmental laws. Congress may be interested in the hydrologic status of the Colorado River Basin and future efforts to plan for increased demand and limited water supplies in the basin."
