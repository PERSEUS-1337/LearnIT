    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Immigrants to New Americans Act\". Congress finds that in 1997, there were 25.8 million foreign-born individuals in the US, the largest number in history. This represents a 30% increase from the 1990 census. The Bureau of the Census predicts that recent immigrants will contribute to 75% of US population growth in the next 50 years. Immigrants from various nationalities have found the American dream of \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" a reality. The diverse cultural heritage of immigrants in the United States has positively influenced the nation's image and relationship with other countries. Understanding immigrant communities is crucial for better integration and education, especially in areas with large immigrant populations. The increasing number of immigrant families settling in high-poverty areas across the United States is creating a national dilemma. There is a lack of teachers with the necessary skills to support these families in successfully participating in schools and communities. Inadequate funding for programs further exacerbates the challenges faced by immigrant students and their families. Local employers value immigrant labor and understand the benefits of helping immigrants integrate into the community. Immigrant families provide businesses with a committed workforce and open up new market opportunities. However, many communities need assistance to support immigrant students and their families in schools and communities in the United States. The Act aims to establish a grant program to fund partnerships between local educational agencies and community-based organizations. These partnerships will develop model programs to support immigrant students and their families in successfully participating in schools and communities in the United States. The Secretary of Education may award grants to partnerships for model programs to assist immigrant students in achieving success in schools by offering educational services and supporting parents with education and social services. Eligible partnerships must include specific components to qualify for the grant. Partnerships awarded grants under this Act must include a local educational agency and a community-based organization, with the option to include other entities like higher education institutions or government agencies. Grants are awarded for a maximum of 5 years, with funds available for up to 1 year for planning and program design. SEC. 6. APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS. Each eligible partnership must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, including documentation of qualified personnel and leadership involvement. The application should also list partnering organizations and describe the need for the proposed program. The application for a grant under this Act must include a description of the need for the proposed program, including data on immigrant students with limited English proficiency, their native languages, English and native language proficiency, achievement data in reading, language arts, and mathematics, as well as their previous schooling experiences. The grant application must include a description of the program goals, how funds will be used to supplement services for immigrant students, activities planned by the partnership, involvement of parents and community members, methods for improving academic achievement, and teacher training. The grant application must include a description of program goals, teacher training methods, parent education, coordination of community services, evaluation of partnership progress, and dissemination of information on model programs and materials. The grant application must include disseminating information on model programs and materials developed under the Act for use by other educational agencies, providing required information to the Secretary annually, and any additional information requested by the Secretary. SEC. 7. SELECTION OF GRANTEES. The Secretary will select partnerships for grants based on program quality, addressing language and cultural differences, activities proposed, parental and community involvement, coordination of social services, success measurement plan, and likelihood of achieving program goals. The Secretary will approve applications under this Act to ensure programs serve different areas of the Nation, including urban, suburban, and rural areas, with special attention to immigrant groups and areas with limited experience in serving the immigrant community. SEC. 8. EVALUATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. Each partnership receiving a grant under this Act must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the program's impact on students, teachers, administrators, parents, and others. They are required to submit a report to the Secretary with data on their progress in achieving program goals and student performance standards. This includes comparing students served under this Act with others in terms of grade retention. The curr_chunk describes the requirements for reporting on a program's impact, including data on academic achievement in reading, language arts, and mathematics, coordination with school programs, access to social services for families, and any other information requested by the Secretary. The partnership receiving a grant under this Act can use up to 5 percent of the funds for administrative purposes. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for the following 4 years."
