    "content": "The \"Consumer Access Rights Defense Act (CARD) of 2005\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Definitions are provided in Section 2. In this Act, definitions include the term \"agency\" as defined in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \"breach of security of the system\" which refers to unauthorized acquisition of personal information, excluding good faith acquisition by an employee for business purposes. The term \"person\" is defined as in section 551(2) of title 5, United States Code. \"Personal information\" includes an individual's last name combined with sensitive data like Social Security number or account numbers. \"Substitute notice\" is defined as a notification method in case of unauthorized disclosure. Substitute notice refers to posting a notice on the agency's website and notifying major media outlets in metropolitan and rural areas where affected individuals reside. The media notice includes a toll-free number for individuals to check if their personal data was compromised in a security breach. SEC. 3. DATABASE SECURITY. SEC. 3. DATABASE SECURITY. Any agency or person engaged in interstate commerce that owns, licenses, or collects data containing personal information must notify individuals if a breach of security is discovered. If the data is not owned or licensed by the agency, they must notify the owner or licensee. Any agency or person must notify individuals if personal information is acquired by an unauthorized person through a breach of security. Notifications should be made promptly after discovering the breach, determining its scope, and taking necessary measures to prevent further disclosures. If a law enforcement agency determines that notifying individuals about a security breach would hinder a criminal investigation, they can delay the notification until it no longer poses a serious impediment. The burden of proof lies with the agency or person responsible for notifying individuals, who must demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence justifying any delays. If a criminal investigation could be impeded, notification of a breach may be delayed at the request of law enforcement. An agency can be exempt from notification if it could harm national security or hinder law enforcement investigations. The agency head must certify in writing for this exemption. An agency cannot use certification to hide violations of law, inefficiency, or competition restraint. The certification must be accompanied by a factual basis and provided to Congress. Notification can be in written form for compliance with the subsection. Notification can be in written form, e-mail if consented, or substitute notice if cost exceeds $500,000, individuals exceed 500,000, or contact information is insufficient. Notification methods include written form, email with consent, or substitute notice for high costs or insufficient contact information. Regardless of the method, notification must include a description of the information acquired, a toll-free number for contact, and information on the types of data compromised. The notification methods for data breaches include written form, email with consent, or substitute notice. The notification must include a description of the compromised information, a toll-free contact number, and details on the types of data affected. Additionally, if more than 1,000 individuals need to be notified, consumer reporting agencies must also be informed promptly. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires agencies to compile and maintain consumer files nationwide. Violations may result in civil penalties up to $1,000 per individual affected or $50,000 per day. Violators may also face injunctions from further violations. The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows for civil penalties for violations, with fines up to $1,000 per individual affected or $50,000 per day. Violators may also face injunctions from further violations. The Federal Trade Commission or other regulators can enforce compliance with the Act, including assessing fines. Additionally, individuals injured by violations can seek damages through civil action. If a consumer's personal financial information is compromised and they submit an identity theft report, civil penalties and fines can be imposed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. State attorneys general can bring civil actions in federal or other courts to enjoin prohibited practices, enforce compliance, obtain damages, or seek other appropriate relief on behalf of residents. Before filing an action, the State attorney general must provide written notice and a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States. An exemption applies if it is not feasible to provide the notice before filing the action. The State attorney general must notify and provide a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States before filing an action. The attorney general of a State has the authority to conduct investigations, administer oaths, and compel witnesses or evidence. Any civil action brought under this Act does not prevent the State attorney general from exercising their powers conferred by state laws. In actions under subsection (a), venue can be in a district court meeting venue requirements or another court of competent jurisdiction. Process serving can occur in any district where the defendant is an inhabitant or can be found. The provisions of this Act will override any conflicting state or local laws. The Act will come into effect six months after its enactment."
