    "content": "Influenza A/H5N1 is a strain of avian flu that can affect poultry. Human cases were first reported in 1997 in Hong Kong, with a fatality rate of over 50% since 2003. The World Health Organization monitors the annual change in human fatality rates, with the highest rates in 2004 and 2006. There is debate about the potential for a global pandemic. The World Health Organization is monitoring the global H5N1 outbreak, currently in pandemic alert phase three. There are predictions of a potential influenza pandemic if the virus becomes transmissible among humans. Despite skepticism, WHO warns that the virus is still spreading and governments should continue to prepare for a pandemic. H5N1 has infected birds in over 50 countries and has caused 261 human cases, with 157 fatalities. H5N1 has spread to over 50 countries, infecting 261 people with 157 deaths. More than 200 million birds in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa have died or been culled due to H5N1. The virus has been detected in poultry in various countries since 2003, with human cases reported outside of Asia in 2006. There is debate over the primary source of transmission, with some experts pointing to wild migratory birds as the main vectors. The spread of H5N1 has been correlated with seasonal migrations of wild species in some countries. Detecting H5N1 in wild birds can be challenging as some infected birds show no symptoms. Other modes of transmission like cross-border trade of infected poultry and poor agricultural practices should not be underestimated. Detection of H5N1 on commercial farms, far from migratory bird habitats, and in regions without wild fowl die-offs support these assertions. Some epidemiologists suggest monitoring limited human-to-human transmission of H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses. WHO states that the virus has not spread beyond close contacts and does not pose a pandemic risk. P.L. 109-13 provided funding for global avian flu efforts. In FY2005, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) received $25 million for global avian flu efforts, with $15 million transferred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An additional $6.3 million was transferred from the Department of State (DOS) for international avian influenza activities. In FY2006, $31.3 million was provided for global avian flu efforts, and a $7.1 billion emergency supplemental request was submitted for avian and pandemic influenza preparedness. Congress allocated $6.1 billion for these efforts in two supplemental appropriations. Supplemental Appropriations. U.S. agencies and departments may provide additional resources for global avian flu efforts, including infectious diseases and influenza programs, global surveillance, and research initiatives. In FY2007, some appropriations bills included extra funds for avian and pandemic influenza preparedness, but Congress did not pass them. Instead, P.L. 109-289 was amended to provide funding until February 15, 2007. The President released the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza on November 1, 2005, to guide future U.S. planning efforts aligned with national security and homeland security strategies. The President requested $7.1 billion to fund the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, with $6.7 billion allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS released its Influenza Plan the following day, outlining its implementation of the National Strategy. Some critics were disappointed by the limited funds allocated for international efforts, arguing for more resources to contain the virus abroad to enhance domestic pandemic preparedness. The President requested $7.1 billion for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, with allocations for international activities including HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS for various initiatives such as pandemic preparedness planning, research, surveillance, and public diplomacy. The White House released the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza in May 2006, outlining how U.S. agencies would integrate over 300 actions to respond to an influenza pandemic. Funding was allocated for public diplomacy, training, international outreach, professional exchanges, behavior change efforts, diagnostic support initiatives, and pre-positioning supplies and equipment for pandemic preparedness. The Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, released in May 2006, integrated over 300 actions to respond to an influenza pandemic threat. 92% of the actions have been completed, with the United States investing $434 million in international efforts. The Department of State (DOS) coordinates the U.S. international response to H5N1, providing information to American citizens abroad and ensuring federal assistance reflects priority activities. The Department of State (DOS) coordinates U.S. international response to bioterrorism and health security, infectious diseases, and post-conflict health. President Bush announced the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IPAPI) at the United Nations in 2005 to enhance public health through diplomatic initiatives. IPAPI collaborates with regional organizations like ASEAN and APEC to address avian influenza and pandemic threats. The International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IPAPI) aims to address avian influenza and pandemic threats by extending preparedness efforts to the national level, coordinating donor and affected nations, mobilizing resources, increasing transparency in disease reporting, and building capacity to respond to pandemics. The President proposed $38.5 million for DOS in FY2006 for international response coordination, diplomatic outreach, medical personnel exchanges, and protecting government employees overseas from influenza. Congress did not appropriate funds to DOS. In FY2006, the Department of State (DOS) spent $6 million on diplomatic support and international response coordination for avian flu, despite Congress not appropriating funds for these efforts. USAID collaborates with various partners to enhance global avian and influenza pandemic preparedness, connecting human and animal health sectors. With guidance from HHS and USDA, USAID works closely with WHO and FAO to prepare for and respond to potential influenza outbreaks. USAID collaborates with NGOs and the private sector to improve outbreak detection capacities and support behavior change efforts for influenza outbreaks. Key activities include planning and preparedness initiatives, surveillance and case detection activities, communications projects for mass media and community outreach, and commodity stockpiling programs. Since January 2006, USAID has provided 1.5 million PPE kits, 100 laboratory kits, and 15,000 decontamination kits for detecting and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. Over 200,000 PPE kits have been distributed to 71 countries, with pre-positioning in 20 countries for avian influenza outbreaks. Emergency response programs promote safe culling and disposal procedures, improved biosecurity practices, and standard health facility procedures. P.L. 109-72 allocated $16.3 million for global avian flu efforts. In FY2006, USAID received $16.3 million for global avian flu efforts, with additional funding of $131.5 million and $30 million from supplemental appropriations. OMB estimates a total commitment of $191 million for bilateral avian and pandemic influenza efforts in FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration requested $55 million for FY2007. The Senate proposed $25 million for USAID's global avian flu efforts, while the House did not specify funding. HHS leads U.S. influenza surveillance and detection efforts abroad. HHS and its related agencies lead U.S. influenza surveillance efforts abroad, collaborating with WHO and other partners on global avian and pandemic influenza preparedness. Activities include training foreign health professionals, guiding public health authorities in infection control measures, and supporting international stockpiling of countermeasures against possible pandemics. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and CDC within HHS fund international research grants related to avian and pandemic influenza. Research activities include developing vaccines and drugs, expanding clinical trials infrastructure in southeast Asia, and conducting human-animal interface studies. CDC officials provide technical assistance in improving governments' capacity to detect infectious disease outbreaks and plan for a possible influenza pandemic. In FY2005 and FY2006, HHS allocated funding for international avian and pandemic preparedness, including initiatives for disease surveillance, laboratory diagnostics, and rapid response. CDC received $365 million from three appropriations for these efforts. The Administration allocated $208 million for international avian and pandemic preparedness in FY2005 and FY2006. In FY2007, $145 million was requested for global pandemic influenza and preparedness initiatives. S. 3708 proposed $40 million for surveillance, diagnosis, and epidemic investigations. Additionally, $130 million was suggested for expanding laboratory capacity and research for detecting pathogens. The House did not specify an amount for global avian flu efforts, but funds were allocated for domestic avian flu and pandemic preparedness. The USDA collaborates with international organizations for animal health research and risk analyses. They have developed a real-time diagnostic protocol for H5N1 in animals and assist countries in adopting it for surveillance. Other activities include promoting compliance with international standards, conducting research, and analyzing economic impacts of influenza outbreaks among animals. The USDA collaborates with international organizations for animal health research and risk analyses, including developing a real-time diagnostic protocol for H5N1 in animals. Funding has been allocated for global avian flu efforts, with $19.5 million committed to international programs in FY2006 and additional budget requests in subsequent years. In June 1996, President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-7 to address emerging infectious diseases. The Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DOD-GEIS) was developed in response to this directive to enhance national security by early disease recognition and control. DOD-GEIS aims to prevent, surveil, and respond to infectious diseases threatening military personnel, families, and national security. The DOD-GEIS network partners with Navy and Army laboratories, as well as WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), to collect avian influenza isolates worldwide for analysis and vaccine development. Key activities include sharing infectious disease surveillance reports, developing emergency response plans, and monitoring influenza among military populations. The DOD-GEIS network partners with Navy and Army laboratories, as well as WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), to collect avian influenza isolates worldwide for analysis and vaccine development. Plans include monitoring influenza among military populations, training healthcare workers in rapid detection and management of influenza illnesses, implementing cooperative surveillance activities in Asia, the Middle East, and the Central Asian Republics, and evaluating emergency response plans. Emergency supplemental funds provided $130 million for avian flu activities, with $120 million for the Defense Health Program and $10 million for Operation and Maintenance. The DHS collaborates with other U.S. agencies like DOS, DOT, and HHS for global avian and pandemic preparedness efforts. They work on sharing information on travelers exposed to pandemic influenza and limiting their entry into the United States. DOT also conducts outreach with stakeholders and provides emergency management for civil transportation resources. The Department of Commerce (DOC) plays a key role in international transportation planning and emergency activities related to avian influenza. They facilitate the expedited review of export licenses for items like test kits and equipment for avian influenza. In 2005, a global action plan was developed in Geneva to control avian influenza in animals and prevent a human pandemic. Participants at a conference discussed the need for resources to support countries affected by avian influenza and to enhance global capacity to respond to a potential human pandemic. The World Bank estimated that $1 billion would be needed over the next three years to address these needs. A donor's conference was held in Beijing in 2006 to gather support for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts. At a donor's conference in Beijing, representatives from 100 countries and 20 organizations pledged $1.9 billion for avian flu assistance. Top donors included the World Bank, the United States, Japan, EU Member States, and the European Commission. A follow-up conference in Vienna addressed increased financial needs due to the spread of the virus to Europe and Africa. The ALive Platform estimated the resources needed for African countries facing H5N1 cases. At a conference in Bamako, Mali, donors pledged an additional $475 million to fight H5N1 avian flu, with the United States increasing its pledge to $434 million. The international community met to assess progress in controlling the virus, with concerns about its spread in southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The ALive Platform estimated African countries needed an extra $700 million for H5N1 cases. As of October 31, 2006, donors had committed $1.4 billion of the $1.9 billion pledged for global avian flu activities. Funds were mainly directed towards country programs, with 36% allocated for bilateral efforts. Multilateral banks provided nearly half of the funds for bilateral programs in the form of loans, while donor governments typically gave grants. Around 17% of funds were targeted at international organizations like WHO, FAO, OIE, and UNICEF, and 14% to regional organizations such as ASEAN, IBAR, and SAARC. The World Bank estimated that countries would need between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion for H5N1 support, with Africa requiring the most due to poor health services. 18% of bilateral assistance commitments were for Africa, with a loan to Nigeria comprising over half of the total commitments. The World Bank manages international pledges for country preparedness plans. The World Bank is providing $500 million in low-interest loans to countries heavily affected by H5N1 to strengthen veterinary systems and assist in culling and animal vaccination programs. The funds are managed through the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) and the Avian and Human Influenza Facility (AHIF), with nearly half already committed. International donors have contributed to these efforts. The AHIF funds, totaling $75 million from international donors, are flexible and managed by OIE, FAO, and WHO to coordinate the global response to H5N1. OIE sets guidelines for animal disease control worldwide, with standards recognized under the WTO's SPS Agreement to ensure food safety and animal health. OIE, designated as the international reference for animal diseases and zoonoses, is evaluating veterinary services in 15 pilot countries to comply with international standards. Countries use feedback from evaluations to make reforms and prepare for international funding. The World Bank considers these evaluations when setting funding levels for countries improving their animal health infrastructure. OIE aims to evaluate 105 countries over three years. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Dr. David Nabarro as the Senior U.N. System Coordinator for Human and Avian influenza in September 2005. Dr. Nabarro, as the Senior U.N. System Coordinator for Human and Avian influenza, is responsible for coordinating avian influenza containment efforts among various U.N. agencies. FAO, OIE, and WHO have developed early warning and response systems to collect and analyze information on outbreaks. OIE reports on animal cases, while WHO reports on human cases. In July 2006, these organizations launched a joint effort to address global avian influenza and pandemic preparedness. In October 2006, OIE and FAO launched a Crisis Management Center with health experts ready to respond to disease outbreaks. The United States provided funding and veterinarians to support the center. FAO coordinates global surveillance and response to H5N1 among livestock, providing technical assistance, training, and equipment. At a donor conference in Beijing, FAO presented a plan developed with OIE to control and eradicate H5N1 in animals. FAO and OIE presented a plan at a Beijing conference to control and eradicate H5N1 in animals. The program included coordinating the global response, supporting countries with H5N1 cases, and assisting countries without cases to develop preparedness plans. The budget for the three-year cycle was $476 million, with FAO estimating needing $130 million. As H5N1 spread, the plan was revised to expand assistance to Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, requiring $882 million, with FAO needing $308 million. FAO has received pledges of $94.4 million from donors, with the United States being the largest contributor. They have a flexible spending account called SFERA for emergency and rehabilitation activities, with $24.9 million committed so far. The United States is not a contributor to this account. WHO is responsible for coordinating the global response to human cases of H5N1. The World Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for coordinating the global response to human cases of H5N1 and monitoring the spread of the virus among humans. The organization also provides guidelines and recommendations for addressing infectious disease outbreaks, including H5N1. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were revised in 2005 to address global disease spread and require Member States to share information about infectious disease outbreaks. The revised International Health Regulations (IHR) require Member States to strengthen surveillance and response capacities, report public health events to WHO, and allow WHO to evaluate and provide support for building capacity. Despite lacking an enforcement mechanism, all WHO Member States are obligated to follow the revised IHR. WHO and several countries, including the United States, have begun implementing the revised IHR by establishing the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to manage critical outbreak information. In August 2005, WHO estimated needing 3 million doses of antiviral treatments to prevent a global pandemic. Roche handed over 3 million Tamiflu courses to WHO in April 2006, with half stored in Switzerland and the rest in the United States. An additional two million courses were donated to WHO for treating people in developing countries. According to WHO, significant progress has been made in implementing the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan. Key accomplishments include distributing PPE, providing biopacking for international shipment of supplies, conducting assessment missions in 30 countries, and strengthening the early warning system. The WHO has made significant progress in implementing the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan by distributing PPE, conducting assessment missions in 30 countries, and strengthening the early warning system. They have also developed guidelines for collecting and shipping specimens for H5N1 diagnosis, supported field epidemiology in southeast Asia, improved surveillance systems in several countries, aided in diagnosing H5N1, and built capacity to cope with a pandemic by working with governments to strengthen national preparedness plans. During a meeting with technical experts and potential pharmaceutical manufacturers, recommendations were developed for managing patients with H5N1 infection and coordinating global scientific research. Efforts were made to develop and increase pandemic influenza vaccines, provide new recombinant H5N1 prototype vaccine strains, and publish a bibliography of research on avian influenza. Representative Kolbe suggested that more funding should be allocated to global influenza pandemic preparedness, citing the insufficiency of the $55 million requested by USAID for FY2007 global avian flu initiatives. Representative Kolbe questioned the small allocation of funds to Africa in the FY2007 budget for global avian flu activities. Congress did not enact specific appropriations for avian flu, instead extending funding levels from previous years. Supporters urge Congress to increase funding for international efforts and pass legislation similar to bills in the previous Congress. Intellectual property rights have become a contentious issue in global health. Some drug manufacturers in developing countries argue that patented antivirals like Tamiflu are too expensive for poor nations. In response, an Indian company threatened to produce a generic version at a lower cost for developing nations. Roche has granted sublicenses to manufacturers in various countries. Concerns exist that the US may not export antivirals during a pandemic, prompting calls for Congress to support developing countries in acquiring antivirals. Some experts argue that exporting generic antivirals to countries unable to afford them could help contain the spread of H5N1. Concerns also exist about limited vaccine research and manufacturing capacity globally, especially in countries most affected by the virus. Some health experts advocate for increased funding for global vaccine research and development capacity to ensure sufficient quantities of vaccines during a pandemic. They also suggest greater U.S. investment in strengthening foreign health systems to improve global cooperation and containment efforts. Key sectors critical for identifying and containing the spread of H5N1, such as disease surveillance and veterinary services, are ill-equipped in many countries. Concerns exist that a pandemic could progress undetected in endemic countries due to slow surveillance systems. Health experts advocate for legislation to strengthen health systems and veterinary services in developing countries. Mass culling of infected poultry is a common containment measure. The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about farmers in poorer countries not culling their poultry due to dependence on poultry farming. Scientists suggest alternative containment strategies like cleaning days and separating ducks and chickens in live poultry markets to reduce viral transmission. Some advocate for a global fund to support farmer compensation efforts. Legislation similar to bills introduced in previous Congress sessions is encouraged. The World Bank released a report on the economic impacts of avian and pandemic influenza at the Bamako Conference. The World Bank released a report predicting economic impacts of a global influenza pandemic. A mild pandemic could cause less than 1% decline in global output, while a severe pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu could cut global GDP by almost 5%. Developing countries would be hardest hit, with sectors like hospitality and tourism severely affected. The SARS outbreak significantly impacted the Canadian and Asian hospitality and tourism sectors, costing the Asia-Pacific region $40 billion in 2002 and 2003. Flights to the region decreased by 45%, affecting the airline and hotel industries. Canada lost $1.2 billion, with $763 million spent on healthcare. Analysts warn of potential economic fluctuations from key Asian markets on the U.S. economy. Legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress to establish a National Pandemic Influenza Economic Advisory Committee to analyze the economic impacts of a pandemic scenario. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to increase resources for global avian flu efforts, including funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and USAID. Proposed amounts ranged from $4.5 million to $40 million for surveillance, diagnosis, and pandemic preparedness. The 109th Congress introduced bills to increase resources for global avian flu efforts, with proposed amounts ranging from $4.5 million to $40 million for surveillance, diagnosis, and pandemic preparedness. Additionally, bills like H.R. 4062 and S. 1821 proposed a \"Pandemic Fund\" to support ongoing U.S. and international avian flu and pandemic preparedness initiatives, while H.R. 4476 and S. 1912 aimed to increase support for preventing the spread of H5N1 among animals. H.R. 3369 and S. 969 would have provided funds to strengthen surveillance capacity in affected countries. The 109th Congress introduced bills to increase resources for global avian flu efforts, with proposed amounts ranging from $4.5 million to $40 million for surveillance, diagnosis, and pandemic preparedness. H.R. 4245, Influenza Preparedness and Prevention Act, S. 2170, Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2005, and H.R. 4603, Pandemic and Seasonal Influenza Act of 2005, aimed to strengthen surveillance capacity in affected countries by increasing public health sites, providing funding for a real-time international threat detection system, and establishing a global network for avian influenza surveillance. H.R. 4392 aimed to allow the export of generic antivirals to non-producing countries under a compulsory license from the World Trade Organization."
