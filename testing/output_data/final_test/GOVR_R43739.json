Securities regulators and state officials have raised policy concerns about these new trading platforms. Dark pools are a type of alternative trading system that do not publicly display traders' buy and sell interests, reducing the riskiness of trades. Securities regulators and state officials, along with Members of Congress, have raised concerns about the impact of dark pools on market quality, lack of pre-trade transparency, and their allowance of high-frequency trading. This report explains what dark pools are, recent developments, and current public policy concerns surrounding them. Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) emerged in the late 1960s and gained popularity in the mid-1990s due to technological advancements. The SEC's adoption of Regulation ATS in 1998 aimed to promote competition and innovation in the market. ECNs publicly display best orders and allow access to stock trade offers. They have been perceived to benefit the equity market with faster trading technologies, innovative pricing strategies, and strong inter-market linkages. INET and Archipelago are well-known independent ECNs, while others like BATS and Direct Edge have merged with registered securities exchanges. Other ECNs, such as BATS and Direct Edge, have merged with exchanges or become exchanges themselves, collectively gaining market share. ATSs, including ECNs, have pressured legacy exchanges like NYSE to improve customer trading experience. Dark pools, a type of ATS, do not provide pre-trade quotes like NASDAQ, stock exchanges, and ECNs, only publishing trade data after transactions. Some argue post-trade disclosure is more informative. Dark pools do not guarantee trade execution, orders may go unfilled. Dark pools do not guarantee trade execution, orders may go unfilled. Traders in dark pools may only become aware of potential trading counterparties after submitting orders. Indications of interest in dark pools are similar to conventional quotes but with less trading interest displayed. Pre-trade opacity initially attracted institutional investors seeking anonymous block trading. Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS) in 2005 boosted the growth of dark pools, which now account for 15% of trading volume in NASDAQ- and NYSE-listed stocks. Dark pools, along with internalization processes, make up the majority of off-exchange trading in today's fragmented equities market. Dark pools and internalization processes dominate off-exchange trading, with dark pools accounting for 40% and internalization for 60% of dark trades. Brokers charge fees for access to dark pools, enabling practices like indirect internalization. High-frequency trading firms in dark pools have been known to front-run retail order flow to profit from anticipated price movements. Dark pools, such as Credit Suisse's CrossFinder and Goldman Sachs's Sigma X, are used by large broker-dealers for price discovery. Broker-dealers like Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley dominate the dark pool business. Front-running in dark pools can lead to a small increase in stock prices, with legality depending on the circumstances. Dark pools, like those owned by Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley, act as agents for trades based on security prices from exchanges. Examples include Liquidnet, ITG Posit, BATS, and NYSE dark pools. Independent operators like Getco and Knight also run dark pools, but they do not contribute to price discovery. The popularity of dark pools has grown due to a mix of non-regulatory and regulatory factors. The popularity of dark pools has increased, with factors such as market volatility and the preference for displayed-market price discovery playing key roles. Traders tend to favor exchanges like NASDAQ and NYSE during periods of high price volatility for more reliable trade execution. The demand for dark pool trading has increased due to factors like share price volatility, avoiding technological mishaps on major exchanges, lower trading fees, and trader autonomy. Dark pools offer traders more autonomy in choosing buyers and sellers, potentially avoiding problematic traders. They are valuable for executing large orders and trading stocks with wider bid-ask spreads or lower liquidity. SEC regulations like Reg ATS and Reg NMS have played a pivotal role in the growth of dark pools. Dark pools, regulated under Reg ATS, must register with the SEC or FINRA. They follow similar rules as exchanges or broker-dealers but are not required to publicize quotes. Reg NMS, implemented in 2005, aimed to enhance domestic exchanges by improving price execution and investor access to market data. Reg NMS, implemented in 2005, aimed to improve price execution, quotes, and investor access to market data through key rules like the order protection rule, access rule, and market data rule. It has been criticized for contributing to a fragmented trading marketplace with multiple exchanges and dark pools, allowing high-frequency trading firms to exploit the market's fragmentation. The abolishment of a rule protecting manually submitted quotes helped expand electronic trading venues like dark pools. Regulatory concerns about dark pools were highlighted in a 2010 IOSCO report due to market fragmentation, with Reg NMS often cited as a contributing factor. Dark pools contribute to market fragmentation, which can lead to challenges for traders such as increased costs and logistical burdens. Fragmentation also allows brokers to prioritize their own needs over those of their customers when routing orders. Despite these concerns, competition between trading venues has reduced transaction costs and spurred technological innovations. Reg ATS mandates fair access to exchange services. Dark pools may not meet fair access requirements for stocks exceeding a 5% trading volume threshold, leading to concerns about discriminatory practices. There are worries about selective offering of terms to traders and potential manipulation of securities prices by HFT firms in dark pools. FINRA is increasing oversight of dark pools, focusing on orders submitted to public exchanges. Regulatory concerns surround dark pools, particularly regarding the potential for improper trading and insider trading. Recent cases have highlighted the use of dark pools for allegedly unlawful trades executed quietly through algorithms and limited viewing access. Dark pools, which account for a significant portion of trades in many stocks, are under scrutiny for their lack of transparency and potential for abuse. Dark pools, which account for a significant portion of trades in many stocks, do not publicly disseminate pre-trade data, raising concerns about stock prices not reflecting the actual market price and impeding price discovery. Orders executed on dark pools offer limited price discovery, potentially undermining overall price discovery. Despite concerns, some argue that off-exchange volume's impact on price discovery is not significant. The market does not show signs of reaching a concerning level, with no upward trend indicating worry. Dark pools have exemptions that allow them to segregate order flow based on information risk, leading to less informed transactions and reduced contribution to price discovery. SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White highlighted that dark trading can detract from overall market quality. The research found that order segmentation by dark venues can harm market quality, except for large block transactions. Foley and Putni\u0146\u0161 studied Canadian dark trading pre and post minimum price improvement rules, categorizing trading into one-sided trading with low execution probability. Two-sided dark trading involves transactions at different prices on both buy and sell sides, offering better concealment of trading intentions. This type of trading benefits market liquidity and can immediately execute orders if there is liquidity on both sides. Researchers highlight the importance of recognizing the varied and distinctive nature of dark pool trading, as it can have different market impacts. The authors found that two-sided dark trading benefits market liquidity, pricing, and informational efficiency. It also lowers bid-ask spreads and reduces price delay. However, one-sided dark pool trading has a negative impact on market quality. Securities regulators have implemented regulatory regimes for dark pools, including a FINRA-based ATS trading data disclosure regime and a pending SEC pilot project for off-exchange venues to provide price improvement. In May 2014, FINRA implemented the \"trade-at\" rule for ATSs, including dark pools, requiring them to report transaction volume and trades by security. In November 2014, ATSs were mandated to use a market participation identifier for reporting. These rules aim to enhance FINRA's surveillance capabilities and regulatory efforts by obtaining detailed information on ATS activity. On June 24, 2014, the SEC ordered a pilot program for lightly traded stocks to trade in five-cent minimum increments. The program includes a control group and two test groups with specific criteria for stock selection. The pilot will last several years and aims to test the impact of different trading rules on market activity. The SEC ordered a pilot program for lightly traded stocks to trade in five-cent minimum increments, expected to last several years. Proponents argue it would increase bid-ask spread for illiquid stocks, benefiting broker profits. Exchange owners support the trade-at rule to gather information on decimalization impact. Brokerage firms and BATS are critical of the rule. The SEC ordered a pilot program for lightly traded stocks to trade in five-cent minimum increments to test the impact of a trade-at requirement on trading volume migration from 'lit venues'. Canada and Australia implemented trade-at rules for off-exchange orders to reduce smaller-sized off-exchange trades in dark pools. Quotes for smaller-sized orders in dark pools must generally offer price improvement over quotes on exchanges. In June 2014, Mary Jo White requested recommendations for expanding operational disclosures from dark pools and other ATSs to the SEC and the public. Regulators are monitoring dark trading volume to prevent it from undermining price discovery on lit venues. Enforcement actions have been taken against dark pool owners for violations of laws or regulations. In 2014, actions were taken against dark pool owners for violating laws and regulations. New York Attorney General filed a civil suit against Barclays, a major dark pool operator, for falsifying marketing material related to high-frequency trading in its dark pool. Observers noted that institutional investors are attracted to dark pools for certain advantages. In 2014, actions were taken against dark pool owners for violating laws and regulations. New York Attorney General filed a civil suit against Barclays for falsifying marketing material related to high-frequency trading in its dark pool. Institutional investors are attracted to dark pools for protection against large orders being front-run by HFT firms. The troubling allegation in the Barclays suit is that the broker lied to clients about the presence of a big HFT firm. The SEC and FINRA are investigating dark pools and their owners for possible securities law violations. The SEC has prosecuted dark pool operators for various violations, such as failing to provide anonymity. White assured Congress of the agency's oversight of dark pools, using a data-driven approach and a new analytical tool called MIDAS. The SEC is investigating dark pool operators for violations related to anonymity and customer misrepresentation. Pipeline Trading Systems was fined $1 million for not disclosing that an affiliate filled most customer orders. The agency is also probing dark pools for proper disclosure, fair treatment of investors, and protection of client information. Barclays dark pool is under SEC investigation. SEC Chair White expressed concerns about dark trading volume potentially undermining price discovery on public exchanges. The SEC is investigating dark pool operators for violations related to anonymity and customer misrepresentation. FINRA is working with the SEC to possibly expand trading disclosures required of dark pools. In 2014, FINRA settled with Goldman Sachs for allegedly failing to ensure clients in its dark pool, SIGMA-X, got the best price while trading stocks. Goldman Sachs paid $800,000 in fines. FINRA is seeking information on dark pools' operations and may take enforcement actions or recommend more oversight based on the responses received."
