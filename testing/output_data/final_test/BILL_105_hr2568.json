TITLE I--ALTERNATIVE FUELS--GENERAL\n\nSEC. 101. DEFINITIONS. Section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include definitions for heavy duty marine vessels and heavy duty motor vehicles, as well as the term marine vessel.

The acquisition of alternative fuel equal to a year's estimated fuel requirements for a dual-fueled vehicle owned by a fleet or covered person will be credited as acquiring 1 alternative fueled vehicle for compliance purposes. The Secretary may request an accounting of the required acquisition of alternative fuel when allowing this credit. The Secretary will amend guidelines to help Federal agencies comply with acquiring alternative fuel for dual-fueled vehicles. SEC. 104. FUEL AND VEHICLE NEUTRALITY.
