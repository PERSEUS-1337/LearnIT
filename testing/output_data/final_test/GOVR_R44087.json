    "content": "A risk and needs assessment instrument measures offenders' criminogenic risk factors and specific needs to reduce future criminal activity. It consists of questions guiding an interview to collect data on behaviors related to recidivism. The instrument generates a total score categorizing offenders as \"low,\" \"moderate,\" or \"high\" risk based on static and dynamic factors like age at first arrest, gender, substance abuse history, and mental health issues. Dynamic risk factors, known as \"criminogenic needs,\" can change and be addressed through interventions. Common risk and needs assessment tools can predict recidivism with moderate accuracy, and no single tool is significantly better than others in predicting violence. Two scholars propose two explanations for why well-validated risk assessment instruments show similar performance levels. One reason is the \"natural limit\" to predicting recidivism accurately due to limited knowledge of criminal behavior causes. Another reason is that these instruments may tap into common risk factors like criminal history, antisocial lifestyle, psychopathic personality, and alcohol/mental health issues. The Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) model is a dominant paradigm in risk and needs assessment, guiding offender treatment by addressing risk, criminogenic needs, and providing treatment. Experts recommend adherence to the RNR model for effective recidivism reduction interventions. The RNR model focuses on assessing risk, addressing criminogenic needs, and providing treatment responsive to the offender's abilities and learning style. It is based on the social psychology of offending, emphasizing individual differences in criminal behavior propensity. The model targets proximate causes of criminal behavior for evidence-based correctional treatment. The RNR model emphasizes predicting criminal behavior, matching intervention to offender risk level, focusing on criminogenic needs in treatment, and delivering programming in a style consistent with the offender's abilities. The RNR model emphasizes cognitive-behavioral and social learning therapies as effective interventions based on the general responsivity principle. The specific responsivity principle highlights the importance of considering offender characteristics in treatment. The \"central eight\" risk and needs factors, including the \"big four\" and \"moderate four,\" are key predictors of criminal behavior. Research on risk and needs factors, particularly the \"central eight,\" shows that past antisocial behavior is correlated with future offending risk. Targeting high-risk offenders with intensive services is most effective in reducing recidivism. However, placing low-risk offenders in intensive programs may increase their likelihood of reoffending due to potential disruption of existing support structures or exposure to negative influences. Research suggests that programs adhering to the RNR principles are effective at reducing recidivism by targeting the \"central eight\" risk and needs factors. Treatment in a community setting is more effective, but adherence to RNR principles can still be effective in custodial settings. The \"big four\" and \"moderate four\" risk factors are significant predictors of future offending. Legislation is being considered to establish a risk and needs assessment system in BOP. Research shows that assessment instruments can classify offenders by risk level effectively. Adherence to RNR principles in offender programming is more effective at reducing recidivism. Implementing an assessment system and offender programming regime that adhere to the RNR principles in federal prisons is an evidence-based way to better match inmates with rehabilitative programming. While there may be some false positives and false negatives in risk assessment systems, the predictive accuracy has improved over the years with more research. Earned time credits for completing programs could help reduce the federal prison population without increasing public safety risks. The accuracy of risk assessment instruments has improved with more research and validation on the population they are used for. The RNR model guides the development of effective rehabilitation programs. Concerns exist about the potential exacerbation of racial disparities in prison systems due to the widespread use of risk and needs assessment. Research has mainly focused on the discriminatory effects on black men. Research by ProPublica on risk classifications generated by COMPAS in Broward County, FL, has raised concerns about racial disparities in risk assessment. Black defendants were twice as likely as white defendants to be assessed as medium- or high-risk for recidivism, despite similar reoffending rates. The company behind COMPAS argues that the instrument is racially neutral, but the contradictory results highlight the limitations of algorithms in risk assessment. Algorithms used in risk assessment cannot achieve both ProPublica's goal of minimizing error rates and Northpointe's aim for predictive parity. Stanford University researchers found that within each risk category, the reoffense rates were similar regardless of race. However, overall, black defendants had a higher recidivism rate than white defendants. Black defendants were more likely to be classified as medium- or high-risk, even if they did not reoffend, highlighting issues with the algorithm's fairness. The study found that black defendants had a higher overall recidivism rate than white defendants, leading to a greater share of black defendants being classified as high risk. This imbalance in risk assessment was highlighted by ProPublica, although another study found no evidence of racial bias in the COMPAS instrument. The study found that black defendants had a higher recidivism rate than white defendants, with COMPAS being a good predictor of rearrest for both races. The researchers criticized ProPublica's interpretation of collapsing medium- and high-risk defendants into one category for comparison. The COMPAS scores are designed to inform the probability of recidivism across different risk categories, similar to how actuaries inform patient prognoses in medicine and risky driving behavior in the auto insurance industry. Concerns exist that inmates of color may be assessed as higher risk, leading to detrimental outcomes like longer incarceration periods. Even if risk assessment tools show no inherent racial biases, the application of these tools can still result in disparities. The application of risk and needs assessment instruments can have disparate racial effects, even if they show no inherent biases. Utilizing actuarial risk assessment is argued to be more objective and less susceptible to bias compared to clinical judgment alone. Before the use of actuarial assessments, decisions were based on professionals' subjective judgments, potentially influenced by biases. Policymakers may want to reduce bias in risk and needs assessment, with the Council of State Governments suggesting three steps to address this issue. The Council of State Governments recommends three steps to reduce bias in assessments: Validate the instrument with a third party, assess its predictive accuracy by race and gender, and ensure proper administration. Address any bias in the instrument by monitoring its use, providing training to assessors, or considering alternative methods. The Council of State Governments recommends validating risk and needs assessment instruments, ensuring proper administration, and addressing bias by monitoring use and providing training to assessors. Policymakers may need to decide on excluding certain inmates from earning time credits for participating in rehabilitative programs. Legislation before Congress aims to validate risk assessment instruments, use research-based methods, prevent disparities, train assessors, and monitor system use in BOP facilities. Legislation before Congress proposes excluding inmates convicted of certain offenses from earning time credits for participating in rehabilitative programs. There is debate over whether inmates convicted of violent or sex offenses should be eligible for early release based on their efforts to reduce recidivism. Policymakers may also need to consider the potential disparate impact on racial or ethnic minorities. The proposed legislation aims to exclude inmates convicted of specific offenses from earning time credits for rehabilitation programs. Policymakers are concerned about the potential impact on racial or ethnic minorities, as data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show disparities in convictions and incarceration based on race/ethnicity. However, the data available only goes up to FY2014, limiting the ability to fully analyze the implications. Legislation before Congress would make most inmates convicted of violent or sex offenses ineligible to receive earned time credits. Data from BJS show that most inmates held in federal prisons at the end of FY2014 were incarcerated for something other than a violent or sex offense. At the end of FY2014, most federal prison inmates were not incarcerated for violent or sex offenses. However, there were significant racial/ethnic disparities among those convicted of such offenses, with Native American inmates having the highest percentage. Legislation proposed would make these inmates ineligible for earned time credits. Native American and Asian/Pacific Islander inmates are disproportionately represented among inmates convicted for violent and sex offenses. Excluding inmates convicted of drug offenses would impact a larger percentage of the federal prison population, as half of all inmates are incarcerated for drug offenses, especially drug trafficking. Some bills before Congress propose making certain drug and fraud offenders ineligible for earned time credits in federal prison. It is unclear if this exclusion would disproportionately affect inmates of color, as data on the race of this subset of offenders is unavailable. Additionally, inmates convicted of certain fraud offenses or sentenced to more than 15 years for a federal fraud offense may also be ineligible for earned time credits under the proposed legislation. Some bills propose excluding inmates convicted of certain offenses from receiving earned time credits in federal prison, including bribery, racketeering, and RICO offenses. Data on the proportion of inmates convicted for these offenses is provided by BJS, but it is unclear if these exclusions would disproportionately affect inmates of color. Policymakers may need to consider focusing on high-risk individuals for rehabilitative programming based on the RNR principles. The risk principle emphasizes placing high-risk offenders in intensive evidence-based programs for reducing recidivism. However, placing low-risk offenders in such programs may increase their likelihood of reoffending due to disruptions in support structures or exposure to negative influences. Legislation is ambiguous on whether high-risk inmates should be the main focus of rehabilitative programming, requiring the Bureau of Prisons to offer programs to all inmates but allowing several years for implementation. The legislation before Congress requires the Department of Justice to use savings from the risk and needs assessment system to expand rehabilitative programming for all inmates. However, there are concerns about whether the savings will be enough to fund the necessary program expansions, as significant savings may only be realized once the prison population decreases enough to close prisons and reduce staff. The BOP may need to prioritize high-risk inmates for intensive treatment to reduce recidivism. Consider releasing low-risk inmates earlier to make room for higher-risk ones if rehabilitative programs cannot expand quickly enough. It may be beneficial to release low-risk inmates earlier to allow for high-quality rehabilitative programming for medium- and high-risk inmates. The National Institute of Corrections could be required to conduct regular evaluations to ensure program fidelity. Legislation in Congress focuses on evaluating recidivism reduction programs for effectiveness. Policymakers should also consider using risk and needs assessments in sentencing to divert low-risk offenders. Assessment in sentencing can help identify low-risk offenders for community supervision instead of incarceration. Legislation aims to house low-risk inmates together and provide options for early release into community supervision. This legislation seeks to reduce the federal prison population. Integrating risk assessment into sentencing guidelines can help identify low-risk offenders for community supervision instead of incarceration, potentially reducing the federal prison population and saving money. However, there is a risk of false negatives, where low-risk offenders may still recidivate if diverted to community supervision. The Obama Administration recognized the importance of evidence-based programs in criminal justice. The DOJ raised concerns about using risk assessment in determining sentences for federal offenders, citing potential disadvantages for certain groups and erosion of sentencing certainty. They argued that this approach would conflict with the Sentencing Reform Act's goal of establishing determinate sentencing guidelines. The DOJ raised concerns about using risk assessment in federal sentencing, arguing that it could conflict with the goal of determinate sentencing guidelines. Legislation before Congress would exempt certain offenders from earning time credits, requiring them to serve more time in prison regardless of their risk level. Recent research suggests that requiring certain offenders to serve most of their sentences in prison may undermine the effectiveness of risk and needs assessment systems. While incarceration helped reduce violent crime rates in the 1990s, there are diminishing returns with higher levels of incarceration. This could be due to including offenders at the end of their criminal careers or those not committing crimes at a high rate. Research suggests that high levels of incarceration may have diminishing returns due to factors such as high replacement levels for certain crimes and the criminogenic effect of prison, especially for low-risk offenders. Immediate delivery of punishment and catching criminals for every offense are crucial for successful deterrence. The effectiveness of punishment in the criminal justice system is hindered by challenges such as lack of certainty in detection, delays in sentencing, and difficulties in supervision. Incarceration may not have a strong deterrent effect but can incapacitate offenders and reduce their ability to commit crimes. Incarceration can reduce crimes committed by offenders and serve as a way for society to show intolerance towards certain behaviors."
