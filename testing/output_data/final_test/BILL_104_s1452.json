    "content": "The Act titled \"Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Act of 1995\" establishes a taxpayer protection lock-box ledger under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The \"Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Act of 1995\" establishes a ledger called the 'Taxpayer Protection Lock-box Ledger' maintained by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. The ledger is divided into entries for each subcommittee of the Committees on Appropriations, with three parts in each entry: the 'House Lock-box Balance', the 'Senate Lock-box Balance', and the 'Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balance'. Amounts credited to each component in an entry are only positive, credited upon the engrossment of appropriation bills by the House and Senate. The Director credits new budget authority and outlays to the House and Senate Lock-box Balances based on reductions resulting from agreed-upon amendments to appropriation bills. Additionally, amounts are credited to the Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balance upon the engrossment of Senate amendments to appropriation bills. The Senate amendments to appropriation bills reported by the Committee on Appropriations are considered part of the original text for calculating reductions in new budget authority and outlays. The term 'appropriation bill' includes general or special bills, as well as those for supplemental, deficiency, or continuing appropriations through the fiscal year's end. During House or Senate consideration of appropriations bills, a running tally of amendments reflecting budget changes will be available to Members. Additionally, adjustments to allocations and suballocations will be made as necessary. Upon the engrossment of Senate amendments to any appropriation bill for a fiscal year, allocations to the Committee on Appropriations of each House will be adjusted downward based on the Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balance. Revised levels of budget authority and outlays will be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. Suballocations will also be adjusted as necessary. The Act of 1974 is amended to require downward adjustments in budget allocations when adjustments are made to allocations under subsection (a)(5). The revised allocations must be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. SEC. 5 amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to include periodic reporting of ledger statements. SEC. 6 involves downward adjustment of discretionary spending limits. The discretionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays for any fiscal year shall be reduced by amounts set forth in the final regular appropriation bill or joint resolution making continuing appropriations. This reduction is based on the Joint House-Senate Lock-box Balances for that fiscal year. The bill or resolution must include a statement of law indicating the adjusted discretionary spending limit for new budget authority shall be reduced. The discretionary spending limits for new budget authority and outlays will be reduced by specified amounts in the final regular appropriation bill or continuing resolution. The adjusted limits will be reflected in reports under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Waiver of certain provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 will apply to this adjustment. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Act apply to all appropriation bills for fiscal year 1996 onwards. For bills engrossed by the House of Representatives after August 4, 1995, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office and other committees must fulfill their duties within 10 days of enactment. The definition of an \"appropriation bill\" includes general or special bills for fiscal year 1996 based on revised allocations as of August 4, 1995. SEC. 8. ADJUSTMENT FOR STIMULATIVE EFFECT OF REVENUE REDUCTIONS. The Director of OMB calculates stimulative effect by determining excess revenues compared to projected levels set forth in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Projected revenues for fiscal years 1996 to 2001 are specified. The Director of OMB certifies estimates and projections made under the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. If a fiscal dividend excess exists, the President can use it to retire debt or propose tax reductions to Congress. The President can propose tax reductions or debt retirement using fiscal dividend excess, with an expedited procedure for introducing the proposal to Congress. The bill introduced in the House of Representatives is referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, while a bill introduced in the Senate is referred to the Committee on Finance. The committee must consider and report the first bill introduced and cannot reduce revenues below the amount proposed by the President. If the committee does not report the bill within 15 days, it is discharged from further consideration. When a bill is reported or discharged from further consideration by a committee, any Member of the respective House can move to proceed to its consideration. All points of order against the bill are waived, and the motion is highly privileged in the House of Representatives. The motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. If agreed to, the bill remains unfinished business until disposed of. Debate is limited to 20 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. The motion to limit debate on a bill is in order and not debatable. Other motions such as to postpone, proceed to other business, or recommit the bill are not allowed. Reconsidering the vote on the bill is also not permitted. Debate on amendments is limited to 30 minutes. Amendments cannot reduce revenues below the President's proposal. The final vote on the bill must follow the debate. The final vote on the bill shall occur after limited debate and rulings of the chair on procedure. Appeals on procedural decisions shall be decided without debate. If one House receives a similar bill from the other House, specific procedures will apply. The final vote on a bill will occur after limited debate and rulings of the chair on procedure. Appeals on procedural decisions will be decided without debate. If one House receives a similar bill from the other House, specific procedures will apply, including not referring the bill to a committee and voting on final passage based on the bill from the other House. These rules are enacted by Congress as part of the rules of each House. If tax reductions are not enacted by December 31 of the year of the submission of a legislative proposal, the President shall follow specific procedures outlined in the rules of each House, which can be changed at any time. The President must pay an amount equal to the revenue not reduced to deficit reduction under a legislative proposal. The term \"stimulative economic effect\" refers to laws that stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth. The maximum deficit amount for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998 is specified. In fiscal years 1998 to 2002, specific deficit amounts were set, with a surplus in 2002. Starting from fiscal year 2003, no deficit is allowed. A point of order is established regarding maximum deficit amounts in legislative proposals. In fiscal years 1998 to 2002, specific deficit amounts were set, with a surplus in 2002. Starting from fiscal year 2003, no deficit is allowed. A point of order is established regarding maximum deficit amounts in legislative proposals, requiring a three-fifths vote for waiver or suspension."
