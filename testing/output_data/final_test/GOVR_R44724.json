    "content": "The 1996 welfare law replaced AFDC with TANF, aiming to address childhood poverty and reduce dependence on government benefits through work and job preparation. The reduction in the number of families receiving cash assistance since the 1996 welfare reform law is seen as a success in reducing welfare dependency. While the decline in caseload historically indicated reduced dependency, concerns arise as child poverty increases and TANF programs may not adequately support low-income families. The report analyzes the cash assistance caseload for low-income families, comparing the number of recipients to those eligible. It also assesses the impact of AFDC and TANF on child poverty rates. The analysis is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the TRIM3 model funded by HHS. TRIM3 model funded by HHS estimates population eligible for assistance and corrects under-reporting of benefits on ASEC. TANF varies by state, limiting state-level analysis. Eligibility for TANF cash assistance requires a dependent child and financial qualifications. To qualify for TANF cash assistance, a family must have a dependent child and meet financial eligibility rules set by the state. States define need, with varying income thresholds for eligibility. Maximum earnings for a single parent with two children range from $269 to $1,740 per month across states in July 2012. The eligibility thresholds for TANF cash assistance vary among states and are not necessarily tied to the federal poverty level. Most states set their own thresholds without adjusting for inflation, leading to a decline in eligibility thresholds over time. Only three states had initial income eligibility thresholds at or above the poverty level, while 24 states had thresholds below 50% of poverty level income. Under TANF, states set their own income eligibility thresholds for cash assistance, leading to a decline over time. Families must also meet nonfinancial eligibility rules and comply with program requirements. Most states time-limit benefits to 60 months, with exceptions in California and New York. Benefits may also be restricted for minor parents. Under TANF, benefits may be restricted for minor parents and convicted drug felons. Applicants must comply with program requirements, but meeting all criteria does not guarantee benefits. Some eligible individuals choose not to apply due to costs like transportation and time spent at the welfare office. Factors such as reluctance to disclose personal information, social stigma, and work requirements may deter eligible individuals from applying for TANF benefits. The time commitment and perceived low benefit amount could also discourage participation. The size of the TANF caseload is influenced by the take-up rate, which is the percentage of eligible individuals who actually receive assistance. The take-up rate is the percentage of eligible individuals who receive assistance. Table 1 shows cash assistance caseload and indicators of child poverty and work among single mothers from 1995 to 2012. The cash assistance caseload declined in two eras: 1995 to 2000 and 2000 to 2012. Child poverty decreased and employment of single mothers increased from 1995 to 2000. However, after 2000, the caseload continued to decline while child poverty increased. Child poverty increased before the 2007 recession, with a further rise during 2007-2012. The employment rate for single mothers declined. The decline in cash assistance caseload could be due to stricter eligibility rules or lower take-up rates. Figure 2 illustrates the number of eligible individuals for TANF cash assistance and those who actually received it. The number of people eligible for cash assistance fluctuated from 1995 to 2012, with a decrease in recipients during the first two periods. The share of eligible individuals receiving benefits declined over time, from 82% in 1995 to 28% in 2012. The data raises questions about the economic disadvantage of those eligible but not receiving benefits. Table 2 shows characteristics of adults eligible for cash assistance but not receiving it from AFDC in 1995 and TANF in 2000, 2007, and 2012. The poverty rate among these adults remained stable, but more were in deep poverty over time. Fewer worked or had family members with earnings. The proportion of married adults decreased from 60% in 1995 to 45.1% in TANF years, indicating relative disadvantage. In 1995, 15.2 million children lived in families below the poverty line, with 11.5 million receiving AFDC cash assistance. By 2012, 15.8 million children were in poverty, but only 4.1 million received TANF. The percentage of poor children eligible for cash assistance declined from two-thirds in 1995 to 56% in 2012. The share of poor children in families receiving TANF cash assistance declined to 20.1% in 2012 from 57% in 1995. The number of poor children eligible for TANF cash increased over time, but the number actually receiving benefits decreased. The number of poor children eligible for TANF cash assistance increased over time, but the number actually receiving benefits decreased. In 2012, 75% of children in deep poverty were eligible for TANF, but only 30.5% received cash assistance. The number of children in families with pre-TANF incomes in deep poverty fell from 1995 to 2000, then increased. However, the rise in children living in deep poverty over 2000 to 2012 did not fully offset the 1995 to 2000 decline. The decline in the percentage of children in TANF-eligible families receiving benefits meant more children in deep poverty were in families without cash assistance. The number of children in deep poverty eligible but not receiving cash assistance increased from 0.5 million in 1995 to 3.1 million in 2012. The impact of TANF cash assistance on child poverty rates in 1995, 2000, 2007, and 2012 is analyzed by comparing pre-TANF poverty rates with post-TANF rates. The discussion focuses on how much the poverty rate changes when transfers are subtracted from total money income. The impact of TANF cash assistance on child poverty rates is analyzed by comparing pre- and post-TANF poverty rates for 1995, 2000, 2007, and 2012. Before welfare reform, AFDC cash assistance had a small impact on poverty rates due to insufficient benefits. Since then, TANF has had a minimal effect on poverty rates as states have not raised benefits to compensate for inflation. In 1995, AFDC had a significant impact on child deep poverty rates, reducing it by 43%. However, with the decline in cash assistance recipients, the impact of TANF on deep poverty has diminished over time. In 2012, TANF cash income reduced child deep poverty by 12%. In addition to TANF, families with children and earnings may benefit from refundable tax credits like EITC and ACTC, as well as noncash assistance programs like SNAP and subsidized housing. Data from 1995, 2000, 2007, and 2012 shows that eligible persons not receiving TANF still commonly received other government benefits such as EITC, ACTC, and SNAP. Among the population eligible for but not receiving TANF, a significant percentage received tax credits like EITC and ACTC, as well as SNAP benefits. The receipt of EITC has decreased over time, while SNAP assistance has increased. Housing assistance receipt remained relatively stable. Refundable tax credits and noncash benefits do benefit families, but have limitations such as being paid only once a year. The House Ways and Means Committee aimed to eliminate welfare dependency by making benefits temporary and provisional, shifting focus from permanent guarantees to temporary assistance. Noncash benefits like EITC and ACTC are received once a year as a lump sum, impacting families' ability to meet ongoing basic needs in the current year. These benefits serve different roles in providing economic security compared to ongoing cash income. The House Ways and Means Committee aimed to reduce welfare dependency by making benefits temporary and provisional. President Clinton highlighted the success of welfare reform, with a significant decrease in caseloads over the past 8 years, emphasizing the importance of work and self-sufficiency. Welfare rolls have dropped nearly 60 percent nationwide, reaching the lowest levels in over 30 years. In 2000, caseloads declined, child poverty decreased, and employment among single mothers increased. The number of children living in families with incomes below half the poverty threshold also fell. However, after 2000, child poverty increased while the number of families receiving TANF cash assistance continued to decline. The number of children in deep poverty rose from 2000 to 2007, with a smaller share assisted by TANF cash even before the recession. The decline in caseloads after 2000 raises questions about TANF's goal of caseload reduction, as assistance was increasingly forgone by eligible families. TANF's structural features incentivize states to reduce caseloads. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program incentivizes states to reduce caseloads by providing funding through a fixed block grant and a sole performance measure called the \"work participation standard.\" This standard sets a goal of having 50% of families either working or in welfare-to-work activities, with credits given for caseload reduction. States can use savings from caseload reductions on other benefits and services for families with children not receiving cash assistance. The TANF program allows states to reduce caseloads by 1% and gives them the legal ability to do so. It also ends individual entitlement to benefits for needy families with children, potentially affecting their rights to legal redress. States can end benefits for a family if the adult member doesn't comply with work requirements. Policymakers have options to address ongoing cash assistance needs, such as altering TANF to reduce incentives for caseload reduction. States could be required to meet work participation standards through engaging recipients in work or activities. Policymakers could consider altering existing programs like the child tax credit to provide ongoing support for needy families with children, beyond TANF's work requirements."
