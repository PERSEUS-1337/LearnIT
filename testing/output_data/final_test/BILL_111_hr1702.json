    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shelter, Land, and Urban Management (SLUM) Assistance Act of 2009\". Congress finds that over half of the world's population resides in cities, generating most of the global economic output. Additionally, around one billion individuals live in slums, with a majority under 25 years old. By 2030, the slum population is expected to double, facing challenges such as inadequate access to water, sanitation, overcrowding, and insecure housing conditions. Unsafe water, poor sanitation, and hygiene contribute to 88% of diseases in developing countries. Almost 50 percent of people in developing countries suffer health problems due to water and sanitation deficits. Over 1.1 billion lack access to safe water and nearly 2.5 billion lack sanitation services. The costs of diseases and productivity losses linked to water and sanitation in less developed countries amount to two percent of GDP and up to five percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Insecure property ownership tenure exposes slum dwellers to arbitrary rents, forced evictions, and harassment. In 2007, about five million people faced forced evictions, with projections indicating a potential increase to 40-70 million in the next 20 years. Insecurity of tenure hinders economic development, limits investment incentives, and affects families' access to shelter. Women, who make up 66% of the workforce, own less than 15% of global property. Gender discrimination leads to women being disproportionately affected by forced evictions and insecure tenure, making them more vulnerable to poverty and violence. The 2006 National Security Strategy emphasizes assisting the world's poor citizens and integrating them into the global economy. Goal 7 Target 11 aims to improve the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020. The United States has reduced its overseas development assistance for shelter and affordable housing in recent years. The statement of policy outlined in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of assisting the world's poor citizens and integrating them into the global economy. The United States aims to prioritize urban development assistance in developing countries, focusing on improved urban management, sustainable development, property security, and access to shelter and essential services for the poor. Increased bilateral assistance will be allocated for these programs to prevent waste and duplication in overseas development assistance. The United States aims to prioritize urban development assistance in developing countries by fostering cooperative relations with foreign governments, organizations, and entities supporting similar programs. Seeking innovative international mechanisms for increased coordination in sustainable urban development policies and programs. Assistance is provided for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries. Assistance under this section aims to support sustainable urban growth, development, and poverty reduction efforts in densely populated urban areas in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, safe water, sanitation, and communal infrastructure. Assistance under this section supports sustainable urban growth in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, safe water, sanitation, and communal infrastructure, as well as enhancing land ownership rights and capacity building for effective urban growth management by governments. Assistance under this section aims to support sustainable urban growth in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, water, sanitation, and infrastructure. This includes promoting functional housing markets, expanding access to investment capital, and strengthening national financing mechanisms. Supporting institutional, legal, and procedural reforms to enhance rights and access to shelter, urban infrastructure, and property ownership for vulnerable groups, including women, children, the poor, and those in urban slums. Prioritizing cross-sectoral projects that advance these objectives. To support institutional reforms for vulnerable groups, the President is authorized to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries through various means like public-private partnerships, grants, loans, and investment insurance. This assistance can be carried out using existing US Government programs in fiscal year 2009. The United States Government can provide technical and financial assistance for urban development and housing in foreign countries through existing programs and agencies like the United States Agency for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and other relevant government agencies. The United States Government aims to enhance its operational capabilities and capacities of programs and organizations to further its objectives in foreign countries. This includes increasing manpower, expertise diversity, funding levels, and improving coordination and collaboration efforts.

Additionally, there is a focus on affordable housing and sustainable urban development strategy. The President, in collaboration with relevant agencies, will develop a strategy for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries. This strategy will draw upon successful models from various organizations and entities. The strategy required for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries will include a review of existing programs, assessment of successful grassroots efforts, and defining short- and long-term objectives with performance measures.
