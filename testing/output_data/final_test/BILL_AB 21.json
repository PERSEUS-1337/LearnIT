    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Department of Food and Agriculture will establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program for the cultivation of medical marijuana. A person must obtain a license from the city or county and a state license to cultivate medical marijuana. To apply for a state license for medical marijuana cultivation, one must first obtain a permit from the local city or county. The local permit requirements must be as strict as the state's licensing requirements. The secretary has the authority to create and enforce regulations for this program. The secretary has the authority to prescribe emergency regulations to implement the medical marijuana cultivation program, following specific government codes for adoption. The secretary may enter into a cooperative agreement with a county agricultural commissioner for the administration of the medical marijuana cultivation program. The department will implement a unique identification program for medical marijuana in consultation with relevant agencies to address water use and environmental impacts. The department will establish a program for identifying permitted medical marijuana plants at cultivation sites using unique identifiers like zip ties. These identifiers will only be issued to licensed individuals and their information will be included in a trace and track program. The department may charge a fee for issuing unique identifiers for medical marijuana plants and enforcing regulations. Protections against fraud and illegal diversion of identifiers must be established. Cities and counties issuing licenses must notify the department and adhere to its requirements for unique identifiers. This section exempts qualified patients and primary caregivers cultivating marijuana for personal medical use from certain restrictions based on the area used for cultivation and the number of patients served. The area used for cultivating marijuana is measured by the aggregate area of live marijuana plants. Exemption from these requirements does not limit a city's authority under the California Constitution. This act is an urgency statute allowing local governments to regulate marijuana immediately to protect public health and safety."
