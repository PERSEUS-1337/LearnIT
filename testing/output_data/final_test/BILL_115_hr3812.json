    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma Working Family Tax Relief Act.\" It determines earned income for the Earned Income Credit and Child Tax Credit for individuals in the disaster areas of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. The \"Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma Working Family Tax Relief Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a special rule for the Earned Income Credit. It allows qualified individuals affected by the hurricanes to use the earned income from the previous year for calculating the credit in the current year. The \"Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma Working Family Tax Relief Act\" defines a qualified individual as someone whose principal place of abode was in the disaster area and was displaced by the hurricanes, or someone who worked in the disaster area on the applicable date. The term \"applicable date\" includes the date of the hurricanes. The term 'applicable date' refers to August 25, 2017 for Hurricane Harvey and September 5, 2017 for Hurricane Irma. 'Hurricane Harvey federally declared disaster' is defined as the disaster caused by Hurricane Harvey that warrants assistance under the Stafford Act. The Emergency Assistance Act defines the Hurricane Harvey disaster area as the area warranting assistance and the Hurricane Irma federally declared disaster as the disaster caused by Hurricane Irma that warrants assistance under the Stafford Act. The term 'Hurricane Irma disaster area' refers to the area determined to warrant assistance. Special rules apply for joint returns, where either spouse being a qualified individual allows for the application of certain provisions. Any election made under these rules applies uniformly. The election made under paragraph (1) applies to both section 24(d) and this section. Errors on a return of earned income are treated as mathematical errors. The title is applied without regard to any substitution under paragraph (1). Additionally, a special rule related to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma can be found in section 32(n). The Secretary of the Treasury will pay possessions of the United States for losses due to amendments made by the section, based on information provided by the respective government. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay possessions of the United States for losses due to amendments made by the section, based on information provided by the respective government. States without a mirror code tax system will receive payments equal to the benefits residents would have received if a mirror code tax system was in place, provided the possession has an approved plan to distribute the payments to residents. Coordination with the credit allowed against United States income taxes is required for individuals. Any person eligible for a credit against taxes imposed by a possession of the United States or eligible for a payment under a specific plan will have their credits determined without considering the amendments made by this section. The term \"possession of the United States\" includes Puerto Rico for this purpose. The term \"States\" in this subsection refers to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. A mirror code tax system means the income tax system of a US possession where residents' tax liability is determined based on US income tax laws. Payments under this subsection are treated as refunds from a credit allowed under section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, US Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after August 25, 2017."
