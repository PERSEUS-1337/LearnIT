    "content": "The issue of living organ donation is important to Congress as it balances the needs of organ recipients and donors. The drive to increase organ supply for transplants competes with ethical considerations, such as paying donors or mandating organ harvesting from cadavers. Congress may need to address new living donation options to maintain a balanced transplantation system. The demand for transplantable organs is surpassing the supply, with over 106,000 candidates on the waiting list in 2010. Congress may need to consider new living organ donation options to address the imbalance, while ensuring equitable distribution through the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) authorized the establishment of the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The OPTN, currently administered by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), matches organs with individuals in need and sets policies for transplant centers and organ procurement organizations. NOTA also prohibits the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation, but allows reasonable payments to living donors for expenses related to donation. The United States organ procurement system consists of 58 OPOs that recover organs for transplant centers. Each OPO has a designated service area and provides candidate information to the OPTN. OPOs can implement regional organ allocation systems to increase organ availability and quality. In 1986, Congress passed legislation requiring hospitals to establish protocols for organ donor requests to increase the organ supply for transplantation. In 2004, the Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act was passed, allowing for living donors to donate organs. This law amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants for travel and expenses related to organ donation. The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act of 2004 authorized funding for donor awareness programs and allowed for reimbursement of expenses incurred by individuals making living organ donations. Government oversight of the living donation process is limited, and some OPOs have organized non-traditional programs for living donors. Living donor programs typically involve transplants from biologically compatible family members or friends, raising concerns about the health, financial, and social risks faced by donors. The Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act was passed in 2007 to address post-operative risks for living donors. It requires annual reports on the long-term health effects of living organ donation and clarifies that paired organ donation is not prohibited. Various bills have been proposed to encourage living organ donation, including tax credits. Various bills have been proposed to encourage living organ donation, including the Living Organ Donor Tax Credit Act of 2009 and the Living Organ Donor Job Security Act. Another proposal involved awarding a bronze medal to organ donors and their families. Different types of directed exchanges, such as paired donation, have emerged to accommodate willing living donors who are not biologically compatible with their intended recipients. Paired donation allows incompatible donors to trade kidneys with compatible recipients. P.L. 110 - 144 clarified that paired donation does not violate NOTA's prohibition on exchanging valuable consideration for organs. This law defined human paired organ donation as a process where a donor is biologically incompatible but desires to donate to a specific patient. In paired donation, donors who are biologically incompatible with their intended recipients can exchange kidneys with compatible recipients. The law allows for this exchange without violating the prohibition on exchanging valuable consideration for organs. Prior to the passage of the law, OPOs in Washington, D.C., and New England had implemented two types of programs for kidney exchange: paired donation and list donation. In list donation, an incompatible donor donates to a stranger on the waiting list, allowing the intended recipient to move up the list for a deceased donor organ. While receiving a kidney from a living donor is preferred, recipients from deceased donors still have a higher chance of survival than those on dialysis. List donation is a directed living organ donation exchange program that may facilitate increased organ donation. However, it disadvantages people with blood type O seeking transplants and the legality of list donation is unclear due to the passage of P.L. 110-114. The impact of P.L. 110-114 on list donation legality is discussed in the report, along with legislative efforts to clarify its permissibility for kidneys. The report also analyzes the impact of living donation programs on organ transplantation, including statistics on the current system and the potential effects of paired and list donation programs on organ supply and waiting lists. Additionally, a legal analysis of NOTA is presented. Living donation provides thousands of organs for transplantation each year, with kidneys accounting for over 96% of organs donated by living donors. In 2009, 6,610 organs were provided by living donors, representing a fifth of total organs donated. The number of living organ donations peaked in 2004. The number of living organ donations peaked in 2004, then declined annually until 2008. In 2009, there was a slight increase in living organ donations compared to 2008 but still lower than in 2001. More than 6,000 people died each year from 2000 to 2009 while waiting for organ transplants, with over half awaiting kidneys. The number of deaths while awaiting a kidney transplant increased each year from 2000 to 2009. The impact of mechanisms like paired and list donation on expanding the pool of potential living organ donors is challenging to assess, as these systems have only been tested for kidney donation. The impact of mechanisms like paired and list donation on expanding the pool of potential living organ donors is challenging to assess. Factors such as selecting an optimal transplant system, increasing donor willingness, and avoiding systemic restrictions play a role in increasing the number of available kidneys for transplant. Studies have examined these factors to determine the optimal transplant system for a given population. One study compared transplant systems for donor/recipient pairs, finding that a combination paired/list exchange program yielded the most successful transplants. Another study explored factors influencing donors' willingness to participate in such programs, showing willingness is linked to the benefit to the recipient. In a study, 63.8% of potential donors were willing to participate in paired donation, while 37.9% were willing to participate in list donation. Willingness to make a list donation was highest when the intended recipient would move to the top of the waiting list. Another study found success in maximizing paired donations by lowering compatibility requirements. Specialized centers report success with incompatible kidney transplantation using special techniques to increase compatibility. Long-term results are not yet available, and the therapy is labor-intensive and costly. Ethical restrictions on list donations may impact the number of transplants performed, as people with blood type O may be disadvantaged in the current system. Type O recipients may face longer wait times for a kidney transplant due to compatibility issues. Restrictions on list donations for blood type O recipients could decrease the number of available kidneys from list exchanges by half annually. Without these restrictions, type O recipients in a list exchange program may experience increased waiting times, leading to potential deaths. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 prohibits buying or selling human organs. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) prohibits buying or selling human organs for valuable consideration, with penalties of fines and imprisonment. The term \"valuable consideration\" excludes reasonable payments for organ-related expenses. Congress intended to criminalize organ trafficking for profit. The Senate report on S. 2048 and the House conference report reiterated that the buying and selling of human organs for transplantation is unlawful. Congressional hearings in 2003 discussed objections to direct monetary incentives for organ donations. Living kidney donations were allowed under NOTA, as certain expense payments to donors were permitted. Congress enacted the Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act in December 2007 to clarify that \"human organ paired donation\" is not a violation of the prohibition on exchanging valuable consideration for human organs under NOTA. Some transplant facilities have hesitated to implement multiple living donation programs due to legal concerns, despite the development of arrangements like paired donation and list donation. The Donation Act clarifies that paired donation is not a violation of NOTA as it does not involve monetary payments. Concerns have been raised about valuable consideration in living donation arrangements, but Congress has clarified that paired transplants do not violate NOTA. While paired transplants of compatible living donors and recipients do not violate NOTA's prohibition of valuable consideration, concerns may still arise regarding other living donation arrangements like list donation. Legal opinions before Congress's amendment of \u00a7 301 of NOTA remain relevant, with the UNOS Associate General Counsel stating in 2006 that NOTA \u00a7301 is not applicable to today's living donation arrangements. The UNOS legal analysis clarifies that the prohibition on valuable consideration under NOTA \u00a7 301 does not apply to living organ donation arrangements, as they are considered gifts and not contracts involving monetary transfers or valuable property exchanges. The donation of an organ is considered a gift, not a contractual agreement. A gift involves a gratuitous transfer without the need for consideration or mutual agreement. Living donations can be made conditionally, but the condition must benefit the donor. The donation of an organ is considered a gift, not a contractual agreement. Living donations can be made conditionally, but the condition must benefit the donor. List donation and paired donation are conditional gifts that benefit the intended recipient, not the donor. Alternative organ donation practices were reviewed for legality under \u00a7 301 of NOTA by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel in March 2007. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concluded that paired exchanges and living donor transplants do not involve 'valuable consideration' under NOTA, allowing the Secretary of HHS to encourage these practices. The OLC's opinion considered statutory provisions, common law, state laws, and case law, interpreting 'valuable consideration' as pecuniary to avoid violating \u00a7 301 as a criminal provision. The legality of list donation arrangements and future multiple recipient/donor arrangements under NOTA's section 301 remains uncertain, as they may not involve illegal exchanges of valuable consideration for human organs according to legal opinions. Further clarification on these issues is needed to balance the needs of individuals seeking organs. The ethical issues in organ transplantation involve balancing the needs of recipients and donors. Recommendations have been made by the ACOT, IOM, and PCBE to address these issues. The ethical issues in organ transplantation involve balancing the needs of recipients and donors. Recommendations from ACOT, IOM, PCBE, and various articles are summarized. Congress faces the decision of maintaining direct control over the system or delegating authority for flexibility. Current law allows paired organ donation for various organs, broader than earlier proposals, but exempts paired donations from valuable consideration exchange prohibition. The ACOT proposed an alternative for transplantation systems, recommending that the HHS Secretary seek authority from Congress to clarify valuable consideration regulations. This would allow for revisions as technology evolves and new systems are developed. The practice of obtaining organs from living donors challenges medical principles of doing no harm, balancing benefits and risks, and obtaining informed consent. P.L. 110 - 114 may expand living organ donation, raising ethical issues, but not more than current practices. Removing a healthy organ from a healthy person for another patient's benefit raises moral dilemmas among transplant surgeons. Surgeons faced moral dilemmas in placing living donors at risk, but believed transplant centers should offer transplantation using living donors. The IOM recommended a thorough review of living donation by HRSA, emphasizing the need to balance benefits and risks for each patient. Living donors may experience psychosocial benefits that could outweigh physical risks, but it is crucial to ensure the risk is not excessive. The IOM recommended appointing an independent donor advocate to assess the risk-benefit ratio for living organ donors. Little is known about the long-term health effects of being a living donor, making it challenging to weigh the risks against the benefits. To address this, living donor registries were recommended to enable follow-up research on the long-term effects of donation. Living organ donation requires competent, voluntary, and fully informed consent from donors. The lack of long-term health data complicates the risk-benefit analysis and informed consent process. Establishing a living donor registry could improve informed consent and provide necessary information for assessing risks. The process of obtaining informed consent for living organ donation can be complicated by factors such as lack of legal competence, coercive situations, and gender disparities. The use of advocates and addressing gender disparities are recommended to protect voluntary consent and evaluate risk-benefit ratios. One study suggests that women are asked to donate more often than men, leading to longer waiting times for organ transplants, especially for individuals with blood type O. This blood type represents a higher percentage of people awaiting transplants compared to other blood types, with over half having to wait more than five years. Concerns have been raised about further disadvantaging individuals with blood type O in the transplantation system. Some authors recommend limiting the role of list paired donation on a national level due to its disparate impact on disadvantaged groups, particularly type O recipients. Others support the list exchange program despite the impact on type O individuals, arguing that the effects would be temporary. Current law focuses on paired donation to avoid the type O issue, while earlier proposals considered allowing list donation. Directed donation, including paired and list donation, raises issues related to equitable organ allocation. Waiting list ranking depends on various factors like biological matching and medical status. Current law allows paired donation, but the rules governing organ allocation are crucial for patients waiting for transplants. The PCBE discussed the ethical implications of directed donation, where donors can choose who receives their organ. They questioned whether it is fair for someone less needy to receive an organ simply because of a donor's preference. Some suggest that in paired and list donations, the organs should be of equal value for a fair exchange, but this may not be possible with list donations where the recipient gets a deceased donor organ. The demand for transplantable organs has led to proposals to increase supply, including financial incentives for donors. Various organizations support these initiatives, but concerns remain about ensuring fairness and outcome parity in donation programs. Various organizations, including the American Medical Association and UNOS, have supported studying financial options to encourage organ donations. Arguments have been made for treating organ donors no differently than donors of tissues. There is resistance to proposals that encourage commodification of human organs. The IOM analyzed various financial incentives for donation but concluded that none should be promoted at this time due to a lack of evidence. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended against promoting financial incentives for organ donation at this time due to concerns about reversibility, potential impact on the poor, and lack of evidence for improved donation rates. Current laws do not allow for monetary exchange for organ donation, although paired donation is permitted. Congress has not yet considered legislation to change this."
