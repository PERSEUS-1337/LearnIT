    "content": "Subpart 1 of part D of chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to read as follows: \"Subpart 1--Programs for Migrant Children.\" The purpose of Subpart 1 is to support high-quality educational programs for migrant children, provide appropriate services addressing their special needs, and help them overcome barriers to education. Grants are provided for these programs. A State educational agency can receive a grant to establish or improve education programs for migrant children. States with allocations of $1,000,000 or less may form consortium arrangements for more effective service delivery. All states, regardless of allocation amounts, can propose consortium agreements, which will be approved by the Secretary if they demonstrate effectiveness. The proposal can reduce administrative costs for State programs and increase funds for direct services to benefit children. The grant amount for each State is based on per pupil expenditure and the number of migrant children residing in the State. If the State's per pupil expenditure is less than 80% of the national average, adjustments may be made. The grant amount for each State is determined based on per pupil expenditure and the number of migrant children residing in the State. If the State's per pupil expenditure is less than 80% of the national average, the grant is 32% of the national average multiplied by the estimated number of migrant children. If the State's per pupil expenditure is more than 120% of the national average, the grant is 48% of the national average multiplied by the estimated number of migrant children. The Secretary will develop a formula to adjust the estimated number of migrant children in a State to account for those served in summer programs, with an equitable cost factor. The grant amount for Puerto Rico is determined based on per pupil expenditure compared to the State with the lowest average, and the average per pupil expenditure of Puerto Rico. The grant amount for Puerto Rico under this section is calculated by multiplying the number of migrant children in Puerto Rico by a percentage and 32 percent of the average per pupil expenditure in the United States. States can have a 5 percent error rate when determining eligible migrants, and there is a provision for states unable to conduct educational programs for migrant children. The Secretary may make special arrangements with other agencies to carry out the purposes of this section in one or more States using grants available under this subpart. \"Program requirements under SEC. 1203 include special arrangements with other agencies to implement grants in one or more States.\" The Secretary approves applications that ensure migrant children meet content and performance standards, maintain educational continuity, record migrant status and attendance, and set goals in a comprehensive plan. The program includes education, health, nutrition, and social services provided directly or through agreements with other service providers. It involves coordination with other federal programs, ongoing professional development, mentoring programs, parent involvement programs, and instructional programs. The program includes instructional programs like the Even Start Family Literacy Programs, integrating information technology, and managing the transition from school to work or postsecondary education for high school students. It prioritizes migrant children with the greatest educational needs and interruptions. The program prioritizes migrant children with the greatest educational needs and interruptions, especially those whose education has been interrupted during the regular school year. SEC. 1204. COORDINATION OF MIGRANT EDUCATION ACTIVITIES. The Secretary is authorized to make grants to State educational agencies for activities improving coordination among educational programs for migrant children. Grants are also provided for developing a national program of credit exchange for migrant children to meet graduation requirements. The Secretary reserves funds to award grants to State educational agencies with approved consortium agreements. Services can continue for a migrant child for one additional school year if comparable services are not available elsewhere. Services for migrant children in secondary school can be provided through credit accrual programs until graduation. The Secretary will assist States in transferring students' educational and health records by providing model information forms. A migrant child is defined as aged 3 to 21, whose parent or guardian is a migrant agricultural, fisherman, or dairy worker, and has moved within the past 24 months for temporary or seasonal employment in agriculture, fishing, or dairy work. Children of migrant agricultural, fisherman, or dairy workers may qualify for educational services if they have moved for temporary employment in these industries. Funds up to $5,000,000 can be reserved annually for this purpose. The Migrant Student Record System contract must end by June 30, 1995, and no new contracts can be awarded for a similar system until then."
