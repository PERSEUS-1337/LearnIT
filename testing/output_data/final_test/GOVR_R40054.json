    "content": "Najib Miqati was appointed as the new prime minister of Lebanon after a parliamentary vote. His nomination is believed to have come after agreeing to Hezbollah's demands. Hariri's supporters protested against the decision, and the security situation in Lebanon remains uncertain. Miqati is working on forming a new government, while Hariri announced that he and his allies would not participate in the Hezbollah-backed government. The US administration is waiting to see the outcome of the government formation process. During a press conference in Spain on January 25, 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern over the situation in Lebanon, particularly regarding the formation of a Hezbollah-controlled government. Hezbollah and its allies withdrew from the cabinet on January 13, 2011, in response to looming indictments and Prime Minister Hariri's refusal to denounce the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL). The White House condemned the actions of the Hezbollah-led coalition, stating that it hindered the government's ability to function effectively. The State Department criticized the government's actions in Lebanon, calling it a transparent effort to undermine stability. The current government is now a caretaker until a new consensus is reached. Indictments were filed against the alleged assassins of Rafiq Hariri, with the process expected to take months. Hezbollah responded with demonstrations in Beirut, but no serious incidents were reported. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an important step towards justice and ending impunity. The United States and Lebanon have a strong relationship due to cultural and religious ties, a large Lebanese American community, and Lebanon's pro-western orientation. Despite this, some argue that Lebanon has limited strategic value to the US as it lacks military bases, oil fields, or major trading ties. The United States has a strong relationship with Lebanon due to cultural and religious ties, a large Lebanese American community, and Lebanon's pro-western orientation. Some argue that Lebanon lacks strategic value to the US, while others point to its strategic location as a buffer between Israel and Syria, its Palestinian refugee population, and historical role as an interlocutor with the Arab world. Current US policy focuses on containing Iran's influence and maintaining security in the region. Lebanon has become a proxy war battleground for regional actors, exacerbating sectarian tensions and hindering state institutions. During the Lebanese civil war, the US provided aid, military training, and equipment. The United States briefly deployed military forces to Lebanon in the early 1980s in response to bombings that killed civilians and members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Efforts were made to bring about a cease-fire during the civil war and to quiet unrest in southern Lebanon. Since Israel's withdrawal in 2000, U.S. efforts have focused on countering terrorism and promoting democracy, despite clashes with Hezbollah, which maintains a political party, social services, a militia wing, and terrorist capabilities. The Bush Administration strongly reacted to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005, criticized Syrian presence in Lebanon, demanded Syrian forces' withdrawal, welcomed a new Lebanese government post-Syrian withdrawal, supported the UN in establishing a tribunal for Hariri's assassination. Large-scale fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 complicated US policy towards Lebanon, jeopardizing long-term stability and presenting a dilemma for the US government regarding supporting Israeli military action while hindering efforts to rebuild Lebanon's infrastructure and democratic institutions. Following the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict, Lebanon faced challenges in rebuilding infrastructure and democratic institutions. Hezbollah's increased popular support led to political stalemate and a vacant presidency. The United States cautiously supported the March 14 coalition until Hezbollah called for a general strike in 2007. After the Doha Agreement in 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated U.S. support for Lebanon. In 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed U.S. support for Lebanon's government and its authority over the country. The Obama Administration backed the government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, while Hezbollah maintained its role and influence in Lebanese politics. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's 2010 visit showed support for Lebanon against U.S. efforts to reduce Iranian and Syrian influence. The U.S. is reevaluating its policy towards Lebanon to promote stability and limit Syrian and Iranian influence, sparking debate on the best approach. The United States is considering different approaches to address Syrian and Iranian influence in Lebanon. Options include supporting the March 14 coalition government or incorporating Lebanon into a broader regional initiative involving Syria, Israel, and the peace process. Recent events, such as efforts to dissuade Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and upcoming indictments from the STL, may influence U.S. actions in Lebanon. Increased economic and military assistance has been provided to Lebanon in recent years, especially after Syria's withdrawal in 2005 and the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act provided over $580 million in security and economic assistance to support Lebanon's recovery and strengthen the Lebanese security forces after the war between Hezbollah and Israel. Additional funding was also allocated for Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) in Lebanon. Subsequent appropriations in FY2008, FY2009, FY2010, and the FY2011 request continued these efforts at reduced levels. Hezbollah's Syrian and Iranian backing poses a significant obstacle to U.S. efforts in Lebanon. The organization, known for terrorist acts against U.S. personnel and its anti-Israel stance, is deeply rooted in Lebanese Shiite society. Despite some analysts suggesting Hezbollah's growing independence from Tehran, the strategic relationship between Iran and Hezbollah remains strong. There are no signs that Hezbollah is willing to renounce violence and solely focus on Lebanese politics. Hezbollah remains reliant on outside support for advanced weaponry and funding, primarily from Iran, to pressure Israel and the United States. Solutions to the challenges posed by Hezbollah to Lebanon, Israel, and the U.S. are unclear. Reports indicate Hezbollah has rearmed in defiance of UN resolutions, with Lebanon's security capabilities limited. Iran continues to provide Hezbollah with weapons, training, and financing, sustaining the organization's capabilities. Hezbollah receives support from Iran for weapons, training, and financing, enabling them to pose a threat to Israel's security. Lebanon's political environment is divided, complicating international efforts to address security issues and Hezbollah's weapons. Reports of Syria transferring Scud missiles to Hezbollah in 2010 were denied. The United States condemns the transfer of Scud missiles from Syria to Hezbollah, citing destabilizing effects on the region and posing a threat to Israel's security. Israeli military officials report the transfer of M-600 ballistic missiles to Hezbollah. Hezbollah denies allegations of transferring weapons south of the Litani River. Israel has expressed concerns about Hezbollah storing weapons in private homes in southern Lebanon. Despite UNIFIL and LAF presence, illegal weaponry continues to enter and circulate in the area. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon has not issued indictments for the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, with the only suspects released in 2009. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon has not issued indictments for the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. Hezbollah officials have been questioned, leading to speculation of possible indictments. Hezbollah has launched a campaign to discredit the tribunal and intimidate its supporters. Hezbollah launched a campaign to discredit the tribunal and intimidate its supporters by linking alleged spy networks to exploit the STL investigation. Nasrallah claimed to have evidence implicating Israel in the Hariri assassination and called the STL an \"Israeli project.\" He called for an internal Lebanese commission to investigate the assassination, citing Israeli aerial movements before the murder. Hezbollah is calling for a Lebanese commission to investigate the Hariri assassination, claiming evidence implicating Israel and criticizing those trying to defend Israel's innocence. The March 14 coalition and the opposition have been exchanging criticisms, with speculation that Hezbollah's media campaign is affecting Prime Minister Hariri's commitment to the process. Hariri appeared to backtrack on his accusation against Syria for the assassination, emphasizing the need for a realistic and solid relationship. He acknowledged past mistakes and stated that the tribunal is not linked to political accusations. Hariri's statements have raised concerns about the political costs of supporting the STL and the possibility of increased pressure from Hezbollah and the opposition. Analysts question if indictments will be issued. Bellemare insists the investigation won't be influenced by Lebanese politics. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon believes the future of the STL is not at stake, as it is an independent judiciary process making progress. Most analysts agree that Syrian interference is the greatest hindrance to Lebanon's independence and stability. Syria aims to dominate Lebanon's internal affairs, considering it an extension of its own state. Lebanon serves as a buffer between Syria and Israel, with pro-Syrian business interests deeply entrenched in its economy. Syria has improved relations with France and Saudi Arabia, established diplomatic ties with Lebanon, and refrained from overtly manipulating Lebanese elections in 2009. Syria's influence in Lebanon has strengthened, leading to a shift in Lebanese leaders' policies towards Syria. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, despite his father's assassination believed to be orchestrated by Syrian leaders, has had to adjust his political stance due to changing regional dynamics. With Saudi Arabia no longer openly hostile towards Syria and the Obama Administration supporting improved relations, Hariri's flexibility has decreased. He has visited Damascus for meetings with President Bashar al Assad, signaling a potential improvement in Syrian-Lebanese relations. Syria's influence in Lebanon has strengthened, leading to a shift in Lebanese leaders' policies towards Syria. Despite public displays of amity, Syria's actions are seen as undermining Lebanese sovereignty, with unresolved border issues and doubts about Syrian leaders' willingness to prioritize Lebanese security. Various visits between Lebanese and Syrian leaders have not resulted in concrete agreements, despite signed accords covering different sectors. Syrian President Basher al-Assad visited Beirut with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abd al Aziz Al Saud, signaling normalization between Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford's appointment in Damascus raised concerns about U.S. support for Lebanon's independence, while some argue that U.S. engagement with Syria is crucial for Lebanese stability. Syria views Lebanon as a buffer against Israel. On August 3, 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) fired on an Israeli Defense Force (IDF) unit near the Blue Line, resulting in casualties. UNIFIL confirmed that the IDF had not entered Lebanese territory. This incident led to a hold on a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon by Congresswoman Nita Lowey. In August 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli unit near the Blue Line, leading to a hold on a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon. Congressman Howard Berman also placed a hold on FY2010 assistance pending clarification on U.S. aid strategy and LAF's actions. The hold was lifted in November after consultations with the State Department. Concerns remain about the impact on FY2011 assistance. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 left unresolved territorial issues. The unresolved territorial issue in southern Lebanon from Israel's withdrawal in 2000 involves the Shib'a Farms enclave, claimed by both Lebanon and Israel. Hezbollah uses Israel's presence in the area as a reason to retain weapons. Israel initially refused to negotiate withdrawal but showed willingness in 2008. In June 2008, Israel shifted its position on negotiating a withdrawal from the area, amidst prisoner exchange talks with Hezbollah and peace talks with Syria. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized the need to address the Shebaa Farms issue. The UN reported that Syria and Lebanon agreed to reactivate a task force to delineate their border, with Syria recognizing Shib'a as part of Lebanon's territory. The task force's progress has stalled. Ghajar, a divided village on the Israel-Lebanon border, remains a point of contention, with Israel controlling both northern and southern parts. Israeli withdrawal from Northern Ghajar is a key provision of UNSCR 1701. Lebanon has agreed to a UN-brokered plan for UNIFIL to replace Israeli troops in the area. Israel is debating whether to adopt the plan or withdraw its troops and citizens en masse. Analysts believe that Israeli withdrawal from Ghajar could strengthen support for UNIFIL and contribute to a comprehensive Middle East peace process involving Lebanon. Ghajar negotiations are taking place through trilateral meetings between Israel, UNIFIL, and Lebanon in Naqoura. The UNIFIL force was created in 1978 to monitor Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese territory. During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, the force consisted of almost 2,000 military personnel from eight countries. Resolution 1701 expanded the force's size to 15,000 personnel and empowered it to monitor the cessation of hostilities, deploy to southern Lebanon alongside the LAF, ensure humanitarian access, and assist in establishing a weapons-free zone. Resolution 1701 empowers UNIFIL to assist in securing Lebanese borders against unauthorized weaponry and take necessary action to prevent hostile activities. UNIFIL personnel work closely with LAF counterparts through joint training and patrols to fulfill their mandate and protect civilians under imminent threat of violence. UNIFIL works closely with LAF counterparts in joint training, patrol operations, mine clearance, and coordination meetings. The deployed force consists of 11,819 military personnel from 33 countries. A Maritime Task Force assists Lebanese forces in maritime security. The Task Force includes ships from Germany, Greece, Italy, and Turkey, operating under Italian command. Major-General Alberto Asarta Cuevas serves as the overall UNIFIL Force Commander. In February 2010, the U.N. Secretary General reported on a review of UNIFIL operations, recommending improvements in mobility and capability. Lebanon, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, abstained from voting on sanctions against Iran in May 2010. Hezbollah, with two seats in the Lebanese cabinet, opposes sanctions on Iran. Lebanese Ambassador to the UN, Nawwaf Salam, advocates for a peaceful resolution with Iran, emphasizing diplomatic efforts. If current diplomatic efforts fail, a call for more diplomatic efforts will be made. Support for mediation by the Brazilian president and Turkey is crucial. If necessary, new doors for diplomacy should be opened. The US increased foreign assistance to Lebanon after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war to aid in economic recovery and strengthen the Lebanese military. The US increased foreign assistance to Lebanon after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war to aid in economic recovery and strengthen the Lebanese military. Assistance is aimed at strengthening state institutions, implementing UNSCR 1701, reducing extremism, and improving fiscal responsibility and border security. Economic Support Funds are used for political and economic reform programs and supporting civil society organizations. The US provided economic aid to Lebanon after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, with funds aimed at strengthening institutions, supporting civil society organizations, and aiding in economic recovery. This assistance included hundreds of millions of dollars committed by the United States for Lebanon's rebuilding efforts. The US provided economic aid to Lebanon through the 2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The aid is tied to benchmarks for economic reform to address Lebanon's $43 billion public debt. Despite some outstanding reforms, Lebanon has made progress in improving its fiscal situation, supported by prudent macroeconomic policies according to the IMF. Lebanon's economic progress is attributed to fiscal primary surpluses, a cautious interest rate policy, and strict financial system oversight. These policies have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio by 20% since 2006, boosting confidence in the economy. The US supports Lebanese civil society through MEPI, with $23.4 million contributed from FY2006-FY2009. There are 26 active MEPI projects in Lebanon focusing on democracy institutions and women empowerment. The US supports Lebanon by providing Foreign Military Financing grants to modernize the Lebanese Armed Forces. Increased assistance was prompted by the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The goal is to promote Lebanese control over southern Lebanon and Palestinian refugee camps. The US provides military assistance to Lebanon to enhance professionalism and promote civilian control over southern Lebanon and Palestinian refugee camps. Funding has increased significantly, with the establishment of a Joint Military Commission in 2008 to strengthen bilateral military relations. In February 2010, Lebanese Minister of Defense Elias Murr and U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Alexander Vershbow emphasized the strong military partnership between the United States and Lebanon. The U.S. State Department announced a focus on supporting Lebanon's special forces with training and equipment, including bunker-busting weapons, anti-tank missiles, UAVs, sniper rifles, and night vision devices. U.S. assistance also aids the Lebanese ISF through INCLE funding for democratic policing and maintaining the rule of law. The INCLE program provides training and equipment to the Lebanese ISF to maintain the rule of law and teach democratic policing techniques. It also supports border security services, communications network development, counternarcotics programs, and corrections system strengthening in Lebanon. Lebanon requires a waiver for U.S. assistance due to budget disclosure requirements. Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Jacob Lew signed a budget transparency waiver for Lebanon in FY2010. The Israeli air campaign in 2006 left unexploded cluster bombs in Lebanon, with estimates that 30% to 40% failed to explode. Most of these weapons were supplied by the United States, leading to criticism from humanitarian groups for causing civilian casualties. The Israeli use of cluster munitions purchased from the United States has raised concerns about potential violations of the Arms Export Control Act. The U.S. State Department has issued a preliminary report to Congress indicating possible misuse by Israel, although a final finding has not been made. Israel denies violating agreements, citing self-defense reasons. The international community has supported U.N. efforts to clear unexploded ordnances in southern Lebanon, with the U.S. contributing $2 million to the UNMACC trust fund. Congress allocated $24.65 million in NADR funding for Lebanon from FY2007 to FY2010. The FY2011 budget requested $4.8 million in NADR funds for Lebanon, but recent reports indicate that demining funding is insufficient. Lebanon struggles to maintain political balance due to weak institutions and interference from Iran and Syria. Lebanon operates under a confessional system with government positions distributed by religion, dating back to an unwritten agreement in 1943. The country has 17 recognized religious sects, and political balance is maintained through this system. Lebanon's confessional system of government, established in 1943, distributes cabinet posts among sectarian communities. The system, based on outdated census data, led to power imbalances and fueled inter-communal tensions, culminating in the civil war from 1975-1990. Political parties in Lebanon are divided along religious, geographic, and ideological lines, with unresolved issues such as the lack of a national budget since 2005. Lebanon's public debt is soaring despite strong economic growth, standing at $51 billion (154% of 2009 GDP). The government is urged to invest in infrastructure and reform key sectors like electricity production. Lebanese exports to the US in 2009 were $77 million, while imports were $1.4 billion. The civil war from 1975-1990 resulted in significant casualties, displacement, and political struggles in Lebanon. During the civil war in Lebanon from 1975-1990, many were killed, wounded, or left homeless. Foreign occupations, kidnappings, and terror bombings were common. Syria and Israel sent troops into Lebanon during the conflict, with Syrian forces occupying parts of Beirut and northern Lebanon. Israel invaded in 1978 in response to PLO attacks from southern Lebanon. The war left lasting sectarian divisions and distrust among Lebanon's demographic groups. In 1978, Israel invaded southern Lebanon to destroy Palestinian bases used for attacks. They withdrew in 1985 but maintained a security zone until 2000. Israeli forces were supported by the South Lebanon Army. Israel unilaterally withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000. After a prolonged political crisis, Lebanese parliamentary deputies met in 1989 in Taif, Saudi Arabia, under the auspices of the Arab League, and adopted a revised power-sharing agreement known as the Taif Agreement. This agreement increased the number of parliament seats, changed the ratio of Christians to Muslims, and left the appointment of the prime minister to parliament. Additionally, Syria and Lebanon signed a treaty of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination in May. The Taif Agreement, signed in 1989, increased parliament seats and changed the Christian-Muslim ratio in Lebanon. Despite declining Syrian troop presence, Syria still wields influence through intelligence agents. The agreement remains a key reference point for Lebanon's political power distribution, serving as a compromise between Sunnis, Christians, and Shiites to prevent civil war. Ongoing sectarian violence and political deadlock highlight tensions over revisiting the agreement's core principles. In 2004, tensions rose between Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and pro-Syrian President Emile Lahoud, leading to Hariri's resignation and alignment with the anti-Syrian opposition. Hariri was assassinated in 2005, sparking widespread protests against Syrian involvement. The assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005 led to protests by anti-Syrian groups and international pressure on Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Syria eventually withdrew its troops, but allegations of Syrian intelligence operations in Lebanon persisted. Lebanon held parliamentary elections in 2005 after Syrian troops withdrew under international pressure. The anti-Syrian bloc, led by Saad Hariri, won a majority of seats, while a pro-Syrian bloc and a Christian bloc also secured seats. In the 2005 Lebanese parliamentary elections, Saad Hariri's anti-Syrian bloc won a majority of seats, while Michel Aoun's bloc gained 21 seats. The electoral system resulted in a mixed government led by Hariri associate Fouad Siniora as prime minister. The cabinet included members from Hariri's bloc, the Shiite bloc, and for the first time, a member of Hezbollah. President Lahoud and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, both pro-Syrians, also remained in key positions. The U.N. Security Council condemned the assassination of Rafiq Hariri in February 2005. The U.N. Security Council condemned the assassination of Rafiq Hariri and established the UNIIIC to investigate. Resolution 1757 created a tribunal outside Lebanon to prosecute those responsible for the attack, causing division in the region. The U.N. Security Council established a tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the assassination of Rafiq Hariri, causing division in the region. Lebanon's political stability was threatened by protracted crises and sectarian violence from 2007 to 2008. The resolution passed under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter faced opposition for potential use of force and interference in Lebanon's affairs. The U.S. contributed $20 million for the tribunal, with Lebanon expected to fund 49% of its costs. The political environment in Lebanon was paralyzed by disagreements, leading to delays in the 2007 presidential election. Hezbollah and its allies boycotted the election, causing repeated delays. The stalemate lasted until May 2008 when sectarian violence erupted in Beirut. In May 2008, Hezbollah clashed with the Lebanese government over dismantling its telecommunications network, leading to a week-long confrontation and violence in Beirut. The Arab League and Qatar mediated negotiations resulting in the \"Doha Agreement\" to end the violence and fill vacant positions. In the \"Doha Agreement,\" factions agreed to end violence, fill the presidency, share power in the cabinet, and hold elections in 2009. General Michel Suleiman was elected president, forming a unity government with Hezbollah gaining veto power. Hezbollah has long opposed government efforts to disarm its militia as per UN Resolution 1701. The government's policy statement reaffirmed support for the resolution and the right to defend Lebanon. Parliamentary elections were held in 2009, electing 128 deputies from various districts and sects. The March 14 coalition maintained its majority in Lebanon's parliament after winning 71 seats to March 8's 57 seats. Minister-designate Saad Hariri announced the formation of a cabinet after five months of negotiations, with the March 8 coalition fighting to retain veto power and control over the Ministry of Telecommunications. The consensus cabinet consists of 15 ministers appointed by the majority March 14 coalition and 10 ministers appointed by the March 8 opposition. The new cabinet in Lebanon consists of 15 ministers appointed by the majority March 14 coalition, 10 ministers appointed by the March 8 opposition, and five ministers appointed by President Michel Suleiman. The March 8 coalition lost its veto power but retained the telecommunications portfolio. Hezbollah now holds two ministry positions. Some argue that March 8 still wields influence through key appointments. Hezbollah now holds two ministry positions in Lebanon, potentially becoming the swing vote on crucial issues."
