    "content": "One possible explanation for the issuance of \"midnight rules\" is the desire of the outgoing administration to complete its work and achieve certain policy goals before the end of its term of office. This phenomenon, known as the \"Cinderella effect,\" involves presidential appointees rushing to issue last-minute regulations before the end of their term. Issuing midnight rules can help ensure a legacy for a President, especially when an incoming administration is of a different party. Some rules issued during the last months of an administration have been controversial, such as energy efficiency standards for washing machines issued by President Clinton. The outgoing administration issued energy efficiency standards for washing machines and workplace ergonomics rules. President George W. Bush's administration finalized rules on concealed firearms in national parks and agency responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. A 2012 study found that many midnight regulations were routine tasks or deadlines outside agencies' control. The study highlighted concerns about midnight rulemaking, including less political accountability for outgoing administrations and limited public input opportunities. Quality of regulations may suffer during the midnight period due to rushed review processes. During the midnight period, departing administrations may issue rules quickly without adequate review, potentially overwhelming the review process. Concerns include limited resources for full regulatory reviews and the challenge of evaluating previous administration's rules. During the transition period, new administrations may impose a moratorium on new regulations and require departments to postpone certain rules issued by the previous administration. Final rules published in the Federal Register can only be changed through the rulemaking process again. President Reagan issued a memorandum shortly after taking office in 1981. President Ronald Reagan issued a memorandum directing agencies to postpone the effective date of final rules for 60 days and refrain from promulgating new rules to allow for a new regulatory oversight process. Executive Order 12291 further imposed a moratorium on rulemaking, specifically targeting 'major' rules. President Ronald Reagan issued a memorandum directing agencies to postpone the effective date of final rules for 60 days and refrain from promulgating new rules to allow for a new regulatory oversight process. Executive Order 12291 imposed a moratorium on rulemaking, specifically targeting 'major' rules. Agencies were directed to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for each major rule suspended or postponed, and to refrain from promulgating any new final rules until a final regulatory impact analysis had been conducted. On January 22, 1993, Leon E. Panetta, the Director of OMB for the incoming William Clinton Administration, sent a memorandum to the heads and acting heads of Cabinet departments and independent agencies requesting them to not send proposed or final rules to the Office of the Federal Register for publication until they had been approved by an agency head appointed by President Clinton and confirmed by the Senate. President Clinton's appointees were directed by OMB Director Panetta to review and approve new regulations. Unlike Reagan's memorandum, agencies were not instructed to postpone rule effective dates. In 2001, Bush's Chief of Staff directed agencies to not send proposed or final rules to the Federal Register. The Card memorandum instructed agencies to not send proposed or final rules to the Office of the Federal Register, withdraw rules not yet published, and postpone effective dates by 60 days. Agencies were to exclude rules impacting health and safety functions and notify the OMB Director. The actions were to allow the President's appointees to review regulations. The Bush Administration later encouraged agencies to complete rulemakings before the end of the administration to prevent new President from blocking midnight rules. Despite efforts by the White House to limit new regulations in the final months of the Bush Administration, the number of rules issued by federal agencies increased. The Administrator of OIRA was tasked with coordinating the completion of Administration priorities, but the number of major final rules published still rose. During the final year of the outgoing administration, the number of major final rules published increased significantly, with 63 rules issued in the second six months compared to 32 in the first six months. This represented a 97% increase in major rules. In 2008, there was a 54% increase in major rules published compared to 2007. The final months of the Clinton Administration also saw a significant increase in major rules. Additionally, there was evidence of \"midnight rulemaking\" at the end of the Bush and Clinton Administrations. OIRA reviewed 82 \"economically significant\" rules from July 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008. During July 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008, OIRA reviewed 82 \"economically significant\" rules, a 64% increase from 2007. In January 2009, Rahm Emanuel requested executive departments and agencies to hold back proposed rules and consider delaying the effective dates of published rules. The Emanuel memorandum requested agencies to \"consider\" extending the effective dates of rules, while the Card memorandum instructed agencies to do so without a provision for public comment. On January 21, 2009, OMB Director Peter R. Orszag issued a memorandum to executive departments and agencies, providing guidance on implementing the third provision of the Emanuel memorandum. The memorandum stated that agencies should base decisions on extending rule effective dates on factors such as procedural adequacy, consideration of relevant facts, and addressing objections. It also emphasized the importance of seeking public comments before extending rule effective dates and consulting with OIRA and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. The Obama Administration, like the Bush Administration before it, delayed the effective dates of some rules and withdrew others to allow for public comments. OIRA Administrator Shelanski urged agencies to prioritize rulemakings to avoid a last-minute rush that could impact the quality of regulations. Some Members of Congress have shown interest in the quality of regulations reviewed by OIRA and the resources available for interagency review. OIRA Administrator Howard Shelanski stated that careful review of rules will continue through the end of the Obama Administration. Once a final rule is published in the Federal Register, the incoming administration can only change or undo it through specific procedures. The incoming administration can only change or undo a rule published in the Federal Register through a specific rulemaking process, which includes publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking, allowing for public comments, and publishing the final rule with a statement of its basis and purpose. Agencies must develop a factual record to support any changes in policy to regulations. The APA allows agencies to issue rules more quickly through the \"good cause\" exception, skipping notice and comment procedures. Agencies must explicitly state the use of this exception and provide a rationale when publishing the final rule in the Federal Register. The APA allows agencies to issue rules quickly through the \"good cause\" exception, skipping notice and comment procedures. However, Congress did not intend for this exception to be an \"escape clause.\" Judicial review can determine if an agency's use of the good cause exception was authorized. To change or eliminate midnight rules, agencies must follow the APA's notice and comment requirements unless good cause exists. Congress may review and decide on the issuance of \"midnight\" regulations at the end of an administration. Congress has the power to overturn or change regulations issued by agencies, including amending the statutory authority underlying a regulation. The Congressional Review Act allows for expedited procedures to disapprove agency rules, even those issued in a previous session of Congress. Congress can overturn agency rules by regular legislation or add provisions to agency appropriations bills to prohibit certain rules. The Congressional Review Act, enacted in 1996, establishes expedited procedures for Congress to disapprove agency rules, requiring submission of all final rules to Congress and GAO before taking effect. Members of Congress have 60 days to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules within a specific timeframe. Once a joint resolution is passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, the rule is invalidated and cannot be reissued without further authorization. The CRA also sets expedited procedures for the consideration of resolutions of disapproval, limiting debate and amendments. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules within a specific timeframe. If the President vetoes the joint resolution, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote. The CRA has been used to disapprove only one rule since 1996, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November 2000 final rule on ergonomics. The rejection of the ergonomics rule in March 2001 was due to a transition in party control of the presidency. The majority party in Congress, same as the incoming President, disapproved the rule published under the outgoing President. Congress can use the CRA successfully in similar transition-related circumstances. The ergonomics disapproval also highlighted the \"carryover\" provisions in the CRA for reconsidering midnight rules in the next session of Congress. Section 801(d) of the CRA specifies the timeframe for Congress to act on rules before adjourning. The Congressional Review Act allows for rules to be reconsidered in the next session of Congress if adjourned within a specific timeframe. This ensures both chambers have enough time to review rules during the end-of-session \"carryover period.\" The process includes a new initiation period and action period in the Senate, even if no resolution was introduced during the initial session. The Congressional Review Act allows for rules to be reconsidered in the next session of Congress within a specific timeframe. Resolutions of disapproval can be introduced within 60 days of continuous session, and expedited procedures can be used in the Senate. Congress has used provisions in appropriations bills to affect rulemaking, including prohibiting funds for certain rulemaking purposes. Restrictions in appropriations bills can impact agency rulemaking by prohibiting the use of funds for specific rule development or enforcement purposes. Unlike CRA resolutions, these provisions do not nullify existing regulations but can still influence regulatory activity. Final rules in effect remain binding even if funds are restricted for enforcement. Additional limits may apply to influencing agency rulemaking through fund restrictions. Restrictions on the use of funds in appropriations acts may not always effectively prevent regulatory actions, as some agencies receive funding from sources other than congressional appropriations. This can limit the impact of language in appropriations bills aimed at restricting rule development or enforcement by certain federal agencies. State and local governments may have independent funding sources and regulatory requirements similar to federal rules, allowing them to bypass restrictions on federal funds for regulatory actions. Agencies may also find alternative ways to work around limitations on appropriated funds for rulemaking. Several midnight rulemaking bills have been introduced into recent Congresses that corresponded with a presidential transition. Companion bills entitled the Midnight Rule Relief Act of 2012 were introduced by Representative Reid Ribble and Senator Ron Johnson in the 112th Congress. The Midnight Rule Relief Act, introduced by Representative Reid Ribble and Senator Ron Johnson in the 112th Congress, aimed to establish a moratorium on certain types of rules during the transition period between presidential Election Day and inauguration day. It would have prevented outgoing Presidents from proposing or finalizing certain \"major\" rules during this time, with exceptions for rules with statutory or judicial deadlines. The Midnight Rule Relief Act of 2016, introduced by Representative Tim Walberg and Senator Joni Ernst, aimed to prevent certain proposed and final rules from being issued during a \"moratorium period\" following the election of a new President. The House passed H.R. 4612, while S. 2582 was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. If enacted, the Act would establish regulations on rule issuance during presidential transitions. The Midnight Rules Relief Act aims to prevent certain major rules from being issued during a moratorium period after a new President is elected. Exceptions include rules required by statute, those deemed necessary by the President, or deregulatory rules. H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, was introduced by Representative Darrell Issa to make it easier for a new administration to repeal existing rules. H.R. 5982, introduced by Representative Darrell Issa, aims to amend the Congressional Review Act to allow for the disapproval of multiple rules issued by an outgoing administration in the final months. This would streamline the process for Congress to overturn late-issued rules by including them in a single disapproval resolution. The Congressional Review Act may be amended to allow for disapproval of rules issued by outgoing administrations in the final days of session before adjournment."
