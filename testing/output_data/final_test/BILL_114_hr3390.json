Coordination with the Investment Credit for Renewable Chemical Production Facilities is required. The Secretary cannot allocate any credit amount more than 5 years after enactment. The enactment of this section amends the general business credit to include the renewable chemicals production credit. Additionally, the Investment Credit in Lieu of Production Credit is modified to include the renewable chemical production facilities credit.

The Investment Credit for Renewable Chemical Production Facilities is included in the general business credit, with adjustments made to cover these facilities. The Investment Credit for Renewable Chemical Production Facilities allows a 30 percent credit on eligible property in a renewable chemical production facility placed in service during the taxable year.

The criteria for allocating credits for renewable chemicals include reduced dependence on imported feedstocks, technological innovation in production methods, energy efficiency, reduction in greenhouse gases, and commercial viability. The Secretary will publicly disclose the identity of the applicant and the allocated credit amount for renewable chemicals. If a taxpayer elects for a renewable chemical production facility, they cannot claim a credit under section 45S for any renewable chemical produced by that facility. The taxpayer can make an irrevocable election for this section to apply instead of section 45S for the renewable chemical. The Secretary will issue regulations for implementation, and no credit allocation is allowed by the Secretary. The Secretary cannot allocate any credit amount under section 45S to a taxable year beginning more than 5 years after the enactment of this section. Amendments are made to allow credits against the Alternative Minimum Tax, including credits for renewable chemical production facilities. Clerical amendments are also included.
