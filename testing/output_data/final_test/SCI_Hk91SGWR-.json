    "content": "Humans excel at solving complex video games due to their prior knowledge of the world, which aids in efficient decision-making. A study was conducted to analyze the importance of human priors in game-solving. By modifying the game environment to mask different visual information, it was found that removing certain priors significantly slowed down human players. General priors, such as object importance and visual consistency, were crucial for effective gameplay. This contrasts with deep Reinforcement Learning methods, which, while impressive, are still inefficient in comparison. Research is focused on improving the sample efficiency of RL algorithms, but the issue of human prior knowledge in problem-solving is often overlooked. Humans have a wealth of prior knowledge about the world, which aids in solving unfamiliar tasks. A study recruited forty human subjects to play an unfamiliar computer game without instructions, and found that subjects finished it easily. In a study, forty human subjects played a game where they had to move a robot sprite towards a princess. The game was easy and took under 1 minute to complete. Another version of the game with new textures was harder, taking over 2 minutes to finish. The second game lacked cues, making it more challenging for players to understand the goal and spot obstacles. The study involved human subjects playing two versions of a game with different textures. The second game was harder and lacked cues, making it more challenging to understand the goal and spot obstacles. Unlike humans, a curiosity-based RL algorithm was able to solve both games efficiently, showing similar performance in both versions. The study compared the performance of an RL agent in two games, showing similar results. The importance of prior knowledge in problem-solving, especially in video games, was highlighted. The paper presents ablation studies on a specially-designed game environment to investigate the impact of masking out various types of visual information that could be used as priors by human players. Removal of certain prior knowledge led to a significant decrease in human performance, highlighting the importance of prior knowledge in problem-solving, particularly in video games. The study focused on the importance of visual information in problem-solving in video games. A specially-designed platform game was created with key elements like platforms, ladders, enemies, spikes, keys, and doors. Human players had to navigate the game to reach the door while avoiding dangers. Removing certain visual cues led to a decrease in performance, emphasizing the significance of prior knowledge in gaming. The study created different versions of a platform game resembling Montezuma's Revenge to run human experiments. Various entities were re-rendered with alternate textures to mask prior knowledge. Physical properties like gravity were altered, but the underlying structure and reward remained the same to assess the impact on human performance. The study created different versions of a platform game resembling Montezuma's Revenge to run human experiments. 120 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk to play the game without knowledge of the goals or reward structure. Data on player performance, including position, time taken, and number of deaths, was collected to analyze the impact of masking prior knowledge on human performance. Each participant could only play the game once. The study created different versions of a platform game resembling Montezuma's Revenge for human experiments. Participants played each version once, with the original game requiring the agent sprite to reach the key while avoiding obstacles. Results showed that prior knowledge of object semantics significantly impacted player performance. Results in Figure 3 (b) demonstrate that human players perform worse when object semantics are masked, taking more time, experiencing more deaths, and exploring a larger number of states compared to the original game. This suggests that knowledge of semantics plays a crucial role in human performance. In the original game, players showed bias by reaching the key first before the door, while in the version without semantics, only 42 out of 120 participants reached the key first. Human players took longer to reach the door after taking the key in the version without semantics, indicating a lack of understanding of the reward structure. In a study on semantics in a game, participants took longer to solve a game with swapped semantic elements, leading to more deaths and exploration of more states compared to the original version. This suggests that reversing semantic information impacts human gameplay. In a study on semantics in a game, participants took longer to solve a game with swapped semantic elements, leading to more deaths and exploration of more states compared to the original version. Reversing semantic information impacts human gameplay, with distinct colored blocks possibly serving as sub-goals that attract human attention for more efficient exploration. The modified game hides objects under colored blocks, testing the theory that visibly distinct entities are more interesting to explore. The study found that masking the concept of objects in a game led to a significant drop in human performance, with players taking four times longer to solve the game, experiencing six times more deaths, and exploring four times as many game states compared to the original version. Removing only semantic information also had a negative impact on gameplay, but masking the concept of objects caused uncertainty in what to explore next. The study showed that masking the concept of objects in a game significantly impacted human performance, leading to longer completion times and increased exploration. Understanding the concept of objects as sub-goals for exploration was found to be more important than knowledge of semantics. The presence of platforms and ladders in the game provided clear affordances for actions like walking and climbing. In a study, masking affordance information in a game led to longer completion times and increased exploration. Affordance prior was found to be as important as semantics prior in impacting human performance. The presence of platforms and ladders in the game provided clear actions for walking and climbing. In a study, masking affordance information in a game led to longer completion times and increased exploration. The presence of platforms and ladders in the game provided clear actions for walking and climbing. Humans efficiently explore environments using color/texture similarity to identify platforms and ladders. A general prior that things with similar appearance act the same helps in exploring environments with hidden semantics or affordances. Performance was significantly worse when platforms and ladders did not have the same visual signature. In a study, masking affordance information in a game led to longer completion times and increased exploration. Visual similarity is the second most important prior used by humans in gameplay after the knowledge of directing exploration towards objects. The presence of platforms and ladders in the game provided clear actions for walking and climbing. Humans efficiently explore environments using color/texture similarity to identify platforms and ladders. Performance was significantly worse when platforms and ladders did not have the same visual signature. The study found that masking affordance information in a game led to longer completion times and increased exploration. Visual similarity is a key factor in gameplay, with humans efficiently using color/texture similarity to identify platforms and ladders. The analysis of prior knowledge used by humans in interpreting the visual structure of the game confirmed the hypothesis that understanding the visual structure is crucial for gameplay. The study tested the importance of prior knowledge in gameplay by creating a version of the game where ladders had to be climbed using alternating key presses. This challenged players who relied on visual cues to infer ladder properties, showing the critical role of understanding visual structure for gameplay. The study created a game where all object information was hidden, resulting in players struggling with increased time to solve the game and a higher number of deaths. The exploration trajectory of players became almost random, with a significant increase in unique states visited. The study designed a challenging game with hidden object information, leading to a significant increase in unique states visited by players. High dropout rates prompted a pay increase to $2.25 to retain participants. Many players resorted to memorization to solve the game, as prior knowledge about physics and motor control was not helpful due to the game's design. A harder game was also created to push the limits of human ability. The study created a challenging game with hidden object information, leading to increased unique states visited by players. The game reversed gravity and remapped key presses, making it difficult even for the creators. This highlighted the importance of incorporating prior knowledge in artificial agents to improve performance. Studies in developmental psychology suggest ways to acquire such priors. Studies in developmental psychology suggest that infants as young as 2 months old possess a primitive notion of objects and expect them to move as connected wholes. By 3-5 months, infants start categorizing objects based on similarity. The ability to recognize individual objects emerges around 18-24 months old. The ability to distinguish walkable steps from cliffs emerges around 18 months old. Infants as young as 18 months old gradually learn about visual similarity, object semantics, and affordances. The order in which infants increase their knowledge matches the importance of different object priors. Prior knowledge about objects, intuitive physics, and motor control are important when approaching a new task. In the context of human gameplay, the importance of prior knowledge, such as intuitive physics and motor control, was explored. Participants faced challenges when gravity was reversed in a game, taking longer to solve it with more deaths and states explored compared to the original version. In a game where key controls were reversed, participants took longer to solve it with more deaths and states explored compared to the original version. The average time taken was close to 3 minutes, and the number of deaths and states explored was significantly larger than the original version. The study manipulated visual priors in the game while keeping the game and reward structure the same. The performance of players was similar when gravity and key controls were reversed, with no significant difference. The visual complexity of the modified games may have changed, but the study investigated the performance of an RL agent to control for this confound. If RL agents are not affected by the game manipulations, it suggests that prior knowledge does not impact their performance. The study systematically created different versions of the game to ablate semantics and concepts like object, affordance, and similarity. The game used for human experiments was more complex than the one used for RL experiments due to the latter being too challenging for state-of-the-art RL agents. Despite being simpler, the game remained non-trivial for an RL agent. The study created various game versions to remove semantics and concepts like objects, affordances, and similarity. Despite the game's complexity, RL agents were not significantly affected by these changes, suggesting that human performance drops were due to masking priors rather than visual complexity. The RL agent's performance worsens when visual similarity is masked, taking twice as many interactions to complete the game. This is attributed to convolutional neural networks imposing the prior of visual similarity. Prior knowledge is crucial for efficient exploration in sparse reward environments, highlighting the importance of learning from human cognition. In sparse reward environments, prior knowledge can help humans explore efficiently but may lead to suboptimal outcomes. For example, in a game with hidden rewards, human players often focus on the princess goal, missing out on additional rewards. In contrast, random agents can achieve higher rewards by exploring more. While incorporating prior knowledge in RL agents has benefits, challenges in exploration should also be considered. Future research in RL agents should focus on challenges related to under-constrained exploration in different settings. Humans have intuitive psychology and video game priors that influence gameplay, such as the correlation between moving up and progress. Developing sample-efficient RL algorithms and incorporating prior knowledge will be key areas of advancement in the field. Our work quantifies the importance of human priors in solving video games and highlights the need to incorporate prior knowledge in designing RL agents. The experimental platform of video games, available in open-source, can serve as a benchmark for studying human priors and different mechanisms for enhancing RL agents."
