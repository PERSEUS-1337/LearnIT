    "content": "Policy makers and analysts have been exploring ways to help unemployment compensation recipients return to work faster. The recent recession caused a significant increase in long-term unemployment, prompting congressional interest in initiatives to expedite reemployment. This report examines current and past UC system projects aimed at reducing long-term unemployment. Various UI programs offer benefits to eligible workers, with the regular UC program providing up to 26 weeks of income support in most states. The Extended Benefit program, jointly funded by federal and state governments, extends UC benefits under certain economic conditions. The UC program, jointly funded by federal and state governments, provides income support to unemployed workers. Various federal and state programs, including the EUC08 program, offer benefits to eligible workers. The authorization for the EUC08 program ends on December 28, 2013. The UC program, funded by federal and state taxes, provides benefits to involuntarily unemployed workers who meet eligibility rules. It does not cover the self-employed, those unable to work, or those without recent earnings history. States disqualify claimants for various reasons like inability to work, quitting without cause, job-related misconduct, or refusal to work. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides benefits to involuntarily unemployed workers who meet eligibility rules. Claimants must have recent earnings to qualify and be actively searching for work. Weekly benefit amounts vary by state, with an average of just over $300 in 2012. Regular UC benefits are available for up to 26 weeks, with an average duration of just over 17 weeks in 2012. In January 2013, about 2.7 million unemployed workers were receiving regular UC benefits. The EB program, established in 1970, extends UC benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. It is triggered by specific unemployment rates, with federal and state financing. During the 2007-2009 recession, up to 34 states had active EB programs. Currently, only Alaska has an active EB program. The EUC08 program was created in 2008 to extend unemployment compensation during economic slowdowns. The EUC08 program was administered by State UC agencies during an economic slowdown, providing up to 99 weeks of benefits to eligible unemployed workers. All tiers of EUC08 benefits expired by January 1, 2014, as the UC program is designed to offer temporary income support and not cover the entire spell of unemployment for every recipient. The EB program, established in 1970, extends UC benefits at the state level based on economic conditions, with only Alaska currently having an active EB program. Initially, states set the maximum duration of unemployment benefits between 12 and 20 weeks, with 16 weeks being the most common. By the early 1960s, most states had increased the maximum duration to 26 weeks. Each state sets its own rules for how long benefits can be collected, with some states providing uniform durations for all claimants who meet qualifying-wage requirements. By 2013, eight states that had provided benefits for up to 26 weeks acted to decrease their maximum benefit durations. Several states decreased their maximum unemployment benefit durations. Arkansas reduced it to 25 weeks, Florida to a variable duration between 12 and 23 weeks, Georgia to a variable duration between 14 and 20 weeks, Illinois to 25 weeks, Michigan to 20 weeks, Missouri to 20 weeks, and North Carolina to a variable duration between 12 and 20 weeks. Several states, including South Carolina, decreased their maximum unemployment benefit durations to 20 weeks. Decisions on benefit duration reflect tradeoffs between program goals and constraints, such as providing temporary income support to workers while balancing program costs. Longer benefit durations may also prolong unemployment by reducing the incentive to quickly return to work. The Unemployment Insurance (UC) benefits provide temporary income support to job-seekers, allowing them to take time to find better job opportunities. There is no consensus on the impact of extending UC benefits on the length of unemployment. Some studies suggest that extending UC benefits by 13 weeks could increase the average duration of benefit receipt by up to 2.5 weeks. The impact of additional weeks of benefits on unemployment duration may vary based on the state of the labor market and the economy. In a weak economy, the impact may be smaller due to fewer job opportunities, while in a strong economy, the impact may be larger. Studies focus on unemployed workers receiving benefits or potentially eligible workers. The program's effects could also spill over to affect ineligible unemployed workers. The exhaustion rate and average duration of receipt are key measures used to assess the performance of the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program. The exhaustion rate estimates the percentage of recipients who use up their benefits, calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. This information is crucial in understanding how well the program is functioning and its impact on job-seekers, including those who are not eligible for benefits. The exhaustion rate for the 12-month period ending in December 2012 is important for assessing the adequacy of the UC program in providing income support for unemployed workers. There has been a decline in program adequacy since the 1970s, with one in three recipients exhausting their benefits by the late 1990s. In 2006 and 2007, over 35% of UC recipients exhausted their benefits despite a low unemployment rate. The exhaustion rate of UC recipients has been rising over the decades, with over 35% exhausting their benefits in 2006 and 2007 despite a low unemployment rate. The average duration of receiving benefits also increased before the recent recession, indicating higher program costs as recipients collect benefits for longer periods. During the recent recession, the average duration of unemployment benefits was 13 weeks, down from 15 weeks before the recession. Over half of UC recipients exhausted their benefits in 2009 and 2010, with the average duration increasing to 19 weeks. The availability of EUC08 and EB benefits helped mitigate the economic impact on recipients and their communities, stimulating demand as recipients used the income to make purchases. The EUC08 and EB programs provided benefits to about 6 million individuals at their peak in early 2010. The increased availability of benefits during the recession led to a rise in the exhaustion rate and average duration of receipt of regular UC benefits. The long-term trends in increased exhaustion rate and duration were evident before the recession, possibly due to changes in the UC program itself. The average weekly unemployment benefit decreased from 36% to 34% of average weekly earnings, with nonwage compensation like health insurance becoming more expensive. Benefits also became subject to income taxation in 1979. Despite the reduced generosity of UC benefits, coverage was expanded to include more types of unemployed workers. The 2009 stimulus package incentivized states to update their programs to include recent work history and optional provisions for part-time job-seekers, voluntary separations, training programs, and dependents' allowances. The 2009 stimulus package incentivized states to update their unemployment compensation (UC) programs by including recent work history and optional provisions for part-time job-seekers, voluntary separations, training programs, and dependents' allowances. This broadened eligibility to cover more types of unemployed workers, with 38 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands qualifying for modernization incentive payments. Additionally, older workers who lose their jobs no longer have UC benefits offset by Social Security benefits, with only 4 states and the Virgin Islands still offsetting at least 50% of social security payments by 2012. The increase in duration of unemployment benefits may not solely be attributed to changes in the UC program itself. Factors such as higher non-wage income for older workers, shift to remote filing methods, and increases in unemployment duration for non-recipients suggest other influences at play. For instance, between 1973 and 2007, there was a significant rise in long-term unemployment among teenagers, voluntary job leavers, reentrants, and new entrants, who may not have been eligible for UC benefits. The increase in unemployment benefit duration is influenced by various factors, including changes in the UC program. Research shows that states with longer potential benefit durations have lower exhaustion rates. As states reduce available benefit weeks, the exhaustion rate is likely to increase. Broadening eligibility rules may lead to more individuals qualifying for lower benefit durations and exhausting benefits sooner. Researchers have developed theories to explain the increased duration of unemployment, with no consensus emerging. One factor contributing to longer unemployment benefit receipt is the trend of employers permanently terminating workers instead of temporarily laying them off. This shift, attributed to changes in the industrial mix and employers' practices, results in longer reemployment times for workers no longer attached to an employer. The shift towards permanent separations in employment has led to longer durations of unemployment benefit receipt. The aging of the baby boom generation has also contributed to increased durations in the labor force. Individuals aged 55 and older will make up most of the labor force growth between 2010 and 2020. Older workers who become unemployed face challenges in finding new jobs, with studies showing they take longer to find employment, earn less, and are more likely to be permanently separated from their previous employer. Older workers who become unemployed face challenges in finding new jobs, earning substantially less than their previous job. Job dislocation has a greater impact on earnings for older workers compared to younger workers, leading to early withdrawal from the labor market. The increase in the duration of unemployment benefits could be due to a mismatch between job seekers and employers, resulting in structural unemployment. The demand for more educated workers has been rising, leading to an increase in the labor force. A growing gap between job seekers' skills and the skills demanded could increase durations of unemployment. Recent research suggests that structural unemployment may explain a significant portion of the increase in the unemployment rate between 2007 and 2010. Long spells of unemployment will continue to be a serious problem even as the labor market improves. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the annual unemployment rate will remain above 6% until 2017, with long spells of unemployment continuing to be a serious issue for many Unemployment Compensation recipients. Despite a relatively low unemployment rate in 2007, nearly 36% of UC recipients exhausted their benefits after an average of 15 weeks. In FY2018, it is forecasted that 8.0 million UC first payments will be made, with recipients receiving an average of $346 per week for 15 weeks, totaling over $41 billion in regular benefits. The exhaustion rate of Unemployment Compensation recipients is projected to remain at or above 40% through 2018. The aging labor force and changes in UC benefits duration are expected to make it difficult for many recipients to quickly return to work. The duration of compensated unemployment in certain states is increasing, leading to more recipients exhausting their benefits. Efforts to expedite the return to work have been a focus for researchers and policymakers, especially after the recent recession. Various approaches have been proposed to shorten the duration of UC receipt and reduce exhaustions, categorized by the primary mechanism to speed up the return to work. Congress may consider additional measures to address this issue. The approach to expedite the return to work for UC recipients includes enforcing job search requirements, providing job search assistance, increasing job search payoff, offering incentives to employers, and improving employability through education and retraining. States now have requirements for the unemployed to actively seek work due to the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires states to enforce job search requirements for unemployment compensation eligibility. The Employment Service, established by the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, assists individuals in finding employment through various services without fees. The Employment Service (ES) provides career counseling, job search workshops, labor market information, and referral to job openings. ES offers services through self-service, facilitated self-help, and staff-assisted tiers. ES offices also administer the UC work test requirements to ensure claimants are able to work, available, and actively seeking work. The relationship between the UC program and ES, as well as job-search assistance rules, varies across states and over time. The Employment Service (ES) has seen a decline in funding and reduced assistance for UC recipients over time. A study found that currently only 3 to 4 percent of ES registrants receive employment counseling, compared to 20 percent in the 1960s. Funding for ES peaked in 1995 at $840 million, falling to $700 million in 2008, but received a temporary increase with the enactment of ARRA in 2009. The ARRA in 2009 provided $400 million in additional funds for UC recipients, with most states processing UC applications by phone or computer. A study showed a shift from in-person to remote claims over the years. Experiments in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated the effectiveness of enforcing job search requirements and providing job-search assistance. In a 1983 experiment in Charleston, South Carolina, UC claimants were required to report to an ES office for placement services, resulting in a reduction in benefits received. Similar experiments in Tacoma, Washington (1986-1987) and Maryland (1994) also showed potential for reducing UC expenditures through requirements and services. Maryland (1994) showed that strengthening work tests can reduce UC expenditures, with recipients opting out of required services. The Tacoma experiment tested relaxing the work test, leading to longer UC receipt durations. Various methods for enforcing job search requirements and providing assistance have been implemented, including collaboration between UC programs and ES, and the use of Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments. The ES has been enforcing job search requirements and offering free job search assistance since the inception of the UC program in 1935. One approach Congress may consider is increasing grants for ES activities to reduce UC receipt duration. States must identify UC claimants likely to exhaust benefits through Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services programs. The Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) program aims to refer UC claimants to reemployment services using existing state and federal funding. A multi-state evaluation found that WPRS effectively reduced the duration of UC receipt but did not significantly increase employment and earnings. The Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) program effectively reduced the duration of UC receipt for claimants with high profiling scores. A year later, their employment and earnings levels were similar to a comparison group. States varied in the amount of services provided, with those offering more services seeing larger impacts on UC receipt. Kentucky's program showed significant effects in reducing unemployment duration. The Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) program reduced UC receipt duration for claimants with high profiling scores. Recipients opted to exit UC rather than comply with participation requirements. Larger impacts in Kentucky were due to differences in sampling methods. Budget constraints limited the services provided, potentially affecting the deterrent effect. Budget constraints have limited services for claimants in the Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) program. Only a small percentage of UC recipients were referred to services, with minimal federal funding allocated to the program. In 2009, $250 million in Reemployment Service (RES) Grants was provided as part of ARRA stimulus funding. State agencies were instructed to use the funds for job search assistance, counseling, testing, and upgrading IT systems to help identify claimants likely to exhaust UC benefits. NASWA is conducting a study on these activities. The NASWA is studying how states used RES grants and other ARRA-funded activities for workforce development. States prioritized expanding services for claimants, such as job-search workshops and career counseling. Concerns arose about sustainability after funds ran out, as many staff hired were temporary workers. Many state agencies hired temporary workers for RES activities, with uncertainty about retention. Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments (REAs) involve in-person interviews with UC claimants to ensure compliance with eligibility rules and provide employment assistance. REAs replaced the previous Eligibility Review Program, with DOL awarding grants to states for this purpose. In May 2012, DOL awarded $65.5 million in grants to 40 states, DC, and Puerto Rico for REAs to help job seekers return to work while maintaining UI system integrity. REAs involve in-person assessments, re-employment plans, labor market info, eligibility reviews, and referrals to services. A DOL-funded evaluation in Minnesota in 2005 showed that REAs can save money and reduce unemployment duration. The Minnesota experiment involved UC claimants from the middle third of profiled claimants, resulting in reduced benefit weeks, lower exhaustion rates, and increased return-to-work rates. However, no significant impacts were found in North Dakota. The impacts of the REA initiative in seven other states could not be assessed due to data acquisition difficulties. A subsequent evaluation in Florida, Idaho, Illinois, and Nevada showed reductions in UC exhaustions in three states, with cost savings exceeding program expenses. No impact was found in Illinois due to inconsistent implementation. The Illinois REA program was inconsistently implemented and limited to claimants with high-demand skills. Nevada had the largest estimated savings, with claimants receiving three fewer weeks of benefits. A follow-up study commissioned by the DOL found that Nevada's program was more effective in saving UC benefits and helping claimants find employment earlier. Nevada's success may be attributed to providing both REAs and RES by the same staff. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required EUC08 claimants to actively search for work appropriate to their skill level, maintain a record of job search activities, and participate in reemployment services. States were also required to provide reemployment and eligibility assessments to certain claimants, with federal funding provided for those who receive assessments. Increasing the payoff for UC recipients is another approach to expedite their return to work. Increasing the payoff for UC recipients is another approach to expedite their return to work. This can be done through reemployment bonuses, wage insurance, and self-employment assistance, which incentivize recipients to search for work more intensively or accept job offers sooner. For example, a reemployment bonus could provide UC recipients with a bonus equal to four times their weekly benefits if they find a new job within a specified timeframe. Such initiatives aim to encourage recipients to return to work sooner. Legislative proposals in the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations aimed to offer reemployment bonuses to eligible UC recipients to incentivize job search and find employment sooner. Under President Clinton's proposed Reemployment Act of 1994, states could use UC funds to provide bonuses to claimants who found full-time employment within 12 weeks of claiming benefits and retained the job for at least four months. Bonuses could not exceed four times the weekly benefit amount, and eligibility was for individuals likely to exhaust their entitlement. President George Bush's 2003 economic stimulus package introduced Personal Reemployment Accounts (PRAs) for UC recipients to receive cash bonuses and purchase employment-related services. The purpose was to give individuals likely to exhaust their UC benefits a choice in reemployment services and incentivize quicker job placement with a bonus equal to their PRA balance upon finding new employment. Recipients had to use funds for some services that were previously free, like training. These proposals were influenced by experiments in several states. Experiments in the 1980s evaluated reemployment bonus programs in several states, finding that offering bonuses to Unemployment Compensation (UC) recipients, along with job-search assistance, shortened benefit receipt. Bonuses ranged from 3 to 10 times the weekly benefit amount, with recipients given 3 to 13 weeks to find a new job. While the inducements did reduce UC receipt duration, the cost of bonuses was not always offset. The largest impact was seen in Illinois. The reemployment bonus programs in the 1980s evaluated in several states showed that offering bonuses to Unemployment Compensation (UC) recipients, along with job-search assistance, shortened benefit receipt. The largest impact was in Illinois, where claimants who found a job within 11 weeks and kept it for four months were eligible for a $500 bonus, resulting in a one-week shorter duration compared to the control group. However, there were concerns about potential displacement and entry effects. Targeting eligibility for bonuses towards UC claimants with an above-average likelihood of exhausting their benefits was also suggested. Targeting bonuses towards UC claimants likely to exhaust benefits could increase effectiveness. Reanalyzing reemployment bonus experiments in Pennsylvania and Washington showed restricting offers to high-risk claimants would have a greater impact. The Clinton Administration's proposal closely followed this design, aiming to save on UC payments by offering bonuses to profiled recipients likely to exhaust benefits. The Bush Administration's proposal combined bonuses with reemployment services into one account, differing from previous experiments. The size of the bonus with the PRA would be based on the remaining balance after paying for employment services. Offering \"wage insurance\" could also incentivize UC recipients to return to work more rapidly. Wage insurance subsidizes the wage difference for workers who experience a loss, compensating for financial losses from job abolishment. It helps workers facing permanent earnings reduction, especially those with long-term job tenure. Wage insurance aims to compensate workers for a portion of their loss in earnings, encouraging them to accept lower-paying jobs they might have been reluctant to take. However, opponents argue that it may subsidize downward mobility and only benefit workers who experience a wage reduction, excluding those who lose low-paying jobs. Despite proposals for wage insurance, implementation has been limited, with past demonstration projects not being carried out due to challenges in securing funding. Since 2002, wage insurance has been offered to workers aged 50 or older certified for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits. The program, now called Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), provides a wage supplement of up to $10,000 over two years for workers who accept lower-paying jobs. In 2011, $40 million was paid to over 6,100 participants. President Obama's American Jobs Act proposed a \"Reemployment NOW\" program with $4 billion in funding for state-designed projects. The \"Reemployment NOW\" program proposed $4 billion in funding for state-designed activities to assist eligible individuals in finding reemployment. States could provide an income supplement to EUC08 claimants who secure reemployment at a lower wage, with the benefit level determined by the states. Wage insurance payments would be limited to two years for individuals aged 50 or older earning up to $50,000 per year from reemployment. Wage insurance, like the \"Reemployment NOW\" program, aims to assist individuals in finding reemployment by providing an earnings supplement for those who secure lower-paying jobs. However, limited information is available on its effectiveness in reducing unemployment duration. A version of wage insurance tested in Canada had little impact on job search speed but helped compensate workers for wage losses. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program, created in 1993 and made permanent in 1998, helps unemployed individuals start their own businesses by providing temporary income support and entrepreneurial training. It aims to remove barriers to self-employment for those receiving unemployment benefits. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program provides income support and entrepreneurial training for unemployed individuals looking to start their own businesses. It waives state work search requirements for full-time entrepreneurs and offers a weekly allowance equivalent to regular unemployment benefits. The program aims to help participants become reemployed sooner and reduce their reliance on unemployment benefits in the future. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program aims to help unemployed individuals start their own businesses, reducing their reliance on unemployment benefits. Based on successful pilot programs in Massachusetts and Washington, the SEA program has been found to significantly decrease benefit receipt and increase total earnings for participants. Currently, only a few states have active SEA programs for UC claimants. The Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) program helps unemployed individuals start businesses, reducing reliance on unemployment benefits. Participation in SEA programs in states like New York ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 individuals per year. SEA programs must be budget neutral and funded separately from regular UC benefits. State officials face challenges in operating SEA programs, such as reliance on profiling systems to identify eligible participants. Challenges in the SEA program include reliance on profiling systems to identify eligible participants, lack of funds for entrepreneurial training, limited capacity, and difficulty in monitoring long-term effectiveness. Suggestions for program expansion include having the federal government pay SEA benefits, providing stronger incentives for states to use funds for entrepreneurial training, and increasing the payoff to potential employers to hire SEA participants. However, self-employment may not be an attractive option for many UC recipients. Employers may discriminate against job applicants based on their employment status, preferring those who are currently working. Long-term unemployment can stigmatize workers and lead employers to believe their skills have deteriorated. This can result in reluctance to hire the long-term unemployed. The American Jobs Act proposed by President Obama in 2011 aimed to establish the Fair Employment Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination against the unemployed in job advertising and hiring practices. Modeled after Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the act would cover most public and private employers, except those with fewer than 15 employees. The Fair Employment Opportunity Act proposed in the American Jobs Act aims to prevent discrimination against the unemployed in job advertising and hiring practices. Covered employers would be prohibited from publishing ads stating that unemployed individuals are not qualified or refusing to consider them for employment. Enforcing the legislation may be challenging, as subtle forms of discrimination can be harder to prove for job-seekers compared to those already employed. Recent research suggests that age discrimination legislation can help older workers find reemployment. Providing subsidies to employers for hiring unemployed workers, through tax credits, has been a focus in recent years. This approach aims to reduce costs for employers and encourage the employment of certain groups of workers. Tax credits have not been specifically designed to promote the employment of unemployed individuals, except for the now-expired credits in the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (HIRE) of 2010 and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for unemployed veterans. Congress may consider renewing expired targeted tax credits or creating new ones. Under HIRE, employers hiring previously unemployed workers could be exempted from Social Security taxes and eligible for a tax credit if they retained the workers for at least one year. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a non-refundable tax credit for employers who hire individuals from certain targeted groups. It replaced the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit in 1996 and provided up to a $1,000 tax credit for hiring eligible individuals. Employees needed to certify that they had not been employed for more than 40 hours during a 60-day period to qualify, regardless of whether they had been actively seeking work. New entrants to the labor force and individuals actively seeking work could qualify for the credit. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provides federal income tax credits for hiring individuals from eligible groups, such as families receiving TANF benefits and unemployed veterans. The credit is 40% of the first-year wages paid, up to a maximum amount of $6,000 for most qualified individuals. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 expanded the targeted group for qualified unemployed veterans and made the WOTC refundable for certain non-profit employers. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 expanded the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for hiring unemployed veterans, offering tax credits for employers who hire individuals with periods of unemployment. The act allowed for credits of 25% or 40% of first-year wages based on the hours worked, with larger credits for veterans unemployed for longer periods. Additionally, the WOTC could be claimed for qualified veterans starting work before January 1, 2014. Several bills in the 112th Congress aimed to provide tax incentives for hiring unemployed workers. The Act of 2011 proposed adding long-term unemployed individuals as a targeted group for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). Employers could claim a 40% tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages for those hired and retained for at least 400 hours. Other bills in the 112th Congress aimed to expand WOTC eligibility to include individuals who exhausted unemployment benefits and provide temporary tax credits for small businesses hiring the unemployed. The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit aimed to provide credit for small businesses hiring unemployed individuals in high-unemployment areas. However, analysis showed that most jobs filled with the credit would have been filled anyway, raising questions about its effectiveness in creating new jobs. Despite reducing the cost of employing targeted individuals, there were concerns about a stigmatizing effect among employers. The government's offer of a subsidy for hiring unemployed individuals raised concerns about potential stigma among employers. Providing a tax credit for hiring individuals who were unemployed or UC recipients may not have a significant impact, as past experiments showed low participation. Lawmakers would need to consider the cost, windfalls, and potential spillover effects of such a tax credit. The GeorgiaWorks program, initiated in 2003, offers employers in Georgia the opportunity to train and assess UC recipients at no cost, potentially reducing stigma and increasing employment opportunities. President Obama highlighted this program in his 2011 jobs plan address. The GeorgiaWorks program allows UC recipients to train with potential employers for up to 24 hours per week for eight weeks, receiving a training stipend and workers compensation. Participation grew rapidly from 2003 to 2009 but was reduced in size and scope in 2011 under new administration, with eligibility restricted to UC recipients and stipend reduced to $240. The GeorgiaWorks program eligibility was restricted to UC recipients, and the stipend was reduced from $600 to $240. The new labor commissioner expressed concerns about spending and low training and hiring rates. Data showed that 40% of participants were placed in clerical jobs, with only 35% being hired by their placement employer. Supporters and opponents debate the program's effectiveness in providing meaningful employment opportunities. In 2010, Texas launched the Texas Back-to-Work Initiative (TBTW) providing up to $2,000 subsidy to employers for hiring eligible first-time UC claimants. Employers must offer at least 30 hours of work per week and retain the claimant for 120 days to qualify for the full subsidy. Over 25,000 individuals were placed in jobs through this program by April 2012. In 2010, New Hampshire started the Return to Work Initiative, allowing employers to train UC claimants for up to six weeks. Participants receive UC benefits and must search for work. In 2011, Connecticut's The WorkPlace launched Platform to Employment (P2E) to boost employment. The WorkPlace's Platform to Employment (P2E) pilot program in southwestern Connecticut offers a five-week preparatory program for long-term unemployed individuals, followed by an eight-week trial placement with employers. The program is expanding to 10 cities in 2013, focusing on individuals over 50 or military veterans. Utah's Small Business Bridge Program provides subsidies to small businesses hiring workers, with amounts based on wages paid. In 2012, Wisconsin implemented the Wisconsin Workers Win (W3) pilot program, offering UC recipients a voluntary six-week placement with employers, working 20-24 hours per week. Employers provide training and supervision, with recipients receiving UC and a $75 weekly stipend. Up to 500 UC recipients are expected to participate in the program during its first year. The 112th Congress incorporated similar ideas into P.L. 112-96. The 112th Congress incorporated ideas from the Wisconsin Workers Win (W3) pilot program into P.L. 112-96, which allows up to 10 states to create demonstration projects to help UC recipients return to work through short-term wage subsidies. These projects can provide subsidies for employer-provided training or direct reimbursement to employers who hire UC recipients. The projects must last between one and three years, be completed by the end of 2015, and include an evaluation of their impact on participants' skills. Short-time compensation (STC), also known as work sharing, provides pro-rated unemployment benefits to workers with reduced hours instead of layoffs. STC aims to incentivize employers to retain workers during economic downturns, preserving jobs and reducing unemployment. No state demonstration project has been approved as of the publication date of this report. Short-time compensation (STC) programs can help preserve jobs during economic downturns by allowing firms to reduce work hours instead of laying off workers. This benefits both employers, who can avoid costs associated with hiring and training new workers, and employees, who receive pro-rated unemployment benefits while working reduced hours. Short-time compensation (STC) programs allow workers to receive about 90% of their full-time wages for working four days a week, reducing the impact of job losses during economic downturns. However, STC programs have not been widely adopted in the United States, with only about 1.5% peak usage during the recent recession. Expansion of the program to more states and increased participation from firms and workers is necessary for STC to be an effective tool in the future. During the recent recession, only about 1.5% of UC recipients in the United States participated in STC programs, which accounted for less than 0.1% of the U.S. labor force. In comparison, several European nations and Japan had higher participation rates in STC programs, possibly due to institutional and cultural differences. The OECD countries played a significant role in preventing unemployment during the 2008-09 crisis, but some support could have funded unnecessary jobs. As economies recover, STC programs may hinder restructuring efforts. Employers may opt out of the program if they plan layoffs or if production technologies make it difficult to shorten work weeks. STC payments to employees may be considered regular UC benefits for firms. Employers may pay the full cost of STC payments, similar to layoffs. Workers may be hesitant due to STC payments affecting their future benefits. Lack of employer awareness hinders STC program participation in some states. Training in a state with high UC claimant participation in STC program attributes success to active promotion. Many states have not aggressively marketed STC programs, leading to concerns about administrative costs and paper-based processes. STC may increase processing costs for state agencies compared to layoffs. efforts are being made to expand STC program usage. The legislation aims to promote the use of Short-Time Compensation (STC) as an alternative to layoffs by providing federal financing for STC benefits and incentives for states to adopt STC programs. Employers would submit STC plans for approval, and eligible workers would receive prorated unemployment compensation while participating in state-approved training. Employers would need to meet work availability requirements for their workweek. Some workers may need new skills to return to work, especially those in declining industries. Long spells of unemployment can be used to develop new skills. U.S. DOL announced grants for states to improve Short-Time Compensation programs. Employers must certify continued benefits for employees in the program. Opportunities for developing new skills arise from structural changes. Congressional interests in training include eligibility rules for receiving Unemployment Compensation (UC) while in training and funding for retraining displaced workers. States have flexibility in setting rules for UC benefits during training, but federal law does not specify approval criteria. Congress encouraged states to expand training opportunities in 2009. In 2009, Congress encouraged states to expand support for training for UC recipients through unemployment modernization incentive provisions in ARRA. States could qualify for incentive payments by amending UC legislation to provide extended compensation to recipients in qualifying training programs. Recipients could continue receiving benefits for at least 26 weeks if enrolled in a state-approved training program or preparing for a high-demand occupation. Incentive payments ended in September 2011. State legislators had to make decisions regarding this provision. The incentive payments for training UC recipients ended in September 2011, and 15 states along with the District of Columbia participated. The effects of this provision have not been evaluated yet. Lawmakers may consider offering additional incentives for retraining opportunities and modifying existing programs. The Expanding Training Opportunities Act of 2012 aimed to expand approved training types for UC recipients. The federal government has funded training and education programs to help unemployed workers acquire new skills, such as industry-recognized certificates or degrees. These programs, including those authorized by the Workforce Investment Act and Pell grants, aim to increase employment opportunities and earnings. While participation in these programs may delay reemployment, they are investments intended to reduce long-term unemployment. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) is a federal program supporting workforce development activities, job search assistance, career development, and job training through One-Stop career centers. WIA programs have been funded through annual appropriations since FY2003, with about $1.2 billion appropriated for dislocated worker activities in FY2012. Unemployed individuals are generally eligible for these programs to help them acquire new skills and increase employment opportunities. Worker activities under Title I of WIA for FY2012 focus on providing dislocated workers with employment placement services. Eligible individuals must be unemployed, attached to the workforce, and unlikely to return to their previous industry. WIA offers core services like workforce information and more intensive assistance such as individual employment plans and retraining support through vouchers for education and training providers. Retraining support through WIA is offered after core and intensive services are deemed insufficient for employment. Selective retraining can be effective if appropriate for the participant's interests and abilities. Heinrich's evaluation of WIA program was based on data from 60,000 displaced workers in 12 states. Researchers evaluated the impact of the WIA program on 60,000 displaced workers in 12 states. 20,000 participants received retraining assistance while the rest received counseling and job search services. The study found that participants increased their earnings with WIA, but the benefits varied across states and services. However, there was little evidence that training produced substantial benefits, as employment and earnings did not significantly improve compared to those who only received non-training services. The researchers evaluated the impacts of WIA activities on displaced workers, using administrative data to track employment and earnings. Significant gains were found for participants in WIA activities, with training activities showing smaller gains compared to non-training services. Displaced workers who received non-training services showed significant gains in employment and earnings. Caution is advised in interpreting these estimates due to potential subtle differences between groups. Ralph E. Smith, Consultant in Economics, authored the report.
