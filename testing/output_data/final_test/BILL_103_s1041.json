    "content": "Section 1 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the immunization of children. The new section in the Public Health Service Act allows State agencies to identify and vaccinate infants and children at increased risk due to missing vaccinations. State agencies may require parents or legal guardians to submit immunization records or a statement from a healthcare provider certifying that the child has received appropriate vaccinations. State agencies have the option to adjust benefits delivery schedules or require more clinic visits for children who have not received all necessary vaccinations. State agencies may require more frequent clinic visits for children at higher medical risk due to incomplete vaccinations. Prerequisites include notifying parents, educating them on vaccination importance, and providing information on vaccination availability. State agencies determine appropriate vaccinations for infants and children based on standards set by the Secretary, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or the American Academy of Pediatrics. Exemptions from vaccination requirements are granted based on state laws applicable to school attendance. The State agency may use funding for nutrition services to implement immunization requirements for children in the program. The Secretary can provide grants to States for vaccination assistance at local offices without healthcare providers. The Secretary will award grants based on need as shown in the State's application. $6,000,000 is authorized for each of fiscal years 1993 and 1994."
