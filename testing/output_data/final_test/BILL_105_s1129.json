    "content": "The \"Safe Havens for Children Act of 1997\" aims to protect children and victims of domestic violence during parent-child visitation and exchanges by providing safe havens and promoting continuity and stability. Congress finds that family violence continues even after legal separation, with custody disputes more common in cases of domestic violence. Violence often escalates post-separation, with abusive fathers seeking sole custody and using legal actions to threaten mothers. Children in homes where mothers are abused often witness the violence, leading to potential behavioral issues such as aggression, fearfulness, and anxiety. Perpetrators may use children as pawns to control the abused party and escalate violence during separation or divorce, with threats of kidnapping being a common tactic. During separation or divorce, women and children face an increased risk of violence. Men who abuse their partners often also abuse their children. The majority of domestic assaults reported to law enforcement occur after the couple separates. In cases of spousal homicide, over half of the male defendants were separated from their victims. Battered women often seek emergency medical services after separation. The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges includes visitation centers in their Model Code on Domestic and Family Violence. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION CENTERS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants to States for establishing supervised visitation centers to facilitate visitation for families, with considerations for the number of families served, underserved populations, and applicant demonstration.

The Secretary will submit a report to Congress annually, detailing the number of individuals served and turned away for supervised visitation or visitation exchange services, categorized by State and presenting problems such as domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual assault. Additionally, the report will include the number of supervised visitations or visitation exchanges ordered during custody. The report to Congress will include details on supervised visitation services, such as visitation exchanges ordered during custody determinations, protection of children and abused partners during visitations, safety and security issues at visitation centers, and the number of parental abduction cases in judicial districts using supervised visitation services. The report to Congress will include details on supervised visitation services, such as visitation exchanges ordered during custody determinations, protection of children and abused partners, safety and security issues at visitation centers, and parental abduction cases in judicial districts. Entities receiving grants must have agreements with courts, child protection services, and domestic violence agencies to evaluate supervised visitation centers. Funding of $65,000,000 from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund will be available for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements under the Act for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. At least 90 percent of the funds will be used for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements, disbursed through the Department of Health and Human Services' regional offices."
