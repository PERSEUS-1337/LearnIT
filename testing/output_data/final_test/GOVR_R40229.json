    "content": "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to provide health care coverage to low-income, uninsured children. Major changes to CHIP enacted in public laws since 1997 are summarized in this report. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established CHIP to provide health coverage for low-income children. The law increased FY1998 CHIP appropriation to $4.295 billion and provided an additional $32 million for territories in FY1999. Each state's share of the appropriation was frozen for FY1998 CHIP allotments. The FY1998 CHIP allotments were determined by a portion of the total appropriation available to states. Changes in the allotment formula affected Native American children, counting those with access to Indian Health Service care and no other insurance as uninsured. The law aimed to stabilize the CHIP allotment formula by considering states' success in covering low-income children. The BBRA 99 modified the distribution to limit fluctuations in state allocations. BBRA 99 modified CHIP allotment distribution formula, established new floors and ceilings, increased allotments for commonwealths/territories FY2000-FY2007, funded data collection for reliable state-level estimates of uninsured children. Law also funded federal evaluation for effective outreach/enrollment practices, barriers to enrollment, beneficiary drop-out factors, and required additional reports/inspector general audit. The law required reports and audits on Medicaid-eligible children in CHIP, states to report on deliveries to pregnant women and infants receiving services, and the establishment of a clearinghouse for children's health data. Schools were allowed to share information to help identify and enroll eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP programs. The law allows sharing of information between schools and state Medicaid/CHIP agencies for free and reduced-price school meals eligibility. It also established a demonstration project for WIC funds to enroll children in Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, it mandates protection of rights for institutionalized children in healthcare facilities receiving federal funds. The law mandates protection of rights for residents in healthcare facilities, including restrictions on the use of restraints and seclusion for safety reasons. Additional requirements govern reporting of resident deaths, staff training regulations, and enforcement. In community-based settings for children and adolescents, restraints and seclusion can only be used in emergencies to ensure physical safety, with a focus on less restrictive interventions. Restrictive interventions deemed ineffective. Reporting requirements for resident deaths, staff training regulations, and enforcement. Special Redistribution Rules for Unspent FY1998 and FY1999 Allotments. Unused funds pooled for states not fully expending original allotments. Territories receive 1.05% pool share based on original allotment. States exceeding three-year spending deadline access redistributed funds. States that did not fully spend their original allotments retained access to a portion of remaining funds, based on the ratio of their unspent allotment to the total unspent funds. They could use up to 10% of their retained funds for outreach activities. The deadline for spending redistributed and retained funds from FY1998 and FY1999 was extended to September 30, 2002. Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules allowed temporary enrollment of children. BIPA clarified states' authority to conduct presumptive eligibility determinations for children under separate CHIP programs, allowing temporary enrollment until formal eligibility is determined. It also authorized the payment of costs for targeted low-income children under Medicaid and benefits during presumptive eligibility periods from the CHIP appropriation. BIPA allowed states to conduct presumptive eligibility determinations for children under CHIP programs, authorizing payment of costs for benefits during these periods from the CHIP appropriation. It also permitted the transfer of unexpended CHIP funds to Medicaid for low-income children. Additionally, the law granted the Secretary the authority to waive provider requirements and payment limits for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries during emergencies. The Secretary may waive participation, state licensing, pre-approval requirements, sanctions for emergency transfers, physician self-referral, and payment limitations for Medicare+Choice enrollees during emergencies. Congress must be notified two days before exercising this waiver authority, which can last for 60 days. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements for Medicare+Choice enrollees during emergencies, with the waiver lasting for 60 days and extendable. A study on the challenges faced by farm workers and their families under Medicaid and CHIP was mandated, including barriers to enrollment and lack of coverage portability between states. Strategies to improve enrollment and access for these families were to be explored, such as interstate compacts and multi-state demonstration projects. The Secretary must conduct a study on challenges faced by farm workers and their families under Medicaid and CHIP, exploring strategies like interstate compacts, multi-state projects, and incentives for private coverage. The study must consult with various groups and submit a report to the President and Congress in October 2003. Additionally, the law extended the availability of FY1998 and FY1999 reallocated funds through FY2004 and revised methods for reallocation of unspent FY2000 and FY2001 funds. The law established a new method for reallocating unspent funds from FY2000 and FY2001 allotments, creating a pool of unspent funds for states that did not fully expend their original allotments. Territories that exhausted their original allotment received a percentage of the pool, while states that did not spend their full allotment retained 50% of unspent funds. The remaining pool was allocated to states that exceeded their original allotment by the deadline. The law allowed certain states to use federal CHIP funds for Medicaid expenditures for specific services after August 15, 2003. Qualifying states could spend up to 20% of their original allotments from FY1998-FY2001 for services for Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 with family income exceeding 150% of the FPL. The law allowed certain states to use federal CHIP funds for Medicaid expenditures for specific services after August 15, 2003. Qualifying states could spend up to 20% of their original allotments from FY1998-FY2001 for services for Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 with family income exceeding 150% of the FPL. Qualifying states included Connecticut, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. This law modified the income eligibility standard for some states from 185% to 184% of the FPL. The law added four states (Hawaii, Maryland, New Mexico, and Rhode Island) to the list of qualifying states for Section 1115 waivers, allowing them to use certain funds for Medicaid expenditures. It also appropriated $283 million to eliminate FY2006 funding shortfalls for states that exceeded available CHIP funds. The FY2006 appropriation included a set-aside for territories and allotments for shortfall states. Any unspent funds were to revert to the Treasury. The appropriation was restricted to benefits for low-income children only, with a prohibition on using CHIP funds for non-pregnant, childless adults. The Secretary of HHS was prohibited from approving new waivers for this purpose after October 1, 2005. Existing waivers covering non-pregnant, childless adults approved before the DRA could continue. The DRA allowed qualifying states to use certain CHIP funds for Medicaid expenditures, prioritizing redistribution of unspent funds from FY2004 and FY2005. The Secretary of HHS was required to redistribute unspent FY2004 original allotments, and an initial redistribution of up to half of states' unspent FY2005 funds was also mandated. An initial redistribution was required of up to half of states' unspent FY2005 original allotments as of March 31, 2007 (capped at $20 million per state). States had to meet certain criteria to forgo unspent FY2005 funds, which were targeted to shortfall states. The redistribution did not replace the regular redistribution at the end of the three-year period. The FY2004 and FY2005 redistributed funds available in FY2007 could only be used to cover populations eligible in a state's CHIP program as of October 1, 2006. The Secretary could adjust the amount of funds based on actual expenditures. Territories did not receive any funds in FY2007. Qualifying states could use FY2006 and FY2007 CHIP funds for certain Medicaid expenditures. The law required the Secretary of HHS to allocate funds to shortfall states to eliminate their estimated FY2007 funding gaps, up to $650 million total. Shortfall states were those with projected federal expenditures exceeding available funds from previous years. This law also removed certain limitations on CHIP funding, including tiered matching and expenditure restrictions. The FY2005 funds available to the state in FY2007 were addressed in P.L. 110-28, which also prohibited certain administrative actions related to Medicaid proposals. Additionally, tamper-resistant prescription pads were required for Medicaid prescriptions after September 30, 2007, and states operating a Medicaid Pharmacy Plus waiver were allowed to continue through December 31, 2009. Each continuing resolution provided FY2008 CHIP allotments of $5.04 billion. Each continuing resolution provided FY2008 CHIP allotments of $5.04 billion through specified termination dates. Unspent FY2005 funds were redistributed to states with shortfalls in FY2008. Qualifying states could use FY2008 allotments for allowed expenditures. The law made $5.04 billion FY2008 allotments available through March 31, 2009, and appropriated the same amount for FY2009 allotments. Allotments to states were based on the statutory formula using estimated low-income children numbers. The law established a formula for redistributing unspent funds from previous fiscal years to states with CHIP funding shortfalls. Additional appropriations of up to $1.6 billion were allocated in FY2008 to address states' federal CHIP funding shortfalls. These funds were only available for FY2008 and were not subject to redistribution. In FY2008, $275 million was appropriated to address states' CHIP funding shortfalls. Funds were available for the first two quarters of FY2009. Qualifying states could use FY2008 and FY2009 allotments for expenditures. $10 million was allocated for improving data collection on low-income children. In FY2008, $275 million was allocated to address states' CHIP funding shortfalls, with funds available for the first two quarters of FY2009. A total of $20 million was provided in CHIP statute for the CPS in FY2008, with a national appropriation totaling $68.9 billion over five years for states and territories. Annual allotments for FY2009 onward would be available for two years, with unspent funds redistributed to shortfall states and bonus payments. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established for making payments. The law established a new Enrollment Contingency Fund for making payments to states for federal CHIP fund shortfalls. It also created performance bonus payments for states exceeding child enrollment levels and implementing outreach initiatives, funded with $3.225 billion. States have the option to receive an enhanced CHIP matching rate for Medicaid coverage of certain children. The law allows states to use CHIP funds for additional funding of children above 133% FPL in regular Medicaid, offers a state option to cover low-income pregnant women under CHIP, terminates coverage for nonpregnant childless adults, and sets conditions for coverage of parents. It also limits federal funds for higher-income CHIP children. CHIPRA provided grants and funding for outreach and enrollment, including $100 million annually through FY2013. Funds were allocated for a national enrollment campaign, outreach for Native American children, and state and local organizations to conduct outreach in rural areas and underserved populations. States had the option to simplify eligibility through Express Lane agencies. The CHIPRA law provided states with the option to rely on Express Lane agencies for simplified eligibility determinations in Medicaid and CHIP, including verification of citizenship or nationality. It also allowed states to ensure coverage without a five-year delay for legal immigrant children and pregnant women under Medicaid and CHIP. The CHIPRA law allowed states to provide premium assistance for enrolling in employer-based health insurance, eliminated barriers to providing such assistance, and required outreach and education for families eligible for subsidies. It also strengthened quality of care and health outcomes. The CHIPRA law improved access to benefits for children under Medicaid and CHIP, including dental and mental health services. It also ensured that financial requirements and treatment limits for mental health benefits were no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. The CHIPRA law implemented a prospective payment system for services provided by federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics. It also required states to provide CHIP enrollees with a 30-day grace period for premium payments before coverage can be terminated. Additionally, it established a Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to review program policies. The law established a Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to review program policies affecting children's access to benefits and make recommendations to Congress. It included provisions to improve program integrity and data collection, required a federal evaluation of 10 states, and extended special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii. The law increased taxes on cigarettes and tobacco-related products effective April 1, 2009, and made changes to floor stock taxes. It also raised the ratio for corporate estimated taxes to 120.5% and shifted $300 million of corporate taxes from FY2014 to FY2013. The 120% withholding provision no longer applies to firms with assets under $1 billion."
