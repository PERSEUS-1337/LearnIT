    "content": "The \"Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017\" is a bill that focuses on studying the effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a study on the outcomes and efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line from January 1, 2014, based on national suicide data and data from the Crisis Line. The study will assess how effective the Crisis Line is in leading veterans to sustained mental health care. The study will assess the effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line in connecting veterans to mental health care services, including those who have not previously received care from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line in assisting veterans at risk for suicide, including those under the care of a mental health provider at the Department. It will also examine if sustained mental health care impacts suicidality and if veterans previously receiving care from the Secretary use the Crisis Line in times of crisis. The effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line in preventing suicides among veterans is evaluated by determining the number of veterans who contact the line and later commit or attempt suicide. The study also looks at how many times a veteran contacted the line before a suicide attempt. The efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line in preventing repeated suicide attempts among veterans is being evaluated by tracking the number of veterans who contacted the line and later committed or attempted suicide. Additionally, the study aims to determine if referral to mental health care affects the risk of suicide. The Veterans Crisis Line is being evaluated for its effectiveness in preventing suicide attempts among veterans. Data will be collected over a five-year period to determine the impact of mental health care referrals on veterans at high risk for suicide. Data collection practices will remain consistent throughout the study period. The Secretary must submit the study on the effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs by March 1, 2020. The term \"Veterans Crisis Line\" refers to the toll-free hotline for veterans established under title 38, United States Code."
