    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Northern Nevada Sustainable Development in Mining Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress recognizes sustainable development as a standard policy, emphasizing environmentally sound practices that meet present needs without compromising future generations. Federal land managers have collaborated with industries to develop sustainability principles, particularly in the mining sector, aiming for economically viable post-mining land uses. Productive post-mining land uses are essential for sustainable development in mining communities, especially in Nevada where Federal lands play a crucial role in providing jobs, tax revenues, and economic benefits. Mining on public lands in Nevada is a significant source of high-paying jobs and tax revenues for the state and local governments. The Rochester Mine in Pershing County, Nevada, has been a major source of employment for residents for 20 years. Operated by Coeur Rochester, Inc., the mine is near the end of its productivity and expected to close within 5 years, leading to reclamation efforts. Coeur Rochester, Inc. plans for post-mining land use at the Rochester Mine site include reusing overburden and waste rock as aggregate in markets like California, and potentially using the site as a landfill for municipal or industrial waste. This innovative plan aims to address the significant unemployment and loss of tax revenues Pershing County may face when the mine closes. The public lands at the Rochester Mine are difficult for the Bureau of Land Management to manage due to Federal land ownership patterns. Disposal of these lands will demonstrate post-mining land uses, sustainable development concepts, create employment opportunities, and provide economic benefits for Pershing County. The Act aims to consolidate or dispose of public lands into private ownership, subject to environmental laws. Lands sold under the Act would be priced at $500 per acre. The purposes include implementing sustainable development in Pershing County, promoting sustainable practices in resource-dependent communities, and providing funds for various programs in Nevada. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Claimant\" refers to Coeur Rochester, Inc. The term \"County\" means Pershing County, Nevada. The term \"the general mining laws\" includes provisions of law in title 30, United States Code. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary shall convey approximately 7,000 acres of Federal lands to the Claimant for $500 per acre, exempt from other Federal laws, with no impact on legal obligations for mine closure or reclamation. The sustainable development project at the Rochester Mine must comply with closure and reclamation laws, ensuring infrastructure usable for post-mining land use is not removed. Claimant will own all materials and minerals, including spent ore and waste rock. The Rochester Mine sustainable development project must comply with closure and reclamation laws. Claimant will own all materials and minerals on conveyed lands, including spent ore, waste rock, and tailings. Valid existing rights on the conveyed lands will be transferred to the Claimant. The United States will not be responsible for investigating or disclosing the condition of the property or for environmental liabilities. The United States will not be responsible for environmental remediation, waste management, or compliance activities related to conditions existing on the land at the time of conveyance. The gross proceeds from land conveyances under this Act will be used to cover administrative costs, fund Nevada's abandoned mined land program, provide payments to Pershing County, and deposit remaining funds into the Treasury's general fund."
