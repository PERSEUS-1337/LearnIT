These pipelines span from Arctic Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, carrying volatile materials with the potential for harm. Despite being efficient, they are vulnerable to accidents and attacks, raising concerns about safety. The Department of Energy's 2015 Quadrennial Energy Review highlighted pipeline safety as a growing concern for the nation's energy infrastructure. The federal pipeline safety program, primarily managed by the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), relies on partnerships with states for inspection and enforcement activities. The program's regulatory authorities have evolved significantly over the last decade and are authorized through the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016. The report discusses federal programs for pipeline safety, including key policy issues, roles of other federal agencies, and recent developments. The U.S. energy pipeline network consists of approximately 3 million miles of pipeline transporting natural gas, oil, and hazardous liquids. The U.S. natural gas pipeline network spans around 300,000 miles of transmission lines, connecting extraction wells to processing facilities. It also includes regional pipelines serving over 69 million customers and connects to LNG storage sites and underground storage facilities for peak demand periods. Uncontrolled releases can occur due to various factors like excavation and corrosion. Pipeline incidents can result from various causes such as excavation, corrosion, mechanical failure, and natural forces like floods and earthquakes. Despite causing few injuries or fatalities compared to other transportation modes, there were on average 12 deaths and 66 injuries annually from 2009 to 2018 in the U.S. pipeline systems. The number of incidents has shown no clear trend recently, with 40 serious incidents reported in 2018. Some accidents may result in environmental damage or physical impacts, particularly in cases of oil spills or fires. PHMSA requires reporting of incidents involving $50,000 or more in total. Pipeline incidents involving spills, fires, or explosions are required to be reported by PHMSA if they exceed certain thresholds. On average, there were 260 significant incidents per year from 2009 to 2018, with no clear trend in incidents affecting only the environment or property. While fatalities from pipeline releases are relatively low, a single accident can have catastrophic consequences for public safety and the environment. Pipeline incidents can have catastrophic consequences for public safety and the environment. Notable incidents in the last decade include a pipeline spill in Marshall, MI releasing 19,500 barrels of crude oil, an explosion in San Bruno, CA killing 8 people, an explosion in Allentown, PA killing 5 people, a spill near Laurel, MT releasing 1,000 barrels of crude oil, an explosion in Springfield, MA injuring 21 people, and an oil spill in Mayflower, AK evacuating 22 homes. In 2014, a natural gas pipeline explosion in New York City killed 8 people and destroyed two buildings. In 2015, a pipeline spill in Santa Barbara County, CA, released 3,400 barrels of crude oil. The Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in Los Angeles released 5.4 billion cubic feet of gas in 2015, causing the relocation of households. In 2016, a gas pipeline explosion in Canton, OH, killed one person and damaged buildings. In 2018, explosions and fires from gas pipelines in Merrimack Valley, MA, killed one person, injured 21 others, and forced 30,000 residents to evacuate. The explosions and fires from gas pipelines in Merrimack Valley, MA in 2018 killed one person, injured 21 others, and required 30,000 residents to evacuate. This has led to increased scrutiny of pipeline regulation and state and community activity related to pipeline safety. PHMSA, FERC, and NTSB are the key federal agencies involved in pipeline safety regulations in the United States. The Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 established federal regulations for pipeline safety. The Transportation Secretary has authority over interstate pipeline safety, including design, construction, operation, maintenance, and spill response planning. PHMSA employs 290 staff in its Office of Pipeline Safety, including inspectors and specialists for enforcement actions, regulations, grants, and research. PHMSA's pipeline safety program is primarily funded by user fees on regulated pipeline operators. State offices can act as agents for interstate pipeline safety programs. The agency relies heavily on state inspectors for intrastate lines, with approximately 380 state inspectors in 2018. PHMSA's budget authority has steadily increased since 2001, with the largest increase in FY2015. PHMSA's budget authority has steadily increased since 2001, with the largest increase in FY2015. For FY2019, the estimated budget authority is approximately $164 million, more than double the agency's budget authority in FY2008. The Trump Administration's requested budget authority for FY2020 is approximately $151 million, with proposed reductions in contract programs, research and development, and grants to states. PHMSA uses various strategies to promote compliance with safety standards, including inspections, investigations, and enforcement actions. PHMSA enforces safety regulations through enforcement actions like corrective action orders and civil penalties. From 2014 to 2018, 943 enforcement actions were initiated, resulting in 348 safety orders and $24.2 million in proposed civil penalties. PHMSA also conducts accident investigations and system-wide reviews focusing on high-risk areas. Integrity management programs have been increasingly required since 1997 for pipeline segments near high consequence areas. Integrity management prioritizes evaluation, risk assessment, inspection, data analysis, and repair in high consequence areas like population centers and environmentally sensitive areas. PHMSA mandated integrity management for most oil pipeline operators with over 500 miles of regulated pipeline in 2001. Congress later expanded integrity management to natural gas pipelines and made other significant changes to federal pipeline safety requirements. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) strengthened federal pipeline safety programs, required risk analysis for natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas, and increased violation penalties. This act was part of a series of periodic pipeline safety statutes that reauthorized funding for PHMSA's pipeline safety program. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) implemented safety actions for pipelines with potential safety issues and increased violation penalties. It established an interagency committee to streamline the permitting process for emergency pipeline restoration. Additionally, it required the Department of Transportation (DOT) to study ways to limit pipeline safety risks from population encroachment and preserve environmental resources in pipeline rights-of-way. The act also included provisions for public education, grants for community pipeline safety studies, employee protection, qualification programs, and mapping data submission. The Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-468) focuses on pipeline damage prevention, integrity management, corrosion control, and enforcement transparency. It established grants for states to improve damage prevention programs, created the national \"call before you dig\" one-call telephone number (811), and gave PHMSA limited authority for civil enforcement against one-call violators. The act also mandated minimum standards for integrity management programs for natural gas distribution pipelines and required PHMSA to review federal pipeline safety regulations related to internal corrosion control. Additionally, it increased transparency of enforcement actions by issuing monthly summaries of violations and penalties. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011, signed by President Obama, imposed 42 mandates on PHMSA to enhance pipeline safety. It increased federal pipeline safety inspectors, required automatic shutoff valves, mandated verification of operating pressure, raised civil penalties for violations, and called for reviews of diluted bitumen pipeline regulation. The Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (PIPES Act, P.L. 114-183) authorized the federal pipeline safety program through FY2019. It grants PHMSA emergency order authority and requires regular reporting on statutory mandates. Siting approval of interstate natural gas pipelines falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Companies building interstate natural gas pipelines must obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from FERC. FERC also approves abandonment of gas facility use and services, including safety provisions for pipeline routing and design in accordance with PHMSA's safety standards. FERC and PHMSA cooperate on pipeline safety matters under a 1993 MOU. PHMSA alerts FERC of safety activities that may impact commission responsibilities and major accidents or enforcement actions. Under a 1993 MOU, FERC and PHMSA cooperate on pipeline safety matters. FERC notifies PHMSA of safety issues involving natural gas transmission facilities and construction projects. They also coordinate environmental compliance inspections and review mitigation conditions for conflicts with PHMSA's regulations. During the preparation of environmental assessments or impact statements for pipeline projects, FERC collaborates with PHMSA on safety matters. FERC issues a policy statement in April 2015 to help interstate gas pipelines recover costs for modernizing facilities and enhancing safety. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates transportation incidents, including pipeline releases, and issues safety recommendations to prevent reoccurrences. Despite lacking regulatory authority, over 82% of NTSB's safety recommendations have been implemented in all transportation modes, leading to changes in pipeline safety regulation. The NTSB's safety recommendations have influenced changes in pipeline safety regulations, including implementing one-call systems for excavation, using internal inspection devices, improving facility response plans, conducting hydrostatic pressure testing on older pipelines, and other safety improvements. The NTSB issued preliminary findings and recommendations following the investigation of the San Bruno Pipeline incident, attributing the rupture to a faulty weld in a pipeline section from 1956. The investigation also addressed broader pipeline issues such as public awareness initiatives, pipeline technology, and regulatory oversight by federal and state agencies. The NTSB's findings criticized the pipeline operator (PG&E) and state/federal regulators for systemic deficiencies in PG&E's pipeline safety program. The state regulator failed to detect inadequacies in PG&E's program, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's inspection protocols need improvement. The oversight lacks effective metrics for performance-based management of pipeline safety programs. The NTSB criticized the oversight of state public utility commissions regulating gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines, highlighting weaknesses in the system. The final incident report revealed PHMSA's weak enforcement program and monitoring of state oversight programs, leading to ineffective Federal and state oversight. The NTSB issued 39 recommendations, including audits to assess PHMSA's oversight effectiveness. PHMSA's oversight of pipeline safety programs includes audits, requiring system-specific information to be provided to emergency response agencies, installing automatic shutoff valves in high consequence areas, conducting pressure tests on older pipelines, and revising integrity management protocols to set performance goals for operators. The NTSB criticized PHMSA for inadequate regulatory requirements and oversight of pipeline operations, emergency response plans, and response plan approval. They issued eight recommendations to improve PHMSA's onshore pipeline facility response plan programs and ensure compliance with the Oil Pollution Act. PHMSA's facility response plan program meets all requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, including issuing advisory bulletins to pipeline operators, developing training requirements for control center staff, strengthening operator qualification requirements, and harmonizing onshore oil pipeline response planning with the U.S. Coast Guard and EPA. The NTSB issued a preliminary report on the Merrimack Valley natural gas fires, attributing the cause to excessive pressure in a distribution main during a pipeline replacement project. Workers bypassed critical pressure-sensing lines due to an erroneous work order, leading to high-pressure gas releases. The formal incident investigation is ongoing, with no final report released yet. The NTSB's preliminary findings on the Merrimack Valley natural gas fires recommended eliminating a professional engineer license exemption for public utility work in Massachusetts and requiring a professional engineer's seal on engineering drawings. Recommendations were also made to the gas distribution utility regarding design and operating practices. No recommendations were made to PHMSA. The NTSB has previously made recommendations to PHMSA in other pipeline incident investigations. Detailed findings and recommendations are available in the NTSB's docket management system, and a safety study on gas transmission pipelines highlighted areas for safety improvement. The study identified areas for safety improvement in high consequence areas, including expanding PHMSA guidance for operators and inspectors, increasing in-line inspections, eliminating direct assessment as the sole method, evaluating risk assessment approaches, enhancing inspector training, setting professional qualification criteria, and improving data collection. PHMSA has 25 open NTSB pipeline safety recommendations dating back to 2011. There are 25 open NTSB pipeline safety recommendations dating back to 2011. Some are classified as \"Open\u2014Acceptable Response\" and others as \"Open\u2014Unacceptable response\" due to PHMSA's actions. Pipeline safety and security are intertwined, with PHMSA involved in both. DOT had the lead role in pipeline security until the late 1990s. The Office of Pipeline Safety, under DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration, was responsible for addressing pipeline security due to its role as a safety regulator. Regulations included provisions for physical security and surveillance of pipeline facilities. In the early 2000s, OPS conducted a vulnerability assessment and collaborated with industry groups to assess readiness for a terrorist attack. OPS, along with DOE and state pipeline agencies, promoted the development of consensus standards for security measures. OPS promoted consensus standards for security measures tiered to match threat warnings by Homeland Security. They developed protocols for critical facility inspections and established communication links. OPS identified technology for enhancing security and urged public-private sector planning. Formal guidance was circulated on security program recommendations and implementation expectations. President Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) in November 2001, establishing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) within DOT. The act placed DOT's pipeline security authority under TSA, specifying duties related to transportation security, intelligence management, threat assessment, and enforcement. President Bush also signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on November 25, 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and transferred the Transportation Security Administration from DOT to DHS. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in 2003, maintaining DHS as the lead agency for pipeline security. A memorandum of understanding between DOT and DHS in 2004 established their respective security roles in all modes of transportation. The MOU between DHS and DOT in 2004 established security roles in transportation. An annex was signed in 2006 to promote cooperation and efficiency in transportation security. A joint working group was formed in 2007 to improve interagency coordination on transportation security matters. The DOT developed a multiyear action plan for pipeline security, including critical infrastructure identification, strategic planning, regulations, inspections, technical support, and more. The DOT Inspector General assessed the actions taken in implementing the 2004 MOU with DHS, noting initial steps towards implementing a pipeline security plan but urging further urgent actions. The report recommended that PHMSA and TSA finalize and execute their security annex action plan, clarify their roles, and jointly develop a pipeline security strategy. TSA and PHMSA improved collaboration after the IG report, maintaining daily contact and sharing information. In March 2010, TSA published a Pipeline Security and Incident Recovery Protocol Plan outlining their responsibilities during a pipeline security incident. The plan outlines DOT's statutory tools for security incidents, including special permits and safety orders. DOT/PHMSA utilizes the RETCO Program for regional emergency preparedness. An Interagency Threat Coordination Committee was established by TSA and PHMSA for threat information sharing. TSA and DOT collaborated on pipeline security, addressing vandalism and sabotage in 2016. In 2016, TSA and DOT collaborated on pipeline security, including sharing information, coordinating activities, and addressing cybersecurity threats to SCADA systems. In 2017, they worked on a web-based portal for sharing incident information among federal agencies with pipeline responsibilities. The 116th Congress may focus on key issues in federal pipeline safety oversight and PHMSA's reauthorization, including incomplete mandates, staffing adequacy, state program oversight, aging infrastructure, and pipeline security. Congress has imposed mandates on PHMSA through reauthorizations in response to pipeline accidents. The Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act of 2011 and the PIPES Act of 2016 included 61 mandates, of which some remain unfulfilled by PHMSA. Congress is concerned about delays in fulfilling statutory obligations, impacting pipeline safety and public confidence. Overdue mandates include regulations on pipeline operating pressure and material testing. PHMSA was required by the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act of 2011 and the PIPES Act of 2016 to finalize rules on pipeline operating pressure, material testing, and integrity management programs by specific deadlines. These rules aim to ensure the safety of gas transmission pipelines, especially in high-consequence areas, and address the regulation of currently unregulated gathering lines. PHMSA split its efforts into three separate rulemakings to finalize provisions on pipeline operating pressure, material testing, and integrity management programs. A final rule for maximum allowable operating pressure and material testing is expected in July 2019, while separate final rules for integrity management and gathering line provisions are anticipated in December 2019. The rulemaking includes requirements for leak detection systems for hazardous liquids pipelines and expands integrity management for liquids pipelines beyond high-consequence areas. PHMSA is working on finalizing rules for pipeline valve installation and rupture detection standards. A prepublication final rule was issued in January 2017 but withdrawn for further review. The anticipated publication of the final rule is in May 2019. These measures aim to improve pipeline operators' ability to quickly stop commodity flow in case of an unintended release. Performance standards for pipeline valve installation and rupture detection are outlined in this rulemaking. PHMSA is working on finalizing rules for pipeline valve installation and rupture detection standards, with deadlines set for January 3, 2014, and June 22, 2018. The agency anticipates issuing a proposed rule in August 2019 for underground natural gas storage facilities. Additionally, a rulemaking to implement emergency orders for imminent hazards is expected to be finalized in August 2019. PHMSA issued an interim final rule on October 14, 2016, with a final rule anticipated in March 2019. Delays in rulemaking were attributed to complexity, limited resources, and lack of processes. A 2016 audit found PHMSA lacking in implementing mandates promptly. The agency's administrator testified in June 2018 that staffing and funding were sufficient for rulemaking activities, with efforts to streamline the process for overdue rules prioritized. PHMSA prioritizes rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines, gas transmission, and rupture detection. The agency faces a manpower issue with limited staff overseeing 2.7 million miles of pipelines, relying heavily on state agencies for inspections. Congressional criticism has been directed at PHMSA's insufficient inspector staffing levels. In FY2019, PHMSA is funded for 308 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in pipeline safety, including 145 inspectors. The President's budget request for FY2020 projects a small reduction in funded staff, with an estimate of 306 FTEs, two fewer than the prior year. Two positions supporting pipeline safety data analysis and information technology are to be transferred to DOT. If PHMSA's pipeline safety staffing is funded at the level of the President's FY2020 budget request, it would maintain the significant increase in staff funding since FY2014. However, reducing grants to states could lead to fewer staff in state pipeline safety agencies, potentially reversing the long-term expansion of PHMSA's pipeline safety program initiated over 20 years ago in response to pipeline accidents, 9/11, integrity management regulations, and the U.S. shale gas and oil production boom. The persistent shortfall in PHMSA inspector staffing is attributed to various reasons, including a scarcity of qualified applicants, delays in the hiring process, and high turnover rates to pipeline companies. The agency faces challenges in recruiting candidates due to competition from the industry, especially with the rapid growth of unconventional oil and gas shales. PHMSA has implemented a recruitment strategy to address pipeline inspector hiring challenges, including noncompetitive hiring authorities, recruitment incentives, and outreach efforts through social media, professional organizations, and career fairs. PHMSA has been working hard to hire and retain inspector staff but faces challenges due to an aging workforce and competition from the oil and natural gas industry. Despite taking actions to strengthen its workforce, there is still room for improvement. The IG report in 2017 highlighted the lack of a current workforce management plan and underutilization of retention tools. PHMSA has agreed to the report's recommendations and proposed action plans. Additionally, a 2018 GAO study found that PHMSA has not planned for future workforce needs for interstate pipeline inspections. The GAO found that PHMSA has not planned for future workforce needs for interstate pipeline inspections. PHMSA has agreed to develop a workforce plan for interstate pipeline inspections, but the impact on staff recruitment, retention, and deployment remains uncertain. PHMSA is seeking direct-hire authority to expedite hiring for pipeline inspectors. The House Appropriations Committee acknowledged challenges faced by PHMSA in hiring pipeline safety inspectors and encouraged OPM to consider granting direct-hire authority. PHMSA applied for this authority in 2015 but was denied. PHMSA applied for direct-hire authority in 2015 but was denied. In 2016, the agency reiterated its desire for DHA to reduce hiring time. P.L. 114-183 did not grant direct-hire authority to PHMSA. The IG report suggested that DHA might not effectively help in recruiting staff. The effectiveness of direct-hire authority in speeding up hiring new employees is uncertain, especially in addressing long-standing staffing challenges in a competitive industry with a limited talent pool. State pipeline safety programs have faced scrutiny after major safety incidents, with criticism directed at California's program for failing to detect problems in the San Bruno pipeline. The NTSB also criticized PHMSA for lacking effective metrics in overseeing state programs. The DOT Office of Inspector General found that PHMSA's oversight of State pipeline safety programs is inadequate, leading to undisclosed safety weaknesses. Recommendations were made to improve oversight and ensure States comply with program evaluation requirements. PHMSA officials agreed with most recommendations to address concerns raised in the IG report. The DOT Office of Inspector General found PHMSA's oversight of State pipeline safety programs inadequate. Most recommendations were addressed, but two remained unresolved regarding staffing formula and inspection procedures evaluations. The Aliso Canyon and Merrimack Valley incidents highlighted concerns about state safety oversight. PHMSA expressed worry about state regulators' handling of safety issues during the Aliso Canyon incident. A federal task force found monitoring practices at Aliso Canyon inadequate for safe operations. In the Merrimack Valley case, state legislators criticized Massachusetts' pipeline safety regulators for inadequate oversight. PHMSA's evaluation of the state's pipeline safety program gave it a high rating, but noted a shortfall in inspector staffing. Congress may reexamine PHMSA's oversight of state pipeline safety partners in light of recent incidents. The NTSB listed safe shipment of hazardous materials by pipeline as a priority for transportation safety improvements. The 2019-2020 Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements highlights concerns about aging infrastructure, particularly older transmission pipelines and cast iron pipes in natural gas distribution systems. The Merrimack Valley incident, caused by a cast iron pipe replacement project, underscores the need for managing, replacing, or reconditioning antiquated pipes over 50 years old. Age was also a factor in the failure at the Aliso Canyon facility. Old distribution pipes are a significant source of methane leakage, posing safety risks and contributing to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz highlighted the environmental and safety risks from leaky distribution lines in 2015. Operators have programs to replace old pipes, but face challenges due to cost and regulatory constraints. The Department of Energy estimates the cost of replacing cast iron and bare steel pipes at $270 billion. Urban excavation and gas supply disruptions also limit annual replacement efforts. Federal involvement in natural gas distribution systems is limited as they fall under state jurisdiction. The Pipeline Safety Act mandated a survey of pipeline operator progress in managing and replacing old cast iron pipes. The Merrimack Valley incident may refocus attention on PHMSA's regulation of pipe replacement and aging pipeline safety issues. Congress may examine the industry's progress in addressing the safety of antiquated distribution lines and opportunities for federal support. Ongoing threats against pipelines have also been a concern since the passage of the PIPES Act. Recent concerns about security risks to the nation's pipelines have increased due to physical and cyber threats. A 2018 study by GAO highlighted evolving threats, including sabotage and cyber attacks. Oversight of federal pipeline security activities has focused on PHMSA's collaboration with TSA, raising questions about the effectiveness of their cooperation. Congress has debated whether the TSA-PHMSA pipeline security annex aligns resources and capabilities to ensure overall pipeline safety and security. In the 116th Congress, the Pipeline and LNG Facility Cybersecurity Preparedness Act (H.R. 370, S. 300) aims to enhance coordination among federal agencies, state agencies, and the energy sector in pipeline security. The act also focuses on incident response, recovery, development of cybersecurity technologies, and training. The role of PHMSA in future pipeline security initiatives and the resources it may need are considerations for Congress. Both government and industry have taken steps to improve pipeline security. In 2016, the oil and natural gas industry committed to achieving zero incidents in operations. Despite efforts to improve pipeline safety, major accidents still occur, prompting calls for additional regulatory measures from Congress and the NTSB. Past PHMSA reauthorizations included mandates for integrity management programs and increased inspector staffing. Recent incidents highlight the need for further action to prevent future accidents. In response to recent pipeline accidents, Congress may consider new regulatory mandates on PHMSA or the pipeline industry. Many pipeline safety rulemakings and NTSB recommendations are still pending, with their effectiveness yet to be determined. Congress is focusing on the practical effects of changes to PHMSA's regulations and assessing how U.S. pipeline safety activities align with the overall strategy to protect the public and the environment. The collaboration between federal and state agencies, pipeline associations, operators, and communities is crucial for achieving common goals in pipeline safety, which is a key concern for Congress."
