    "content": "The Department of Transportation requested $43.3 billion in funding for FY1999, a 1% increase from the previous year. Hearings were held on the budget request in transportation subcommittees. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century reauthorized many surface transportation programs. The House and Senate passed their respective versions of the budget resolution, with different amounts allocated for FY1999. President Clinton signed the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21) into law, providing authorization for appropriations for DOT's agencies and programs for fiscal years 1998 through 2003. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $13.7 billion in new budget obligational authority for the Department of Transportation for 1999. The Senate passed its version of the DOT appropriations for FY1999, with a total obligational authority of approximately $45.9 billion. A controversial provision regarding \"project labor agreements\" was dropped from the legislation, allowing for passage. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4328 (H.Rept. 105-648) on July 22, 1998. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 4328 (H.Rept. 105-648) with a total budget of $46.9 billion for FY1999, $4.8 billion more than FY1998 levels. The bill was passed by the House and referred to the Senate, which amended it with S. 2307. After several continuing resolutions, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999 was passed on October 19, 1998. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, passed on October 19, 1998, provided approximately $47 billion for federal transportation programs, 12% more than FY1998 funding. The amount for some DOT programs was secured by funding \"firewalls\" in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Transportation budgeting involves budget authority and contract authority. Members and staff can access the legislative text on the Clerk of the House website. Contract authority, a form of budget authority, provides obligational authority for trust fund financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in transportation budget spending were previously achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations. Contract authority allows funds to be automatically available to states at the start of each fiscal year without the need for appropriations legislation. Appropriations are still required for outlays. TEA-21 limits appropriations for highway and transit programs by setting obligation levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and federal payments are made later. Obligated funds are not subtracted from trust fund balances, making them appear high. Trust fund balances must cover future commitments. Highway and transit accounts operate on a reimbursable basis. The highway and transit accounts have short- and long-term commitments, including payments for current projects and outstanding obligations for future projects. Contract authority funds are distributed to states through apportionments for formula-driven programs and allocated funds for programs under federal control. The Department of Transportation requested $43.259 billion for FY1999, a 1.0% increase from FY1998. Agencies targeted for funding increases include the Maritime Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and others. The FY1999 budget request for the Department of Transportation includes funding increases for various agencies, such as the Federal Railroad Administration, Office of the Secretary, and U.S. Coast Guard. Some agencies, like the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and Federal Transit Administration, saw budget reductions. The report analyzes funding proposals for national transportation priorities and highlights historical funding trends. Key modal administrations like the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Aviation Administration are also summarized. The allocation of funds for the U.S. Department of Transportation among competing national interests is a major challenge. Monies are allocated for various purposes such as U.S. Coast Guard expenses, transportation system safety improvements, and infrastructure needs. The appropriations also support agencies like the National Transportation Safety Board and the Surface Transportation Board. The perennial question of priorities surrounds the appropriations process. The DOT emphasizes safety, infrastructure, financing, environment, technology, and security in its budget request. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) guides the appropriations process, focusing on key transportation programs until 2003. Congress prioritizes using gasoline tax proceeds for maintaining the U.S. highway and transit network, not as general revenue. The Administration requested approximately $30.0 billion for FY1999 for transportation infrastructure spending, despite limitations on discretionary spending. This increase is seen as a strong policy statement by Congress and the Clinton Administration on the priority of infrastructure. The Clinton Administration's FY1999 budget request emphasizes increased infrastructure spending to boost national productivity and competitiveness. They aim for a $30.0 billion level of transportation infrastructure spending, which would be the highest in DOT history. The Administration also highlights improvements in transit and airport capacity, as well as highway conditions in recent years. The Administration's FY1999 budget request aims for increased infrastructure spending, emphasizing improvements in transit and airport capacity, as well as highway conditions. The request is influenced by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the passage of TEA-21, which sets limitations on program spending for the next 6 fiscal years. The Administration's FY1999 budget request aims for increased infrastructure spending, emphasizing improvements in transit and airport capacity, as well as highway conditions. The request sets limitations on program spending for the next 6 fiscal years by creating \"fire walls\" to prevent reductions in spending below agreed upon levels. The DOT proposed to continue supporting State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) at the $150 million level and to finance a new Transportation Infrastructure Credit Program at the $100 million level for FY1998. The Administration's efforts to promote innovative financing in transportation represent a small portion of the total DOT budget, with a proposed $1.1 billion for research and technology activities in FY1999, a 10% increase from FY1998. The focus is on leveraging federal dollars and encouraging private sector investment in projects of national significance. The Department of Transportation (DOT) emphasizes research and technology activities to improve safety, mobility, transportation systems, economic growth, and national security. The FY1999 budget request includes significant funding for FHWA, FAA, and NHTSA programs. Increased investment in research and development is a key theme of the Clinton Administration. Decision-making on funding for R&T activities remains challenging due to competing funding needs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is involved in various technology programs, including the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program with a FY1999 request of $250 million. This initiative aims to promote investments in ITS technologies like traffic surveillance and safety monitoring for commercial vehicles, with $95 million allocated for research and development activities in the TEA-21 law. The TEA-21 law provides $95 million for research, development, and operational tests for the core departmental ITS program. Additionally, $105 million is authorized for ITS integrated deployment projects. The total funding available for ITS programs specified in TEA-21 is $200 million, but with an obligation limitation of 88.3% for FY 1999, the effective amount is reduced to $176.6 million. The Federal Railroad Administration requested a reduction in funding for the Next Generation of High-Speed Rail Program from $20 million in FY 1998 to $12.6 million in FY 1999. The Coast Guard requested $18 million for research, development, testing, and evaluation in FY 1999. In FY 1999, $18 million was requested for research, development, testing, and evaluation by the Coast Guard to improve mission performance and service delivery. The Department of Transportation (DOT) requested $3.1 billion for transportation safety programs, with increases for modal administrations like the Federal Aviation Administration, NHTSA, and the Federal Highway Administration. The focus was on promoting public health and safety by reducing transportation-related injuries, deaths, and property damage. In FY1999, funding was requested to increase safety through various approaches such as rulemaking, compliance efforts, public education, and direct operations. Activities included requesting additional personnel for safety offices, promoting public-private partnerships for safety technologies, and advancing research on transportation incidents. NHTSA's highway safety program funding was set to increase by 22%, with a focus on grants and research to improve automobile occupant protection. $31 million was proposed for increasing seat belt use and $10.2 million for safety initiatives. In FY1999, funding was requested to increase safety through various approaches such as rulemaking, compliance efforts, public education, and direct operations. The Department of Transportation Appropriations Act provided $333.5 million for NHTSA's activities, with $159.4 million allocated for operations and research. TEA-21 sets funding levels for traffic safety grants and research programs, impacting NHTSA's budget for FY1999. The passage discusses the impact of P.L. 105-277 on NHTSA's budget from FY1999 to FY2003, including funding allocations for operations, research, and traffic safety grants. The debate on the FY1999 budget request focused on funding priorities, with some Members emphasizing local needs for roads, transit, and airports. Passage of TEA-21 created new issues for appropriations, particularly regarding the budgetary treatment of highway and transit spending. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) has influenced DOT's spending requests to align with strategic goals. Historical funding levels for FY1988-FY1998 and FY1999 request for the Department of Transportation are shown in Table 2. Total DOT funding increased by 66% from FY1988 to FY1998. Funding comes from new budget authority or limitations on obligations in the DOT appropriations act. The information includes actual, estimated, and requested appropriations, obligations limitations, DOD transfers, and exempt obligations subject to the appropriations process. The Administration requested $4.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY1999, up 2.2% from FY1998. The budget would support activities against drug smuggling and fleet recapitalization for national security goals. $2.8 billion would be for operation and maintenance, including $309 million in defense-related funding. $67 million was requested for training. The Administration requested $67 million for training and support of a military Selected Reserve Force of 7,600 members. Other Coast Guard funding included $61 million for spill clean-up and $300 million in national security activities scored against defense funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.7 billion for the Coast Guard, 1.1% less than the budget request. The House passed an appropriation of $3.887 billion for the Coast Guard, which is $29.4 million less than FY1998. Operating expenses were funded at $2.7 billion, including $300 million in national security activities scored against defense spending. Acquisition, construction, and improvements would be decreased from the request, and research, development, test, and evaluation would also see a decrease in funding. Drug interdiction activities received an increase of $33.8 million over the President's request, while reductions were made in fisheries law enforcement and polar ice breaking. Acquisition, construction, and improvements were funded at $389 million. The conference agreed to an appropriation of $3.9 billion for the Coast Guard, with operating expenses funded at $2.7 billion. Acquisition, construction, and improvements were funded at $395.5 million, with $20 million from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Research, development, test, and evaluation would receive $12 million. The House approved $69 million for reserve training, $12 million for research and development, and $14 million for bridge alterations. The Administration requested $751 million for the Federal Railroad Administration for FY1999, with notable reductions in funding for Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $729.3 million for FRA, including $609.2 million for Amtrak, while the Senate recommended $707 million, including $555 million for Amtrak. The Senate recommended $707 million for Amtrak, while Congress appropriated $749.8 million to FRA for FY1999, with $609.2 million allocated for Amtrak. The Administration requested $621 million for capital grants to Amtrak, with a focus on the Northeast Corridor. Operating grants for Amtrak were not requested, as it was proposed that operating funds could come from capital grants. The House recommended $609.2 million for Amtrak for FY1999. The House recommended $609.2 million for Amtrak for FY1999, along with additional funding for a third freight track in Rhode Island and \"next generation high speed rail\" projects. The Senate recommended $555 million for Amtrak for FY1999, totaling $1.6 billion when combined with funds from the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The committee bill included provisions for capital funds to be used for capital expenses, potentially reaching $400 million in FY1999. The committee recommended allocating $200 million of the $555 million for upgrading the Northeast Corridor, with $40 million designated for New York Pennsylvania Station. Congress appropriated $609.2 million to Amtrak for FY1999, allowing Amtrak to decide how much to use for upgrades. The committee rejected using capital grants for equipment maintenance but did not set a specific limit on using federal capital grants for maintenance. Funding for Penn Station redevelopment in New York City was not allocated. The Congress did not allocate funds for the Penn Station redevelopment in New York City. Instead, they allocated $20.5 million for \"next generation high speed rail\" and $5 million for the Rhode Island freight rail project. The Amtrak Reform Council, established by the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, was given additional responsibilities by the Senate Appropriations Committee for FY1999 to help Amtrak reach its financial goals and decrease reliance on federal aid by identifying routes for closure or realignment. The Council is prohibited from using its appropriation for outside consultant services. The Council members were chosen for their expertise and qualifications. Congress allocated $450,000 to the Amtrak Reform Council for FY1999. The FY1999 Appropriations Act provided $25.5 billion for highway program activities, with an additional $1.2 billion in exempt obligations. The Act made modest changes to the highway program but largely followed TEA-21 guidance. The Act clarifies distribution of high priority project funds under TEA-21, giving states flexibility in setting priorities. It does not provide funding for the Appalachian highway program but allocates additional funds for Alabama, Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Arkansas. The total funding for FY1999 exceeds the Clinton Administration's proposal. The FY1999 budget for highway activities under TEA-21 had a limitation on obligations of $25.5 billion, with specific funding levels for major programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations set spending at the TEA-21 level, totaling just over $27.0 billion. Recommendations were made for specific activities, such as increasing FHWA operating expenses. The FY1999 budget for highway activities under TEA-21 was set at $26.7 billion by the House Committee on Appropriations, slightly below the Senate level. Funding for the Appalachian highway system was reduced to $200.0 million, $100.0 million less than FY1998. The FTA received $5.39 billion in total funding, an increase of $549.0 million from the previous year. The FY1999 budget for the FTA provided $5.39 billion, exceeding FY1998 funding by $549.0 million. Most FTA programs received funding increases, except for the operating assistance program. Transit programs have been controversial, with proposals for reductions or elimination since the Reagan Administration. Transit is mainly supported locally, while highway programs have broader support, especially in rural areas. The Clinton Administration proposed a slight decrease in total FTA funding for FY1999, consolidating most programs into a $3.6 billion formula program funded by the transit account of the Federal Highway Trust Fund. Fixed guideway modernization programs would be retained separately, while the Major Capital Investment Program would continue to allocate discretionary funds for fixed guideway projects. The Clinton Administration proposed a slight decrease in total FTA funding for FY1999, consolidating most programs into a $3.6 billion formula program funded by the transit account of the Federal Highway Trust Fund. The Major Capital Investment Program was increased to $2.3 billion from the FY1998 level of $2.0 billion, an increase of 12.8%. This included $902.8 million each for new starts and fixed guideway modernization. The House and Senate transit proposals recommended the same funding levels for FY1999, $5.39 billion, an increase of $549 million over FY1998. These funding levels were enacted into law on October 21, 1998, under the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1999 (H.R. 4328, P.L.105-277). The FY1999 funding for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) was set at $3.6 billion, with $2.3 billion allocated to the Major Capital Investment Program, including funds for new starts, fixed guideway modernization, and various grants for urbanized and nonurbanized areas. Additionally, $9.6 billion was appropriated for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in FY 1999, a 5% increase from the previous year. The FY1999 funding for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was set at $9.6 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. The appropriation is $85 million more than the House recommendation, but $300 million less than the Senate mark and $150 million less than the Administration's request. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) spending is limited to half the annual authorization level, potentially affecting approved airport construction work. The FAA's Operations account is funded at $5.563 billion, $25 million less than the Administration's request. The Facilities and Equipment account is funded at $2.0 billion, $130 million below the budget request. It funds air traffic services, aviation regulation, safety certification, and security activities. The Act fully funds the Administration's $168 million request for the Free Flight Phase I program and includes $100 million for explosive detection devices. The FAA is prohibited from obligating funds for explosive detection systems until major air carriers agree to fund operation and maintenance. The major air carriers agree to fund operation and maintenance of systems in FY 1999 and increase their use of machines. Programs for the Year 2000 computer problem are funded at $25 million, with additional funds provided through the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations section. The Research, Engineering, & Development account is funded at $150 million, $140 million less than the budget request, with reductions due to Congress denying funding for the Flight 2000 program. The FAA is not ready to start an ambitious project, lacking consensus and site decisions. Full funding is allocated for aircraft safety technology, including $15 million for aging aircraft research. $41.7 million is provided for explosives and weapons detection research. Airport grants are limited to $1.95 billion, with $975 million available until an FAA reauthorization bill is passed. Priority is given to projects listed in House and Senate bill reports. Airport Improvement Program contract authority for the first six months of FY 1999 is included in the Act. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, established in 1970, is responsible for setting safety standards for automotive equipment and promoting road safety. In FY1999, the agency requested $406 million in funding. The FAA is prohibited from creating a peanut-free buffer zone until a study shows severe reactions from peanut exposure. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested $406 million in funding for FY1999, with a significant portion allocated to Highway Traffic Safety Grants. The agency's programs aim to reduce the $150 billion lost annually to highway deaths, injuries, and property damage. Initiatives include promoting seat belt use and advocating for a uniform 0.08 blood alcohol concentration level. Senate and House reauthorization proposals differed on approaches to convince states to enact the 0.08 BAC level. The Senate and House had differing approaches on convincing states to adopt a 0.08 BAC level. The House prevailed in conference, providing funding for NHTSA programs including seat belt use promotion and developing crash protection devices. Total funding for NHTSA was $361.4 million, $28 million more than FY1998 but $44.5 million less than requested. The conference bill allocates $159.4 million for Operations and Research for the agency, $12.4 million above its FY1998 amount. Additional obligations of $13.5 million are permitted for Highway Safety Grants, with $2 million provided for the National Driver Register.
