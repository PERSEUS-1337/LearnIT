    "content": "The President's budget for FY1999 included $21.7 billion for energy and water development programs, larger than the previous year's appropriation. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees proposed funding levels of $21.4 billion and $21.1 billion respectively for FY1999. The Senate approved the bill for $21.4 billion with additional funding for solar and renewable energy programs, while the House approved their version for $21.1 billion. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill (H.R. 4060) was approved by the House and Senate in 1998 for $21.2 billion. The President signed the bill into law on October 7, 1998. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277) added funding to various programs, including the Corps of Engineers and DOE's renewable energy program. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY1999 allocated $21.2 billion, with additional funding added by the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Funding for the Corps of Engineers civil programs is often a contentious issue, with appropriations typically exceeding the amount requested. For example, in FY1998, Congress added $270 million to the $3.63 billion requested by the Administration. The FY1999 request of $3.22 billion is over $800 million less than the previous year, with a significant reduction in the Corps' construction budget. The Corps' construction budget was significantly reduced for FY1999, leading to funding issues in the appropriation legislation. The House and Senate criticized the Administration's limited construction budget request as \"irresponsible.\" The final budget allocated $3.86 billion for the Corps, $638 million more than requested, with a recommended construction budget of $1.43 billion, nearly double the Administration's request. The House initially proposed a decrease in funding for Columbia River fish mitigation activities. The Administration's request for Columbia River fish mitigation activities was reduced in the FY1999 budget. The House recommended $7.8 million, the Senate recommended $95 million, and the conference committee settled on $60 million. Funds are allocated for the John Day Reservoir drawdown study, Snake River feasibility study, and construction. Additionally, $5 million was included for an emergency outlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota. The Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-277) added funding for various Corps projects, including $35 million for Columbia River fish mitigation. It also prohibited the use of funds for draining Lake Powell or decommissioning the Glen Canyon Dam. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations included funds for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Reclamation manages over 600 dams in 17 western states, providing water for farmland and millions of people. It has shifted from dam construction to water resource management, focusing on safe and efficient operations while sustaining ecosystems and meeting water demands. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams in 17 western states to provide water for agriculture and urban areas. Despite the goal of addressing water demands while sustaining ecosystems, the agency faces challenges in changing water allocation policies due to existing laws and agreements. The Administration requested $852 million for FY1999, including $143.3 million for the California Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration program. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $852 million for FY1999, including $143.3 million for the California Bay-Delta Ecosystem Restoration program. The House-Senate conference agreement allocated $780.5 million for the Bureau, $71.5 million less than requested. The Animas-La Plata project received no new funding, with $3 million allocated for preconstruction work. The House-Senate conference agreement allocated $780.5 million for the Bureau of Reclamation for FY1999, $71.5 million less than requested. The conferees agreed upon $75 million for the CALFED program, which is $68.3 million less than requested. The conference agreement included $3 million for resource management and development for the Animas-La Plata project. The Senate Appropriations Committee report recommended a reduction of $3.5 million in fish and wildlife coordination, mitigation, and native species activities associated with the Central Arizona Project. The House Appropriations Committee report included directives to maintain budget levels for the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, restrict funds for evaluations of current water management practices, and explore consolidation of ecosystem restoration activities under the CVPIA. The Committee also urged better coordination of ecosystem activities under the CALFED program and CVPIA, while expressing concerns about the Bureau's shift towards water resources management and protection. The Senate bill increased solar and renewable funding by $70 million and decreased other programs by 1.6% in the Department of Energy's Energy and Water Development Appropriations. Research and Development Programs saw varying approved budgets, with the Conference agreeing upon $6.55 billion, 3.4% below the request but 8.1% above FY1998 levels. The conferees directed about $93.7 million to come from prior year funds for basic research programs under the Energy Resource R&D heading. Congress expressed concern about support for the Administration's Climate Change Technology Initiative. The Senate approved $415.3 million for the program, while the House approved $351.6 million. The appropriation was about 5% below the request but 20% above FY1998 levels. The House approved $351.6 million, including $47.9 million funded by BES, for DOE programs. The conference report added $60 million to renewable energy programs and provided $284 million for nuclear energy programs, $40 million below the DOE request. Additionally, $19 million was allocated for innovative nuclear energy research projects. The House approved funding for DOE programs, including $284 million for nuclear energy programs. The Senate supported efforts to encourage the operation of U.S. nuclear plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The DOE budget justification suggests that up to 47 million metric tons could be saved if nuclear plants operated longer. Critics argue that nuclear energy research proposals are wasteful subsidies. Funding for \"electrometallurgical treatment\" of DOE spent fuel is controversial, with $45 million allocated for the technology in FY1999. The treatment process involves separating highly radioactive isotopes from uranium and plutonium. Opponents claim the process is unnecessary and could be used for making nuclear weapons. The DOE budget includes funding for a joint U.S.-Russian project to develop an advanced reactor technology, the gas-turbine modular helium reactor, to destroy weapons plutonium. Russia must provide matching funds. DOE requested an 11.1% increase for basic research programs, with the largest increase for the Basic Energy Sciences program to begin construction of the spallation neutron source. The Senate appropriated $2.67 billion for the DOE science programs in FY1999, including funding for the construction of the spallation neutron source (SNS) and the large hadron collider project at CERN. The High Energy Physics program requested a $30 million increase for the U.S. contribution to the project. The Senate added $7 million to the science total recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee for FY1999. The final appropriation was about 6% over the FY1998 appropriation. The House approved $2.42 billion, 2.8% below the request but 5.6% above FY1998. The conference agreed to $2.70 billion, 2.5% below the request but 7.1% above FY1998, primarily due to the transfer of the Fusion Energy Science program to the Science programs. The SNS was approved for $130 million, $27 million below the request but above the House approved amount. The conferees approved $130 million for the SNS, $27 million below the request but above the House approved amount. Funds were included for completing R&D on the ITER project in the fusion budget, with a directive not to sign an extension without Congress' consent. The conferees also approved the House mark for high energy and nuclear physics programs, providing a small increase above the request. No funds were allocated for DOE's portion of the Next Generation Internet initiative. National Security R&D saw an 11.5% increase for Stockpile Stewardship and Maintenance over FY1998, with the Stockpile Stewardship program requesting a 17.8% increase for maintaining nuclear weapons stockpile safety and reliability without testing. The Senate and House approved reductions in funding for the Stockpile Stewardship program, with concerns about the accelerated strategic computing initiative (ASCI) growing faster than justified. The House committee expressed concerns about program management and extraneous activities. The House directed $305 million of prior year carryover balances to be used for the FY1998 appropriation. The conferees agreed on $2.14 billion for the Stockpile Stewardship program, with a $40 million reduction directed at the ASCI program and construction of new facilities. DOE was directed to conduct an independent cost assessment before expending any FY1999 funds on these projects. $5.58 billion was allocated for DOE's Environmental Management Program at defense-related sites, and $431 million for non-defense sites, in line with the DOE request. The FY1999 EM budget request includes $228 million for the \"privatization\" of DOE waste management projects, reflecting an accelerated cleanup strategy to close sites by 2006. $1 billion is allocated for site closure, including Rocky Flats, Fernald, and Grand Junction. The $1 billion allocated for site closure at Rocky Flats, Fernald, and Grand Junction in Colorado is part of the largest EM funding area totaling $2.74 billion. Despite an accelerated cleanup plan aiming for completion by 2006, some projects are projected to continue beyond that year, drawing opposition from environmental groups concerned about potential insufficient cleanups. DOE maintains that the requested funding should be sufficient for most sites, although there may be a small gap at some locations. The EM privatization funding request aims to meet compliance requirements at various sites by increasing efficiencies and closing funding gaps. Two-thirds of the funding would go towards Phase 1 of the Hanford Tank Waste Remediation System, with other projects including waste treatment at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The privatization effort seeks to reduce costs through competition and shifting project risks to contractors. Contractor profits would be tied to meeting project schedules and controlling costs. Under the privatization initiative, contractors would need to raise most of the funding for project facilities and equipment. They would earn profits by charging fees for services provided to the DOE, such as radioactive waste solidification. Profits would be based on performance, with potential for higher earnings than traditional DOE contracts. However, contractors could incur losses if project costs exceeded expectations or services were not delivered as required. DOE requested over $1 billion for privatized projects, but Congress only provided $200 million due to concerns about upfront funding for contracts not fully negotiated. DOE promised to submit proposed privatization contracts to Congress for review 30 days before signing, including anticipated costs, performance specifications, project schedules, and cost savings. The DOE requested over $1 billion for privatized projects, but Congress only provided $200 million due to concerns about upfront funding for contracts not fully negotiated. DOE promised to establish review teams for privatization projects, increase oversight training, and ensure contractors hire experienced personnel. The conferees cut the DOE privatization request by more than half. The conference report provides $358 million in FY1999 for developing a disposal site for highly radioactive spent fuel and weapons-related high-level waste, about the same as the FY1998 level. The Senate had voted to cut the request by $5 million, while the House held the program to level funding due to budget constraints. The FY1999 budget request was issued after DOE missed a statutory deadline to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites. The Department of Energy missed a statutory deadline in 1998 to start receiving waste from nuclear plant sites. They plan to begin receiving waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada by 2010 if the site is suitable. Nuclear utilities and state regulators have won court decisions against DOE for missing the deadline. The House and Senate passed bills for an interim waste storage facility near Yucca Mountain. The Clinton Administration opposes selecting Yucca Mountain for waste storage until its suitability for permanent disposal is confirmed. DOE aims to complete a viability assessment of the site in 1998. DOE missed a deadline to receive nuclear waste in 1998. They plan to assess Yucca Mountain's suitability for waste disposal by 2010. Legislation for an interim storage facility near Yucca Mountain was blocked in Congress. DOE lacks authority for temporary waste storage. Funding was requested for long-lead time activities for waste removal. $165 million for the nuclear waste program was directed from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Nuclear Waste Fund will provide funding for spent fuel disposal and high-level radioactive waste disposal from nuclear weapons production. Research on treating high-level radioactive waste with advanced particle accelerators will also be funded. Funding for the State of Nevada to monitor the Yucca Mountain Project was mostly rejected, with $5.5 million allocated to local governments for monitoring instead. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated $525 million for DOE's defense activities to address uranium and plutonium from Russian nuclear weapons. This includes purchasing natural uranium and funding facilities in Russia to convert plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel. Additionally, $325 million was provided for purchasing natural uranium associated with ongoing purchases of highly enriched uranium from Russian warheads. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated funds for DOE's defense activities to address uranium and plutonium from Russian nuclear weapons. This includes purchasing natural uranium and funding facilities in Russia to convert plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel. Additionally, $200 million was provided to implement a U.S.-Russian accord on disposition of plutonium from surplus nuclear weapons. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated funds for DOE's defense activities to address uranium and plutonium from Russian nuclear weapons. This includes purchasing natural uranium and funding facilities in Russia to convert plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel. The bill withholds plutonium funding until DOE submits a detailed budget justification and receives approval from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established in 1933 to bring electricity and development to a region encompassing parts of several states. The agency's electric power operations are self-supporting. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established in 1933 to bring electricity and development to a region encompassing parts of several states, including Kentucky and Tennessee. TVA's electric power operations are self-supporting, but it also manages non-power functions such as flood control, recreation, navigation, and an Environmental Research Center. TVA operates over 50 dams and reservoirs, including Land Between the Lakes, a 170,000-acre recreational area. In 1997, TVA Chairman Craven Crowell proposed that Congress stop appropriating funds for non-power activities starting in FY1999, with a budget of $106 million for these programs representing 2% of the agency's budget. An internal task force would recommend transferring these functions to other agencies. The TVA task force recommended transferring functions to other agencies and eliminating some. Chairman Crowell's proposal to reassign assets stirred controversy and challenged TVA's existence. Opponents argued shedding non-power programs would go against TVA's mission. The FY1998 Energy and Water Appropriations recommended a $70 million appropriation for TVA. The FY1998 Energy and Water Appropriations recommended a $70 million appropriation for TVA. For FY1999, the Administration requested $77 million for TVA non-power programs. The Senate funded TVA at $70 million, while the House bill provided no funding. Conferees adhered to the House position, not providing funding for Land Between the Lakes. If TVA deemed a rate increase necessary for funding, a report assessing transferring stewardship to the Army Corps of Engineers would be required. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriation Act (P.L. 105-277) restored $50 million to TVA non-power programs and included a debt-refinancing plan to save $100 million in interest payments over the next 10 years. The impact of this turnaround on TVA during the 106th Congress's consideration of electricity deregulation legislation is uncertain. Critics may push for extensive reorganization, while supporters believe reducing debt and operating more efficiently could lessen pressure in the next Congress. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received $470 million for FY 1999, slightly below the budget request. The funding includes activities such as regulating nuclear reactors and overseeing nuclear materials users. The Senate initially proposed $466 million, which was criticized for potential employee cuts. The full Committee reversed the cut but criticized NRC for not updating its regulatory system to improve nuclear industry safety. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received $463 million for FY 1999, slightly lower than the budget request. The House and Senate criticized NRC for inconsistencies in regional offices, interference with nuclear plant management, and outdated review processes. Both chambers supported NRC eventually taking over safety regulation of DOE nuclear facilities. The conferees allocated $3.2 million for regulatory reviews of DOE facilities and $4.8 million for the NRC inspector general's office. The budget would continue to be offset by fees on nuclear power plants and licensed entities. The conferees extended the agency's fee-collection authority for one year, with DOE reimbursing NRC for oversight of high-level nuclear waste disposal program. Various CRS reports on nuclear waste disposal, renewable energy, fusion energy, DOE programs, and budget were included."
