The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) was signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2015. It provided $66.000 billion for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, with increases in funding for various departments compared to the previous year. The FY2016-enacted appropriation for CJS is 5.0% greater than the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations recommendations.

The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 includes a 25.9% increase in funding for the Census Bureau compared to FY2015, and an 11.6% increase in funding for NIST, largely due to increased funding for Industrial Technology Services and Construction of Research Facilities.

Congress provided $1.244 billion for the Commercial Crew program in the Space Operations account. Table 1 and Table 2 show detailed appropriations for FY2015 and historical data for FY2006-FY2015. Inflation-adjusted appropriations for CJS increased from FY2006 to FY2009, peaking at $76.782 billion with ARRA funding. Without ARRA, appropriations peaked in FY2010 at $69.146 billion. ARRA provided a significant boost in FY2009, equal to 25% of regular appropriations. Appropriations decreased in the following years, with flat funding in FY2014 and FY2015, higher than FY2013. Sequestration impacted funding levels. Appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and NSF in FY2013-FY2015 were generally at the same level as in FY2006. FY2009-2011 saw increases due to more funding for the Department of Commerce for the 2010 census. Decreased appropriations for Commerce explain the overall decrease in funding since FY2010. The overall decrease in CJS appropriations since FY2010 is explained by cuts in funding for DOJ and NASA. DOJ's FY2015 appropriation is 4.4% below its FY2010 appropriation, while NASA's FY2014 appropriation was 3.8% below its FY2010 appropriation. Despite receiving less in FY2015 than in FY2010, NASA's FY2015 appropriation is $1.379 billion more than its FY2006 appropriation. Congress appropriated $5.316 billion more for DOJ in FY2015 than in FY2006, mainly for federal law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts. Funding for the NSF has generally increased. Funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF) has mostly increased over the past 10 fiscal years, with appropriations rising in 8 out of 10 years between FY2006 and FY2015. The decrease in funding for FY2013 was due to sequestration, but overall, Congress has been increasing funding for the NSF's Research and Related Activities account."
