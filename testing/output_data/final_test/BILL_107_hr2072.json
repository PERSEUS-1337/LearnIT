    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Science for Nuclear Waste Disposal Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that the Yucca Mountain central repository project is estimated to cost $58 billion, making it one of the most expensive public works projects globally. Geological and hydrological conditions at Yucca Mountain suggest it is not suitable for a central repository, and safety regulations have been adjusted to make it seem feasible. Storing high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain would involve transporting 70,000 tons of nuclear waste through 43 States and numerous cities, posing a risk to 50 million Americans. However, current nuclear power reactor sites can safely store waste for another 100 years, eliminating the immediate need for a central repository. The US has the capability to find long-term solutions. The United States can explore emerging technologies to neutralize highly radioactive waste, instead of storing it in a central repository. The Nuclear Waste Fund has accumulated over $10 billion for this purpose, but the concept of a central repository has scientific evidence against it and poses health and safety risks. The Nuclear Waste Fund should be used for research and development of alternative waste storage technologies to protect the environment. Congress should end the Yucca Mountain Project due to insurmountable problems and focus on developing safe nuclear waste disposal technologies. The Nuclear Waste Fund is established for research and development of alternative waste storage technologies to protect the environment. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to provide for payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund for use as specified in the section. This includes redesignating paragraphs and adjusting costs. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to support uses described in subsection (c) by adjusting fees to fully cover those uses and annually adjusting for inflation. The Secretary will propose adjustments to fees to Congress and the Energy Policy. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to adjust fees for uses described in subsection (c) and propose fee adjustments to Congress. Subsections (b) and (d) are struck, with subsections (c) and (e) redesignated. Additional changes are made to subsection (b) as part of the amendments. The Nuclear Waste Fund is available for research and development of risk-decreasing technologies to safely store nuclear waste for longer periods at designated sites. The Waste Disposal Act of 2001 aims to minimize transportation of nuclear waste, reduce radiation levels, and prohibits the use of funds for a central high-level radioactive waste repository. The Waste Disposal Act of 2001 aims to minimize transportation of nuclear waste, reduce radiation levels, and prohibits the use of funds for a central high-level radioactive waste repository. SEC. 4. REPEALS AND REDESIGNATIONS. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended by repealing titles I, II, IV, and V, and making conforming amendments to various sections. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to redefine paragraphs and introduce new definitions related to research and risk-decreasing technologies. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended by redefining paragraphs and introducing new definitions related to research and risk-decreasing technologies. Subsection (c) is redesignated as subsection (b) and subsection (b) is struck, with corresponding amendments to the table of contents. SEC. 5. REPEAL OF SPECIAL RULES FOR NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING COSTS. Section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is repealed, with conforming amendments to other sections. Effective upon enactment of this Act."
