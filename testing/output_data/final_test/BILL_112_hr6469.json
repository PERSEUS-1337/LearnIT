    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Soledad Canyon Mine Mitigation and Relocation Act of 2012\". The Soledad Canyon area has been used for mining construction aggregate since the 1960s and was classified as a significant resource area by California in 1987. The construction sand and gravel industry in the US is valued at over $5.9 billion, with California leading in sand and gravel production. Sand and gravel are mainly used for concrete aggregates (41%) and road base (25%). Two Federal contracts issued in 1990 authorize the extraction of 56,000,000 tons of sand and gravel from Soledad Canyon near Santa Clarita, California. The contracts were awarded to Transit Mixed Concrete, a subsidiary of Southdown. Sand and gravel are used for various purposes including road base, construction fill, asphalt, plaster, and miscellaneous products. CEMEX acquired Southdown, parent company of Transit Mixed Concrete, in 2000, holding Federal contracts for Soledad Canyon Mine. The Bureau of Land Management approved a mining plan with an environmental impact statement addressing concerns about air quality, health, truck traffic, and property values in Santa Clarita. The final statement, released in June 2000, listed eight alternatives for mining the site. Los Angeles County was required to take action in response. The county of Los Angeles prepared an environmental impact report for mining in Soledad Canyon under the California Environmental Quality Act. Despite the release of the final report in April 2001, the County Board of Supervisors denied a mining permit in early 2002, citing the need for environmental protection. Multiple lawsuits involving Santa Clarita and Los Angeles County were filed between 2002 and 2004. Exhibit H to the Consent Decree from the settlement of CEMEX Inc. v. County of Los Angeles outlines 40 conditions for CEMEX to mitigate environmental concerns in Santa Clarita. Congressman Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon introduced bills related to the Soledad Canyon Mine. Congressman Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon introduced bills related to the Soledad Canyon Mine, including H.R. 3060, H.R. 679, H.R. 3529, and H.R. 5471 to address mining permits and leasing laws. The Soledad Canyon Mine Act aims to cancel two mining permits, provide financial opportunities in exchange for invested value, and prohibit mining above historical levels in Soledad Canyon. The Soledad Canyon Mine Act aims to cancel mining permits, prohibit future mining in Soledad Canyon, provide compensation to CEMEX for cancelled contracts, verify expenses incurred by CEMEX, and establish timelines for compensation determination. The Soledad Canyon High Desert, California Public Lands Conservation and Management Act of 2009 aims to cancel mining contracts, withdraw areas from further mineral entry, and provide compensation to CEMEX for the cancelled contracts. Congressman McKeon played a key role in the agreement between CEMEX and the city of Santa Clarita, known as the \"Principles of Cooperation,\" which prevented mining permits and aimed for a legislative solution. Congressman McKeon was informed by Congressman Doc Hastings that H.R. 4332 was considered a congressional earmark under the Rules of the House of Representatives for the 112th Congress. Clause 9(e) of rule XXI defines a congressional earmark as a provision included primarily at the request of a Member, providing specific spending authority for various purposes. The curr_chunk states that a provision is considered a congressional earmark if it provides specific spending authority to an entity or targeted to a specific location, rather than through a competitive award process. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management, is required to conduct a study on the steps needed to implement the goals of a specific bill. A report with recommendations must be submitted to the House and Senate committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act."
