The Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Act of 2006 includes findings from President George W. Bush and former President William J. Clinton on the importance of educating youth for global engagement. Congress established the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program to promote international understanding. The Commission has recommended expanding study abroad opportunities for US students, especially in developing nations. Studies show US students lag behind in global knowledge, which is a disadvantage in today's globalized world. The majority of Americans believe it is important for their children to learn other languages and study abroad. In a 2005 survey, it was found that learning other languages, studying abroad, and interacting with international students are crucial for preparing students for the global age. The United States needs to be a responsible leader with informed citizens who possess knowledge of the world. Study abroad is effective in developing international competency among students. In the 2003-2004 academic year, around 16,910,000 students were estimated to have studied abroad. In the 2003-2004 academic year, only 1 percent of US postsecondary students studied abroad for academic credit, with less than 10 percent of bachelor's degree graduates having studied abroad. There is a need for more study abroad programs in developing countries, as 61 percent of US students studying abroad in that year went to Europe. In 2003-2004, only 1% of US postsecondary students studied abroad for academic credit, with less than 10% of bachelor's degree graduates having studied abroad. 46% of US students studying abroad went to Europe, with the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France being popular destinations. The Senate designated 2006 as the Year of Study Abroad to raise awareness of its importance. More study abroad programs are needed to promote national leadership, international effectiveness, and economic competitiveness. To democratize study abroad and make it accessible to all undergraduate students, regardless of their background, institutional barriers at the campus level need to be addressed. This includes removing obstacles related to field of study, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and gender. According to reports, these barriers hinder the integration of study abroad into undergraduate education. The Institute of International Education highlights the low percentages of African-American, Asian-American, and other minority students participating in study abroad programs. The percentages of African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic-American students studying abroad are low compared to their representation in the general student population. Students in social sciences, humanities, and foreign languages dominate study abroad programs, while those in engineering, mathematics, computer science, and education are underrepresented. Only 10.7% of business majors, 8% of engineering majors, and 5.9% of education majors in the US have studied abroad. The Act aims to encourage 1,000,000 undergraduate students to study abroad within 10 years and establish the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program to reflect the demographics of the US undergraduate population. The Act aims to increase study abroad opportunities for undergraduate students, especially in nontraditional destinations and developing countries, and make these opportunities accessible to students from diverse types of institutions. The Act defines key terms such as \"institution of higher education\" and \"minority-serving institution\" as specified in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State. The Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program is established. The Secretary is authorized to establish the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program for undergraduate students to study abroad for academic credit through fellowships and grants to institutions of higher education. The Lincoln Institutional Leverage Grants enable higher education institutions to award fellowships to students for studying abroad and reform academic programs. Grants must be used primarily for student fellowships. The Secretary ensures that fellowships awarded for study abroad reflect US demographics and increase in nontraditional destinations, especially in developing countries. Consultation with experienced organizations is done for program development of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program. The Secretary may integrate activities of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Program with other federal study abroad initiatives supported by various government departments. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes necessary sums for fiscal year 2008 and the following 4 years, with 25% allocated to section 4(a)(1) and 75% to section 4(a)(2) annually."
