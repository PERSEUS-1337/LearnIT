Congress acknowledges the significant impact of international family planning programs, which have increased the use of modern contraceptives in developing countries. US funding supports services for 20 million couples in the world's poorest nations, improving maternal health, reducing deaths, and enhancing family well-being. The US spends three cents per American per week on these programs. In developing countries, modern contraceptives reduce unintended pregnancies and abortion rates by 85%. President George W. Bush advocates for quality family planning programs to prevent abortion. 120 million married couples in developing countries lack access to modern contraception. In sub-Saharan Africa, 46% of women wanting to delay or end childbearing lack access to family planning. Over 525,000 women die annually from pregnancy-related causes. Approximately 525,000 women die annually from pregnancy-related causes, with 99% of deaths in developing countries. Lack of birth spacing increases maternal death risk by 250%, while spacing of at least 36 months is safest for infants. 10.8 million children under five die each year, with access to modern contraception potentially preventing 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 maternal deaths annually. Family planning programs linked with HIV/AIDS prevention help meet health needs efficiently. For HIV-positive women, family planning is crucial to prevent unintended pregnancies and maternal deaths. Rapid population growth strains vital resources, leading to poverty, disease, and environmental destruction. Malnutrition in children and mothers contributes to high mortality rates. US-funded family planning programs help conserve natural resources, improve food security, and support healthy families. Without meeting family planning needs, the population in developing countries is projected to grow significantly by 2050. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is to partner with developing countries to expand access to voluntary family planning programs and modern contraceptives to achieve various goals such as reducing maternal and child mortality, unintended pregnancies, HIV transmission, and improving food security while conserving natural resources. The sense of Congress is to partner with developing countries to expand access to voluntary family planning programs and modern contraceptives to achieve goals like reducing maternal and child mortality, unintended pregnancies, HIV transmission, and improving food security through public health initiatives that provide training, research, and services for a wide variety of modern contraceptives and family planning methods designed and implemented based on community participation, beneficiary needs and values, and voluntary participation and informed consent principles. Assistance is provided to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorize the President to provide assistance to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries through the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes assistance to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries, including public knowledge, support for various programs, and training for healthcare providers and educators. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of improved coordination between voluntary family planning programs and programs receiving US Government assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention, mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention, and care for those affected by HIV/AIDS. This aims to strengthen activities and enhance cost-effectiveness. The curr_chunk focuses on strengthening supply chain logistics for the procurement and distribution of modern contraceptives in developing countries with acute family planning and maternal health needs. Priority is given based on criteria such as unmet need for family planning and fertility rates. The curr_chunk highlights key indicators such as fertility rates, high-risk birth rates, maternal mortality rates, infant and child mortality rates, abortion rates, HIV/AIDS prevalence in women, and additional criteria like conflict or humanitarian crises. The authority to provide assistance under section 104(b)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added by subsection (a), applies with respect to fiscal year 2007 and subsequent fiscal years. SEC. 5. REPORT. The President shall submit a report biennially to the House Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the implementation of section 104(b)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The report will detail efforts, programs, and impact assessments related to the policies outlined in the Act. The President shall submit a biennial report to the House and Senate Committees on International Relations and Foreign Relations on the implementation of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The report will include estimates of annual expenditures on modern contraceptives, assessments of unmet needs, availability, and use of contraception, allocations of contraceptives in family planning assistance, and descriptions of funded quality. The biennial report to Congress includes estimates of expenditures on modern contraceptives, assessments of unmet needs, availability, and use of contraception, and descriptions of funded quality voluntary family planning programs. Voluntary family planning programs are effective in addressing individual health needs.
