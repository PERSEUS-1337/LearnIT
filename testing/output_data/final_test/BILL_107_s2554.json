The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 establishes the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which deputizes qualified pilots as Federal law enforcement officers to defend commercial aircraft against criminal violence or air piracy. The program is administered in connection with the Federal air marshal program. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program deputizes qualified pilots as law enforcement officers to defend aircraft. Pilots must be employed by an air carrier, demonstrate fitness, and undergo an employment investigation. Training, supervision, and equipment are provided at no cost to the pilot or carrier. The Under Secretary may approve private training programs for pilots to become Federal flight deck officers. Air carriers must accommodate pilot training and support officers in their duties. The Under Secretary will train and deputize qualified pilots, including former military or law enforcement personnel, as Federal flight deck officers within 120 days of enactment. The Under Secretary will deputize qualified pilots, including former military or law enforcement personnel, as Federal flight deck officers within 24 months of enactment. Pilots in the program will not receive compensation from the Federal Government. The Under Secretary will authorize officers to carry firearms to defend the flight deck of commercial aircraft. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 allows Federal flight deck officers to use force, including lethal force, to defend commercial aircraft if security is at risk. Air carriers are not liable for damages related to employing these officers or their actions in defending the aircraft. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 allows Federal flight deck officers to defend aircraft against criminal violence or air piracy without liability, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Federal flight deck officers are considered government employees while acting in defense of the aircraft. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 authorizes Federal flight deck officers to protect aircraft from criminal violence or air piracy without liability, with regulations to be issued by the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security within 90 days. The term \"pilot\" in this context includes individuals responsible for operating an aircraft. The Federal flight deck officer program is amended to include qualified pilots deputized as officers for flight deck security. Section 128 of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act regarding flight deck security is repealed.

The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 makes technical amendments to title 49, United States Code, including redesignating subsections and amending the Aviation Crewmember Self-Defense Division. The Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 requires detailed training for air carrier cabin crew members to prepare them for potential threat conditions. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security must consult with law enforcement, security, and terrorism experts, as well as air carriers and labor organizations. Additionally, an Aviation Crewmember Self-Defense Division will be established within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Aviation Crew Self-Defense Division will be established by the Secretary of Transportation for Security within the Transportation Security Administration. The Division will implement requirements and be headed by a Director with a background in self-defense training. Recommendations for the Director will be sought from law enforcement, air carriers, and labor organizations. The Aviation Crew Self-Defense Division, under the control of the Director, will provide training in self-defense and appropriate use of force. The training program includes 28 hours of self-defense training with elements such as determining seriousness of incidents, crew communication, and hands-on defense training. The Aviation Crew Self-Defense Division provides hands-on training in self-defense over a 4-week period, covering awareness, verbalization, control, weapons, deadly force, use of protective devices, psychology of terrorists, and live situational simulation joint training. The Aviation Crew Self-Defense Division offers training in self-defense, including live situational simulation joint training exercises and flight deck procedures for defending the aircraft. Program elements for instructors include a certification program and a requirement for a minimum instructor-to-student ratio. Air carriers must provide instructor information. Air carriers must provide instructor information, training course curriculum, lesson plans, and performance objectives to the Aviation Crew Member Self-Defense Division. Recurrent training must be conducted every 6 months, with initial training to be completed within 24 months of the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 mandates air carriers to provide discreet, hands-free communication devices for flight and cabin crew. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security must prescribe regulations within 180 days after the enactment of the Act. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 requires air carriers to provide training for cabin searches and conduct preflight security briefings. Air carriers are not liable for damages in actions related to defending against criminal violence or air piracy. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002 mandates training for cabin crew in defending against criminal violence or air piracy. The act also includes a provision for a study on the use of nonlethal weapons by cabin crew to assist flight deck crew in combating threats. The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted under the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act of 2002."
