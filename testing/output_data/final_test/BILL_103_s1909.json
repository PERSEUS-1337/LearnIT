    "content": "The \"Child Support Enforcement Act of 1994\" may hold occupational, professional, and business licenses as stated in Title I. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act of 1994\" allows states to restrict occupational licenses for noncustodial parents with outstanding warrants or delinquent child support payments. The \"Child Support Enforcement Act of 1994\" allows states to restrict occupational licenses for noncustodial parents with outstanding warrants or delinquent child support payments. A Federal agency may not issue or renew any occupational, professional, or business license of an individual who is delinquent in child support payment without consent from the obligee, obligee's attorney, or a State prosecutor responsible for child support enforcement. An expedited review can grant a 60-day temporary license in cases of undue hardship. The prosecutor or court can release a license hold for child support enforcement, or an expedited review can grant a 60-day temporary license. This does not apply if undue hardship is shown. SEC. 102. DENIAL OF FEDERAL BENEFITS, LOANS, GUARANTEES, AND EMPLOYMENT TO CERTAIN PERSONS WITH LARGE CHILD SUPPORT ARREARAGES. Under this provision, federal agencies cannot provide benefits, loans, or guarantees to individuals with child support arrearages over $1,000 who are not in compliance with repayment plans. Exceptions can be made for cases of undue hardship. Additionally, individuals with large child support arrearages may be considered ineligible for employment. An individual may be ineligible for Federal Government employment if they have child support arrearages exceeding $1,000 and are not complying with a repayment plan. Exceptions can be made for undue hardship cases. Regulations for executive branch positions will be set by the President or their designee. The regulations for child support in Federal Government employment positions are determined by different branches: the President for executive positions, the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House for legislative positions, and the Chief Justice of the United States for judicial positions. The term \"child support\" is defined according to the Social Security Act. The Secretary of State can deny passports to noncustodial parents with outstanding state arrest warrants for child support nonpayment of at least $10,000. Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act is amended to allow sharing information with state agencies for child support purposes, and there are provisions for national reporting of new hires and child support information. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, will establish a system for reporting new employees by requiring employers to provide a copy of each new employee's W-4 form to the state's child support enforcement agency. The W-4 form will be modified to include information on child support obligations, payment methods, and health insurance availability. TITLE II--INTERSTATE CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT\n\nSEC. 201. INTERSTATE RECOGNITION OF CHILD SUPPORT AND PARENTAGE ORDERS. Section 1738B of Title 28, US Code, provides full faith and credit to child support and parentage orders. It defines terms like 'child,' 'child support,' and 'child support order.' A court decree mandates payment of child support, including permanent and temporary orders, initial orders, modifications, ongoing support, and arrearages. Terms like 'child's State,' 'contestant,' and 'court' are defined in relation to child support orders. The term 'home State' refers to the state where a child lived with parents for at least 6 consecutive months. 'Individual acting as a parent' is someone other than a parent with physical custody of a child. The term 'State' includes various regions within the United States. Courts in each State must uphold child support orders and parentage adjudications against individuals under their jurisdiction, without modifying them unless specified. A court of a State may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident contestant if consistent with state and federal constitutions. The court retains jurisdiction over child support orders and parentage adjudications as long as the state remains the child's state or the contestant's residence, unless modified by another state. Before issuing orders, contestants must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard. Another state can modify orders issued by a different state under specific conditions. A court of a State can modify a child support order or an order adjudicating parentage issued by another State if both contestants consent and the court has jurisdiction. The court can enforce the order for past obligations if it no longer has exclusive jurisdiction. Additionally, a State court cannot exercise jurisdiction in a child support or parentage proceeding if another State is already handling the case, unless specific conditions are met. In child support or parentage proceedings, a State court can modify orders issued by another State with consent and jurisdiction. The forum State's law applies in establishing, modifying, or enforcing child support orders. The court of the State issuing the order interprets it, and in enforcement actions, the statute of limitations applies. In child support or parentage proceedings, the statute of limitations under the laws of the forum State or the issuing State, whichever is longer, shall apply. Title III of the Social Security Act addresses hiding assets through fraudulent transfers in child support cases. It introduces procedures that presume any property transfer by an individual with child support arrears is done to avoid payment, unless proven otherwise. The Social Security Act introduces procedures to void fraudulent property transfers made to avoid child support obligations."
