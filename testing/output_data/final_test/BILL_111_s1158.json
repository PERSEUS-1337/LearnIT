    "content": "The \"SMA Treatment Acceleration Act of 2009\" establishes a Clinical Trials Network for Spinal Muscular Atrophy under the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will establish a national clinical trials network for spinal muscular atrophy to conduct coordinated trials and disseminate findings efficiently. The Director of NIH will establish a data coordinating center for spinal muscular atrophy to provide expert assistance in research projects, conduct monitoring activities, and provide regular reports to relevant institutes and the FDA. The Director of NIH will expand pre-clinical translation research programs related to spinal muscular atrophy in coordination with other Institutes. The National Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patient Registry will be enhanced to support epidemiological research for improving awareness, management, treatment, and prevention of the disease. Longitudinal data on individuals of all ages with spinal muscular atrophy will be collected and analyzed. Additionally, an Interagency Spinal Muscular Atrophy Research Coordinating Committee will be established. The Public Health Service Act will be further amended to establish an Interagency Spinal Muscular Atrophy Research Coordinating Committee. The Interagency Spinal Muscular Atrophy Research Coordinating Committee (Committee) will be established by the Secretary within 6 months of the enactment of this section. The Committee will share information, coordinate research activities, and develop a strategy for spinal muscular atrophy and related neurological diseases. The Committee will provide annual reports to the Secretary on collaborative research efforts to support spinal muscular atrophy, including ongoing and future research needs and recommendations to improve collaboration among national research institutes and centers. The Committee will develop a summary of advances in research related to spinal muscular atrophy and other neurological diseases, make recommendations to improve research activities, and suggest changes to the research portfolio of the National Institutes of Health to support research priorities. The Committee will focus on identifying barriers to developing new treatments for spinal muscular atrophy and other neurological diseases, increasing public participation in research decisions, disseminating progress information, and expanding partnerships between public and private entities. The Committee aims to expand collaborative research on spinal muscular atrophy and other related neurological disorders. The membership includes voting Federal representatives such as the Directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. The Committee includes the Director of the National Institutes of Health, national research institutes, national centers, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and heads of other relevant agencies and advisory committees as determined by the Secretary. The Committee includes representatives from various federal agencies involved in neurological research and support services for individuals with spinal muscular atrophy. Additionally, there are 9 voting members appointed under paragraph (2), and 6 additional voting members appointed by the Secretary. The Committee includes 9 voting members appointed under paragraph (2) and 6 additional voting members appointed by the Secretary. The 6 members appointed from scientists, physicians, and health professionals must represent multiple disciplines, different geographical regions, and have experience in scientific peer review. 3 members appointed from the general public represent individuals with specific backgrounds. The Committee for spinal muscular atrophy includes nonvoting members determined by the Secretary. Voting members select a chairperson from Federal members and meet at least once a year. The Secretary reviews the Committee's necessity biennially. The Secretary will establish a program to provide information and education on spinal muscular atrophy to health professionals and the public, including advances in screening, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as training for healthcare providers."
