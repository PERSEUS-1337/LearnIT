Congress finds that eliminating avoidable hospital readmissions is crucial for improving quality of care and reducing healthcare costs. Measures by CMS should accurately reflect care quality without lowering expectations for certain hospitals. Socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, and current programs like the Medicare readmission reduction program do not adjust for these influences effectively. Socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and limited resources, have significant impacts on avoidable hospital readmissions. The Medicare hospital readmission reduction program needs to adjust for these factors to accurately measure quality of care. Research shows that socioeconomic factors can influence readmissions as much or more than clinical variables. Research has shown that adjusting for socioeconomic status in the Medicare hospital readmission reduction program is crucial for accurately assessing the quality of care provided by hospitals. Failure to do so can lead to unfair penalization of hospitals serving low-income populations. Risk adjustment for socioeconomic status will improve care quality, increase accountability, and reduce preventable readmissions nationwide. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should implement these adjustments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services should consider adopting socioeconomic adjustment methodologies in other Medicare quality reporting and pay-for-performance programs. Improvements to the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Improvements to the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program include amending Section 1886(q) of the Social Security Act to adjust readmissions based on socioeconomic status for payments starting on October 1, 2016. The Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program will adjust readmissions based on socioeconomic status for payments starting on October 1, 2016, utilizing recent data from the Bureau of the Census to develop a quantitative method. The Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program will adjust readmissions based on socioeconomic status for payments starting on October 1, 2016, utilizing recent data from the Bureau of the Census to develop a quantitative method. Inputs used should address specific factors. The Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program will consider income, education level, and poverty rate to adjust readmissions for payments starting on October 1, 2016. The Secretary may revise inputs for a quantitative method annually to improve adjustment accuracy under the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. The Secretary may measure the socioeconomic status of patients served by each hospital and supplement incomplete patient-level data with geographic region data. Alternative adjustment methods can be used for payments for discharges under certain circumstances. For discharges after October 1, 2017, the Secretary can use a different socioeconomic status adjustment method, like peer groupings and stratification, before conducting a comparative analysis. The Secretary can conduct a comparative analysis of an alternative adjustment method and publish the results in the Federal Register for public comment. The Secretary may consider an alternative adjustment method for the hospital readmissions reduction program if it shows improved accuracy and effectiveness compared to the current adjustment method. Additionally, information on the results of the analysis should be included in the report. The Secretary will make adjustments to base operating DRG payment amounts for hospitals to ensure that readmission measures and penalties do not result in aggregate payments exceeding or falling below estimated amounts for a fiscal year."
