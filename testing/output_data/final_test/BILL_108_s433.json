The Clearwater Basin pilot project in Idaho authorizes stewardship contracts for high priority activities recommended by an advisory panel. The Clearwater Basin pilot project in Idaho authorizes stewardship contracts for high priority activities recommended by an advisory panel. Within two years of enactment, the panel will develop schedules for activities in the pilot project area for the next five years, in consultation with the Forest Supervisor and Nez Perce Tribe. The Forest Service must ensure that activities in the schedules align with treaty obligations to the Nez Perce Tribe. Each five-year schedule should detail high priority activities in the pilot project area and their timing for implementation, allowing for environmental evaluation. Activities in the schedules must be consistent with the forest plan. The Forest Service must align activities in the five-year schedules with treaty obligations to the Nez Perce Tribe. The schedules should detail high priority activities in the pilot project area and their timing for implementation, consistent with the forest plan. NEPA procedures must be followed for approval of activities in each schedule, tiered to the environmental impact statement for the forest plan. The Forest Service, along with other Federal agencies, must complete reviews and consultations within one year of issuing a public scoping notice for proposed schedules. Adequate resources must be provided to avoid delays in implementation. The Forest Service and other agencies must complete reviews and consultations within one year for proposed schedules, without delaying forest management activities. Failure to complete the process within the required timeframe will not delay the approval or implementation of activities if deemed sufficient by the Forest Supervisor and advisory panel. The advisory panel, after sufficient review and consultation, submits final recommendations to the Forest Supervisor for approval at least 30 days before implementation of activities. The Forest Supervisor must review and make a decision within 30 days of receiving the schedule and record. Upon receiving final recommendations from the advisory panel, the Forest Supervisor must issue a decision document within 30 days regarding the recommended schedule. The Supervisor may approve or disapprove the schedule, with the latter requiring further consideration. If no decision is made within the 30-day period, the schedule is deemed approved and can be appealed under Department of Agriculture procedures. Upon approval of the schedule, the Forest Service may issue permits, contracts, or authorizations for activities without further review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Activities not included in the schedule may be approved on an individual or group basis, and the schedule can be amended following the required review process. The five-year schedules and activities authorized under the pilot project shall supplement other schedules, plans, and projects. Activities from other schedules or plans may be authorized under the pilot project if they meet the requirements for high priority activities. SEC. 5. MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The advisory panel may compile regulations deemed inappropriate, incompatible, or burdensome for the pilot project. The Secretary will monitor and report on the project annually to the Senate and House Committees on Energy and Natural Resources and Resources. The House of Representatives will receive detailed reports on the pilot project's funds, activities, and results. The State of Idaho will prepare a report every five years on the project's achievements, to be submitted to the Secretary and relevant committees. The pilot project under review is meeting stewardship objectives effectively. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary is authorized to receive necessary appropriations through fiscal year 2012 for various purposes related to the pilot project, including developing schedules, providing technical assistance, monitoring requirements, and implementing the Act. Appropriated amounts shall remain available until expended.
