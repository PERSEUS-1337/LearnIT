    "content": "The \"Online Voter Registration Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that Americans are increasingly using the Internet for various purposes such as gathering information, making purchases, and accessing government services. In 2008, 74% of adults in the US used the Internet for tasks like finding information, online shopping, reading news, and online banking. The Internet is effective for individuals to provide and update personal information. Many States offer online government services like renewing licenses and registering cars. Arizona and Washington have online voter registration systems, with Washington seeing a 20% increase in online registrations compared to mail-in cards. Young adults are utilizing online voter registration systems. Younger adults, especially those aged 18 to 29, are proficient Internet users and prefer to complete tasks online. Washington State had the highest rate of online voter registration among voters aged 18 to 24 in 2008, processing around 130,000 transactions during that election cycle. Implementing online voter registration systems requires an initial investment for technology and data input, with Washington State spending $278,000 to establish its system. Once in place, these systems facilitate new registrations and address changes. Washington State implemented an online voter registration system that saved $32,500 for the 2008 general election and reduced postage costs by $54,600, resulting in total savings of over $87,000 for the state and consumers. The system requires no staff processing and has no per transaction cost. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"election,\" \"participating State,\" and \"State.\" SEC. 4. ONLINE VOTER REGISTRATION GRANT PROGRAM. This section establishes the Online Voter Registration grant program. The Election Assistance Commission establishes an Online Voter Registration grant program to make grants to participating States for implementing online voter registration systems. Grants cannot reimburse costs incurred before October 1, 2009. States must submit an application to participate, and the program specifies the amount and awarding of implementation grants. The Election Assistance Commission's Online Voter Registration grant program provides implementation grants to participating States. Each State receives a $150,000 grant without fiscal year limitation. The Commission awards one grant per state annually. The Online Voter Registration grant program requires participating States to establish and implement an online voter registration system over a 5-year period. The Election Assistance Commission provides best practices, technical assistance, and reports to help States with implementation. The Online Voter Registration grant program mandates participating States to implement online voter registration systems over 5 years. The Election Assistance Commission must submit annual and final reports to Congress on program implementation, along with recommendations for legislative or administrative actions.
