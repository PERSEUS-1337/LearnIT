    "content": "The Latin America and Caribbean region has seen political development progress with regular free and fair elections in most countries. Challenges include poverty, conflicts, drug trafficking, and high crime rates. Weaknesses in public services and accountability persist. The global financial crisis negatively impacted economies in the region. Several nations held elections for head of government in 2007 and 2008. In 2008, elections were held in Barbados, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Paraguay. Incumbent parties were defeated in parliamentary elections in Barbados, Belize, and Grenada. Paraguay saw the victory of opposition candidate Fernando Lugo in presidential elections, while the Dominican Republic re-elected President Leonel Fernandez. The Latin America and Caribbean region experienced economic growth with a 6.1% average growth rate in 2004. In 2004, Latin America and the Caribbean region saw an estimated average growth rate of 6.1%, surpassing predictions. Countries like Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela experienced significant economic growth. Per capita income for the region increased by almost 5%. Subsequent years saw growth rates of 4.9% in 2005, 5.8% in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, Panama and Antigua and Barbuda had the highest growth rates at 11.5% and 10% respectively. Other countries had growth rates between 8-9%. Belize, Jamaica, and St. Lucia had the lowest growth rates at just over 1%. The global financial crisis in 2008 had a significant negative impact on the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, with economic growth slowing to 4.6% in 2008. The forecast for 2009 is 1.9%, with some countries like Mexico expecting a contraction. The recession led to a drop in demand for exports, tourism, and commodity prices, affecting nations dependent on exports. Remittances from the US and other countries also declined, with overall tightening of financial conditions expected to lead to a decrease in foreign direct investment. The overall tightening of financial conditions globally will reduce foreign direct investment flows to the Andean region. Politically, challenges persist with the rise of populism in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela won a six-year term in 2006 but lost a 2007 referendum to remove term limits. Bolivia's President Evo Morales, elected in 2005, strained U.S. relations by decriminalizing coca growing. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa, elected in 2006, aims to reform the political system and renegotiate foreign debt. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa aims to reform the political system, renegotiate foreign debt, and assert state control over foreign oil companies. In Colombia, President Alvaro Uribe has made progress in combating drug trafficking and terrorist groups, including the demobilization of paramilitaries and setbacks for the FARC. Tensions rose in 2008 after Colombia's bombing of a FARC camp in Ecuador, raising questions about potential ties to Ecuador and Venezuela. In Central America, countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua are emerging from challenges. In Central America, countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua are facing violent crime despite democratic institutions being more firmly entrenched. Honduras and Nicaragua are among the poorest countries in the region. In Guatemala, the center-left government of Alvaro Colom took office in 2008 amidst concerns about violence during the elections. In Nicaragua, former President Daniel Ortega's government has faced criticism for lack of transparency and authoritarian actions. The diverse Caribbean region faces significant challenges, including the AIDS epidemic, vulnerability to hurricanes, and economic struggles. Haiti, the poorest nation in the hemisphere, continues to grapple with economic, political, and security issues. Cuba's political succession from Fidel to Ra\u00fal Castro has been stable since 2006. Since Ra\u00fal Castro assumed the presidency in 2008, Cuba has implemented significant economic changes while maintaining tight political control. The United States has diverse interests in Latin America and the Caribbean, with strong economic ties as a major trading partner and source of foreign investment for most countries in the region. Free trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, Chile, and Central America further solidify these economic linkages. The United States has strong economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean through free trade agreements with various countries in the region. Migration, both legal and illegal, is a significant issue, with geographic proximity and economic conditions playing a role. Curbing drug flow from Mexico and South America is a key focus, and concerns exist about the region's stability as an oil supplier due to declining reserves in Mexico and threats from Venezuela. After the Cold War, U.S. policy in Latin America shifted to economic relations, but the 9/11 attacks refocused on security. Cooperation on anti-terrorism efforts intensified, with a focus on border security and migration with Mexico. The Bush Administration outlined four pillars of U.S. policy in the Americas: consolidating democracy, promoting prosperity through free trade, investing in people, and protecting democratic states like Colombia. The United States maintains various foreign assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, including security assistance, counternarcotics, economic development, and trade capacity building programs. Aid to the region increased during the 1960s with the Alliance for Progress and continues to focus on fostering cooperation on issues like drug trafficking, terrorism, crime, and poverty reduction. Persistent poverty and the rise of populism in countries like Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador pose challenges for U.S. interests and policy in the region. Since the 1960s, U.S. assistance in Latin America has increased with programs like the Alliance for Progress and aid to Central America. Recent focus has been on counternarcotics, expanding to Mexico. Aid aims at poverty reduction, economic growth, child and maternal health, trade, agriculture, education, environment, democracy, justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, and human rights. Emergency food assistance is provided in natural disasters. The United States provides various forms of assistance to Latin American countries, including food aid during emergencies, counternarcotics programs, foreign military financing for defense equipment, support for HIV/AIDS initiatives, and contributions to global health funds. The Bush Administration's FY2009 foreign aid request for Latin America was $2.05 billion. The FY2009 foreign aid request for Latin America was $2.05 billion, a 40% increase from FY2008. The top recipients were Colombia, Mexico, Haiti, Peru, and Bolivia, receiving 73% of the total aid. Colombia was the largest recipient with $543 million. In FY2009, the United States allocated significant foreign aid to Latin America, with Colombia being the largest recipient at $543 million. Mexico received about $501 million, mainly under the M\u00e9rida Initiative for security cooperation. Haiti's aid increased to almost $246 million, while Peru would receive $103 million for the Andean Counterdrug Program. In FY2009, the United States allocated significant foreign aid to Latin America, with Colombia being the largest recipient at $543 million. Mexico received about $501 million under the M\u00e9rida Initiative for security cooperation. Haiti's aid increased to almost $246 million, while Peru would receive $103 million for the Andean Counterdrug Program. Additionally, Congress appropriated funds for hurricane relief and reconstruction assistance for Haiti and other Caribbean countries in FY2009. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides aid grants to low-income nations with strong policy reform records. In 2005 and 2006, MCC approved compacts with Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Guyana and Paraguay received threshold assistance to become eligible for MCC compacts. The Bush Administration suspended funding for Nicaragua in 2008 due to fraudulent elections. Other Latin American or Caribbean nations could be eligible for assistance in the future. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is the main U.S. foreign assistance program supporting counternarcotics activities in South America. Colombia, a key ally and major source of cocaine, receives the majority of funding. The program, which began in 2000 with $1.3 billion in aid for Colombia and six neighboring countries, has totaled approximately $6 billion in funding from FY2000 to FY2008. The Administration requested $442.8 million for FY2008, with $367 million designated for Colombia. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $319.8 million for ACP programs, with Colombia receiving the majority of funding for interdiction and eradication programs. Other countries like Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Panama also received ACP assistance. Venezuela no longer receives ACP funding, and Congress provided $194 million in ESF funding for alternative development/institution building programs. In FY2008, Congress allocated $194 million in ESF funding for alternative development programs in Colombia and $41.9 million in INCLE funding for human rights programs. The FY2009 ACP request was for $406.8 million, with increased funding for eradication and interdiction programs in Colombia. The ACP program has improved security in Colombia but has not reduced drug production in the region. The U.S. assistance to Colombia aims to combat drug-supported armed groups and reduce drug production in the Andean region. However, critics argue that the focus on military training and crop eradication overlooks alternative development projects for growers. Critics also highlight inadequate support for human rights protection in U.S. assistance. The U.S. assistance to Colombia focuses on combating drug-supported armed groups and reducing drug production in the Andean region, but critics argue that it lacks support for human rights protection. In Mexico and Central America, increasing violence from drug cartels and criminal groups threatens citizen security and democracy, with the U.S. and Mexico announcing the M\u00e9rida Initiative to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in the region. The FY2009 budget request includes proposed funding for Mexico and Central America to support anti-drug efforts. Congress appropriated $465 million in FY2008 and FY2009 supplemental assistance for Mexico and Central America. Mexico receives $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in FY2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance, while Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic receive $65 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance with softer human rights conditions. The final enacted measure of the Merida Initiative reduced funding subject to human rights conditions from 25% to 15%, removed certain conditions regarding military officials and the National Human Rights Commission in Mexico, and softened other conditions. The House approved H.R. 6028 authorizing $1.6 billion over three years for Mexico and Central America, but the Senate did not take action on the measure. Trade has been a key issue in U.S.-Latin American relations, evolving from one-way trade preference programs to reciprocal free trade agreements in the 1990s. The Haiti HOPE Act, aimed at promoting export-led growth, was extended in 2008. The U.S. transitioned from one-way trade preference programs to reciprocal free trade agreements in the 1990s, including NAFTA, U.S.-Chile FTA, U.S.-Peru FTA, and CAFTA-DR. These FTAs replaced unilateral trade preferences like GSP, CBI, CBTPA, and ATPA. New FTAs with Panama and Colombia also replaced unilateral preferences. The CBTPA was extended by the 110th Congress until September 30, 2010. The 110th Congress extended the CBTPA until September 30, 2010. The ATPA was extended into 2009, except for Bolivia. The FTAA has stalled due to disagreements between Brazil and the United States. Mercosur is expanding as an alternative to the FTAA. The expiration of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) limits the US ability to move forward on future FTAs. The \"New Trade Policy for America\" is guiding changes in labor and environmental provisions in FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia. The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) provides special duty treatment to certain US imports from Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. The Andean Trade Promotion Act (ATPA) extends special duty treatment to U.S. imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to promote economic growth and discourage illegal coca cultivation. Enacted in 1991 and renewed under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act in 2002, ATPA has seen short-term extensions by Congress. Legislation in 2008 extended trade preferences until 2009 for Colombia and Peru, and until mid-2009 for Bolivia and Ecuador, with the possibility of further extensions for the latter two countries. The ATPA extends special duty treatment to U.S. imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Former President Bush suspended Bolivia's beneficiary status under ATPA due to lack of cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was implemented on February 1, 2009. The Senate passed implementing legislation for the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) on December 4, 2007. President Bush notified Congress of the agreement on January 6, 2006, and it was signed on April 12, 2006. The Peruvian Congress approved the PTPA on June 28, 2006. Congressional action was postponed to develop new text for labor and environment chapters. An agreement on core labor and environmental standards was reached on May 10, 2007. Amendments to the PTPA were agreed upon on June 25, 2007. The United States and Peru reached an agreement on amendments to the PTPA, which was approved by Peru's Congress. The PTPA is expected to have a small economic impact on the U.S. due to Peru's smaller economy. In 2007, Peru's GDP was $109 billion, 0.8% of the U.S. GDP. The U.S. currently provides duty-free treatment to some imports from Peru under ATPA, which expires in December 2008. U.S. imports from Peru make up 0.3% of total imports, with a trade deficit of $1.44 billion in 2007. The U.S. trade deficit with Peru was $1.44 billion in 2007. Major imports from Peru include gold, refined copper, and petroleum light oils, while top exports to Peru are gasoline, transmission apparatus, and office/data processing machinery parts. Former President Bush notified Congress of the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement in 2006, signed in November. Legislation for the agreement was introduced in Congress in 2008, but faced criticism for lack of coordination with the House leadership. The House approved H.Res. 1092 to make certain provisions in the Trade Act of 1974 inapplicable to the CFTA implementing legislation. Congress is uncertain about how to proceed with the pending CFTA, with concerns about violence against trade unionists in Colombia being a major issue. Some members oppose the agreement due to these concerns, while others see it as a way to strengthen a key democratic ally in South America. Colombian President Uribe reassured U.S. Congress of addressing concerns and improving the situation in Colombia. Some members want evidence of progress before supporting the agreement. A CFTA with Colombia would have a small economic impact on the U.S. due to Colombia's relatively small GDP compared to other trading partners. The Andean Trade Preference Act provides duty-free treatment to some Colombian imports, but it expires in 2008. The U.S. trade balance with Colombia shifted from a surplus to a deficit of $1.4 billion in 2007. A U.S.-Colombia free trade agreement would have a positive but very small impact on the United States. If the Andean Trade Preference Act is not renewed, Colombian products entering the U.S. market would face higher duties. Leading U.S. imports from Colombia include crude oil, coal, and coffee, while top exports to Colombia are corn, automatic data processing machine parts, and vinyl chloride. The United States and Panama signed a free trade agreement after two and a half years of negotiations. The agreement included changes to labor, environment, and intellectual property rights chapters. Panama ratified the FTA in 2007, but consideration in the U.S. Congress was delayed. The proposed FTA incorporated principles from the \"New Trade Policy for America\" requiring enforceable commitments to basic labor rights. The U.S. trade surplus with Panama was $3.4 billion in 2007, with major exports including oil, aircraft, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and vehicles. Panama's economy is services-based, setting it apart from its Central American neighbors. The proposed U.S.-Panama FTA aims to eliminate tariffs on 88% of U.S. exports immediately. The U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would eliminate tariffs on 88% of U.S. exports immediately, with remaining tariffs phased out over a ten-year period. Nearly half of U.S. farm exports to Panama would achieve duty-free status right away, with other farm products seeing tariffs phased out over 16 years. The FTA covers services trade, telecommunications, intellectual property rights, labor, environment, and government procurement, with provisions for trade capacity building. Additionally, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act was passed by the 109th Congress in December 2006 to provide duty-free treatment for select apparel imports from Haiti. The 110th Congress expanded duty-free treatment for select apparel imports from Haiti in the 2008 farm bill, known as the HOPE II Act. This was done to enhance the effectiveness of the provisions and make them easier to use, aiming to boost apparel exports from Haiti. The U.S. market plays a crucial role as the main destination for Haitian apparel exports, supporting Haiti's core export sector and economic well-being. Haiti's apparel sector is vital for its economy, accounting for 80% of exports and supporting employment growth. The HOPE Act requires labor standards compliance, and the proposed FTAA aims to expand trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere. The FTAA agreement, originally set to be signed in January 2005, has faced delays due to differences between the United States and Brazil. The two countries have not been able to define a two-tier approach for the negotiations, leading to a standstill in the process. At the fourth Summit of the Americas in 2005, resistance to the FTAA was evident among Latin American and Caribbean countries. While 29 countries supported restarting negotiations, Mercosur countries, including Venezuela, rejected the idea, citing the lack of conditions for a balanced agreement. Venezuela later joined Mercosur in July 2006. Venezuela joined Mercosur in 2006, becoming its first new full member since 1991. Mercosur collectively resisted the FTAA, with Venezuela being the only country in Latin America to unequivocally reject the idea. The United States may face challenges isolating its negative stance on FTAA negotiations with Venezuela's influence in Mercosur. The Summit Declaration called for reflection on FTAA issues while awaiting the outcome of WTO talks, but progress seems unlikely with Venezuela potentially influencing Mercosur policy. Latin America is a key source of migration to the United States, with immigrants mainly coming from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. Factors driving this migration include family ties, poverty, lack of good job opportunities, and proximity to the U.S. Latin American governments, such as Mexico under President Vicente Fox, have advocated for comprehensive immigration reform in the U.S. and the establishment of a guest worker program to normalize the status of illegal migrants. The 109th Congress failed to enact comprehensive immigration reform, leading to disappointment in Latin American nations. President Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006, prompting Mexico and 27 other nations to denounce the proposed border fence. In the 110th Congress, immigration reform stalled in June 2007 when the Senate did not limit debate on reform measures. The House held hearings on immigration reform, but comprehensive reform was unlikely to be taken up. The Senate's action made it unlikely for the House to consider comprehensive immigration reform. President Bush supported reform with increased border security, a guest worker program, and normalization of status for illegal immigrants. Mexico is a major source of legal and illegal migrants to the US. Undocumented Mexican migrants accounted for 56% of illegal immigrants in 2005. In 2006, the Mexican Congress approved a resolution on migration and border security acknowledging the need for more opportunities in Mexico. The Mexican resolution on migration and border security accepted the need to revisit migration policies, enforce borders, respect human rights, combat human trafficking, and develop a guest worker program in the US. Mexico committed to enforcing legal emigration if sufficient visas are provided. Additionally, Mexico enacted a new human trafficking law in November 2007. Mexico benefits from illegal migration as a \"safety valve\" for political discontent and a source of remittances. President Calder\u00f3n introduced a jobs program to reduce migration pressures. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua seek extensions for temporary protected status. The U.S. designates countries for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) due to armed conflict, natural disasters, or extraordinary conditions hindering their ability to accept nationals. Honduras and Nicaragua received TPS in response to Hurricane Mitch in 1999. TPS was extended for both countries until 2010. El Salvador was granted TPS after earthquakes in 2001, with an extension until 2010. Deportations to Latin America and the Caribbean have increased in recent years. The increase in deportations to Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years has raised concerns about the impact on border communities and the ability of countries to absorb deportees, especially those with criminal convictions. In FY2007, almost 40% of deportees to the region were removed based on criminal grounds, with Mexico experiencing stress on its border communities due to the influx of deportees. Policymakers in the Caribbean and Central America are worried about the challenges posed by the large number of deportees, including the effects of criminal deportees on crime rates. The United States is urged to provide better information and reintegration assistance for criminal deportees in Latin America. U.S. attention to terrorism in the region increased after the 9/11 attacks, with concerns about support for Middle East terrorist groups. The State Department's 2008 report highlighted threats in Colombia and mentioned ideological supporters in South America and the Caribbean aiding terrorist groups. The State Department's 2008 report highlighted the limited progress in improving counterterrorism capabilities in the hemisphere due to corruption and weak government institutions. Most countries in the region have good cooperation with the United States on terrorism issues, with Cuba remaining on the list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1982. The State Department's 2008 report highlighted Cuba's opposition to U.S. counterterrorism policy and hosting of U.S. fugitives. Venezuela was also criticized for lack of cooperation on antiterrorism efforts and relations with Cuba and Iran. Both countries were included on the list triggering a ban on U.S. commercial arms sales. The State Department's terrorism report raised questions about Venezuelan government support for Colombian terrorist organizations, particularly the FARC. President Ch\u00e1vez urged the FARC to end its armed struggle in 2008. The U.S. Treasury Department froze assets of Venezuelan officials for allegedly aiding the FARC. The United States provides Anti-Terrorism Assistance training to Latin American countries for improving security capabilities. The United States provides Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training to Latin American countries for improving security capabilities, with funding amounts specified for different countries in recent years. Additionally, the US began providing Terrorist Interdiction Program assistance to several Latin American countries. In the110th Congress, resolutions were passed condemning the 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires and expressing concern over Iran's national security implications. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 53 in December 2007, condemning the hostage-taking of three U.S. citizens by the FARC. The hostages, along with others, were rescued in a military operation in July 2008. Resolutions related to terrorism in Latin America were introduced but not acted upon, including one calling for Venezuela to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is negatively impacting economic and social development in several countries. HIV transmission in these regions is primarily through heterosexual contact, making containment challenging. Countries with the highest infection rates include Belize, the Bahamas, Guyana, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago. The response to the AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America involves support from governments, donors, and NGOs. U.S. government funding for HIV/AIDS in the region has significantly increased in recent years, reaching $139 million in FY2008. In FY2009, the Administration requested almost $139 million in HIV assistance for the Caribbean and Central America, with $92 million for Haiti and $20 million for Guyana. Legislation proposed adding 14 Caribbean countries to the list of focus countries under PEPFAR, including Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, and Jamaica. The House approved the inclusion of these countries in PEPFAR reauthorization legislation. The 110th Congress showed interest in crime and gang violence in Central America, particularly the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang. Over 2,000 alleged gang members were arrested in the US, raising concerns about transnational gang activities. Central American governments are struggling to address the issue with suppressive and preventive measures. Some experts suggest that increased US deportations of individuals with criminal records to Central America may be fueling the gang problem. Experts argue that repressive anti-gang laws in El Salvador and Honduras have not reduced violence, and law enforcement alone will not solve the gang problem. Illicit gang activities may increase illegal immigration and trafficking to the US. Contact between gang members across regions is rising, potentially leading to more gang-related crime in the US. US agencies are actively involved in addressing Central American gangs, with the National Security Council creating a task force to develop a comprehensive strategy. The U.S. government has implemented a strategy to combat international gang activity through various means such as diplomacy, law enforcement, and prevention. Congress allocated $465 million in supplemental assistance for Mexico and Central America to support anti-gang programs as part of the M\u00e9rida Initiative. During the 110th Congress, legislation was introduced to increase regional cooperation in tracking gang activity and handling deported gang members. The Consolidation Appropriations Act recommended $8 million to combat criminal youth gangs, $3 million more than the Administration's request. The House passed a resolution supporting expanded cooperation between the U.S. and Central America to combat crime and violence. The Congress also showed interest in the situation of Afro-Latinos in Latin America. Afro-Latinos in Latin America, including Afro-Colombians affected by the armed conflict, are advocating for increased rights and representation. They are among the poorest and most marginalized groups in the region, comprising 150 million out of 540 million total population. With the help of international organizations, they are seeking political, human, land, social, and economic rights. Improving their status may be challenging depending on each country's circumstances. U.S. foreign policy has not prioritized assistance to Afro-Latinos. Assisting Afro-Latinos has not been a primary U.S. foreign policy objective, but some foreign aid programs benefit them. While some aid is targeted towards Afro-Latinos, most is distributed broadly to help marginalized populations. There were bills in the 110th Congress related to Afro-Latinos, including provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008 (H.R. 2764/P.L. 110-161) regarding land and property rights of Afro-Colombians and restrictions on Andean Counterdrug funds for oil palm development causing displacement or environmental damage. The House passed resolutions in support of Afro-Colombian communities, recognizing their rights and offering assistance programs. Up to $15 million in alternative development aid may be provided to address displacement and environmental damage caused by oil palm development in Colombia. The United States and Brazil signed an agreement to combat racial and ethnic discrimination in 2008. Human trafficking is a major concern, with Latin America serving as a source, transit, and destination region for victims. Latin America is also a significant source of the up to 17,500 people trafficked to the United States annually. In FY2007, Latin America accounted for 41% of trafficking victims in the United States. The State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report categorizes countries into tiers based on their efforts to combat trafficking. Cuba is the only Latin American country ranked Tier 3, while seven others are on the Tier 2 Watch List. Congress plays a key role in fighting human trafficking. In 2009, Congress passed several acts to combat human trafficking, including the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005. Additionally, the 110th Congress introduced bills with trafficking-related provisions, such as the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. H.R. 2522 (Lewis) proposed establishing a Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of current anti-trafficking programs. H.R. 2522 (Lewis) proposes a Commission to evaluate U.S. anti-slavery efforts. S. 1703 (Durbin) aims to expand U.S. courts' jurisdiction for trafficking offenses abroad. Bolivia, with political instability, saw Evo Morales win the 2005 election and enact reforms like decriminalizing coca cultivation and nationalizing the gas industry. Opposition to Morales' constitutional reforms has been led by Bolivia's eastern prefects. In Bolivia, President Morales faced strong opposition from wealthy eastern provinces seeking autonomy. Despite protests and violence, a constitutional referendum was approved in January 2009 with a 61% vote in favor. The new constitution in Bolivia was approved by a 61% to 39% vote after a peaceful election, with four eastern provinces voting against it. U.S.-Bolivian relations were strained due to the Morales government's drug policy and ties with Venezuela, leading to diplomatic expulsions and trade preference suspensions. In November 2008, Bolivian President Morales suspended DEA operations in Bolivia due to espionage accusations. U.S. concerns in Congress focused on counternarcotics and trade issues, with Bolivia receiving $99.5 million in foreign aid in FY2008. Legislation extended ATPA trade preferences until June 30, 2009, but President Bush later suspended them on December 15, 2008. On January 1, 2007, Luis In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva began his second term as President of Brazil, focusing on economic growth and crime issues. Despite intra-party rivalries, President Lula maintained high approval ratings and benefited from a growing economy. Corruption investigations within his party did not diminish his popularity. President Lula's second term in office has been strong despite ongoing corruption investigations. Some are urging him to seek a third term, criticizing his lack of action on political and economic reforms. Brazil's relations with the United States have been positive, with a focus on strengthening ties with neighboring countries and nontraditional partners like India and China. Cooperation between Brazil and the U.S. has increased, especially on energy issues. During President Lula's second term, cooperation between Brazil and the U.S. increased, particularly on energy issues. Presidential visits in 2007 led to the signing of a U.S.-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding to promote ethanol production in Latin America. Brazil's potential as a major oil supplier to the U.S. was also noted. The 110th Congress showed significant interest in Brazil, passing resolutions recognizing the strong relationship and biofuels cooperation between the two countries. The Western Hemisphere Energy Compact Act of 2008 aims to strengthen energy security by promoting biofuels production in Brazil and other Western Hemisphere countries. Congressional interest in Brazil during the 110th Congress also focused on various issues such as trade negotiations, counternarcotics efforts, and HIV/AIDS prevention. Colombia, a key U.S. ally in South America, has made significant progress in recent years. In the last decade, Colombia has made progress in reasserting government control, combating drug trafficking, and reducing poverty with U.S. support through Plan Colombia. Critics argue that U.S. policy has not adequately promoted human rights or sustainable economic alternatives for drug crop farmers. President Alvaro Uribe has been re-elected in 2006. President Alvaro Uribe, re-elected in 2006, has made progress in addressing Colombia's conflict with guerrillas and paramilitary groups. His popularity remains high despite a scandal involving ties to illegal groups. Uribe's approval surged after successful military operations against FARC, including the rescue of hostages. Calls for him to seek a third term are mixed with disillusionment over his handling of illegal activities. The 110th Congress addressed U.S. policy towards Colombia, focusing on funding for Plan Colombia, U.S. hostages, trade, and human rights. Funding levels were increased for economic and social aid in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Resolutions were passed expressing gratitude for the successful rescue of U.S. hostages by the Colombian government. Continuing U.S. assistance to Colombia was emphasized in an amendment passed by the House. Funding was provided at FY2008 levels in an enacted continuing resolution. The 110th Congress addressed U.S. policy towards Colombia, focusing on funding for Plan Colombia, U.S. hostages, trade, and human rights. An enacted continuing resolution (P.L. 110-329) provides funding at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. Concerns were raised about labor activist killings and the parapolitical scandal, as well as the Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). President Obama questioned the CFTA, leading to a hold on the agreement. U.S. policy towards Cuba has been consistent since the early 1960s. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement has been a key focus of U.S. policy towards Colombia. The Bush Administration has maintained economic sanctions on Cuba since the 1960s. Congress has been examining how to support political and economic change in Cuba, especially with Fidel Castro's departure. Ra\u00fal Castro took over as head of government in 2008. Since Fidel Castro stepped down in 2006, Cuba's political succession to Ra\u00fal Castro has been stable. Economic changes since 2008 include lifting restrictions on consumer products, cell phones, decentralizing agriculture, revamping salary structures, and allowing Cubans to stay in tourist hotels. The move to allow Cubans to stay in tourist hotels is symbolically significant, ending \"tourism apartheid.\" Economic changes under Ra\u00fal Castro include lifting restrictions on consumer products and cell phones, decentralizing agriculture, revamping salary structures, and allowing Cubans to stay in tourist hotels. Despite these changes, tight government control over the political system is expected to remain, backed by a strong security apparatus. Congress fully funded Cuba democracy programs in FY2008, and there were provisions related to Cuba in both sessions of Congress. Several legislative initiatives in the 110th Congress aimed to ease sanctions on Cuba, including provisions related to travel, agricultural sales, educational travel, Cuban baseball players, family travel, remittances, and the sale of U.S. agricultural and medical products. However, none of these provisions were included in enacted measures. Additionally, there were efforts to develop Cuba's offshore oil and terminate U.S.-government sponsored television broadcasting. Several legislative initiatives in the 110th Congress aimed to ease sanctions on Cuba, including provisions related to travel, agricultural sales, educational travel, Cuban baseball players, family travel, remittances, and the sale of U.S. agricultural and medical products. However, none of these provisions were included in enacted measures. Additionally, there were efforts to develop Cuba's offshore oil and terminate U.S.-government sponsored television broadcasting. S. 554 would have terminated U.S.-government sponsored television broadcasting to Cuba. Several initiatives would have tightened sanctions related to U.S. fugitives in Cuba and Cuba's offshore oil development. Other initiatives focused on amending trademark laws, awarding a congressional gold medal to a Cuban political prisoner, commemorating a 1996 incident, and funding anti-drug cooperation with Cuba. Ecuador, a small oil-producing country in South America, experienced political and economic instability. Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, became the country's eighth President in ten years in 2007. He fulfilled his campaign pledge by calling a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution, approved by 64% of voters in 2008. New elections were scheduled. Ecuador held a referendum in late September 2008 and is set to have new elections in April 2009. Concerns have been raised about the new constitution giving too much power to the presidency. Relations with the United States have been strained, with a free trade agreement suspended in 2006. President Correa opposes a trade agreement with the U.S. due to concerns about his ties with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and populist tendencies. Despite these issues, U.S. trade preferences for Ecuador were extended in October 2008. In October 2008, legislation (P.L. 110-436) extended U.S. trade preferences for Ecuador under the Andean Trade Preferences Act through June 2009. President Correa confirmed that the lease on the U.S. air base at Manta would not be renewed for U.S. counter-drug operations. The U.S. provided $32 million in assistance to Ecuador in FY2008, with a request for $32.5 million in FY2009. President Alvaro Col\u00f3m was sworn in for a four-year term on January 14. President Alvaro Col\u00f3m of the center-left National Union of Hope (UNE) party began his four-year term on January 14, 2008, after defeating right-wing candidate Otto P\u00e9rez Molina in run-off elections. Despite a lack of majority in the National Assembly, Col\u00f3m successfully passed a budget increasing social development spending by 32.6%. However, corruption investigations led to a legislative crisis, with the leader resigning and facing prosecution. President Alvaro Col\u00f3m of the UNE party faced corruption investigations and a legislative crisis after being accused of involvement in siphoning state funds. Despite some achievements in rural development and drug interception, his presidency was marred by increased violence, attributed to drug trafficking by Mexican cartels through Guatemala. In his first few months in office, President Alvaro Col\u00f3m faced an increase in violence, with kidnappings rising by 8.3%. He took steps to address the issue by overhauling military leadership and implementing an economic program to tackle the food crisis and inflation. Critics raised concerns about the lack of a comprehensive policy to address gang-related issues and corruption within the police force. The food crisis in Guatemala worsened, with poverty increasing in 2007. President Col\u00f3m implemented a minor tax reform in 2008, but faces opposition for further tax increases in 2009. Under former President Berger, the economy grew at 5.6% in 2007 due to remittances and high export prices. However, economic growth is expected to decline in 2009 due to the U.S. financial crisis. In 2007, the Berger government passed laws against organized crime and established the United Nations International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). They also expanded voting to rural areas, incorporating indigenous people into the political process. Col\u00f3m's administration was praised for improving human rights by opening military archives and cooperating with CICIG. However, the human rights situation remains dire with weak judicial institutions and ongoing attacks on human rights defenders and marginalization of indigenous people. Relations between the United States and Guatemala have traditionally been close, with occasional friction over human rights and civil/military issues. Congressional concerns focus on human rights, democracy, and U.S. immigration policy. Guatemala received significant U.S. assistance in FY2007 and FY2008, with funding allocated for development assistance and global health. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 recommended providing Foreign Military Financing. The act's joint explanatory statement recommended providing $500,000 in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to Guatemala pending Department of State certification of human rights conditions. This marked the first time Guatemala was eligible for FMF funding since 1990. The FY2009 funding request is $62.3 million, with funding continuing at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. Guatemala implemented a new adoption law to comply with the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children, transferring adoption responsibility to Guatemalan courts and the National Adoptions Council. Guatemala's new adoption law has led to a halt in U.S. adoptions, as the country lacks the necessary regulations for compliance with the Hague Convention. Adoption cases pending before December 31, 2007 are being reviewed for legality. In other news, Guatemala and Belize have agreed to refer their border disputes to the International Court of Justice, pending referendums in both countries. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val has brought some stability since taking office in May 2006. In his first year and a half, President Pr\u00e9val focused on building institutions, promoting private investment for job creation, and implementing a Poverty Reduction Strategy to meet IMF requirements. International donors pledged over $1.5 billion in economic assistance, with support from the United Nations. President Bush commended Pr\u00e9val for his efforts to improve economic conditions and establish the rule of law in Haiti. Despite progress, Haiti's stability remains fragile due to political and climatic challenges, as seen in the violent protests sparked by a food crisis in April 2008. In April 2008, a food crisis in Haiti led to violent protests and the removal of the Prime Minister. UN officials reported political opponents and armed gangs infiltrating the protests, hindering the government's ability to address the crisis. Parliament eventually confirmed Michele Pierre-Louis as Prime Minister in September, following rejection of previous candidates. Natural disasters, including four major storms in late August and September, further exacerbated the situation. The main focus of U.S. policy towards Haiti during the 110th Congress was on strengthening democratic processes and providing support for the country's recovery efforts. During the 110th Congress, key concerns in Haiti included strengthening democratic processes, improving security, promoting economic development, and addressing issues such as U.S. aid effectiveness, human rights protection, combating trafficking, and poverty alleviation. Some Members were worried about the Bush Administration's decision to partially lift the arms embargo against Haiti. The Haitian government and international donors are working on a strategy to address these needs simultaneously, focusing on short-term projects to boost confidence and long-term development plans. The U.S. provided $225 million in assistance to Haiti in FY2007 and $234.2 million in FY2008. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act stipulated $201.5 million in economic and military aid. The Bush Administration also allocated $83 million to combat HIV/AIDS and $25.5 million for a conflict mitigation program targeting urban crime. Additionally, $45 million in emergency food aid was provided in response to a food crisis in April. In response to the 2008 hurricanes, humanitarian assistance totaled $31 million in FY2008 funds and $2.7 million in FY2009 funds. The FY2009 request is $245.9 million, including allocations for HIV/AIDS, Economic Support Funds, P.L. 480 food aid, Child Survival and Health, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and International Military Education and Training. Bipartisan support was seen in the 110th Congress for aid to Haiti under the Pr\u00e9val government, including the passage of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act in 2008. This law expanded trade preferences for U.S. imports of Haitian apparel. The HOPE Act of 2008 expanded trade preferences for U.S. imports of Haitian apparel. The U.S. and Mexico have a close bilateral relationship with economic linkages under NAFTA. Drug trafficking issues are prominent in relations with Mexico. President Felipe Calder\u00f3n of Mexico launched operations against drug cartels in nine states, increasing extraditions to the US and seeking counternarcotics assistance. Drug cartel rivalries led to violence along the US-Mexico border as they fought for control of smuggling routes. The M\u00e9rida Initiative was launched in 2007 to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Mexico and Central America. The US provided $400 million in supplemental assistance in FY2008 and FY2009 for Mexico, with a focus on judicial reform, institution-building, anti-corruption, and rule of law activities. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, launched in 2007, aimed to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Mexico and Central America. The US provided $400 million in supplemental assistance in FY2008 and FY2009 for Mexico, focusing on judicial reform, institution-building, anti-corruption, and rule of law activities. The measure includes $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance within various accounts and $48 million in FY2009 supplemental assistance within the INCLE account. Human rights conditions in the final version require 15% of assistance to be withheld until Mexico takes action in four areas, with a report on vetting procedures needed. The House approved authorization legislation for the M\u00e9rida Initiative in 2008, authorizing $1.6 billion over three years for Mexico and Central America. $1.1 billion would be for Mexico, with $73.5 million for ATF activities to reduce illegal weapons flow to Mexico. Vetting procedures are required to ensure no human rights violations by recipients of assistance. Migration, border security, and trade issues are also prominent. In recent years, migration, border security, and trade have dominated the bilateral relationship. Comprehensive immigration reform was debated in Congress, but put aside after a failed cloture motion. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 authorized the construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. NAFTA institutions have been functioning since 1994, leading to a tripling of trade between the countries. The Bush Administration argues that NAFTA has had positive impacts, but Mexican farmers have criticized its effects. Notable trade disputes include trucking, tuna, and sweeteners. President Calder\u00f3n faced challenges due to the global financial crisis affecting the Mexican economy, leading to a decline in the stock market and peso value. President Ortega's credibility in Nicaragua and abroad decreased due to questions about government transparency and perceived authoritarian actions. Fraud allegations in the 2008 municipal elections resulted in the suspension of international assistance. Ortega's previous presidency was marked by conflict with U.S.-backed \"contras,\" authoritarian tendencies, and corruption charges. Despite winning the 2006 elections with 37.9% of the vote, a Nicaraguan law allowed him to avoid a run-off. International financial support was suspended due to the Ortega government's \"closure of democratic space,\" and the opposition faced challenges with the revocation of legal status for major parties. The opposition claims the Sandinistas won 44 municipalities fraudulently in the 2008 elections. The government refused a recount and established Citizens Power Councils, overseen by Ortega's wife, criticized for lack of transparency. The Sandinistas renewed a governing pact with the Liberal Constitutional Party, and the Supreme Court overturned a money laundering conviction for PLC leader Arnoldo Aleman in 2009. The National Assembly reconvened and reelected a Sandinista legislator as president, giving the Sandinistas control over all branches of government. The U.S. foreign policy priorities in Nicaragua are to strengthen democracy, promote economic growth, and improve security. In 2005, the Bush Administration signed a $175 million agreement with Nicaragua for rural development. Ortega balanced anti-U.S. rhetoric with cooperation on issues like free trade. In December 2008, the Millennium Challenge Corporation suspended $64 million in new MCA funds to Nicaragua due to concerns about the Ortega administration's actions surrounding municipal elections. The IMF also withheld $39 million from Nicaragua for failing to approve an \"anti-fraud\" energy law to regulate aid from Venezuela. The IMF withheld funds from Nicaragua for not passing an \"anti-fraud\" energy law to regulate aid from Venezuela, which amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Donors and critics are concerned that the Venezuelan aid is being used as a slush fund by the Sandinistas, outside the national budget. The IMF also expressed worry about the government making loans to companies using social security funds. U.S. aid to Nicaragua has varied in recent years. The FY2009 continuing resolution (P.L. 110-329) maintains funding at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. Disagreements between the U.S. and Nicaragua include concerns over Iran's investments in Nicaragua's infrastructure and ties with Venezuela. Nicaragua criticizes the U.S. for inaction on immigration reform. Tensions may rise if Nicaragua strengthens ties with Venezuela or nationalizes parts of the economy. Panama has shown political and economic progress with successive civilian governments. Panama has made significant political and economic progress since the 1989 U.S. military intervention. President Mart\u00edn Torrijos, son of former leader General Omar Torrijos, was elected in 2004. His government faces challenges such as social security funding deficits, Panama Canal expansion plans, and addressing unemployment and poverty. In 2006, plans were unveiled to double the Canal's capacity with a third lane and new locks. Panama's ambitious plans to double the Canal's capacity through a third lane and new locks began in 2007 after a referendum with strong public support. The project is expected to be completed by 2014. Income inequality persists in Panama despite its booming service-based economy. Presidential election campaigning started in 2008 for the 2009 election, with leading candidates from the Democratic Change and ruling PRD parties. The U.S. maintains close ties with Panama, rooted in historical connections from when the canal was under U.S. control. The current relationship between the United States and Panama includes extensive counternarcotics cooperation, assistance for Canal security, and negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement. The United States is providing foreign aid to Panama, including funds from the M\u00e9rida Initiative. A bilateral FTA was signed in 2007 with enforceable labor and environmental provisions. Panama's Legislative Assembly approved the agreement in July 2007. The U.S. Congress delayed consideration of the Panama Free Trade Agreement due to the election of Pedro Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, who was wanted in the U.S. for a murder case. The Bush Administration prioritized the FTA with Colombia over Panama. Implementing legislation for the Panama FTA was not submitted to Congress, leaving potential action for the next Administration and Congress. President Alan Garc\u00eda was re-elected in 2006, embracing free trade agreements and pro-market economic policies. Peru's economy grew by 8% in 2007, but rising inflation and reduced demand may temper growth. In 2009, Peru's economic growth is expected to be 4.6%, despite inflation and reduced demand for Peruvian products. President Garc\u00eda aims to use trade to reduce poverty, especially in rural and jungle areas. Economic growth has decreased poverty by 3%, but weak institutional capacity hinders poverty reduction programs, leading to social unrest. Human rights groups criticize the government for restricting legitimate protests. Garcia's administration in Peru imposed strict regulations on NGOs, criminalized social protests, and labeled strikes as \"extortion.\" Critics argue that Garcia's trade agenda threatens the environment and indigenous livelihoods. Questions arise about the independence of the heads of the Supreme Court and Lima High Court, who have ties to former President Fujimori. Fujimori faces trial for corruption and human rights violations, with a potential 30-year prison sentence and a $33 million fine if convicted. The trial of former President Fujimori in Peru began in December 2007, with a potential 30-year prison sentence and a $33 million fine if convicted. The Fujimorista bloc in the Peruvian Congress, led by Fujimori's daughter Keiko, could withdraw support for Garc\u00eda. Corruption scandals have eroded public confidence in the government, leading to cabinet dismissals. U.S.-Peruvian relations focus on democracy, human rights, environmental protection, and trade, with the signing of a Trade Promotion Agreement in 2006. In December 2007, the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act was signed into U.S. law (P.L. 110-138). Peru created an environment ministry in May 2008 for environmental impact assessments. Congress extended Peru's trade preferences until December 31, 2009, while Peru worked on legislation needed for the PTPA. Former President George W. Bush implemented the PTPA on February 1, 2009. House committees expressed disappointment with Peru's legislation and expected the Obama administration to improve enforcement of trade agreements. In June 2008, Peru and the United States signed a $35.6 million program to reduce corruption and improve immunization coverage. In October 2008, they signed a debt-for-nature swap reducing Peru's debt by $25 million for forest protection. President Garc\u00eda announced an anti-drug policy in April 2007. The United States provided $136.2 million in foreign assistance to Peru in FY2007. The United States provided $136.2 million in foreign assistance to Peru in FY2007 and an estimated $90.3 million in FY2008, with significant cuts in counternarcotics funds. The FY2008 request for Peru was $93.2 million, including $66.8 million for counternarcotics and economic support. The FY2009 request is $103 million, with $37 million for counternarcotics and $53 million for Development Assistance, including increased alternative development programs and support for the Peru trade promotion agreement. The FY2009 continuing resolution (P.L. 110-329) maintains funding at FY2008 levels until March 6, 2009. Venezuela, under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has seen political changes with concerns about democratic institutions and freedom of expression. Ch\u00e1vez's populist agenda has been fueled by rising oil prices, leading to increased social program expenditures and a move towards socialism announced in May 2007. After being reelected, President Ch\u00e1vez announced new socialist measures. His closure of a critical TV station in May 2007 sparked protests. A constitutional amendment package, including the removal of term limits, was defeated in December 2007. State and local elections in November 2008 showed mixed support for the government. A controversial referendum in February 2009 aimed to abolish term limits. The United States has traditionally had close relations with Venezuela, a major oil supplier. The United States has had friction with Venezuela, a major oil supplier, due to concerns about human rights, military arms purchases, relations with Cuba and Iran, and efforts to export populism. President Bush designated Venezuela as failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements from 2005-2008. Bilateral relations worsened in 2008 when President Ch\u00e1vez expelled the U.S. Ambassador. Congressional concerns in the 110th Congress focused on Venezuela's democracy. In the 110th Congress, concerns about Venezuela focused on democracy, human rights, energy, terrorism, bilateral relations, and U.S. policy. The House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere held a hearing on Venezuela in July 2008. The Senate and House approved resolutions expressing concerns about freedom of expression, Venezuela's decision on RCTV, and Iran's influence in Latin America. In the 110th Congress, the House approved measures related to Venezuela, including a $2 million Iranian-Venezuelan fund for investments in third countries and direct civilian airline flights from Iran to Venezuela. Additionally, the House approved funding for targeted broadcasting for Venezuela, but it was not included in the final enacted measure. In FY2008, the House expressed support for restoring shortwave and medium wave transmission to Venezuela. The House also passed a bill requiring a national intelligence assessment on energy security issues, but the Senate did not take action on it."
