    "content": "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was passed by Congress in 2000 to promote economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa and strengthen trade ties with the U.S. Congress has made amendments to AGOA over the years, with the latest renewal extending trade preferences until September 30, 2015. Bills for renewing AGOA were introduced in the House and Senate, with related measures needing reconciliation between the two chambers before becoming law. AGOA is considered a cornerstone of America's economic engagement with Africa. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has been a cornerstone of America's economic engagement with sub-Saharan Africa for the past fourteen years. Economic conditions in Africa have significantly improved since AGOA was enacted in 2001, with SSA's growth averaging 6.3%, higher than the world average of 3.9%. Observers and policymakers suggest a shift in U.S. policy towards SSA, focusing more on private sector investment and increasing two-way trade due to the region's economic potential and abundant natural resources. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has attracted foreign investors, including state-supported enterprises from China. Some have called for an expedited reauthorization process for AGOA to address changing economic circumstances in Africa. Concerns have been raised about specific provisions of the program, such as limited coverage for certain agricultural products. The report analyzes the components, import trends, impact on African economies, and issues surrounding the reauthorization of AGOA. AGOA is a nonreciprocal preference program providing duty-free access to the US for qualifying exports from eligible SSA countries, with apparel products being economically significant. Discussions include expanding the program to more least-developed countries and addressing concerns over US businesses' competitiveness in the region. The AGOA legislation provides tariff preferences and mandates an annual meeting for U.S. and African officials to discuss trade and economic issues. Countries must meet eligibility requirements to qualify for benefits, with 39 current beneficiary countries listed in the report. The core of AGOA lies in duty-free access for qualifying exports from eligible SSA countries. AGOA offers tariff benefits for duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain products from eligible SSA countries. It expands on the GSP program by providing preferential access for more products like apparel and includes additional eligibility criteria. AGOA is nonreciprocal and unilateral, aiming to enhance export-led economic growth in developing countries. AGOA offers tariff benefits for duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain products from eligible SSA countries, aiming to enhance export-led economic growth in developing countries. Unlike free trade agreements or multilateral agreements through the WTO, AGOA focuses on excluding import-sensitive items and served as a potential stepping stone to broader trade pacts with African countries. Despite initial FTA negotiations with South Africa and its regional partners, they were ultimately unsuccessful and suspended in 2006. The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) includes thousands of tariff lines for goods imports, with GSP and AGOA removing tariffs on various products. AGOA offers duty-free treatment for certain apparel and footwear products not covered by GSP, but agricultural products under tariff-rate quotas remain ineligible for duty-free treatment under both programs. Under AGOA and GSP, duty-free treatment is provided for certain products. AGOA beneficiaries are exempt from caps on duty-free imports under GSP. Products must meet rules of origin requirements, including direct importation into the U.S. and 35% value from beneficiary developing countries. AGOA provides duty-free treatment for apparel and textile products, with up to 15% of the value allowed to be of U.S. origin. Regional cumulation allows production from other SSA countries to contribute to the value-added requirement. Duty-free benefits apply to apparel, which has played a significant role in the development of some countries. Beneficiary countries must have an efficient visa system to prevent unlawful transshipment for apparel products under AGOA. Apparel production in lesser-developed countries allows for global competitiveness due to low-skilled labor and minimal capital requirements. The U.S. apparel sector has specific safeguards in place, such as \"yarn forward\" rules of origin in free trade agreements. Success in export-intensive industries like apparel may lead to a more diversified manufacturing sector. The U.S. apparel sector benefits from preferential treatment under programs like AGOA, with high preference margins due to higher tariffs on apparel compared to other products. This advantage helps AGOA producers, especially in LDCs, compete with lower-cost producers. Eligible apparel includes items made from U.S. yarn and fabric, SSA yarns and fabrics, and third-country yarns and fabrics. The AGOA program allows U.S. apparel imports from least-developed SSA countries to qualify for duty-free treatment, even if the yarns and fabrics used are imported from non-AGOA countries. This provision is set to expire in September 2015, along with the overall AGOA program. Eligibility for the AGOA trade preference program consists of two separate steps. Eligibility for the AGOA trade preference program involves being on a list of sub-Saharan African countries and meeting criteria set by Congress. The President annually determines which countries should receive AGOA benefits based on factors like economy, rule of law, and poverty reduction efforts. The AGOA trade preference program eligibility requirements include factors like economy, rule of law, and poverty reduction efforts. The Obama Administration made changes to AGOA country eligibility in 2014, reinstating benefits for Madagascar and Guinea-Bissau while terminating benefits for Swaziland, South Sudan, and The Gambia due to various issues. AGOA, similar to GSP, offers additional benefits for least-developed beneficiary countries (LDCs) with duty-free treatment on 1,400 products. AGOA defines LDCs based on a per capita GNP threshold, with exemptions for countries like Botswana, Namibia, and Mauritius. Mauritius, despite exceeding the GNP threshold, is a significant exporter under AGOA, primarily in apparel products. The President, in consultation, is required to oversee AGOA implementation. The AGOA program requires annual United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forums to discuss trade relations and encourage joint ventures between businesses. The 13th AGOA Forum in 2014 focused on potential reauthorization and announced that the 2015 Forum would be held in Gabon. Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the 2015 AGOA Forum will be held in Gabon, marking a first for Central Africa. AGOA directs U.S. government assistance to encourage trade policy liberalization, harmonization of laws with WTO commitments, financial restructuring, and agribusiness linkages in beneficiary countries. Assistance also includes support for private sector associations, trade missions, services trade, agricultural policy, and WTO participation. In FY2013, the United States provided $209 million in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance to AGOA countries, primarily through MCC and USAID. Funds were allocated for trade-related infrastructure, agriculture projects, trade facilitation, and other TCB categories. AGOA also involves agencies like OPIC and Ex-Im Bank, with a focus on supporting projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The AGOA legislation supports increased funding for SSA countries through OPIC and Ex-Im Bank. It expresses Congress's support for expanding financial commitments to African countries and commends the work of the Ex-Im Bank's sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee. The current Ex-Im Bank reauthorization does not explicitly authorize the committee, which is currently not operational. Additionally, there is support for creating an Assistant USTR for Africa to serve as the primary point of contact. The legislation supports the creation of an Assistant USTR for Africa to be the primary contact for trade with sub-Saharan Africa. It also requires an increase in the number of CS officers in SSA to better serve U.S. businesses. In FY2014, there are 15 CS officers in sub-Saharan Africa, up from 5 in FY2012, located in Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania. USAID funds trade capacity building efforts related to AGOA, with $1.6 billion since 2001. The African Competitiveness and Trade Expansion (ACTE) initiative, with funding of up to $30 million annually, supports the three African Trade Hubs in Ghana, Kenya, and Botswana to help potential exporters become globally competitive. The East Africa Trade Hub has been renamed the East Africa Trade and Investment Hub to focus on two-way trade and investment between the United States and the East African Community. U.S. imports from AGOA countries represent a small share of overall imports, with $25.6 billion in 2014, accounting for slightly more than 1%. 56% of these imports received duty-free treatment, with crude oil being a significant portion. In 2014, U.S. imports from Sub-Saharan Africa under AGOA and GSP, excluding energy products, were $4.4 billion, increasing three-fold since 2001. Non-energy trade between the United States and SSA is the focus, with a $500 million decrease in imports from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, U.S. imports from Sub-Saharan Africa under AGOA and GSP, excluding energy products, were $4.4 billion, increasing three-fold since 2001. Apparel products, a significant non-oil import category, saw a $500 million decrease in imports from 2013 to 2014, mainly due to lower auto imports from South Africa. The peak in apparel imports in 2004 was prior to the removal of the Multifiber Agreement (MFA), which limited U.S. apparel imports from certain countries. Despite facing high tariffs, the removal of quantitative limitations reduced the competitive advantage of AGOA countries in producing apparel. U.S. apparel imports under AGOA represent only 1% of overall U.S. apparel imports, totaling $82.7 billion in 2014. In 2014, U.S. imports from Sub-Saharan Africa under AGOA and GSP, excluding energy products, were $4.4 billion, increasing three-fold since 2001. Apparel imports declined in 2014, mainly due to lower auto imports from South Africa. U.S. imports of vehicles rose from $289 million in 2001 to nearly $2.2 billion in 2013, but declined to $1.4 billion in 2014. Imports of more advanced manufactured products, such as chemicals, come mostly from South Africa. U.S. imports of food and agriculture products under AGOA and GSP have increased from $139 million to $467 million, with a $20 million increase from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, U.S. preferential imports from Sub-Saharan Africa under AGOA and GSP totaled $4.4 billion, with South Africa being the top exporter at $3.1 billion. Other top exporters included Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius, Swaziland, Cote d`Ivoire, and Malawi. However, preferences were not heavily utilized by most AGOA beneficiary countries, with imports less than $1 million for over half of them. The goal of AGOA was to improve economic development in SSA and increase trade ties with the U.S. The AGOA preference program has led to increased employment in sectors benefiting from duty-free treatment in countries like Lesotho. A study found a direct link between AGOA preferences and increased U.S. imports from beneficiary countries, especially in the apparel sector. Challenges remain, such as limited utilization of preferences by some countries. AGOA countries have doubts about translating short-term preference benefits into transformative changes in manufacturing capabilities. Apparel exports dominate AGOA non-oil imports, but manufacturing sectors in beneficiary countries are underdeveloped. AGOA apparel production focuses on low-skill tasks with limited knowledge transfer, and exporters' global competitiveness relies on preferential treatment. AGOA supports economic development and trade goals in Sub-Saharan Africa, acting as a focal point for U.S. economic relations in the region. With the potential for SSA to become a significant consumer market and destination for U.S. exports and FDI, AGOA plays a role in spurring dialogue on trade and investment issues through the annual AGOA Forum. The program also influences the political and economic structure of participating countries through its eligibility criteria. The United States maintains influence over political and economic structures in beneficiary countries through AGOA. AGOA's authorization is set to expire in 2015, with support for renewal from President Obama and other stakeholders. The Obama Administration initiated a review of AGOA in 2013, leading to four investigations by the U.S. International Trade Commission. The first report on AGOA's trade and investment performance was published in April 2014. Ambassador Froman outlined key recommendations for AGOA's reauthorization in July 2014, including a longer renewal period, expanded product coverage, flexible rules of origin, updated eligibility criteria, and a more reciprocal trade program. The main barriers to greater AGOA utilization were identified as \"supply-side\" constraints like inadequate infrastructure. Congress has also shown interest in studying and renewing the AGOA preference program. During the 113th Congress, committee leadership requested GAO reports on AGOA's effectiveness, including trade impact and utilization. GAO published four reports addressing import competitiveness, trade capacity building, eligibility process, and other countries' trade agreements with sub-Saharan Africa. The need for better development of country export strategies was highlighted. Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means expressed strong support for AGOA's potential reauthorization in July 2014. Chairman Ryan of the House Committee on Ways and Means cited the importance of AGOA at the start of the 114th Congress. At the start of the 114th Congress, Chairman Ryan highlighted AGOA's reauthorization as a top priority. Various stakeholders, including the AGOA Ambassadors Working Group, civil society network, and East African Community, have provided recommendations for AGOA's renewal. Private sector actors have called for longer and uniform reauthorization periods (10-15 years) to reduce investment uncertainty in the region. AGOA stakeholders advocate for uniform reauthorization of preferences, including the third-country fabric provision, to boost capital investment and value-added production in the region. Lengthened authorization periods may deter advanced economies like South Africa from engaging in broader trade liberalization efforts. Various proposals aim to modify AGOA's eligibility criteria to reduce investor uncertainty and enhance worker rights. AGOA stakeholders debate potential modifications to eligibility criteria, including timing and scope of preference withdrawal. Suggestions include more targeted penalties for non-compliance and differing opinions on immediate versus gradual phase-outs. AGOA stakeholders discuss potential changes to eligibility criteria, with suggestions for more targeted penalties and differing opinions on immediate versus gradual phase-outs. Regional integration efforts are seen as crucial for economic development in Africa, with AGOA calling for increased U.S. assistance in this area. Evaluating the impact of AGOA on intra-African trade and regional integration is important for future policy decisions. AGOA provides preferential access to the U.S. market with no reciprocal access for beneficiary countries. Some suggest a focus on two-way trade and seeking possible FTA partners among SSA nations. Negotiations with South Africa for an FTA were unsuccessful, while the EU concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement with South Africa. The EU successfully concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with South Africa and other regional countries, providing reciprocal preferential tariff treatment to EU exports. GSP includes language declaring a country ineligible if it gives preferential treatment to developed countries other than the United States. Policy questions arise regarding negotiating FTAs with emerging markets like South Africa and whether AGOA should have its own graduation process. AGOA policy questions include graduation process for economically advanced countries, enforcement of GSP rules, impact of benefits removal on intra-African trade. Many AGOA beneficiaries export less than $1 million to the US, with LDCs enjoying duty-free treatment on apparel exports. Kenya, Lesotho, and Mauritius are major apparel exporters under AGOA. AGOA countries like Kenya, Lesotho, and Mauritius have been successful in utilizing the preference program, facing challenges such as poor infrastructure and skilled labor shortages. $5 billion has been allocated to Trade Capacity Building (TCB) funding in AGOA countries since 2001, with discussions centering on the need for more effective TCB funding. USAID's TCB programs under AGOA need better evaluation according to GAO. USAID could enhance AGOA utilization by focusing on country strategies and timely implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. President Obama announced a government-wide TCB strategy to improve AGOA utilization during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. This strategy could impact TCB considerations in AGOA's reauthorization. AGOA and GSP provide duty-free access on U.S. imports of approximately 5,200 tariff lines, granting AGOA beneficiaries duty-free access to 86% of U.S. products. Some excluded products, like certain agricultural items, are competitively produced in AGOA countries. Congress may consider expanding the products or quantities covered under AGOA to allow more beneficiaries to utilize the program. Some suggest reallocating current quota allocations to expand agricultural market access for AGOA. Some groups propose reallocating current quota allocations to AGOA countries to enhance agricultural market access. However, changing quota allocations may require WTO approval. AGOA countries also face challenges meeting U.S. food safety standards for exports, suggesting targeted TCB funding could help. AGOA has more liberal rules of origin compared to other preference programs. Some stakeholders are seeking to ease restrictions on AGOA apparel exports, such as increasing the allowable value content attributed to the United States or easing technical constraints on cumulation. Certain AGOA countries are also advocating for modifications to rules of origin to allow canned tuna to qualify for AGOA preferences. Some Members of Congress supporting AGOA have concerns over South Africa's antidumping duties on U.S. poultry exports. They argue that AGOA should be strengthened to prevent South Africa from benefiting from duty preferences while discriminating against U.S. goods. AGOA's current eligibility criteria require progress in eliminating trade barriers and disputes. In June 2015, the U.S. and South Africa agreed to renew market access for U.S. goods in South Africa. The U.S. and South Africa renewed market access for certain poultry products, with the removal of anti-dumping duties on 65,000 tons of U.S. chicken exports annually. This agreement may resolve concerns raised by Members pressuring South Africa on this issue. Some argue for broader duty-free tariff preferences for all least-developed countries, not just those in Africa. In 2014, U.S. import duties on all imports from Cambodia were higher than those from France. Broadening duty-free tariff preferences for all least-developed countries could impact AGOA apparel producers. Studies show mixed results on the effects of a broader DFQF program, with some suggesting potential benefits for AGOA LDCs. Bills to renew the AGOA preference program were introduced in the House and Senate. Bills to renew the AGOA preference program were introduced in the House and Senate on April 17 and April 20. Key issues addressed in the bills include a ten-year renewal of the program, modifications to rules of origin, changes to the eligibility review process, and the ability to withdraw, suspend, or terminate preferential treatment for beneficiary countries. The House Committee on Ways and Means reported H.R. 1891 without amendment, which includes provisions for a review of South Africa within 30 days of enactment, the ability to withdraw, suspend, or limit preferential treatment, and the development of utilization strategies with U.S. trade capacity building agencies. Additionally, the bill includes a policy statement to expand trade and investment through negotiating trade agreements, a biennial report on trade and investment relations, and reports on negotiating FTAs with sub-Saharan African countries. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1267 with amendments related to the U.S. harmonized tariff schedule and AGOA eligibility criteria. The Senate passed the provisions of S. 1267 as an amendment to H.R. 1295, which was further amended by the House. The bill must now be reconciled between the two chambers before it can be sent to the President for approval."
