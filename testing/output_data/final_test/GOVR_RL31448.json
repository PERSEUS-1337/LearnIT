    "content": "The United States and Russia showed signs of starting a new arms control dialogue after a meeting between President Bush and President Putin in Genoa, Italy in July 2001. They planned to have intensive consultations on offensive and defensive systems, with differing views on the goals. Russia proposed a formal treaty limiting each side to 1,500 nuclear weapons, while the Bush Administration preferred unilateral reductions without offering specific details until a review was completed in November 2001. President Bush announced in November 2001 that the United States would reduce its strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700-2,200 over the next decade without a formal agreement with Russia. President Putin appreciated the decision and stated that Russia would respond in kind, without specifying a target number for reductions at that time. Russia planned to reduce its forces to 1,500 warheads and wanted a formal arms control process to reduce U.S. and Russian weapons. Discussions began in January 2002, with significant differences in opening positions. By May, most differences were resolved, with the treaty reflecting U.S. proposals in content and Russia's desire for a formal, \"legally binding\" document in form. Russia sought a \"legally binding document\" for predictability and transparency in reducing nuclear forces, similar to START I and START II but with lower warhead limits. They insisted on eliminating non-deployed warheads to ensure irreversibility of reductions and prevent exceeding treaty limits. The United States preferred a less formal process for reducing nuclear forces, such as exchanging letters or a joint declaration for added transparency measures. They did not plan to include strict limits on deployed weapons or restrictions on missile defenses in an agreement. The United States did not want restrictions on missile defenses in an agreement on reducing nuclear weapons. Pentagon officials opposed limits on nuclear weapons in a binding agreement, while Secretary of State Powell supported it to improve President Putin's image. The US started moving towards Russia's position in early 2002. Secretary of State Powell stated that the framework for a nuclear weapons agreement would be legally binding, with options for approval as an executive agreement or a formal treaty. Some in the Pentagon opposed a treaty limiting nuclear weapons, preferring legally binding provisions for verifying warhead numbers only. Undersecretary of Defense Feith argued against dictating the size of Russia's forces through legal means and against setting U.S. nuclear levels in stone. President Bush supported Secretary Powell's approach for a legally binding nuclear weapons agreement, emphasizing the importance of verification. Senators Biden and Helms urged the Administration to submit the agreement to the Senate as a treaty, highlighting the significant obligations it would entail for the United States. The Senate's position on advising and consenting on treaties influenced the U.S. decision to treat the agreement with Russia as a treaty. Key issues in the arms control agreement included warhead definitions, transparency, and missile defense restraints. The U.S. and Russia had differences over counting weapons limited by the Moscow Treaty. Russia proposed using counting rules similar to START for warheads on deployed weapons. Parties could reduce warheads or destroy delivery vehicles to remove weapons from accountability. Russia wanted to make changes to the treaty. According to reports, Russia wanted the Moscow Treaty to count the maximum number of warheads that could be carried by a delivery vehicle without allowing reductions. The United States did not plan to use START counting rules to calculate \"operationally deployed\" warheads. Delivery vehicles not deployed with warheads would not count against the limits under the U.S. formula. Warheads removed from deployed systems also would not count. The parties would not have to eliminate delivery vehicles or stored warheads to reduce the number of warheads counted under the agreement. The United States preferred a different approach to counting warheads under the Moscow Treaty, wanting to maintain the ability to reverse reductions if needed. They did not want to bear the costs of eliminating launchers and delivery vehicles according to START rules, such as removing ballistic missile launch tubes from submarines or limiting aircrafts' nuclear capabilities. The United States planned to have two ballistic missile submarines in overhaul at any one time, with the Bush Administration not counting the warheads that could be deployed on these vessels under the treaty's limits. If all weapons on these systems were counted, the U.S. would retain nearly 4,000 warheads. Russia accepted the U.S. position of not including START counting rules and elimination procedures in the treaty, clearing the way for its completion. Russia initially insisted on radical cuts in strategic offensive weapons in the Moscow Treaty, including the elimination of delivery vehicles and warheads removed from service. The United States argued that previous arms control agreements did not require the elimination of warheads removed from deployment, allowing for their storage, spare parts, and possible redeployment. Russia eventually softened its objection, agreeing that warheads could be stored temporarily before eventual elimination. Additionally, Russia addressed the issue of \"reload capability\" through the treaty's counting rules. The Moscow Treaty addressed the issue of \"reload capability\" through counting rules. Russia wanted delivery vehicles to count as the maximum number of warheads they could carry and to eliminate them before warheads could be removed from treaty totals. The Bush Administration rejected this, wanting to maintain the ability to redeploy warheads quickly. General Yuriy Baluyevskiy believed the question of warhead storage was still unresolved. The Russian General Staff believed the issue of warhead storage was unresolved under the Moscow Treaty. The United States did not endorse the idea of using a special bilateral commission to discuss warheads removed from deployment. The absence of counting rules and elimination provisions in the proposed limits would make monitoring deployed warheads difficult. START Treaty allowed on-site inspections to view reentry vehicles but did not count the actual number of warheads on delivery vehicles. The United States proposed new transparency measures during negotiations for an agreement on warhead reductions. These measures could include detailed information exchanges, site visits, additional inspections, and activities to verify reductions of deployed systems. A reentry vehicle inspection system similar to the one in START could be used to confirm declared warhead numbers on missiles. Russia and the United States discussed transparency measures and verification regimes for a new agreement on warhead reductions. Russia agreed to the need for transparency measures, drawing on START I for reference. However, there was disagreement on which measures to include, with Russia favoring formal inspections and data exchanges while the US preferred a more general cooperation approach. The US and Russia disagreed on the specifics of transparency measures and verification regimes for a new warhead reduction agreement. Despite signing the treaty at the Moscow summit, they continued discussions on the issue. Secretary of State Powell mentioned that sufficient data could be collected through cooperation, including the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. START I Treaty would remain in force until 2009. The START I Treaty would remain in force through 2009, and Russia insisted on assurances that the U.S. missile defense program would not undermine its strategic nuclear deterrent. The U.S. refused to include language limiting ballistic missile defenses in the new agreement, stating that their program was not directed at Russia. The Bush Administration did not believe U.S. missile defenses should be limited by treaties, but the U.S. and Russia agreed to cooperate on missile defense through a Joint Declaration, aiming to increase transparency and confidence in this area. The U.S. and Russia agreed to cooperate on missile defense through a Joint Declaration, aiming to increase transparency and confidence. Tensions rose as Russia expressed concerns about U.S. plans to deploy missile defense interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, or Moscow Treaty, outlines the obligations assumed by both nations. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, or Moscow Treaty, includes arms control obligations and outlines the reduction of strategic nuclear warheads by the United States and Russia to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads by December 31, 2012. The treaty will be registered at the United Nations. The Moscow Treaty aims to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. There is ambiguity in counting warheads, as each country can use its own definition. The treaty does not set interim limits or pace for reductions, allowing flexibility for each side to adjust their pace within the 10-year timeframe. The Moscow Treaty aims to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. Each party can determine the composition of its strategic offensive arms without specific limits on delivery vehicles or types of weapons systems. This differs from past arms control agreements that imposed sublimits on warheads carried on ballistic missiles and mobile ICBMs. START I and START II treaties had sublimits on warheads and heavy ICBMs. The Moscow Treaty aims to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012, allowing each party to determine the composition of its strategic offensive arms without specific limits on delivery vehicles or types of weapons systems. In contrast, the START II Treaty, which contained a sublimit on SLBM warheads and a ban on multiple-warhead ICBMs, will not be implemented. U.S. and Russian officials have acknowledged the demise of START II, with Assistant Secretary of Defense J.D. Crouch stating that they have moved beyond it. The Defense Minister and Foreign Minister informed the Russian Duma in mid-May 2003 that the START II treaty had lapsed after the US withdrew from the ABM Treaty in late 2002. Russia was no longer obligated to eliminate all of its MIRVed ICBMs with the new treaty. The START Treaty remains in force, separate from the Moscow Treaty. The provisions of the START Treaty remained unchanged by the Moscow Treaty, with data exchanges, notifications, on-site inspections, and a Bilateral Implementation Commission established. The parties will meet at least twice a year in this forum. The Moscow Treaty established a Bilateral Implementation Commission for meetings at least twice a year. The commission's purpose is to discuss issues related to the treaty, but no guidelines are provided for the meetings. The U.S. and Russia may have different preferences for the commission's role, with Russia possibly seeking to address limits on warheads removed from service. Article IV of the Moscow Treaty outlines the ratification process, duration, and withdrawal terms. The treaty will be legally binding and remain in force until December 31, 2012, with the possibility of extension or replacement. Parties could increase warheads above the 2,200 limit once the treaty expires, and either party can withdraw with three months' notice, unlike previous treaties that required six months notice. The new treaty outlined in the curr_chunk allows for withdrawal with only three months' notice, unlike previous treaties that required six months' notice and cited \"extraordinary events\" as a reason for withdrawal. The United States proposed a 45-day withdrawal period and flexibility to exceed treaty limits temporarily, but these were not included in the final draft. The final draft of the treaty does not contain interim limits or schedules for reductions, allowing either party to exceed the limits until December 31, 2012. The tables display U.S. and Russian force structures under the START Treaty, START II Treaty, and Treaty of Moscow for comparison. The United States completed its implementation of START in December 2001, with strategic nuclear forces including Minuteman III ICBMs and Peacekeeper ICBMs. The United States' strategic nuclear forces include 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, 18 Trident submarines, 141 B-52 H bombers, 47 B-1 bombers, and 18 B-2 bombers. The U.S. eliminated 50 Minuteman III ICBMs and 50 Peacekeeper missiles but kept the silos. Additionally, some Trident submarines were converted to carry cruise missiles. The United States' strategic nuclear forces include B-1 and B-2 bombers, with B-1 bombers no longer equipped for nuclear missions but still counted as warheads under START. B-2 bombers can carry up to 16 gravity bombs, each counted as one warhead under START. The force structure identified in 1994 for the START II Treaty included Minuteman III missiles, Trident submarines with SLBMs, B-52 bombers, and B-2 bombers. The B-52 bombers would carry cruise missiles, and the B-2 bombers would carry gravity bombs. The United States planned to reduce its strategic nuclear forces by eliminating Trident submarines, Peacekeeper missiles, and warheads from Minuteman and Trident missiles to comply with START II limits. The Bush Administration also decided to eliminate 50 Minuteman ICBMs and deploy 450 Minuteman III missiles and 14 Trident submarines with reduced warheads. The Bush Administration planned to reduce its strategic nuclear forces by eliminating Trident submarines, Peacekeeper missiles, and warheads from Minuteman and Trident missiles to comply with START II limits. In addition, the Administration announced plans to reduce the B-52 fleet to 56 bombers, with many bombers assigned to conventional units on a day-to-day basis not counted under treaty limits. Russia's strategic nuclear forces in July 2009 included various types of ICBMs and ballistic missile submarines. Russia's strategic nuclear forces in July 2009 included 14 ballistic missile submarines with different types of missiles and a bomber fleet of 76 aircraft. Under START rules, each bomber counted as 8 warheads but could carry up to 16 cruise missiles. The force totaled 3,897 warheads under the START Treaty. START II would have required the elimination of all SS-18 ICBMs, with Russia potentially retaining 105 SS-19 ICBMs and 400-700 single warhead ICBMs depending on production capabilities. Russia's submarine fleet could have had up to 13 submarines. Russia's strategic nuclear forces in July 2009 included 14 ballistic missile submarines and a bomber fleet of 76 aircraft. Russia could only reach the START II limits of 3,000-3,500 warheads by deploying over 800 ICBMs, 13 ballistic missile submarines, and 78 aircraft. Most analysts believe Russia would not have the economic resources to support this force, leading to interest in a new agreement limiting warheads to 1,500. Russia's strategic nuclear forces are expected to decline over the next 10 years as aging systems are retired and only small numbers of new missiles are produced. Russia's strategic nuclear forces are expected to decline over the next 10 years as aging systems are retired and only small numbers of new missiles are produced. If Russia deployed new ICBMs with multiple warheads, it could retain a force of 2,064 warheads. Alternatively, producing fewer missiles with single warheads would result in a force of fewer than 500 ICBM warheads and a total of 1,624 warheads. Russia entered negotiations seeking a treaty for significant reductions in U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons, achieving the first objective. Russian officials and analysts view the signing of a formal arms control treaty as a major success for Russian diplomacy. The treaty ensures that as Russia reduces its nuclear forces due to economic pressures, the United States will also reduce its forces to maintain rough nuclear parity. This agreement also signifies that the U.S. commitment to reduce its forces will continue beyond the Bush Administration. Despite Russia no longer being a military or economic equal to the U.S., both countries are seen as equal partners in the arms control process. President Putin's key objective was to retain a \"seat at the table\" with the United States, despite Russia no longer being a military or economic equal. Russia failed to convince the U.S. to adopt certain counting rules or provisions in the arms control treaty, but Russian officials still believed they could achieve their objectives. The Treaty of Moscow did not address the issue of limiting non-deployed warheads, but Russian officials claimed success in linking offensive and defensive systems. The Joint Declaration provided assurances on U.S. missile defenses through expanded information exchanges and cooperation. The U.S. aimed to maintain flexibility in nuclear sizing and structuring without signing a formal arms control treaty. The Bush Administration agreed to a formal arms control treaty with Russia despite initially wanting unrestricted flexibility in nuclear forces. The decision was influenced by U.S. Senators pressuring for a treaty and the hope that it could strengthen relations with Russian leaders. The treaty signed by President Putin and President Medvedev strengthened cooperation with the United States in security policy. Despite initial criticisms, the treaty rewarded Putin for his cooperation. However, strains in the U.S.-Russian relationship continued, raising doubts about the impact of arms control on broader relations. Ratification of the treaty requires approval from both houses of Parliament in Russia. In both Russia and the United States, approval from the respective legislatures is required for ratification of arms control agreements. Recent years have seen reluctance in both nations to approve such treaties without significant debate and reservations. The Russian Duma has linked consideration of arms control treaties to objections on other aspects of U.S. policy. The U.S. Senate has imposed conditions on ratification of treaties in the past, such as with the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997. The Clinton Administration did not submit several 1997 agreements related to the 1972 ABM Treaty out of fear of Senate rejection. The Moscow Treaty faced little opposition in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats praising it for different reasons. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not recommend any amendments to the treaty but included reservations and conditions in its Resolution of Ratification. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Resolution of Ratification with reservations and conditions, requiring annual progress reports on reducing forces, non-binding declarations on force reduction and assistance to Russia. The full Senate later approved the Resolution with a 95-0 vote, including these provisions. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Resolution of Ratification with conditions, requiring progress reports on reducing forces and assistance to Russia. The Russian Duma also showed independence on arms control treaties, delaying the vote on START II for seven years and including conditions in its ratification. The Russian Duma delayed its debate and vote on the START II treaty, raising questions about Russia's financing for nuclear forces. Despite some opposition, President Putin had strong support in the Duma, with most members praising him for securing a \"legally binding\" treaty with the United States. The Russian Working Group, consisting of Duma and Federation Council members, reviewed and approved the Moscow Treaty, which entered into force on June 1, 2003. It was set to expire in 2012 but may end in early 2011 due to the new START Treaty signed by the US and Russia. The US Senate ratified the New START Treaty in 2010, with analysts praising the Moscow Treaty as a positive step in reducing nuclear weapons. The Moscow Treaty, a formal treaty between the US and Russia, was praised for its commitment to nuclear disarmament. However, some critics in both countries noted the absence of provisions for eliminating delivery vehicles or warheads, leading to concerns about Russia being at a disadvantage. The Moscow Treaty was praised for nuclear disarmament, but concerns were raised about the retention of excess warheads in storage. Critics fear potential risks of warheads being sold or stolen by terrorist organizations. Russia sees the treaty as the end of the START II Treaty, allowing flexibility in structuring its forces. In the US, critics worry that the ban on MIRVed ICBMs could undermine stability. Russia's high alert status for its nuclear weapons could lead to accidental launches. Deployment of new MIRVed ICBMs in Russia may prompt the US to increase warheads, risking treaty collapse. The new treaty does not address non-strategic nuclear weapons, which Russia has 3,800 of, raising concerns about their security and role in national security policy. Russia's national security policy has seen an increased focus on weapons, including nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration acknowledged concerns about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons, which were to be discussed in the new Consultative Group for Strategic Stability. However, discussions on this issue did not take place during the summit. The State Department provided reports on the implementation of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty to Congress as required. The United States and Russia were ahead of schedule in reducing their nuclear warheads under the Offensive Reductions Treaty. The Bush Administration promised frequent discussions on nuclear forces and strategic relationships, but few talks actually took place. Compliance questions were rare due to the lack of rules and definitions in the treaty. The United States and Russia reduced their forces under the Offensive Reductions Treaty. They disbanded a transparency working group and replaced it with talks on arms control after the START Treaty expires in 2009. The START Treaty provided important data for monitoring compliance with the Moscow Treaty, but its value was downplayed in the 2006 report. The START data provides additional information for monitoring the Moscow Treaty. Russia calls for a new treaty to replace START, but the Bush Administration rejected this. The Obama Administration pursued formal negotiations with Russia to replace the START Treaty with a new one for further reductions in nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia signed the New START Treaty on April 8, 2010, aiming for further reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and implementing monitoring and verification provisions. The treaty is based on mutual security, cooperation, trust, openness, and predictability, with a focus on significant reductions in strategic offensive arms. The United States and Russia signed the New START Treaty on April 8, 2010, aiming for further reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. The treaty is based on mutual security, cooperation, trust, openness, and predictability, with a focus on significant reductions in strategic offensive arms. In a joint statement, both countries agreed to reduce and limit strategic nuclear warheads to promote security, cooperation, and international stability. The New START Treaty, signed by the US and Russia in 2010, aims to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to 1700-2200 for each Party by December 31, 2012. The treaty remains in force, with regular meetings for implementation. It will be ratified according to each Party's constitutional procedures and will stay in effect until December 31. The Treaty of Moscow, signed in 2002, will remain in force until December 31, 2012, and can be extended by agreement of the Parties. Each Party can withdraw with three months notice. The Treaty will be registered with the United Nations. The Moscow Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Moscow, signed in 2002, will be in force until December 31, 2012, and can be extended by agreement of the Parties. Each Party can withdraw with three months notice. The Treaty will be registered with the United Nations. The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the Moscow Treaty is subject to conditions outlined in section 2, including the submission of reports on Cooperative Threat Reduction assistance to Russia. The Russian Federation is required to submit an annual report on the implementation of the Treaty on nuclear weapons to the US Senate committees. The report should include strategic nuclear weapons force levels of both countries. The Russian Federation must provide an annual report to US Senate committees on strategic nuclear weapons force levels and planned reductions, transparency measures, and implementation progress of the Treaty. The Senate requires the Russian Federation to report annually on strategic nuclear weapons force levels, reductions, transparency measures, and Treaty implementation progress. The Senate's advice and consent to ratify the Moscow Treaty is subject to declarations expressing intent, including reaffirming conditions related to previous agreements. The Senate encourages further strategic arms reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with national security requirements and alliance obligations. Regular briefings on implementation issues related to the Moscow Treaty are expected to be provided to the Senate committees. The Senate urges the President to engage the Russian Federation on nonstrategic nuclear weapons issues, including difficulties in determining the number and security of these weapons. This engagement should include discussions at the Bilateral Implementation Commission and other diplomatic channels. Presidential determinations on these issues are also to be reported within 30 days after meetings. The Senate urges the President to engage the Russian Federation to improve confidence in the accounting and security of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. It also encourages the acceleration of US strategic force reductions in light of the decreased threat posed by Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal. The Senate urges the President to consult with them before taking actions relevant to strategic offensive reductions required by the Treaty before December 31, 2012."
