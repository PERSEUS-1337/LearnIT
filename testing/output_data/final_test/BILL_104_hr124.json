The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a language training credit of 50% of qualified expenses paid by the taxpayer for employee language training. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, books, and supplies. The taxpayer can claim a credit for wages paid for providing qualified language training to employees, along with expenses for books and supplies used in the training. Only domestic employment qualifies for this credit. The taxpayer can claim a credit for providing qualified language training to employees if the services are performed in the United States or a U.S. possession. Qualified language training includes English language and literacy training for individuals with limited English proficiency. The credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. The tax code allows a credit for qualified language training expenses, including English language and literacy training for employees with limited English proficiency. The credit can be claimed under section 38 of the tax code and is subject to certain limitations to prevent double benefits. The tax code provides a credit for language training expenses, subject to limitations to prevent double benefits. The credit is reduced by the unused portion of the language training credit against the normal limitation. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
