    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act\" and authorizes the completion of the third phase of the Umatilla Basin Project. The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act authorizes the construction of the third phase of the Umatilla Basin Project to provide additional flows in the Umatilla River for anadromous fish through a water exchange with Westland Irrigation District. Before construction, a feasibility study will be conducted to identify alternatives to provide exchange flows to restore the Umatilla River fishery. The study will examine engineering, environmental, and economic factors associated with project alternatives. The feasibility study for the Umatilla Basin Project will include technical engineering and hydrologic analyses, biological analyses for fish restoration, and assessment of the best value per expenditure. It will also analyze the inclusion of other irrigators, consolidation of facilities, water transfers, delivery scheduling, backup systems, water conservation, and other analyses deemed necessary by the Secretary. Before completing Phase III facilities, an exchange agreement with Westland Irrigation District for the use of Columbia River water must be negotiated and executed. The Umatilla Basin Project includes an exchange agreement with Westland Irrigation District for Columbia River water use in exchange for Umatilla River or McKay Reservoir water. The Federal Government is responsible for operation and maintenance costs, and the Bonneville Power Administration will provide power for project pumping. The Umatilla Basin Project, in coordination with the Administrator, will provide project power for Phase III water exchange to mitigate anadromous fishery impacts. The cost of power will be offset from the Administrator's annual Treasury payments. Project facilities authorized by sections 215 through 219 will be integrated into the existing Umatilla Basin Project. The Umatilla Basin Project will provide project power for Phase III water exchange to mitigate fishery impacts, with costs offset from annual Treasury payments. Project facilities authorized by sections 215 through 219 will be integrated into the existing Umatilla Basin Project, including a boundary adjustment for irrigation districts. The Umatilla Basin Project will adjust the boundaries of irrigation districts including Hermiston, Stanfield, West Extension, and Westland to include specific acres identified in their 1993 requests to the Bureau of Reclamation. The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act requires the Secretary to complete environmental reviews within 6 months of enactment at no cost to irrigation districts. The districts will provide water from McKay Reservoir for environmental enhancement according to options specified by the Secretary. Storage capacity for environmental purposes will be provided annually. The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act requires irrigation districts to provide water from McKay Reservoir for environmental enhancement purposes annually from 1997 to 2002. The amounts of water to be provided each year are specified, with a choice between fixed amounts or a percentage determined by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act mandates the Secretary to grant $300,000 annually from 1997 to 2002 to the Westland Irrigation District for improvements. Failure to provide the grant exempts the district from supplying water for that year. Additionally, the Secretary must choose between Option A or Option B within 9 months of the Act's enactment, and parcels must have a valid State water right to receive project water. The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act requires a valid State water right for project water, with no alterations in ability to pay for irrigation districts due to boundary adjustments. Legal descriptions of district boundaries must be provided in contracts. SEC. 217. WATER PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, will discuss water claims and needs in the Umatilla River Basin with the State of Oregon. They will work on developing a water management plan for the basin, including restoring the anadromous fishery and creating an integrated ground water/surface water model. The Secretary will report on the progress of facilities, water management plan, ground water/surface water model, and tribal water claims discussions in the Upper Umatilla River Basin within 2 years of the Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act. The Secretary will report on the progress of facilities, water management plan, ground water/surface water model, and tribal water claims discussions in the Upper Umatilla River Basin within 2 years of the Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act, including a joint water supply system. The Secretary is authorized to contract with the Tribes for the construction of an off-stream storage reservoir near the Tribes' reservation in Oregon, with a capacity of 10,000 acre-feet. The reservoir must comply with all laws and minimize adverse effects on the Umatilla River fishery. Diverted water for storage must not harm the Umatilla River anadromous fishery. The Tribes and the city of Pendleton may agree to higher levels of protection for instream flows when diverting water for the reservoir. The reservoir will only be filled during high flow periods to preserve the ecological value of the Umatilla River. The City agrees to provide funding for feasibility planning, environmental studies, and construction of the reservoir. The City and Tribes will share operation and maintenance costs based on water reservation. City to use water rights for fishery improvement, with reservoir water available for municipal use. Allocation of funds for reservoir construction is 70% City, 30% Tribes unless mutually agreed otherwise. The reservoir facility will be jointly held by the City and the United States in trust for the Tribes. The Secretary may transfer operation and maintenance responsibility to either the Tribes or the City. Funds authorized under this section may be contracted to the Tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. \"Authorization of appropriations for the reservoir facility, with the possibility of transferring operation and maintenance responsibility to the Tribes or the City.\" The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for feasibility studies, environmental studies, and construction of Phase III Exchange, with a limit of $64,000,000. Additionally, up to $500,000 is authorized for tribal water claims. Administrative overhead costs are capped at 25% of the total amount appropriated. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for various purposes, including tribal water claims discussions, water management plans, enforcement of exchange water for instream uses, and feasibility studies for off-stream storage reservoir construction. Total funding limits are set for each category. SEC. 3. WATER RIGHTS. This Act does not affect state water laws or rights, does not create new water rights, and does not establish federal reserved water rights. The Congress expects that the Umatilla Basin Project will fulfill the Federal Government's obligations to provide water for fishery purposes to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation as per their 1855 treaty with the United States."
