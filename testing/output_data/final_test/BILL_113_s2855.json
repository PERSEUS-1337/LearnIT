    "content": "The \"Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014\" is aimed at protecting older, longer service participants. The Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014 aims to protect older, longer service participants by amending the Internal Revenue Code to ensure that contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. The Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014 protects older, longer service participants in defined benefit plans by ensuring that closed classes of participants and their benefits meet certain requirements. The Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014 protects closed classes of participants in defined benefit plans by requiring plan amendments to meet specific requirements for benefits, rights, and features. If a plan amendment fails to meet these requirements, the plan can still be considered compliant if it met the requirements before the effective date of the amendment. The Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014 protects closed classes of participants in defined benefit plans by requiring plan amendments to meet specific requirements for benefits. Defined contribution plans can be tested on a benefits basis if they provide make-whole contributions to a closed class of participants whose defined benefit plan accruals have been reduced or eliminated. The Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014 protects closed classes of participants in defined benefit plans by requiring plan amendments to meet specific requirements for benefits. Plan amendments must satisfy section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) when the class of participants is closed. Any amendments made after the class is closed must also meet the requirements to ensure compliance with the Act. The paragraph discusses the requirements for plan amendments to closed classes of participants in defined contribution plans, ensuring compliance with specific regulations. The curr_chunk discusses the aggregation and testing of defined contribution plans with make-whole contributions and matching contributions or employee stock ownership plans for benefits basis testing. Matching contributions are defined in subsection (m)(4)(A). The curr_chunk discusses make-whole contributions for retirement benefits, treated similarly to employer contributions, and defined as allocations to replace retirement benefits. The curr_chunk discusses protecting grandfathered participants in defined benefit plans by allowing testing on a benefits basis with defined contribution plans. The curr_chunk outlines the conditions for defined contribution plans to provide benefits to a closed class of participants while maintaining compliance with certain requirements. The curr_chunk discusses plan amendments for defined contribution plans to meet requirements without regard to certain subclauses. Testing methodologies are also mentioned for compliance. The curr_chunk discusses aggregating defined benefit plans with defined contribution plans for compliance testing purposes. The curr_chunk discusses rules for preventing abuse of plan designs permitted by certain sections, including treating matching contributions like employer contributions. The curr_chunk outlines rules to prevent abuses in defined benefit plans, focusing on closed classes of participants and reduced accruals. Transition rules are to be established within a year of the Retirement Security Preservation Act of 2014. The curr_chunk amends participation requirements for defined benefit plans to protect closed classes of participants and prevent unnecessary plan amendments. The curr_chunk states that if a defined benefit plan amends to cease all benefit accruals or provide future benefit accruals only to a closed class of participants, it must meet certain requirements. The Secretary has the authority to establish rules to prevent abuse of this provision. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, regardless of plan modifications."
