    "content": "The \"College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009\" may be cited as the College Opportunity Tax Credit. The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009 amends the Hope scholarship credit to increase the credit amount for qualified tuition and related expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year. The Hope scholarship credit is increased for qualified tuition and related expenses paid during the taxable year, with a maximum credit of $2,000 plus 50% of expenses exceeding $2,000 but not exceeding $6,000. The aggregate credits allowed will be increased accordingly. The text discusses the treatment of credits allowed under a specific subparagraph, which will reduce the amount of credit otherwise allowable without regard to certain sections. Additionally, it mentions the extension of the credit allowed for 4 years and for any year of post-secondary education. The Lifetime Learning Credit for a student with an election in effect is 40% of qualified tuition expenses up to $1,000, plus 20% of expenses exceeding $1,000 but not exceeding the applicable limit. The Lifetime Learning Credit allows for 40% of qualified tuition expenses up to $1,000, plus 20% of expenses exceeding $1,000 but not exceeding 3 times the dollar amount in effect for the taxable year. Special rules apply for determining expenses, including coordination with the Hope Scholarship Credit and allowing expenses for job skills courses. The Lifetime Learning Credit covers expenses for job skills courses at eligible educational institutions, with limitations based on the amount of tax for the taxable year. Section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting \"25B(i)(1)(B)\" before \"35\". The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008."
