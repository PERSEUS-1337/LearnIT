    "content": "The \"Family Reconciliation Act\" may be cited as the short title. States with approved family reconciliation plans have a set-aside under this Act. The \"Family Reconciliation Act\" reserves 10 percent of funds for States with approved family reconciliation plans to develop counseling programs. Assistance is provided for developing these programs under the Act. The \"Family Reconciliation Act\" allocates funds for States with approved family reconciliation plans to develop counseling programs for couples going through a divorce with children under 12 years old. The \"Family Reconciliation Act\" requires couples with children under 12 years old seeking divorce to undergo a 60-day waiting period and participate in counseling programs discussing the impact of divorce on the family and society. The Secretary will approve plans meeting the Act's requirements, and states with approved plans will receive allotments for counseling programs. The Secretary will allot funds to states with approved family reconciliation plans based on the average annual number of final dissolutions of marriage in the state over a 3-year period compared to all states with approved plans. The amendments made by subsection (a) entitle each State with an approved family reconciliation plan to an amount equal to their allotment under section 433(d) for the fiscal year. The amendments made by subsection (a) will be effective on October 1, 1995. The Legal Services Corporation Act is amended to allow funds to be used for providing legal assistance in cases of marriage dissolution or legal separation, with exceptions for cases of abuse."
