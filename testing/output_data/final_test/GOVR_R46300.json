In FY2018, 22.8 million VWP visitors entered the U.S., up almost 30% from FY2008. Countries must meet strict criteria to join the VWP, including information-sharing agreements and security standards. Admission into the U.S. is not guaranteed for travelers from VWP countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows nationals from 39 countries to enter the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. Travelers must obtain preclearance through ESTA and may be denied entry by CBP officers. The report discusses national security implications, economic effects on the travel industry, and legislative proposals related to the VWP. The VWP allows nationals from 39 countries to enter the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. Countries must meet specific requirements to participate in the program, including offering reciprocal privileges to U.S. citizens and having a low visa refusal rate. The DHS and DOS have the authority to designate participants, with final approval based on meeting all requirements. Countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program must have tamper-resistant, machine-readable visa documents with biometric identifiers, validate passports at entry ports, report lost or stolen passports within 24 hours, screen foreign nationals using INTERPOL databases, accept repatriation of individuals with removal orders within three weeks. As of March 2020, countries in the Visa Waiver Program must share information with the United States on potential threats, have low visitor visa refusal rates, and meet security criteria. Advocates of expanding the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) argue that the current 3% nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate criterion should be replaced with the overstay rate to accurately assess program participation. They suggest raising the refusal rate threshold or reintroducing the nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate waiver. DHS faces challenges in accurately calculating overstay rates due to reliance on passenger manifests, leading to potential mischaracterization of overstays. The nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate waiver was available from October 2008 to July 2009, allowing DHS to admit countries with low overstay rates and declining visa refusal rates below 10%. Eight countries were added to the VWP in 2008 due to this waiver. The Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to waive the refusal rate is suspended until biometric matching with watchlists is possible. In FY2018, all VWP countries had overstay rates below 0.5%. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has a low overstay rate, with most countries having rates below 2%. The program has expanded over the years, with countries like the United Kingdom and Japan being admitted in the late 1980s. In the past decade, more countries have joined the VWP. Since 1999, several countries have been added to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including Chile, Greece, Taiwan, and Poland. Argentina and Uruguay were removed in 2002 and 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has admitted four countries into the VWP since 2010. Many countries are interested in joining the program, with the George W. Bush Administration providing road maps to help them meet the criteria. aspirants. This report examines aspiring VWP countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Israel, Romania, and Uruguay. Four EU countries - Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania - are not in the VWP. The European Commission has raised concerns about visa reciprocity with the United States. Israel and Brazil are aspiring to enter the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Israel faces challenges due to its Biometric Database Law and accusations of discrimination against Arab Americans. Brazil recently introduced visa-free entry for U.S. citizens. In June 2019, Brazil implemented visa-free entry for U.S. citizens and citizens of three other countries to boost tourism. Countries can be removed from the program if their participation undermines U.S. law enforcement. Argentina and Uruguay were former members of the VWP but were removed due to economic conditions leading to illegal immigration. The VWP aims to enhance national security. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) prioritizes national security by implementing security criteria like ESTA, introduced in 2009 by DHS. VWP partner countries must share information and meet travel documentation standards. There are concerns about the VWP's vetting process for individual travelers. Travelers must submit biographical information through ESTA, which checks against law enforcement databases to determine eligibility. If not approved, a visa is required for entry into the U.S. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) introduced ESTA in 2009 for security. Travelers must submit biographical information through ESTA for screening against security databases. If not approved, a visa is needed before coming to the U.S. ESTA became fully operational for VWP visitors in 2009, streamlining the screening process before travel. The ESTA system screens travelers to the United States against security databases and can revoke approval if new derogatory information is found. Biometric information is only collected upon reaching a U.S. port of entry. The ESTA system screens travelers to the United States for security purposes. Travelers pay a $14 fee, which may increase to $21 in the future. The VWP benefits the U.S. economy by promoting tourism, but there is debate about its impact on national security. The VWP enhances national security through country-to-country security agreements and individual traveler screening. Participating countries must share extensive information on security threats, issue biometric e-passports, and use U.S. counterterrorism information for traveler screening. Failure to comply can result in immediate suspension from the VWP. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows the United States to monitor foreign countries' border operations through regular audits. Participating countries are subject to security inspections of airports, seaports, land borders, and passport facilities to ensure compliance with VWP criteria. Joining the VWP incentivizes countries to share information and improve their border security. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) incentivizes countries to share information and improve border security. Participating countries must meet program requirements to join and remain in the VWP. VWP travelers are continuously vetted through ESTA for derogatory information, unlike nonimmigrant visitor visas. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows travelers to enter the US without a visa, but they must have e-passports and undergo biometric checks upon entry. Unlike nonimmigrant visitor visas, VWP travelers do not have personal interviews with US consular officers and are not required to submit social media identifiers. The Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act was passed in response to concerns about potential threats posed by nationals from VWP countries aligned with the Islamic State. This act makes citizens of VWP countries ineligible for admission to the United States under the VWP if they are dual nationals of certain countries. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows citizens from certain countries to travel to the United States without a visa. However, individuals who are dual nationals of specific countries or have been present in certain countries after March 1, 2011, are not eligible for the VWP. Countries with an overstay rate of over 2% must educate their citizens on U.S. admission conditions to prevent violations. The VWP aims to promote travel and tourism from low-risk countries to the United States. The number of international visitors to the United States was 79.3 million in 2019, slightly lower than the record high of 79.7 million in 2018. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel has sharply declined, leading to canceled flights and a projected decrease in visitor volume for 2020. The travel and tourism sectors in the U.S. accounted for 2.9% of the GDP in 2018, employing 9.2 million workers. Foreign visitors spent approximately $256 billion in 2018, making tourism the largest services sector export for the United States. In 2018, the U.S. travel and tourism industries had a trade surplus of $69.6 billion, with travel-related exports accounting for 31% of all U.S. services exports. International visitors spend an average of $4,200 per trip in the U.S., contributing significantly to the country's tourism spending. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries are among the highest spenders and visitors, but there is also an increasing number of visitors from non-VWP countries like China, Venezuela, and Brazil. In 2019, overseas visitors from non-VWP countries like China, Venezuela, Brazil, and India totaled nearly 6.7 million, spending over $5,000 per trip on average in the United States. Spending from China and India has increased significantly since 2013. Despite a rise in foreign visitors, the U.S. share of global tourism arrivals decreased from 6.4% in 2015 to 5.7% in 2017, possibly due to easier travel options to other regions like Asia and Africa. Before the global pandemic, the U.S. aimed to welcome 100 million international visitors by 2021, with efforts to expedite visa processing and encourage tourism from countries like China and Brazil. However, it was projected that the goal would not be met, with an expected total of around 82.9 million visitors. The impact of the pandemic on U.S. travel and tourism industries remains uncertain. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) may have contributed to increased travel to the United States by reducing uncertainty and costs associated with visa applications. Most VWP countries saw a rise in tourists and business visitors from FY2013 to FY2018, with many recording double-digit growth rates. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has led to growth in admissions from countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Spain, and New Zealand. Some VWP countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Japan, experienced a decrease in U.S. VWP admissions between FY2013 and FY2018. U.S. Travel's analyses suggest that adding new countries to the VWP could have positive economic impacts, with potential increases in visitation, economic growth, and job creation. An economic analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce data on travel and tourism from 1980 to 2013 found that the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) had a significant impact on increasing U.S. tourist volumes. U.S. Travel predicted that Poland's participation in the VWP would lead to a $312 million increase in travel spending by Polish visitors, 97,000 more Polish arrivals, and support for 4,200 American jobs. Adding four non-VWP EU countries to the program may have a relatively small economic effect based on visitor spending data. According to U.S. Travel estimates, joining the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) could bring significant increases in visitor numbers and travel spending from various countries. For example, Romania could see 38,000 more arrivals and $128 million in additional spending, while Israel could bring in $1.2 billion in travel spending with an additional 450,200 travelers over three years. Israeli visitors spent nearly $1.8 billion in the U.S. in 2018. The U.S. travel and tourism industries support expanding the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to other countries, such as Brazil, which was the fifth-largest tourism source market for the United States in 2018. Brazilian visitors spent an average of $5,200 per person, and the number of visitors from Brazil is projected to reach 2.6 million by 2024. Brazil will soon join the Global Entry program to reduce waiting times for approved Brazilian visitors at U.S. airport immigration checkpoints. The VWP is essential for promoting foreign tourism to the United States. The National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) provides official tourism statistics, while Brand USA is responsible for travel promotion and communicating U.S. visa policies. Brand USA was established under the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 and receives funding from the ESTA fee paid by visitors. Congress approved raising the ESTA fee to $21, with $7 going to Brand USA per traveler. The new ESTA fee allocation includes $4 for CBP administration costs and $10 for the U.S. Treasury. Brand USA faces controversy over funding allocation, with some advocating for private sector promotion of tourism. Airlines for America opposes Brand USA's reauthorization, suggesting ESTA funds be used for border security instead. The United States is considering rejoining the UNWTO to promote tourism worldwide. Other countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia are not members. Proposals in Congress aim to give DHS more flexibility in admitting countries to the VWP. Representative Mike Quigley introduced the JOLT Act. Representative Mike Quigley introduced the JOLT Act (H.R. 2187) to reinstate DHS's authority to grant waivers for nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rates and rename the VWP to Secure Travel Partnership. Another bill, H.R. 1996, also by Quigley, focuses solely on renaming the VWP. Representative Dan Lipinski introduced the Allied Nations Travel Modernization Act (H.R. 2946) to allow countries with low visa overstay rates and defense spending commitments to join the VWP, specifically targeting NATO nations like Poland. Senator John Cornyn introduced the HUMANE Act of 2019 (S. 1303) to deter VWP overstays by amending terms and conditions of admission for VWP travelers. Senator Mike Enzi introduced the America's Landscapes Act (S. 2783) to establish a fund for national park maintenance projects funded by increased ESTA and visa fees. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 increased visitor visa fees by $25 and park fees by $5. It extended Brand USA's authority to receive fees from the VWP until September 2027 and raised the ESTA fee. The private sector must contribute $100 million annually to Brand USA to receive federal funds."
