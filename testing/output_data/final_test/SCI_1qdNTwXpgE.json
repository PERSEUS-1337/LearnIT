    "content": "The use of AR in an industrial context could aid in training new operators by providing an AR guidance system. WAAT, a 3D authoring tool, allows for quick creation of 3D models of workstations and testing of AR guidance placement. This tool is designed to be user-friendly for non-AR specialists, such as assembly line managers. Future work includes deploying WAAT in a real boiler assembly line to assess usability. The XXX company, a boiler manufacturer, faces a training issue with new operators during peak seasons. Currently, training takes 3 days with experienced operators, halting production. It then takes 2 weeks for trainees to work independently. The XXX company faces a training issue with new operators during peak seasons. Training currently takes 3 days with experienced operators, followed by 2 weeks for trainees to work independently. To improve training, an AR-based system is proposed for operators to train directly on the assembly line without the need for an experienced operator. AR can also be used for expert remote guidance, collaborative engineering, digital inspection, testing ergonomics, and new layout designs in the industrial context. The most interesting feature of AR is assembly assistance for training purposes. The AR-based operator training system requires a quick and easy creation of a 3D representation of the assembly line, along with the placement of anchors and markers for guidance elements. The tool must be user-friendly for operators unfamiliar with AR technology. Line managers, who may not be familiar with AR, will be the final users of the authoring tool. The paper is organized into sections discussing industrial constraints, related work, and justifying design choices. The authoring tool described in section 4, called WAAT, is designed to help operators on assembly lines save time. The tool considers time and space constraints, as well as the need for flexibility in rearranging workstations. This is crucial for managing assembly lines that can be changed throughout the day to accommodate different boiler models. The WAAT authoring tool allows the line manager to easily update 3D models of workstations and AR guidance panels to match the real assembly line. This tool enables comparison between 3D models and real objects, as well as resizing and moving 3D objects for better alignment with the actual scene. The state of the art 3D authoring tools like SolidWorks, Inventor, CATIA, Pro/ENGINEER, and AutoCAD are widely used in the industry for creating 3D models of components and workstations. However, these tools have a steep learning curve and require additional software to export files to AR engines like Unreal or Unity. Digital content creation tools like Blender, 3dsMax, Maya, and SketchUp are used to create 3D models for AR engines. While tools like SolidWorks and AutoCAD are great for precise models, they have a steep learning curve. In contrast, SketchUp is easier to learn but produces less accurate models. For AR guidance tools, accurate 3D models are not necessary, just representations of components and their positions are needed. To use AR authoring tools in assembly lines, knowing the 3D model's location in space is crucial. Various tracking techniques, like using markers for object positioning, are essential for accurate and stable AR usage in industrial settings. Markers can be images, QR codes, or colored paper, making them easy to implement and useful in dynamic environments like assembly lines. The emergence of AR has led to the development of tools like ARToolkit and Vuforia for building AR applications. These tools require programming skills in C/C++ or C# to create AR content, posing a challenge for non-programmers. There is a need for high-level AR authoring tools that are user-friendly for creating AR content without programming skills. High-level AR authoring tools are needed for non-programmers. Earlier frameworks like DART and AMIRE were GUI-based, while APRIL was based on XML descriptions. Recent studies focus on 3D GUI-based authoring tools like ACARS. These tools aim to simplify AR content creation for users without programming skills. The maintenance technician can author AR content on-site using a tangible object to change information position. AR authoring tools like SUGAR and ARAUM allow experts to place AR information around equipment using depth maps. VEDILS framework enables users to create AR content for mobile using a desktop application with visual programming and behavioral blocks. Mobile AR authoring tools like HARATIO allow users to add 3D objects to scenes with behavior scripts using a radial menu. Limitations include interactions on touch screens or directly with markers, restricting associations to one marker per 3D object. Desktop applications are typically used by experts or designers for authoring tasks, but there is a need for tools usable by line managers. WAAT is an authoring tool designed for creating 3D scenes of workstations by placing 3D objects. It allows users to compare the 3D model with the real workstation and consists of a desktop 3D authoring module and an AR authoring module. The tool addresses the limitations of mobile authoring tools and the need for tools usable by line managers. The authoring module in WAAT is used to modify and validate the placement of 3D models. The modules are connected by a server, allowing users to modify scenes on desktop or AR. WAAT is developed with Unity using Vuforia for AR marker tracking. The AR hardware used is the Microsoft Hololens. To deploy on other AR devices like Magic Leap, the Magic Leap extension of the SDK can be added. Desktop authoring is done with simple interactions using a mouse and keyboard. Objects can be selected from the interface and their position in the scene defined. Properties can be changed easily. The authoring module in WAAT allows users to modify and validate 3D models' placement. Users can save or load scenes, with drag and drop interaction. Testing is done on tasks like installing a graphic card. The tool can be used in immersive mode, but currently, users prefer non-immersive mode. The AR feature helps compare 3D objects with real objects for accuracy. The AR Tool in WAAT allows users to manipulate 3D objects to match real objects for accurate placement. Users can save their work and load different scenes to check the 3D modeling. WAAT also helps place markers for AR guidance of operators at workstations. The AR Tool in WAAT assists users in placing markers for AR guidance at workstations by matching virtual markers with real markers. Specific markers are placed at specific positions for each workstation, and if the real marker is not in the correct position, the 3D objects will be displaced. Users can adjust the virtual marker position if needed. The AR Tool in WAAT allows users to create 3D models of the assembly line in a boiler factory. Users can adjust the positioning of markers and objects in the AR scene to ensure proper alignment with the real model. This tool enables fast creation and comparison of 3D and real models, with the ability to make adjustments as needed. The AR tool in WAAT allows users to create 3D models of the assembly line in a boiler factory. Users can adjust 3D components to match the real workstation and test AR guidance for training assembly line operators. Modifications made in desktop and AR are saved on a server. Testing with 3D elements corresponding to the factory's workstations is needed to determine the level of detail and fidelity required. Additionally, testing with real operators will assess the usability and intuitiveness of WAAT. Exploration of adding accessories like a controller for moving/rotating/resizing 3D objects is planned, along with testing new AR systems for usability and native interactions. The immersive mode of WAAT will allow visualization of the augmented environment and testing of operator guidance placement. AR scenes can be simulated without the need to be physically present in the plant. Testing new AR systems for usability and native interactions is also planned."
