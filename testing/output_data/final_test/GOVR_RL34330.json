    "content": "The U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was implemented on March 15, 2012, aiming to reduce bilateral trade barriers and enhance rules governing trade and investment. Provisions cover various sectors like manufactured goods, agriculture, services, foreign investment, intellectual property rights, and worker rights. The agreement phased in some provisions over time, with the U.S. seeking increased market access in South Korea for various products and services to maintain competitiveness. The KORUS FTA aimed to reduce trade barriers and enhance rules governing trade and investment between the U.S. and South Korea. It provided increased market access for various products and services. The agreement's largest commercial effects are expected to be microeconomic, with specific industries likely to see noticeable impacts. However, the increase in the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has raised questions about the agreement's benefits. Some U.S. companies have raised concerns about the implementation of the KORUS agreement, citing issues with South Korean customs requirements and a tax program that may discriminate against U.S.-made cars. Efforts are being made to address these issues, which could impact other U.S. trade negotiations and congressional debates. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a 12-nation FTA negotiation that includes various countries. The KORUS FTA has economic, diplomatic, and security implications, strengthening the U.S.-South Korean alliance. The provisions of the KORUS FTA are examined in this report. The report examines the provisions of the KORUS FTA and its implementation in the U.S.-South Korean economic relationship. South Korea granted duty-free status to most U.S. agricultural exports immediately, with tariffs and quotas on other goods phased out within 10 years. Some products will have duty-free access expanding slowly in perpetuity. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea agreed to eliminate its 40% tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the United States over a 15-year period. Negotiations on access for U.S. beef faced challenges due to concerns over mad cow disease, leading to a separate bilateral understanding and resumed shipments in July 2008. Negotiations between the United States and South Korea included contentious issues such as access for U.S. rice and oranges into the Korean market. Rice was a critical issue for Seoul and was excluded from the agreement at South Korea's insistence. Special treatment for U.S. oranges was agreed upon last minute, with a multi-part solution expected to increase exports over time. In December 2010, changes to the agreement included a two-year extension in tariff phase-out for U.S. frozen pork in exchange for changes sought by the United States in other provisions. In June 2011, South Korea clarified that certain generic names used by U.S. cheese exporters would not be restricted by provisions in the EU-Korea FTA. The United States and South Korea reached a joint understanding on automotive trade in December 2010, leading to modifications that ultimately gained support from all three U.S. automakers for the KORUS FTA. One of the key provisions included the elimination of the U.S. tariff on passenger cars, including electric and hybrid vehicles. The United States will eliminate its 2.5% tariff on passenger cars, including electric and hybrid vehicles, in 2016. South Korea will cut its passenger car tariff to 4% under the KORUS FTA and remove the remaining tariff in 2016. For trucks, South Korea dropped its 10% duty upon implementation, while the U.S. tariff of 25% will be phased out by 2021. The KORUS FTA includes a \"snapback provision\" for the U.S. to reinstate tariffs if violations occur. South Korean commitments on automobile regulations may not be enforceable under the dispute settlement. The KORUS FTA includes a special motor vehicle safeguard allowing the US to address harmful surges in South Korean auto imports. The safeguard can be initiated by various entities and the remedy for injury is a snapback to original tariff levels. This remedy can be used multiple times within 10 years after tariffs are eliminated, allowing the US to re-impose the 2.5% passenger vehicle tariff. South Korean assembly production in the US reached nearly 770,000 cars and light trucks in 2013. In 2013, South Korea imported almost 770,000 cars and light trucks, with an equal number of passenger vehicles and light trucks. U.S.-based automakers can export up to 25,000 cars to South Korea without meeting Korean safety standards if they comply with U.S. federal safety standards. U.S. automakers also have flexibility to comply with South Korean fuel economy and emissions standards. Trade data shows an increase in exports of U.S. autos to South Korea in recent years. Exports of U.S. autos to South Korea have increased in recent years, with sales of \"Detroit 3\" cars growing by 20% in 2013. Ford vehicles make up the majority of these exports. However, it is too early to draw conclusions about the impact of the KORUS FTA on the auto industry, as tariffs are still being phased out. U.S.-based automakers have raised concerns about non-tariff barriers hindering their exports to South Korea. The KORUS FTA aims to make 95% of U.S.-South Korean trade in consumer and industrial products duty-free by 2016, with all remaining tariffs lifted by 2021. The KORUS FTA between the United States and South Korea aimed to liberalize trade in services beyond WTO commitments. 60% of trade in textiles and apparel became duty-free immediately. The FTA included provisions for trade remedies, such as exempting imports from South Korea from certain measures if they do not cause serious harm to the U.S. domestic industry. Additionally, a binational consultative committee and a Medicines and Medical Devices Committee were established for information sharing and review purposes. The KORUS FTA established a Medicines and Medical Devices Committee to review South Korean pricing and government reimbursement for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. A binational committee was formed to study expanding the agreement's coverage to products from \"Outward Processing Zones\" in North Korea. The negotiations were conducted under the trade promotion authority granted by Congress in 2002. The KORUS FTA negotiations under TPA granted by Congress in 2002 led to modifications in the 2007 agreement, particularly regarding auto provisions and tariffs. The changes, finalized in February 2011, included adjustments to phase-out periods for tariffs on autos and pork, a new safeguard provision on autos, and concessions by South Korea to allow more U.S. cars into the country. The KORUS FTA negotiations led to modifications in the 2007 agreement, including adjustments to tariffs on autos and concessions by South Korea to allow more U.S. cars into the country. President Obama submitted draft legislation to Congress, which was passed and ratified by South Korea's National Assembly in 2011. The KORUS FTA agreement was ratified by South Korea's National Assembly in 2011, despite opposition from the Democratic Party. The issue of renegotiation arose during the 2012 elections but faded as the conservative party retained control. U.S. and South Korean policymakers had shared goals in completing the negotiations. The KORUS FTA was seen as an extension of the important economic relationship between the U.S. and South Korea, aiming to address fundamental issues and increase market access in various sectors. The negotiations reflected different perspectives but shared objectives, with the U.S. seeking greater access to South Korean markets in agriculture, autos, pharmaceuticals, and services, while also aiming to establish updated trade disciplines in the East-Asian region. South Korea initiated FTA negotiations with the United States to achieve broader economic and strategic goals, including raising GDP and becoming an economic hub in Northeast Asia. Former President Roh Moo-hyun made the FTA a top priority during his tenure, aligning with his long-term domestic objectives. Former President Lee Myung-bak continued economic reforms in Northeast Asia, focusing on boosting national competitiveness amidst competition from Japanese and Chinese firms. The KORUS FTA was supported to promote South Korean economic growth, emphasizing long-term gains from increased allocative efficiency in the services industries through U.S. investment and technology influx. The KORUS FTA was negotiated between the United States and South Korea to strengthen their alliance and address bilateral tensions, including issues with North Korea and U.S. troop repositioning in South Korea. Concerns were raised about the FTA potentially worsening South Korea's income gap, leading to anti-FTA protests by farmers and trade unionists. The tensions decreased in 2007 after the Bush Administration emphasized engagement with North Korea. The KORUS FTA was initially seen as a way to strengthen the alliance between the United States and South Korea, but with improved relations and a shift in focus towards engagement with North Korea, its significance as a bilateral cooperation tool diminished. Some argue that the FTA could still benefit the alliance in the long term by deepening economic and political ties, but its impact on strategic relationships in the region remains unclear. The passage discusses the potential symbolic impact of the KORUS FTA on the strategic relationship between the United States and South Korea. Rejection or delay of the FTA could have been perceived as a betrayal by South Korean policymakers, leading to doubts about the U.S. commitment to the region. South Korea is a major economic partner of the United States, with two-way goods trade totaling $101.3 billion in 2013. The U.S. exports semiconductors, machinery, aircraft, and agricultural products to South Korea, while importing autos and electrical machinery. The U.S. consistently runs a goods trade deficit with South Korea. In 2013, the U.S. had a goods trade deficit of $23 billion with South Korea and a services trade surplus of $10.1 billion. U.S. FDI into South Korea was $2.5 billion, while South Korean FDI into the U.S. was $6.6 billion. South Korea depends more on the U.S. economically. China became South Korea's top trading partner in 2003, displacing the U.S. Historically, there have been disagreements between the U.S. and South Korea over trade issues, with transparency in South Korea's trading and regulatory systems being a major concern for U.S. exporters and negotiators. The lack of transparency in South Korea's trading and regulatory systems is a significant barrier to trade, especially in politically-sensitive industries like automobiles and telecommunications. Other concerns include rigidities in the labor market and the need for South Korea to further open its agricultural market. Disputes have lessened in the past two decades due to reforms following the 1997 economic crisis. Following reforms post the 1997 economic crisis, South Korea has become more receptive to foreign investors, with many U.S. firms now having a significant presence in the country. Issues addressed during the KORUS FTA negotiations were resolved in the final agreement, with committees and working groups like the Automotive Working Group monitoring trade issues. Studies prior to the FTA's implementation estimated potential effects, with the USITC study projecting a boost of $10.1 billion to $11.9 billion in U.S. GDP. The USITC study projected that U.S. GDP would increase by $10.1 billion to $11.9 billion with the full implementation of the KORUS FTA. This estimate was based on the removal of tariffs and tariff rate quotas, leading to higher exports of goods, particularly in agricultural products, machinery, electronics, and transportation equipment. Imports would also rise, primarily in textiles, apparel, leather products, footwear, machinery, electronics, and passenger vehicles. The impact on services and foreign investment flows was not considered in the estimates. The KORUS FTA is projected to increase U.S. exports in services and bilateral trade with South Korea. While the impact on aggregate U.S. employment is expected to be negligible, certain sectors like livestock producers may see increases while others like textile and electronic equipment manufacturers may experience declines. Different studies have varying estimates on the potential increase in U.S. GDP, with one analysis suggesting a $25.12 billion boost. The KORUS FTA is projected to increase U.S. exports in services and bilateral trade with South Korea. Different studies have varying estimates on the potential increase in U.S. GDP, with one analysis suggesting a $25.12 billion boost. The authors also analyzed the impact of a KORUS FTA before the final text had been released, estimating a 0.14% increase in U.S. GDP. The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP) published a study estimating a 0.42% to 0.59% increase in South Korea's GDP according to a static analysis, and 1.99% to 2.27% according to a dynamic analysis. The KORUS FTA is estimated to increase the U.S. trade deficit by $13.5 billion and eliminate 159,000 jobs. The agreement gradually eliminates tariffs on goods, with 99% and 98% of tariff lines becoming duty free for the U.S. and South Korea respectively by the tenth year. Non-tariff barriers in goods trade, services trade, and foreign investment will also be reduced under the KORUS FTA. Assessing the impact of the KORUS FTA on U.S.-South Korea trade flows and the U.S. economy is complex due to various factors. The agreement has only been in effect for about two years, making it challenging to determine its long-term economic effects. Tariffs on sensitive products will be phased out over several years, and production and consumption patterns require time to adjust. The benefits of trade agreements like KORUS FTA are long-term, impacting individual firms and industries more than overall trade flows. The agreement's effects may not be fully captured by aggregate data, and benefits such as lower prices and improved productivity are hard to measure. U.S. goods exports to South Korea decreased by 5% from 2011 to 2013, while imports increased. The U.S. goods trade balance with South Korea decreased from $-14.7 billion to -$23.0 billion (56% decrease) due to a 5% decrease in exports and an 11% increase in imports. Meanwhile, the U.S. services trade balance with South Korea increased from $6.9 billion to $10.1 billion (46% increase) with a 25% increase in exports and a 10% increase in imports. The rising trade deficit has raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, but some of the export decrease may be attributed to fluctuations in the business cycle in South Korea. In 2011 and 2012, South Korea's GDP growth slowed, leading to a decrease in imports from the United States and the world. From 2011 to 2013, South Korea's goods imports fell overall, with significant drops from China, Japan, and the United States. Categories with large fluctuations in import and export commodity between 2011 and 2013 suggest factors beyond tariff changes from the KORUS FTA. U.S.-South Korea trade flows were influenced by factors beyond tariff changes from the KORUS FTA. U.S. imports of South Korean vehicles increased significantly, while U.S. exports of cereals, primarily corn, declined due to the 2012 drought. U.S. exports of pharmaceuticals to South Korea saw a substantial increase. The KORUS FTA has led to a $374 million increase in U.S. imports from South Korea, with a reduction in import tariffs. Various issues regarding implementation are being addressed through working groups and committees. These issues may impact future FTAs like the TPP and T-TIP. U.S. officials and companies have raised concerns about origin verification procedures. The U.S. government is addressing concerns about South Korean Customs Service procedures affecting the preferential treatment under the KORUS FTA. Issues include excessive documentation requirements for imports of U.S. products, with recent positive rulings indicating some improvements. Additionally, there are concerns about South Korea not complying with FTA requirements for express delivery packages under $200 in value. The KORUS FTA exempts express deliveries under $200 from formal entry requirements, causing delays. South Korea allows off-shore data processing for financial services, but U.S. companies are concerned about regulatory discretion. Quarterly reviews of data transfer commitments are agreed upon. Proposed auto regulations aim to promote lower emission cars, worrying U.S. automakers about potential tax penalties. The South Korean government is reviewing a proposed regulation scheme that could impose tax penalties on consumers buying high-emission cars, potentially negating tariff benefits under the KORUS FTA. U.S. industry is concerned about a new pricing regime for pharmaceuticals undervaluing new drugs and a biased patent linkage system favoring generic manufacturers. Additionally, U.S. automakers claim South Korea's intervention in currency markets is hindering exports. The KORUS FTA is economically significant as South Korea is the sixth largest U.S. trade partner, making it the largest U.S. FTA after NAFTA. The agreement reflects current U.S. trade and investment policy priorities and serves as a starting point for current U.S. trade negotiations. It also highlights the use of bilateral trade agreements by both the U.S. and South Korea. The KORUS FTA is significant for the U.S. as South Korea is a major trade partner. It reflects current trade priorities and aims to shape economic rules in the Asia-Pacific region. President Obama and other officials see it as part of a strategy to rebalance U.S. orientation towards Asia. South Korea's decision to negotiate and implement a comprehensive FTA with the United States may influence other region-wide trade policies. As a participant in the RCEP negotiations, South Korea will help determine the structure and disciplines of that potential regional FTA, which includes ASEAN members, Australia, China, India, Japan, and New Zealand. The KORUS FTA may have sparked interest in other Asia-Pacific countries to negotiate FTAs with the United States, such as Japan's entry into the TPP negotiations in July 2013. South Korea's interest in joining the TPP negotiations was possibly influenced by Japan's entry in 2013. Despite existing trade agreements, South Korea announced its interest in participating, with the U.S. Administration welcoming it. President Obama emphasized the importance of full implementation of the KORUS FTA to meet the high standards of the TPP. The Administration aims to conclude an initial TPP agreement with current members before allowing new negotiating partners to join. Under the KORUS FTA, market access provisions include immediate elimination of most tariffs, with the remaining tariffs to be removed within ten years. Bilateral, regional, and plurilateral initiatives will continue to be important in international trade liberalization efforts. The agreement addresses sensitive products like agricultural goods and autos. The KORUS FTA includes provisions for market access, focusing on sensitive products such as agricultural goods and autos. U.S. negotiators aimed to gain access for agricultural products in South Korea's market and address restrictions on U.S. beef purchases. South Korea's agricultural sector is heavily protected with high tariffs and quotas due to the influence of farmers and urban population ties to rural roots. In 2013, South Korea was the fifth-largest market for U.S. agriculture, with export sales totaling $5.1 billion. The KORUS FTA granted duty-free status to two-thirds of current U.S. agricultural exports, with tariffs on other goods phased out by 2021. Some products will be subject to import quotas that slowly expand indefinitely, but U.S. rice and rice products did not gain additional access to the South Korean market. The KORUS FTA is expected to benefit certain U.S. agricultural and food processing sectors by increasing exports to South Korea's market. The USITC estimated that U.S. exports of agricultural commodities and processed foods could increase by $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion once the FTA's provisions are fully implemented. The U.S. beef sector is projected to receive almost half of this export increase. The KORUS FTA is projected to boost U.S. agricultural exports to South Korea, with a potential increase of $1.5 billion by the end of the transition period. The agreement includes phasing out tariffs and quotas on agricultural imports from South Korea over seven phase-out periods, with a 10-year TRQ for specified dairy products. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea agreed to eliminate its 40% tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the United States over a 15-year period. South Korea can impose safeguard tariffs temporarily in response to potential surges in U.S. beef imports. The trigger for this tariff was 270,000 metric tons in year 1, increasing 2% annually, reaching 354,000 MT in year 15. This protective mechanism expires in year 16. In year 16 (2027), the protective mechanism for beef imports in South Korea will no longer apply. Tariffs on beef offals and other beef products will be eliminated over 15 years. The USITC estimates that this could increase U.S. beef exports significantly. The AFBF projects higher U.S. beef sales under the KORUS FTA, but market share may not increase due to South Korean preference for Australian beef. Australia has developed a preference for grass-fed beef and secured a tariff phase-out in South Korea. The differential in tariffs between Australian and U.S. beef may not matter if Korean consumers continue to prefer Australian beef or if exchange rates favor Australian imports. Korea was a significant market for U.S. beef before a ban due to mad cow disease. On April 18, 2008, U.S. and South Korean negotiators agreed to allow imports of all cuts of U.S. beef into South Korea, with certain conditions to prevent the transmission of mad cow disease. However, on June 21, 2008, both sides revised the agreement to limit sales of U.S. beef from cattle less than 30 months old. South Korea quickly implemented these rules and began inspecting U.S. beef shipments. The U.S. Department of Agriculture implemented a program to verify beef from cattle under 30 months old. U.S. beef exporters aimed to regain an overseas market. Korean protests and rumors about U.S. beef safety led to calls for renegotiation. South Korea sought talks with the U.S. to address public concerns without renegotiating the beef agreement. In June 2008, a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement allowed South Korean firms to import U.S. beef. In June 2008, a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement was established for South Korean firms to import U.S. beef from cattle under 30 months old. The Obama Administration aimed to resolve beef and auto issues with South Korea by November 2010. The negotiations in December 2010 focused on revising auto provisions, with little discussion on the beef issue. President Obama expressed the goal of ensuring full access for U.S. beef in the Korean market. Congressional reaction to the outcome of the beef issue was mixed. Senator Baucus expressed disappointment with the outcome of the beef issue in South Korea, stating his commitment to address barriers to American beef exports. He refused to support the KORUS FTA until the beef market was opened. Other Senators viewed the deal positively and welcomed the prospect of considering the FTA in 2011. Meat industry groups supported the trade agreement, expecting increased exports to South Korea and urging Congress to ratify it quickly. The 2008 anti-beef agreement protests in South Korea influenced Korean negotiators' stance on the beef issue, leading to no further discussions on ending age limits for U.S. cattle slaughtered for beef. South Korea's trade minister confirmed this decision, supported by the ambassador to Washington in January 2011. The outcome was seen as successful. The USTR announced measures on U.S. beef access in May 2011 to move closer to submitting the KORUS FTA to Congress. They committed to requesting consultations with South Korea on opening Korea's market to all ages and cuts of U.S. beef once the trade agreement takes effect. The U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded $1 million to the U.S. Meat Export Federation to promote U.S. beef sales in South Korea. Senator Baucus supported the KORUS FTA and trade measures, including trade adjustment assistance. U.S. beef exports to South Korea reached $578 million in 2013, 71% of the 2003 level. In 2013, U.S. beef exports to South Korea reached $578 million, representing 71% of the 2003 level. U.S. beef exporters gained market share since the market reopened, with promotional efforts and lower prices contributing to the growth. South Korea excluded U.S. rice entry on preferential terms to maintain self-sufficiency in rice production. The KORUS FTA only requires South Korea to continue abiding by its multilateral trade commitments to increase rice imports. U.S. rice exporters have access to the South Korean market under specific quotas with a 5% tariff for entries above the quotas being prohibited. South Korea received a unique concession in the 1993 Uruguay Round of trade negotiations allowing for specific rice import quotas with a 5% tariff. The country has decided to eliminate the cap on rice imports starting in 2015, but rice above the current quota will face tariffs of 300 to 500%. This may limit U.S. rice exports due to prohibitive duties and Korean preference for Japonica rice. The FTA negotiations between the United States and South Korea involved discussions on liberalizing trade in fresh oranges, with the U.S. pushing for the elimination of South Korea's border protection on citrus products. A compromise was reached to create a duty-free quota for U.S. navel oranges during the Island's orange harvest season, increasing annually. In 2013, South Korea remained the top market for U.S. orange exports, totaling $96 million. The high tariffs on oranges are being phased out gradually, with the 50% tariff on excess shipments reduced to 3% annually in perpetuity. South Korea will phase out its 25% tariff on frozen pork cuts on January 1, 2016, affecting 75% of U.S. pork exports. The tariff on fresh/chilled pork will be phased out by 2021. The KORUS FTA is seen as a good deal by the National Pork Producers Council, expecting increased exports and hog prices. The U.S. pork industry is expected to benefit from a substantial increase in exports to South Korea, with higher sales levels in 2013 compared to the late 2000s. Concerns were raised by the U.S. dairy sector regarding geographical indications provisions in the KOREU FTA that could impact U.S. cheeses in the Korean market. Geographical indications (GIs) are marks that identify a product's origin, providing protection from infringement under trademark laws. The EU seeks additional protection for its GI-designated agricultural and beverage products in FTA-partner country markets. More than 50 House Members urge USTR to ensure South Korea's regulations do not undermine dairy market gains in the KORUS FTA. They are concerned about European efforts to claim exclusive rights to cheese names like feta and gorgonzola. The U.S. aims to protect generic cheese names like cheddar and mozzarella from EU legal precedents in South Korea. U.S. exporters can continue to sell cheeses like camembert, mozzarella, and parmesan in the South Korean market. U.S. dairy groups welcome the assurance, as Korea is a significant market for U.S. cheese exports. The KORUS FTA established a bilateral standing committee to address food safety and animal/plant health issues in agricultural trade. However, certain U.S. cheese exporters have been shut out of the Korean market due to protected cheeses under the Korea-EU FTA GI annex. The agreement lacks commodity-specific SPS provisions to address issues like Korea's import health requirements on U.S. beef and standards preventing sales of some U.S. horticultural products. The Committee on SPS Matters will implement the WTO's Agreement on the Application of SPS. The Committee on SPS Matters will implement the WTO's Agreement on the Application of SPS Measures, resolve bilateral disputes, coordinate technical assistance programs, and consult on SPS issues in international bodies. The 2008 bilateral agreement between the United States and South Korea resolved disputes regarding U.S. beef imports based on OIE guidelines. The final KORUS FTA modified trade commitments on automobiles in December 2010 and February 2011. The Obama Administration believed it was necessary to provide new market access for U.S. auto companies. Key components included the elimination of South Korean tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles. The KORUS FTA modified trade commitments on automobiles in 2010 and 2011, eliminating South Korean tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles, including passenger cars, electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrids. Tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles will be phased out by 2016, with both countries dropping duties on auto parts in 2012. U.S. tariffs on South Korean-made automobiles will be reduced gradually, with a 2.5% rate for passenger vehicles until 2016. The KORUS FTA modified trade commitments on automobiles in 2010 and 2011, eliminating South Korean tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles. The final agreement establishes a special bilateral dispute settlement panel for automotive issues. U.S. automakers have raised concerns about South Korea's vehicle tax schedule. South Korea's vehicle tax schedule, part of the KORUS FTA, imposes high rates on larger engine capacity vehicles, making U.S. imported cars more expensive. The tax system includes various taxes like special consumption tax, educational tax, and value-added tax. The government agreed to simplify and reduce taxes on passenger vehicles and eliminate rate discrepancies between imported and domestic vehicles. U.S. automakers are concerned about a potential Korean regulation affecting car buyers. The Korean government is considering a new regulation that would provide a subsidy or surcharge to new car buyers based on the car's emission profile, which some argue is a prohibited engine displacement tax under KORUS. South Korea has committed to improving regulatory transparency and process for new automotive regulations, giving U.S. auto companies one year to comply with new regulations. The U.S. auto industry has concerns about the potential impact of this regulation on car buyers. The U.S. auto industry has concerns about proposed Korean automotive regulations that could increase costs and hinder car sales in Korea. The KORUS FTA allows for self-certification to U.S. federal safety standards for a limited number of exported vehicles, with flexibility in meeting new South Korean environmental standards. Compliance with new South Korean fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions standards requires meeting a target level that is 19% higher. The KORUS FTA allows for self-certification to U.S. federal safety standards for a limited number of exported vehicles, with flexibility in meeting new South Korean environmental standards. U.S. carmakers that sold fewer than 4,500 cars in South Korea in 2009 can comply with fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions standards if they meet a target level 19% more lenient than the regulation. An Automotive Working Group (AWG) was established to address regulatory issues related to automotive safety, fuel economy, and greenhouse gas regulations. The KORUS FTA includes a special safeguard for motor vehicles to protect the U.S. auto industry from harmful surges in South Korea auto imports. The safeguard allows the U.S. to impose extra duties in case of an import surge, with higher tariffs applicable for up to four years. Truck tariffs could have the safeguard in place until 2031, and it can be applied multiple times for a specific auto product in case of recurring surges causing harm to U.S. production. The KORUS FTA includes a safeguard for motor vehicles to protect the U.S. auto industry from surges in South Korean auto imports. The safeguard allows for extra duties in case of an import surge, with higher tariffs applicable for up to four years. GM Korea has been manufacturing over 100,000 cars in South Korea annually since 2005. The USITC simulation model estimates that U.S. automotive exports to South Korea will increase by 45% to 59%, amounting to $300 million-$400 million due to tariff elimination. The potential positive effects of tariff elimination on U.S. exports to South Korea, particularly for hybrid vehicles. Currently, most hybrids in the U.S. market are imported from Japan, with the Toyota Prius accounting for a significant portion of sales. Hyundai's Sonata hybrid, the first South Korean hybrid sold in the U.S., has also seen success. U.S. manufacturers have increased their hybrid electric vehicle sales in recent years. Hyundai and Kia have seen a significant increase in hybrid electric vehicle sales, rising from 0 in 2003 to nearly 100,000 in 2013. They are also considering developing pickup trucks for the U.S. market. Textiles and apparel imports from South Korea to the U.S. have decreased over the years, with South Korea providing 3% of textiles and less than 1% of apparel imports in 2013. In 2013, U.S. apparel imports from South Korea decreased to 1%, down from 10% in 1990. China accounted for 40% of U.S. apparel imports in 2013, up from 14% in 1990. The KORUS FTA eliminated U.S. tariffs on 52% of South Korean textiles and apparel immediately, with further reductions planned by 2021. U.S. MFN tariffs on textiles average 7.9% and 11.6% on apparel imports. The KORUS FTA phased out tariffs on textiles and apparel from South Korea, with a maximum tariff of 13%. The agreement uses the yarn-forward rule of origin for apparel imports, allowing duty-free treatment for apparel made from yarn or fabric originating in the US or South Korea. A special safeguard provision allows for tariff suspension or increase if imports cause harm to the domestic industry. The safeguard action under the KORUS FTA can be in place for up to four years, with compensation required from the importing country. The USITC estimates an increase in U.S. imports of South Korean textiles and apparel, with a portion diverted from other countries. Additionally, there is an expected increase in U.S. exports of textiles and apparel. The KORUS FTA allows for exports of textiles and apparel to South Korea, with certain conditions for preferential treatment. A Committee on Textile and Apparel Trade Matters was established to address concerns under the FTA. The agreement also impacts other industries, with U.S. machinery exports expected to benefit the most. The KORUS FTA benefits various industries, with U.S. machinery exports expected to gain significantly. Tariffs on machinery and equipment imported into South Korea are being phased out, with the sector poised to increase exports by nearly $3 billion. Aircraft products and parts also hold a strong bilateral trade position, with exports totaling $3.5 billion in 2013. South Korea aims to boost domestic aerospace production to $20 billion by 2020 and become the world's seventh-largest aerospace producer. They plan to supply components to Boeing and EADS-Airbus, provide maintenance for commercial and military aircraft, and eliminate tariffs on electronics exports through the KORUS FTA. In 2013, the United States had a trade deficit of $8.8 billion in computer and electronic products with South Korea, which decreased from $6.5 billion in 2012. The trade deficit in semiconductors and electronic components dropped to $1.2 billion in 2013 from a high of $3 billion in 2010. The KORUS FTA improved intellectual property protection, technical barriers, government procurement, and competition policy for U.S. products in South Korea. Steel products are significant in U.S.-South Korea trade, with South Korea being a major exporter and importer of steel products. The United States had a trade deficit of $1.9 billion in steel products with South Korea in 2013. The American steel industry had concerns about the KORUS FTA, including trade remedies, rules of origin provisions, and currency manipulation issues. U.S. pharmaceuticals and medical devices compete well in the South Korean market, with increasing export opportunities as the South Korean economy matures. The South Korean pharmaceutical market is one of the largest in Asia, with sales expected to reach $24.3 billion by 2020. U.S. pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers have increasing export opportunities in South Korea, which is a fast-growing market. The South Korean pharmaceutical market is estimated at $4.9 billion in 2013 and could grow 10%-15% annually due to an aging population. U.S. manufacturers face challenges with government regulations limiting market access despite KORUS implementation. U.S. exports of pharmaceuticals and medicines to South Korea were $1.2 billion in 2013, while exports of medical equipment totaled $497 million. Trade surpluses were recorded in both pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. During the KORUS FTA negotiations, the South Korean government changed its reimbursement system from a \"negative list\" to a \"positive list,\" making it harder for products to become eligible without prior notification to U.S. officials. Despite complaints from the United States, South Korea implemented the new system, causing concerns for U.S. manufacturers. U.S. manufacturers raised concerns about South Korea's reimbursement policies under its single-payer health insurance program during the KORUS FTA negotiations. They argued that the policies discriminate against innovative pharmaceuticals by establishing low reimbursement amounts, and pushed for transparency and an appeal process in pricing decisions. The KORUS FTA provisions allowed U.S. pharmaceutical makers to apply for increased reimbursement levels based on safety and efficacy. South Korea agreed to publish proposed laws, regulations, and procedures related to pharmaceuticals and medical devices, allowing time for comments. They also agreed to establish a process for U.S. manufacturers to comment on proposed changes and obtain a review of administrative determinations. Intellectual property rights protection has been a critical issue, with concerns about the failure to protect proprietary data and approving marketing of pharmaceuticals before verifying patent ownership. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea will not allow a third company to market a new pharmaceutical using safety and efficacy data from the original U.S. manufacturer without permission for five years. The agreement also requires notification to the original patent holder if a third party submits similar information for an approved product. The U.S. and South Korea agreed not to enforce data exclusivity provision for 18 months. Under the KORUS FTA, the United States and South Korea agreed to extend the time for South Korea to implement a patent linkage system for pharmaceuticals to 36 months. They also agreed on a patent-term extension to adjust the effective period for patents on pharmaceuticals. Additionally, both countries can take measures to protect public health from epidemics like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The KORUS FTA aims to protect public health in South Korea and the US from epidemics like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria by ensuring access to medicines. US service providers exported $20.9 billion in services to South Korea in 2013, including charges for intellectual property, travel, transportation, and financial services. This amount may underestimate the total volume of US sales to South Korea due to various modes of service delivery. In 2013, the United States imported $10.8 billion in private services from South Korea, including transportation services like freight and travel. The KORUS FTA aimed to reduce barriers in the services sector, with commitments to national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment for services imports. Under the KORUS FTA, the US and South Korea agreed to promote transparency in regulations for services, prohibit limits on market access, foreign direct investment requirements, and restrictions on business entities. The agreement follows a \"negative list\" approach, applying to all services unless specified as exceptions. Under the KORUS FTA, the US and South Korea agreed to promote transparency in regulations for services, prohibit limits on market access, foreign direct investment requirements, and restrictions on business entities. The commitments are ratcheted, automatically covering new services unless identified as exceptions. The agreement also includes reciprocity in the treatment of professional services, with a working group formed to develop mutual standards and criteria for licensing. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea allows U.S. law firms and attorneys to provide advisory services on U.S. and international law. U.S. legal representative offices can cooperate with South Korean firms for legal matters. South Korea will eventually allow joint ventures between U.S. and South Korean law firms. Restrictions on foreign lawyers will still apply. In financial services, if a new service is developed in one country, providers from the partner country can offer a similar service. The KORUS FTA allows restrictions on the sale of financial services for prudential reasons, such as protecting investors and ensuring the soundness of financial institutions. U.S. insurers are expected to gain significantly in the liberalized South Korean insurance market. Concerns exist about the regulation of state-owned and cooperative insurance providers in South Korea. Under KORUS, South Korea agreed to regulate both private-sector foreign and domestic financial service providers under an independent state regulator. Korea Post will be prohibited from offering new insurance products. U.S. companies can now own up to 100% of voting shares in South Korean telecommunications companies. Under KORUS, South Korea allows 100% ownership of telecommunications companies by U.S. firms. The agreement also ensures access to public telecommunications networks for interconnection under fair conditions. South Korea has sought visa ease for business representatives, which was discussed separately from the KORUS FTA negotiations. President Bush announced on October 17, 2008, that South Korea would be admitted into the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), resolving potential issues in bilateral relations. South Korea is a significant source of foreign visitors to the United States, with 1.5 million short-term visitors in FY2012. Additionally, the validity period of L-1A visas for South Korean nationals was extended as part of a package of modifications agreed to on December 3, 2010. These visas are used for foreigners working at U.S. subsidiaries, with the initial validity period extended from one to five years for establishing a new subsidiary and from three to undisclosed years for working at an existing subsidiary. The KORUS FTA text includes provisions for trade remedies like antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard actions to protect domestic industries from lower priced imports. These provisions have become standard in US FTAs. Trade remedies are seen as important tools by Congress to mitigate the impact of imports on US industries and workers. Trade remedies such as antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard actions are included in the KORUS FTA to protect domestic industries from subsidized or unfairly traded imports. Safeguard actions allow industries to adjust to new competition, while antidumping and countervailing duty actions impose additional duties on dumped or subsidized imports. These actions are authorized by the WTO and must comply with international trade agreements. Many Members of Congress support the use of trade remedies to protect US industries and workers. The preservation of U.S. authority to enforce trade laws was a key negotiating objective in the KORUS FTA. South Korea demanded changes to U.S. antidumping rules due to the high number of trade remedy cases brought by U.S. industries on South Korean goods. Antidumping duties were imposed on 12 South Korean imports, while countervailing duties were assessed on 3 products. The U.S. global safeguard cases significantly reduced South Korean steel imports. South Korea has brought 16 WTO dispute resolution cases, with 10 against U.S. trade remedy actions. South Korea is part of the \"Friends of Antidumping\" group in the WTO Doha Round. The KORUS FTA allows trading partners to include each other in global safeguard actions. The KORUS FTA allows for exemptions from global safeguard measures and the implementation of AD and CVD actions against each other. The agreement also permits transitional safeguard measures if increased imports cause serious injury to domestic industries. Compensation must be provided in case of a safeguard, or concessions may be suspended. No changes to U.S. AD were required by the agreement. The KORUS FTA includes additional steps before initiating a trade remedy investigation involving goods from the other party, such as notifying each other of antidumping petitions and providing opportunities for consultations. The agreement does not require changes to U.S. AD or CVD laws. The KORUS FTA established a Committee on Trade Remedies to enhance knowledge of trade remedy laws, oversee implementation of the trade remedies chapter, improve cooperation, develop educational programs, and provide a forum for exchange of information. The Industry Trade Advisory Committee on Steel is concerned that procedural concessions on trade remedies could politicize actions and weaken U.S. trade laws. The ITAC 12 opposed the establishment of a Committee on Trade Remedies in the KORUS FTA, fearing it could politicize and weaken U.S. trade laws by delaying the investigative process and introducing foreign government actions. APEC Wendy Cutler, the chief U.S. negotiator, mentioned that the consultative committee will focus on information sharing and not specific cases. The committee could benefit the U.S. by addressing industrial subsidies from South Korea. South Korea aimed to secure preferential treatment for products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, a position opposed by the U.S. Located near Kaesong, the complex allows South Korean companies to employ North Korean workers. South Korean companies employ over 47,000 North Korean workers in Kaesong to manufacture various products. The facility generated $323 million in output in 2010 and houses firms producing clothing, kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) has been controversial as it provides revenue to the Kim Jong-il regime in Pyongyang. However, it also potentially contributes to stability on the Peninsula and could serve as a platform for market reforms in North Korea. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea serves as a possible beachhead for market reforms and exposure to outside influences. The KORUS FTA agreement does not include KIC products for special treatment but forms a committee to study incorporating products from \"Outward Processing Zones\" in North Korea. The committee will focus on denuclearization progress, intra-Korean relations, wages, business practices, environment, and labor standards. The committee established under the KORUS FTA agreement will consider incorporating products from Outward Processing Zones in North Korea based on criteria developed, with a three-step process for inclusion. The decision-making process is not specified, but decisions require unified consent. In March 2011, the USTR stated that legislative approval would be needed to extend KORUS FTA tariff benefits to products from Kaesong or any OPZ in North Korea. Concerns were raised about potential increased U.S. imports of goods made in North Korea through South Korean firms exploiting the agreement. The KORUS FTA may not significantly impact US imports of North Korean goods unless the KIC is included in the agreement. Imports from North Korea require US government approval, including finished goods and those with North Korean components. Critics argue that the FTA could limit the US's ability to restrict North Korean imports by using dispute settlement procedures. The KORUS-FTA allows the US or South Korea to impose trade restrictions on goods from a third country like North Korea. The US shifted its stance during negotiations to include North Korea-made products, benefiting South Korea without giving up much control. The US-South Korea bilateral economic relationship has seen a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) over the past decade. In 1997, the value of US FDI in South Korea was $6.5 billion, which grew to $32.8 billion by the end of 2012. Similarly, South Korean FDI in the US increased from $0.6 billion in 1997 to $32.5 billion. This growth is attributed to market-oriented reforms in South Korea after the 1997 financial crisis. The value of South Korean FDI in the United States increased from $0.6 billion in 1997 to $32.5 billion by the end of 2013. Foreign investment has been a sensitive issue in U.S.-South Korean relations, with criticisms from U.S. investors about restrictions in key sectors and intellectual property protection. Efforts to establish bilateral rules, like a BIT, have failed in the past due to disagreements over issues like South Korea's screen quota on domestic films. The KORUS FTA chapter on investment addresses U.S. opposition to South Korea's screen quota on domestic films. It sets principles for non-discriminatory national treatment of investors and investments from both countries. Exceptions to this principle must be specified in relevant annexes to the agreement. The KORUS FTA chapter on investment establishes principles such as most-favored-nation treatment, minimum standard of treatment, limits on government expropriation, and free transfer of financial capital. The KORUS FTA prohibits performance requirements on investments between the U.S. and South Korea, except for measures aimed at social objectives. It also establishes procedures for settling investor-state disputes. The KORUS FTA prohibits performance requirements on investments between the U.S. and South Korea, except for measures aimed at social objectives. It establishes procedures for settling investor-state disputes, where investors can allege violations of their rights under the FTA and seek resolution through consultations, negotiations, arbitration, and tribunals. The USITC concluded that U.S. investors, especially in financial services, would likely benefit from the agreement, with the United States being the predominant partner in foreign investment. South Korea's investments in the U.S. are increasing, indicating potential benefits for both countries. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights protection in U.S.-South Korean trade, going beyond WTO agreements. It requires national treatment for IPR holders, transparency in regulations, trademark protection, and limitations on geographical indications. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights protection in U.S.-South Korean trade, requiring copyright protection for at least 70 years and extending South Korea's copyright term. It also aims to protect copyrighted material against piracy, including penalties for piracy abetment and the seizure of counterfeit products. Additionally, it seeks to protect copyrighted performances on the Internet and encrypted programming over satellites and cable signals. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights protection, requiring copyright protection for at least 70 years and aiming to protect copyrighted material against piracy. The agreement also establishes a Labor Affairs Council to enforce labor standards and ensure access to tribunals for those affected by labor laws. Former-USTR Ron Kirk supported the incorporation of labor rights in the FTA, and disputes regarding labor matters are to be resolved under the agreement. The KORUS FTA includes provisions for resolving labor disputes through consultations, the Labor Council, and dispute settlement panels. It also establishes a Labor Cooperation Mechanism to work on labor rights issues. South Korea's labor rights regime is considered strong, ranking in the top third of the OECD for employment protection. U.S. multinationals have raised concerns about restrictions in the South Korean labor market increasing business costs, while U.S. union representatives argue for labor rights. South Korean labor unions are known for their activism, with frequent strikes and sometimes violent protests. The government has been criticized for imprisoning unionists and using riot police against union activities. This has raised concerns about the cost of doing business in Korea and the rights of South Korean workers. South Korean labor unions are divided into two segments: (1) \"salarymen\" in large corporations, mostly men with powerful unions, and (2) employees in small-scale firms, temporary, and day laborers with few unions. Temporary workers make up nearly one-third of the workforce, receiving low wages and limited social safety net coverage. Labor markets are rigid, with governments purchasing goods and services. The Buy American Act requires goods and services in the United States to be of domestic origin, while the WTO Government Procurement Agreement allows for some government procurement business to be open to foreign companies. The GPA, signed by 41 WTO members including the US and South Korea, establishes rules for transparent and nondiscriminatory government procurement practices. The KORUS FTA builds on the GPA for government procurement criteria. The GPA and KORUS FTA expand government procurement criteria, with the GPA applying to contracts valued at $203,000 and above, and the KORUS FTA applying to contracts valued at $100,000 and above. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea added nine more agencies to be covered, and both countries commit to enforcing multilateral environmental agreements. Under the KORUS FTA, the United States and South Korea commit to transparency by publishing regulations, allowing comments on proposed regulations, and enforcing environmental standards to prevent trade advantage. U.S. exporters faced barriers due to South Korea's lack of transparency in trading and regulatory systems. The KORUS FTA requires transparency in decision-making and regulations, allowing comments and questions from both parties. It establishes a joint committee to oversee implementation and a panel to resolve disputes if consultations fail. The KORUS FTA includes provisions for dispute settlement, market access facilitation, and commitment to uphold WTO obligations on technical barriers to trade. The KORUS FTA promotes transparency and cooperation between South Korea and the United States in standards development and customs administration. It also includes rules of origin for preferential treatment of goods. The KORUS FTA requires goods to be wholly obtained or produced in both countries, with regional value thresholds. It also enforces competition laws to prevent market dominance and ensures transparency in administrative actions. Cooperation in enforcing competition laws and operating monopolies in accordance with the agreement is also mandated. The KORUS FTA promotes trade through e-commerce, prohibits discrimination against digital products, and requires recognition of electronic authentication. South Korea started its automobile industry in 1962 and was not listed among the top global producers in 1980 but had companies in the top 50 by 2013. South Korea ranked as the global number five national producer of cars and commercial vehicles in 2013, with exports accounting for about 70% of production volume. The country aggressively developed its automotive manufacturing base, prohibiting motor vehicle imports until 1987 and from Japan until 1999. Domestic sales of motor vehicles in South Korea have been around 1.4 million in recent years. In the aftermath of South Korea's economic crisis in 1997-1998, the government's strategy to promote domestically owned car producers failed. Hyundai emerged as the only major South Korean-owned company, acquiring Kia and becoming the fourth largest global producer. Daewoo is now controlled by General Motors. Hyundai-Kia produced 6.8 million cars in 2012 and is a strong global competitor with operations in various countries. The South Korean motor vehicle industry is export-oriented, known for quality cars, and has relatively low U.S. presence. The South Korean motor vehicle industry, known for quality cars, has found a good market in the United States due to low tariffs. South Korean automakers export more cars to the U.S. than vice versa. Total exports peaked in 2004 but dropped until 2009, then increased to over 750,000 vehicles in 2013. U.S.-based exporters sent over 27,550 cars to South Korea in 2013. In 2013, South Korea exported over 27,550 passenger cars and light trucks to the United States, with Hyundai and Kia having production facilities in Alabama and Georgia. Hyundai and Kia sold 1.26 million vehicles in the U.S., with about 60% produced locally. GM Korea, the South Korean arm of GM, also builds vehicles in the country. In 2013, GM Korea sold 145,300 domestically built cars in South Korea, not covered by the KORUS FTA. South Korean automotive exports to the US totaled $19.7 billion, with a trade deficit of $18.2 billion in autos. Analysts predict Korea would gain from bilateral liberalization due to its advantage in the automobile sector. Hyundai and Kia have been more successful in accessing the U.S. market compared to the U.S. accessing the Korean market. Despite growth in sales, South Korean automakers' share of the U.S. market dropped in 2013. South Korean policies restricting imports of foreign-made vehicles have been a target of U.S. trade policy. In 1995 and 1998, the USTR negotiated MOUs with South Korea to address discriminatory policies against imports of U.S.-made vehicles. The focus was on motor vehicle taxation policies and standards. Since then, imports in South Korea have increased, with European manufacturers accounting for over three-quarters of imported cars. European manufacturers dominated the South Korean car market in 2013, with Japanese brands following. U.S. automakers held a smaller share, with Ford, Chrysler, and GM combined making up 7.4% of new imported car sales in South Korea."
