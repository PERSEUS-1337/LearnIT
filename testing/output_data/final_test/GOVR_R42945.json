    "content": "Increasing numbers of animal and plant species face possible extinction due to habitat loss caused by development, climate change, land management practices, invasive species, and other factors. The 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) is controversial as it can affect the use of federal and nonfederal lands and resources. The act requires species to be listed as threatened or endangered based on scientific information, without considering economic factors. Congress must balance conservation efforts with economic interests. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) faces challenges in balancing economic interests with species protection. Reauthorization efforts have been unsuccessful since 1992, with limited bills enacted in subsequent Congresses. The 113th Congress has not introduced measures to reauthorize the act, but some bills aim to limit its scope or prevent species listings. The 1973 ESA aims to protect species at risk of extinction and their habitats. It allows for species to be listed as endangered or threatened, with more flexible management for threatened species. Distinct population segments of vertebrate species can also be listed. Some populations of salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California have been listed under ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects species at risk of extinction and their habitats. Salmon populations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California are listed under ESA, while healthy populations in Alaska are not listed. Legal tools are available for species recovery and habitat protection, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). As of December 26, 2013, a total of 1,268 animal species and 877 plant species were listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, with the majority occurring in the United States and its territories. Out of the 1,519 U.S. species, 1,144 are covered in active recovery plans. In FY2011, expenditures on endangered and threatened species totaled about $1.39 billion, with federal agencies reporting $1.34 billion and states reporting $57.8 million. The top 10 species with the highest expenditures in FY2012 included steelhead and Pacific salmon subpopulations. In FY2011, expenditures on endangered and threatened species totaled about $1.39 billion, with federal agencies reporting $1.34 billion and states reporting $57.8 million. Costs included various species such as steelhead, Pacific salmon, pallid sturgeon, bull trout, and red-cockaded woodpecker. Conservation efforts are shifting towards focusing on ecosystems rather than individual species, leading to controversies especially in resource-based economies. Controversies surrounding ESA-listed species include conflicts over water supply in California, Tennessee's Tellico Dam, Pacific Northwest timber harvest, and management of the Apalachicola Basin. These debates involve balancing economic interests with environmental protection. Foreign species actions are also considered by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior considers actions by foreign governments on species for listing, based on scientific data and efforts by foreign entities. FWS reviews foreign species under ESA criteria with a regulatory process. International treaties like CITES address foreign species conservation. The Western Hemisphere Convention, signed by the United States in 1940, focuses on wildlife preservation and trade-related extinction. CITES, which divides species into three categories, regulates international trade through permits. Violations of CITES are also violations of U.S. law under ESA if committed within U.S. jurisdiction. ESA controls import and export of wildlife products from listed species, with specified exceptions. Illegal trade in endangered wildlife products is a concern according to U.S. government estimates. Illegal wildlife trafficking, including elephant ivory, rhino horns, and turtle shells, is estimated to be worth $7 billion annually by the U.S. government. This figure does not include illegal logging and fishing, which can amount to an additional $30 billion to $100 billion and $10 billion to $23 billion annually, respectively. Prosecutions by the Department of Justice have led to the dismantling of wildlife trafficking rings worldwide. Recent legislative activity in the 113th Congress has focused on addressing elephant and rhino poaching, ivory trade, and ESA reauthorization. The reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been a legislative priority since 1992. In the 40 years since its enactment, 58 species have been delisted for reasons such as recovery, extinction, taxonomic revisions, or errors in data. Some of the recovered species include the American alligator, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has seen success with species like the American alligator, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon being delisted due to recovery. However, challenges remain in determining the status of rare species, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker. Critics argue that only 30 species have been delisted for recovery, while others point out that only 10 have been delisted due to extinction. The difficulty lies in the fact that rare species are hard to find, making it challenging to prove whether they are extinct or simply elusive. The Endangered Species Act has had success with species like the American alligator, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon being delisted due to recovery. However, challenges remain as full recoveries are few due to increasing habitat loss and invasive species. Only species in desperate situations receive priority, making conservation intervention difficult. Despite this, some species have stabilized or increased populations, with 35 species downlisted from endangered to threatened. The ESA has helped species like red wolves and California condors survive, showing some measure of success. The success of the Endangered Species Act can be measured by the achievement of recovery objectives in species recovery plans. A study found that conservation efforts may be underestimated as they do not consider species that would have deteriorated without intervention. The Government Accountability Office found that FWS prioritizes species based on factors other than priority ranking. The Government Accountability Office found that FWS does not routinely assess funding decisions to ensure appropriateness. In 2006, GAO examined federal efforts to recover selected species and found that recovery plans played a crucial role in the recovery of most species. Critics questioned the bias of the study towards positive reflections on the recovery planning process. The Government Accountability Office found that FWS had not fully implemented recommendations to strengthen ESA implementation, such as clarifying the role of critical habitat and assessing expenditures on species. NMFS released a Biennial Report to Congress on the Recovery Program for Threatened and Endangered Species in August 2011. The report provides summary tables on recovery efforts for 64 domestic species under NMFS's jurisdiction from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2010. In May 2012, the Center for Biological Diversity released a report on the recovery rates of 110 species protected by ESA, concluding that 90% are recovering as predicted. Controversies have arisen over ESA actions for species like the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin suckers, coho salmon, gray wolf, and sage grouse. Critics question the scientific rigor and handling of ESA actions in these cases. The Center for Biological Diversity published a study in July 2012 questioning the scientific rigor of ESA critical habitat designations. Limited resources and difficulty in studying rare species facing extinction raise concerns about the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Some suggest prioritizing other considerations over species conservation, while others propose changing the role of science in ESA actions. These challenges are further complicated by the time and cost required to gather more comprehensive data. Courts have ruled that agencies must consider the \"best data available\" when making decisions on species conservation. This standard does not require absolute certainty but mandates action before a species is on the brink of extinction. Agencies cannot ignore current biological information or treat species differently. The cost and time needed to gather complete data for lesser-known species pose challenges to conservation efforts. The best scientific data available must be utilized by agencies when making decisions on species conservation, as stated in judicial review. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the court emphasized the low evidentiary bar that must be met, requiring the agency to demonstrate the presence of a species in an area before regulating it. The ESA requires agencies to establish a causal connection between land use regulation and harm to species. Speculation is not enough; relevant facts must be considered. Some suggest using the ESA to restrict greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that emissions harm listed species' habitats. No court opinion has addressed this issue yet. The ESA may require negotiation of an incidental take permit for sources emitting greenhouse gases that affect species' habitats. Case law shows limited use of the ESA as an enforcement tool for climate change arguments. In specific cases, claims were made that emissions harmed specific species near power plants, but courts did not review the ESA claims due to procedural reasons. In United States v. Pacific Gas and Electric, the court ruled that the ESA was not violated, and claims of harm to species from a power plant were not linked to greenhouse gases. Regulatory changes were made to limit lawsuits based on climate change impacts on species, but these changes were later revoked. The revocation of regulatory changes limiting lawsuits based on climate change impacts on species did not expand the scope of effects on listed species. Another regulatory change restricts lawsuits for incidental takes of polar bears to actions in Alaska, despite the polar bear's habitat loss due to climate change. The polar bear rule remains in place, despite authorization for revocation under P.L. 111-8. In December 2010, FWS designated 187,000 square miles in Alaska as critical habitat for a species. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to amend ESA to exclude greenhouse gas impacts. Conservation efforts face challenges from human population growth, resource crises, and economic conflicts. Regional resource issues related to ESA have sparked congressional interest. The Bureau of Reclamation's decision in 2001 to withhold water from part of the Klamath irrigation project sparked conflicts between upstream farmers and downstream salmon fishery advocates. The project, spanning Oregon and California, involves endangered fish species under ESA protection, leading to complex water management disputes involving various stakeholders. Farmers argue for their contractual water rights, while others prioritize the salmon fishery's value and suggest temporary economic assistance for farmers. The Bureau of Reclamation's project facilities in the Klamath Basin are at the center of conflicts between farmers and salmon advocates. Various plans and agreements have been proposed to address water management disputes and endangered fish species protection, including the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) signed by multiple stakeholders in 2010. The Klamath Basin faces conflicts over water management and water rights, with agreements like the KBRA and KHSA aiming to address issues such as dam removal to restore salmon habitats. Congressional authorization is needed for KBRA implementation, while states are expected to fund dam removal under the KHSA. Dam removal under the KHSA is expected to be funded by the states of Oregon and California, with congressional authorization required for the Secretary of the Interior to make a final decision. The estimated costs for implementing the Klamath agreements have been revised downward. The 113th Congress needs to decide whether to provide legislative approval and support for the agreements. Wolves were once found throughout North America, but their populations have declined in recent centuries. Wolves in North America were historically divided into red wolves and gray wolves, with the Mexican wolf as a subspecies. The taxonomic debate revolves around whether wolves in different areas are distinct enough to be classified as separate species or subspecies, despite natural intermixing of genes. The gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the contiguous United States has faced complex regulatory and legal challenges under the Endangered Species Act since 1973. Efforts to delist or designate distinct population segments have been met with litigation, leading to a shifting landscape of wolf protections. In 2003, FWS designated wolves in the western and eastern US as distinct population segments (DPSs) and delisted them. However, courts nullified these designations. In 2007 and 2008, FWS designated and delisted the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rocky Mountains DPSs, but courts found the delistings flawed and vacated them. In December 2008, FWS returned wolves in these areas to their former protections. In 2009, FWS designated DPSs for wolves in the Western Great Lakes and Northern Rockies, delisting them except in Wyoming. Legal challenges led to the Western Great Lakes wolves returning to threatened or endangered status. The Northern Rockies wolves were also returned to experimental population status after a court ruling in 2010. There were proposals to legislatively delist the species, but concerns were raised about setting a dangerous precedent. Congress approved language in P.L. 112-10 (H.R. 1473) to reissue a final rule without judicial review, returning wolves in the Northern Rockies to the April 2009 rule and delisting them. This marked the first legislative delisting under the ESA. The gray wolf was delisted in the Northern Rockies under the ESA through legislative action in P.L. 112-10, marking the first time a species was delisted in this manner. The delisting only applied to certain states, while the species remains listed as endangered or threatened in other states. The decision was based on the species meeting recovery plan goals, despite some controversy over genetic connectivity. The gray wolf was delisted in the Northern Rockies under the ESA through legislative action in P.L. 112-10, based on meeting recovery plan goals despite genetic connectivity controversy. FWS proposed delisting wolves in the Western Great Lakes region in May 2011 and designated wolves in the east as a new species called the \"eastern wolf.\" The Service recognizes two species of wolves in the Western Great Lakes: the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and the eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), with recent genetic studies indicating the eastern wolf as a distinct species. This proposal could lead to delisting wolves in eastern states. The proposal aims to delist wolves in eastern states by considering them as a distinct species from Canis lupus. This taxonomic change would require a new listing process for ESA protections. FWS proposed delisting gray wolves in the lower 48 states and changing the status of Mexican wolves to endangered based on habitat interpretation, taxonomic revision, and habitat suitability concerns. Litigation and congressional attention may follow these controversial wolf conservation proposals. The decline of the Delta smelt in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers Delta is attributed to factors like water exports, competition from other fish species, warmer water temperatures, toxic contaminants, and changes in food supply. This has led to a 90% decline in the species over a 20-year period, resulting in its listing as threatened under the ESA in 1993. The decline of the Delta smelt in the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers Delta is attributed to factors like water exports, competition from other fish species, warmer water temperatures, toxic contaminants, and changes in food supply. Some factors are under federal control, impacting water supply to Central and Southern California. Changes in federal pump operations triggered consultation with fish and wildlife agencies under the ESA, leading to reduced water deliveries to users south of the Delta. The reduction in water deliveries south of the Delta has been controversial, especially during droughts. An ESA Section 7 consultation was initiated in 2004 to address the impact on delta smelt. FWS issued a no-jeopardy BiOp in 2004, re-issued in 2005 for critical habitat issues. In 2007, the FWS BiOp was found non-compliant, leading to consultation reinitiation. Interim protective measures were implemented in 2007, and a revised biological assessment was issued in 2008. In 2008, the Bureau of Reclamation issued a revised biological assessment on the CVP Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) for water projects in the Bay-Delta. The FWS BiOp determined that the operation of these projects could jeopardize the delta smelt's existence and its critical habitat. This led to reduced water deliveries for users south of the Delta, resulting in litigation and controversy. In 2011, an agreement on water flow levels was reached, marking a period without litigation since the 2008 FWS BiOp. The 2008 FWS BiOp led to reduced water deliveries due to concerns for the delta smelt's habitat. Litigation over water flow has been ongoing, with dry conditions in 2013 and projected drought in 2014 adding stress to the water supply system. Congressional oversight may address water supply shortages and environmental challenges in the Bay-Delta. Section 308 of S. 17 (H.R. 1881) aims to restrict operations for the Central Valley Project under certain conditions. Section 1(b) of H.R. 1927 would fulfill ESA requirements for the CVP and SWP if certain conditions are met, including implementing 2008 FWS and 2009 NMFS BiOp RPAs. Conflicts between ESA and property owners arise despite mechanisms like incidental take permits to soften its impact. The issue of property \"taking\" under ESA has been a central concern for detractors, who argue for just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court struggles to define government actions that constitute a \"taking\" of private property. A taking usually involves a permanent occupation or total elimination of economic use. A three-factor test is used for partial takings. Lower court decisions suggest that a severe impact on the property as a whole is necessary for a taking to occur. Only one case out of approximately 20 challenges to ESA restrictions has found a taking. The Supreme Court struggles to define government actions that constitute a \"taking\" of private property, with only one case out of approximately 20 challenges to ESA restrictions finding a taking. Cases have involved restrictions on timber cutting, reductions in water delivery to preserve instream flows for listed species, restrictions on shooting animals causing loss of livestock, and prohibitions on transport or sale of endangered species. Takings claims were rejected due to insufficient economic impact or the government not being responsible for actions of wild animals. The decision to maintain in-stream flows for ESA-listed fish was undermined by a judge in a later ruling. A second ESA/taking case was dismissed on ripeness grounds. The Federal Circuit ruled that diverting water to a fish ladder must be analyzed under a physical taking theory. The water district failed to prove interference with its obligations, leading to the case being dismissed as unripe. In the 1990s, critics sought to amend ESA to provide compensation for property impacts. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress includes bills altering the consultation process for timber sales on federal lands and making changes to permitting for oil shale development. H.R. 3533 and S. 1731 propose significant changes to the Endangered Species Act, including giving governors more authority over species listings, eliminating petitions for listing, requiring congressional approval for listings, and allowing property owners to seek compensation for impacts on fair market value. Additionally, S. 17 would restrict critical habitat designation for the Keystone XL pipeline, and S. 19 aims to amend the ESA. S. 19 proposes amending the Endangered Species Act to establish a procedure for state approval of consent decrees or settlement agreements. S. 744 aims to waive ESA and other legal requirements for expedited construction of border fences. Appropriations are crucial in ESA debates, providing funding for listing, recovery activities, and consultations for federal projects. The Administration proposed increased funding for endangered species programs in FY2014. The Administration proposed an increase of 17.4% for the Cooperative Endangered Species Fund above FY2013 levels, with level funding for the Multinational Species Conservation Fund and Neotropical Migratory Bird Fund. FY2014 appropriations for these programs are pending in congressional deliberations. Funding for NMFS's protected species programs in NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account is proposed to increase for FY2014. In FY2014, funding for Protected Species programs in NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account saw varying recommendations from different committees. The House Committee on Appropriations approved a $1.5 million increase (0.9%) and a $19.0 million decrease (-10.2%) from the Administration's proposal. In contrast, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an $18.2 million increase (11.0%) above the FY2013 spend plan, a $2.2 million decrease (-1.2%) from the Administration's proposal, and a $16.7 million increase (10.0%) above the House Committee's recommendation. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-46) was signed into law on October 17, 2013, extending FY2013 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) agencies and bureaus until January 15, 2014, or until the FY2014 CJS appropriations bill is enacted."
