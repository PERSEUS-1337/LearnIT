    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mercury-Free Vaccines Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that in 1999, a joint statement was issued by the Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics, endorsed by other medical organizations, recommending the removal of thimerosal-containing vaccines. In 2000, further recommendations were made by various health organizations regarding the use of these vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics, along with the American Academy of Family Physicians, reaffirmed the goal to remove or greatly reduce thimerosal from vaccines due to its feasibility, substantial progress in removal, ongoing discussions with vaccine manufacturers, and public concern about mercury use. The Public Health Service projects the US will transition to a thimerosal-free pediatric vaccine supply. The Institute of Medicine's Immunization Review Committee recommended removing thimerosal from vaccines for children and pregnant women. Progress has been made in reducing mercury exposure from childhood vaccines, but thimerosal still remains in some non-routine vaccines. Thimerosal remains in some non-routine childhood vaccines, with no current law prohibiting its reintroduction. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 1 in 6 infants are born with elevated blood mercury levels, posing risks to young children and pregnant women. Reduction of mercury exposure through vaccines is crucial to prevent harm. The text chunk discusses the prohibition of mercury-containing vaccines under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. The text prohibits mercury-containing vaccines under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with an exception for public health emergencies declared by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to declare a public health emergency justifying the use of vaccines containing mercury or thimerosal, with a limit of 12 months for the declaration's effective period. Renewals can be issued for the same incident or emergency. The Secretary can declare a public health emergency for the use of mercury-containing vaccines, with specific effective dates based on the type of vaccine. The Secretary can declare a public health emergency for the use of mercury-containing vaccines, with specific effective dates based on the type of vaccine, such as vaccines not described in subparagraphs (A) or (B) before January 1, 2006, and vaccines introduced into interstate commerce on or after January 1, 2007. SEC. 4. INFORMATION ON THIMEROSAL CONTENT.\n\nSection 2126 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include requirements for vaccine information materials to disclose the presence of thimerosal, provide information on thimerosal-free alternatives, and recommend against administering thimerosal-containing vaccines to pregnant women. The Congress recommends against administering thimerosal-containing vaccines to pregnant women. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs must report annually on progress in removing mercury from vaccines."
