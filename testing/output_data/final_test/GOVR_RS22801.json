    "content": "The federal copyright law, based on the Copyright and Patent Clause of the U.S. Constitution, protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium. Various types of creative works are eligible for copyright protection, including literary, musical, and visual arts. Copyright protection extends to various types of creative works such as pictures, audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works. It also includes compilations and derivative works but does not cover underlying abstract ideas. Works of the federal government are excluded from copyright protection and are considered public domain, allowing anyone to use them without infringement concerns. Copyright grants the creator rights to control the use of their work. The Copyright Act grants the copyright holder control over the use of protected material, including reproduction, distribution, public performance, and display. Statutory limitations, such as the \"first sale doctrine,\" allow for certain exceptions to the copyright monopoly. The Copyright Act grants control over protected material to the copyright holder, with exceptions like the \"fair use\" doctrine allowing for certain uses without consent. Fair use includes purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, and is determined by factors like the purpose of use and nature of the copyrighted work. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits circumventing technological measures controlling access to copyrighted works. Determining fair use of copyrighted material requires a case-by-case analysis, considering factors like purpose, nature of the work, and market impact. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits circumventing digital rights management (DRM) security measures, including descrambling, decrypting, or bypassing technological measures without authorization. It also prohibits selling products or services that circumvent access-control measures and trafficking in devices that bypass copyright protection measures. Unlike copyright infringement, the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions target the act of DRM circumvention and the distribution of technology used for that purpose. Copyright protection is limited in duration, lasting the author's life plus 70 years. After expiration, the work enters the public domain. Unauthorized use of exclusive rights constitutes infringement, such as copying without permission. Permission, compulsory licenses, or fair use must be obtained for any use of copyrighted work. The Copyright Act allows for copyright infringement to be either civil or criminal, with civil infringement involving violations of the copyright owner's exclusive rights and criminal infringement including offenses like copyright infringement for profit and pre-release distribution of copyrighted works. The federal courts have recognized two forms of secondary copyright infringement liability: contributory and vicarious. Contributory infringement involves knowingly inducing, causing, or materially contributing to infringing conduct. This includes circumvention of copyright protection systems, bootleg recordings, unauthorized recording of motion pictures, and counterfeit labels and packaging for copyrighted works. Vicarious infringement liability can occur when a defendant has the right and ability to supervise infringing activity and a direct financial interest in it. The statute of limitations for civil action for copyright infringement is three years, while criminal proceedings must be initiated within five years. Federal courts determine civil remedies for infringement, and imprisonment terms for copyright crimes are specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319, with fines determined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571. Legal remedies for copyright infringement include injunctions, impounding or destruction of infringing copies, actual damages, profits of the infringer, and statutory damages ranging from $750 to $30,000. Willful infringement may result in increased statutory damages. Legal remedies for copyright infringement include injunctions, impounding or destruction of infringing copies, actual damages, profits of the infringer, and statutory damages ranging from $750 to $30,000. Willful infringement can lead to increased statutory damages up to $150,000, costs, attorney's fees, criminal prosecution with penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, as well as civil and criminal forfeiture of infringing copies and equipment."
