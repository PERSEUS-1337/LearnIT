    "content": "The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to allow the Secretary of Education to provide local educational agencies with flexibility to consolidate federal funds with state and local funding to create a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students. The Every Student Succeeds Act allows the Secretary of Education to provide flexibility to local educational agencies to create a school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students, including those from low-income families, English Learners, or with disabilities. School budgets are based on these weighted pupil counts, and allocations are transferred with students if they move within the same district. Title I-A funds can be used by LEAs to implement weighted student funding systems under Title I-E agreements, with requirements to allocate funds to schools with low-income families and ELs. LEAs must also meet Title I-A and other requirements, with limited authority for 50 LEAs before 2019-2020 and potential expansion thereafter. The Secretary began accepting applications for local flexibility demonstration agreements under the Student-Centered Funding Pilot in February 2018. The U.S. Department of Education has approved Puerto Rico to implement a weighted student funding system under the Title I-E authority starting in the 2019-2020 school year. Six LEAs have applied for this authority, with no other LEAs implementing weighted student funding systems prior to 2019-2020. The report provides context on state and local financing of public schools, including an overview of weighted student funding systems. The report focuses on the Title I-E authority, examining its statutory authority, implementation issues, interactions with other ESEA programs, and potential issues. It also provides an overview of funding sources for public schools, including the use of weighted student funding at the state and LEA levels. In the United States, public elementary and secondary education funding comes from local, state, and federal government revenues. In the 2015-16 school year, a total of $678.4 billion was allocated for education, with state governments contributing 47.0%, local governments 44.8%, and the federal government 8.3%. State funding has increased over the years, while local funding has decreased. The primary source of local education funding is the property tax. State revenues for public education come from various sources including personal and corporate income taxes, retail sales taxes, excise taxes, and lotteries. All states, except the District of Columbia, contribute to public education funding, with the state share varying widely. State funds are distributed to Local Education Agencies (LEAs) through five types of programs, with Foundation Programs being the most common. The goal of state school finance programs is to provide funding for public elementary and secondary education. State school finance programs aim to equalize spending and resources for public education across all Local Education Agencies (LEAs) in the state by establishing target funding levels per pupil. Pupil counts may be weighted based on various factors like special needs, grade levels, educational programs, and geographic considerations. The survey of individual state entries indicates that 32 states use weighted student counts to determine funding levels for Local Education Agencies (LEAs). States assign numeric weights to different pupil categories or specify target dollar amounts, adjusting weights for grade levels, geographic areas, or programs. Population sparsity weights are also considered to address diseconomies of scale in small LEAs or schools. The concept of pupil weighting is used to determine funding levels for Local Education Agencies (LEAs), recognizing diseconomies of scale in small LEAs or schools. After state funds are allocated to LEAs, they are combined with local funds to provide resources to individual schools. Weighted student funding is relevant in the distribution of educational resources at the LEA level, compared to traditional centralized budgeting within LEAs. The Local Education Agencies (LEAs) manage state and local funds centrally, assigning resources like facilities, teachers, and support staff to individual schools based on LEA-wide standards. Expenditures per pupil are determined after resources are allocated, leading to variations in spending on teachers and other resources due to factors like teacher seniority. Under traditional school budgeting policies, variations in teacher seniority and other factors can affect resource allocation in each school. Local policies often use average salaries instead of actual salaries, masking these variations. Some LEAs have started implementing weighted student funding for individual school budgets, but this concept is not applied to federal program funds and only a portion of state and local revenues. LEAs still centrally administer activities like school facility construction and employee benefits. The use of weighted student funding within Local Education Agencies (LEAs) is a new practice for school budgets, with limited research on its effects. Dr. Marguerite Roza and her team at the Edunomics Lab are studying spending patterns under this system. Dr. Roza and her team at the Edunomics Lab are studying the effects of weighted student funding systems on equity and achievement in 19 LEAs. These systems are implemented for equity and flexibility for school principals. There is no standard model for weighted student funding, with differences in budget allocation, base amounts, and weights for student categories. Most LEAs still use average salaries in budgeting instead of actual personnel expenditures. The report focuses on the new authority for flexible per-pupil spending under ESEA Title I-E, discussing statutory requirements, implementation, interactions with other programs like Title I-A, and possible issues. The Title I-E authority aims to allow LEAs to consolidate federal funds with state and local funding to create a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students. The Title I-E authority allows LEAs to consolidate federal funds with state and local funding to create a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for disadvantaged students. Eligible federal funds include ESEA funds from various programs, with no required uses as long as expenditures are \"reasonable and necessary\" and meet the purposes of the programs. The Incentive Program, Comprehensive Literacy State Development Grants, Innovative Approaches to Literacy, School Leader Recruitment and Support, English Language Acquisition, Student Support and Academic Enrichment, Small Rural School Achievement Program, and Rural and Low-Income School Program are federal programs that can be consolidated by participating LEAs. The funds must align with the purposes of each program, such as well-rounded education, safe and healthy students, and technology. If SSAE funds are consolidated with state and local funds under a weighted student funding system, participating LEAs must demonstrate that activities in schools align with program purposes. LEAs are not required to meet specific funding allocations for each purpose. When consolidating funds from federal programs into the system, LEAs must adhere to approved application objectives. Title I-E provides formula grants for LEAs, and flexibility in funding does not mandate including all eligible federal programs in the system. Under Title I-E authority, participating LEAs can consolidate eligible federal funds into a weighted student funding system for low-income students. The Secretary can enter into a local flexibility agreement with selected LEAs for up to three years to implement this system. Non-ESEA funds like IDEA or Perkins CTE Act are not eligible for consolidation. Under Title I-E authority, participating LEAs can consolidate eligible federal funds into a weighted student funding system for low-income students. The Secretary can waive ESEA provisions to allow this, with broader authority than under Section 8401. LEAs must still meet certain statutory requirements, such as Title I-A fiscal accountability standards. The Title I-A fiscal accountability requirements in Section 1118 include maintenance of effort, supplement, not supplant, and comparability. Maintenance of effort mandates that LEA expenditures remain at least 90% of the previous year's for public education. The supplement, not supplant provision ensures Title I-A funds supplement, not replace state and local funds for Title I-A schools. The use of a weighted student funding system does not impact meeting these requirements. The comparability requirement for Title I-A schools mandates that a comparable level of services be provided with state and local funds compared to non-Title I-A schools. Many LEAs use a pupil-teacher ratio for this comparison, but under a weighted student funding system, this method may not be feasible. However, if an LEA can demonstrate comparability through an equitable funding system, their weighted student funding system would meet the comparability requirement. The weighted student funding system can demonstrate comparability for Title I-A schools based on funds rather than staff-student ratio. Public schools must be identified for supplement, not supplant, and comparability provisions, including determining which schools receive Title I-A funds. The Secretary cannot waive the requirement to identify schools for Title I-A funding distribution, even if funds are not distributed based on these determinations in a weighted student funding system. The LEA must distribute Title I-A funds based on current distribution requirements if included in the weighted student funding system. LEAs must meet fiscal accountability requirements, identify Title I-A schools and funding levels, and provide equitable services under eligible federal programs before allocating funds. The participating LEA must determine the amount of Title I-A funding to reserve for eligible private school students, consult with private school officials, and provide necessary services. Remaining funds will be distributed through the LEA's weighted student funding formula. LEAs must also comply with federal civil rights laws and IDEA requirements. The Secretary has determined additional requirements that cannot be waived for participating LEAs, including meeting state academic standards, administering state assessments, accountability requirements, and reporting per-pupil expenditures. State-level responsibilities delegated to LEAs, like identifying migratory children, must also be met. LEAs with schools in comprehensive or targeted support must develop improvement plans. The Secretary has additional requirements for participating LEAs, including meeting state standards, assessments, and accountability. LEAs with schools in need of improvement must develop plans. LEAs offering public school choice as an intervention are exempt from transportation funding limitations. LEAs must address disparities in teacher quality for low-income and minority students. The Secretary can enter into flexibility agreements with up to 50 LEAs. Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, interested LEAs must submit a proposed local flexibility demonstration agreement that meets statutory requirements and agree to meet continued demonstration requirements. The Secretary can extend funding flexibility to LEAs that meet specific criteria related to weighted student funding systems and demonstrate annual progress. LEAs must annually demonstrate to the Secretary that no high-poverty school received less funding for low-income students or English learners compared to the previous year. Six LEAs applied for Title I-E authority, with Puerto Rico approved for funding flexibility starting in the 2019-2020 school year. LEAs seeking to combine federal, state, and local funds in a weighted student funding system must submit an application to the Secretary. The application should include details of the funding system, legal authority to use funds, system requirements, and how it will support student achievement. Funding sources and amounts must also be described. The LEA must provide details of the amount and percentage of total funding allocated through the weighted student funding system, including per-pupil expenditures of state, local, and federal funds for each school. This calculation should be based on actual personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures. Additionally, the application must include the per-pupil amount of eligible federal funds received by each school in the previous fiscal year, disaggregated by the programs supported by the funds. The system must ensure that the purposes of the federal funds are met. The LEA must ensure that eligible federal funds allocated through the weighted student funding system meet the purposes of federal programs, serving various student populations. The LEA must provide assurances in its application, including developing a local flexibility demonstration agreement in consultation with stakeholders, implementing fiscal controls, and continuing to meet ESEA requirements. In order to enter into a local flexibility demonstration agreement, each LEA must have a weighted student funding system that meets specific requirements. The system must allocate funds to the school level based on the number of students and an LEA-developed formula. It must also allocate a percentage of all eligible federal, state, and local funds to schools, agreed upon during the application process. The LEA must provide assurances that it will meet federal civil rights laws when implementing the agreement. The LEA's weighted student funding system must allocate a percentage of eligible federal, state, and local funds to schools, agreed upon during the application process. The system must provide substantially more funding to ELs, students from low-income families, and other disadvantaged students selected by the LEA. High-poverty schools must receive more per-pupil funding for low-income students in the first year of the agreement compared to the previous year. The LEA's weighted student funding system allocates funds to schools based on agreed percentages, prioritizing ELs, low-income students, and other disadvantaged groups. High-poverty schools receive increased funding for these students compared to the previous year. Schools are charged based on actual costs for personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures. The LEA's weighted student funding system allocates funds to schools based on agreed percentages, prioritizing ELs, low-income students, and other disadvantaged groups. Schools are charged based on actual costs for personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures. LEAs entering into a local flexibility demonstration agreement must cooperate with ED in monitoring and technical assistance activities. Each participating LEA must demonstrate annually that high-poverty schools do not receive less per-pupil funding for low-income students or ELs compared to the previous year. Each participating LEA must annually report per-pupil expenditures of federal, state, and local funds for each school, disaggregated by student poverty levels and racial/ethnic groups. Data must include personnel and nonpersonnel expenditures, as well as student enrollment numbers by various demographics. The Secretary can renew local flexibility demonstration agreements for additional three-year terms if the LEA meets requirements for weighted student funding systems and has a high likelihood of continued compliance. The agreement can be terminated if the LEA fails to comply with the terms or requirements. The Secretary can renew local flexibility demonstration agreements for additional three-year terms if the LEA meets requirements for weighted student funding systems and has a high likelihood of continued compliance. The agreement can be terminated if the LEA fails to comply with the terms or requirements. If the LEA believes the Secretary has erred in making a determination, it may provide additional evidence for consideration. The Secretary will evaluate the implementation of agreements to improve funding distribution and student achievement. On February 2, 2018, the Secretary announced the launch of a Student-Centered Funding Pilot under Title I-E. Five LEAs submitted applications for local flexibility demonstration agreements by March 12, 2018, including Puerto Rico, whose application was approved on June 28, 2018. The student funding system, initially planned for the 2018-2019 school year, has been delayed until 2019-2020. Only the Roosevelt School District in Arizona applied for flexibility by the July deadline. The ED requested $1 billion in FY2018 to support weighted student funding systems and public school choice. The ED proposed grant funds to support LEAs in establishing weighted student funding systems with open enrollment policies for public school choice, focusing on maximizing opportunities for all students, especially those from low-income families. Requirements could include providing school information to parents, supporting school integration, arranging transportation, and giving priority to low-income students or those in Title I-A schools. LEAs could use funds for temporary payments to schools affected by the transition. The ED proposed grant funds to support LEAs in establishing weighted student funding systems with open enrollment policies for public school choice. This included providing school information to parents, supporting school integration, arranging transportation, and giving priority to low-income students or those in Title I-A schools. Funds could also be used for temporary payments to individual schools affected by the transition. Congress did not act on ED's request for funding in its FY2019 budget. The ED proposed grant funds to support LEAs in establishing weighted student funding systems with open enrollment policies for public school choice, focusing on maximizing opportunities for all students, especially those from low-income families. The requirements could include providing school information to parents, supporting school integration, arranging transportation, and giving priority to low-income students or those in Title I-A schools. Additionally, funds could be used for temporary payments to schools affected by the transition. The ED did not specify a funding amount for Open Enrollment Grants (OEGs) but requested $500 million for Scholarships for Private Schools and OEGs. In its FY2020 budget request, the ED proposed $50 million for Student-Centered Funding Incentive Grants to increase LEA participation in agreements authorized under ESEA Section 1501. Congressional action would be needed to implement the proposal, which aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of weighted student funding systems in improving student outcomes and reducing administrative burdens for LEAs. The ED proposed $50 million for Student-Centered Funding Incentive Grants to support LEAs in implementing weighted student funding systems. Up to 10 LEAs could receive grants, with priority given to those with high poverty rates. The funds can be used for activities related to transitioning to the new funding system, including making temporary payments to offset funding reductions and providing technical assistance. The ED proposed $50 million for Student-Centered Funding Incentive Grants to assist LEAs in implementing weighted student funding systems. LEAs entering into agreements can use administrative funds under Section 8203 for system implementation. Title I-E authority may interact with other ESEA programs, with a focus on Title I-A requirements for fund allocation within LEAs. The Title I-E authority allows LEAs to consolidate and allocate federal funds to public schools through weighted student funding formulas. Most of the funding is provided through formula grants, with a focus on the ESEA Title I-A program. This program constitutes about 76% of the total FY2019 appropriations for all programs potentially affected by the Title I-E authority. Most funds are allocated to individual schools under statutory school allocation policies. The ESEA Title I-A funds are likely to be the primary federal program affected by the weighted student funding authority in most participating LEAs. Other federal programs are less focused on individual schools and may not be as directly impacted. The distribution of funds under ESEA programs could change significantly with the authority to combine Title I-A funds with state and local funds under weighted student funding formulas. This shift allows Title I-A funds to follow students to any public school in the LEA, not just those with high concentrations of low-income students, unlike traditional program implementation. Most ESEA Title I-A funds are allocated to individual schools based on their percentage of low-income students, with LEAs having discretion to control some funds centrally. Schools are ranked by low-income student percentage for grant eligibility, with options to prioritize certain grade levels or high schools with over 50% low-income students. LEAs must serve all eligible schools if funds allow. The Title I-A program serves schools with a high percentage of low-income students, with eligibility criteria based on the school's low-income student percentage. LEAs can choose to set higher eligibility thresholds to focus funds on fewer schools, especially in urban areas like Chicago. In Chicago, all public schools participating in Title I-A have a free and reduced-price lunch child percentage of 55% or higher, exceeding the 35% eligibility threshold. Data used for Title I-A funds distribution differs from that used for state and LEA allocations, requiring the use of proxies for low-income status. LEAs can use various measures, such as eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches, for school selection and allocations. Approximately 90% of LEAs receiving Title I-A funds use free/reduced-price school lunch data to select schools and allocate funds. The income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches are higher than the poverty levels used in the allocation formulas. For example, for a family of four during the 2018-2019 school year, the income eligibility threshold was 130% of the poverty level for free lunches and 185% for reduced-price lunches. During the 2018-2019 school year, income thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches were higher than poverty levels. Title I-A funds are meant for schools with high percentages of low-income students, but many low-poverty LEAs still receive funds. This results in high-poverty schools within these LEAs not having high percentages of low-income students compared to the national average. According to the Department of Education (ED), 23% of the nation's public schools in the lowest quartile for students from low-income families receive Title I-A grants. These funds are allocated based on the number of low-income students, with the option for higher grants per child in schools with more low-income students. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can offer Title I-A services schoolwide, while others can only provide services to the lowest-achieving students. Title I-A funds are allocated based on the number of low-income students, with higher grants per child in schools with more low-income students. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can offer services schoolwide, while others can only serve the lowest-achieving students. Funding is focused on schools with high concentrations of low-income students, not individual students, due to the relatively low funding per student. The level of funding for each participating student is relatively low and can finance services when combined with Title I-A funding for eligible students in a school. The estimated funding per student in the program is $645, based on the total FY2019 Title I-A appropriation divided by the number of students participating. This amount may be an overestimate as it does not consider funds used at the state or LEA level for activities like administration. Under weighted student funding, the relevant figure would be the level of funding per student from a low-income family, which could be an overestimate due to funds retained at the state or LEA level. The national average Title I-A grant per pupil from a low-income family would be $614, with 25.8 million public school students from low-income families. LEAs participating in the weighted student funding authority may also include funds from other programs. The weighted student funding authority may decentralize federal programs currently managed by LEAs, with funds allocated to schools based on a formula. Participation in the Title I-E authority by LEAs is examined for possible reasons for low participation rates. The curr_chunk discusses reasons for low participation in the Title I-E authority by LEAs, potential benefits of participation according to the ED, and possible issues that may arise if participation increases. It considers how the allocation of federal funds could change, the impact on individual schools, the potential for a major shift in fund distribution, and the need for safeguards to ensure program goals are met. The Title I-E authority under ESSA aims to ensure federal education program goals are met. Only one LEA, Puerto Rico, has been approved for the authority as of July 2019. Low participation may be due to slow implementation by ED and a three-year time limitation for the authority. LEAs may be hesitant to make major changes or new investments in their school finance system for the limited three-year time period of the Title I-E authority. The number of LEAs already using weighted student funding systems for state and local funds, and interested in expanding to federal programs, is limited. There is no comprehensive list of LEAs using weighted student funding, with only a small number of large urban LEAs currently implementing it. This limits the potential applicants for the federal weighted student funding authority. The federal weighted student funding authority may deter potential applicants due to limitations. Including IDEA and Perkins CTE Act funding streams in Title I-E flexibility authority could align with state and local weighted student funding policies, offering enhanced flexibility to LEAs. LEAs may be deterred by the requirement to use actual personnel expenditures in weighted student funding systems. Most LEAs still use average staff salaries instead. While some ESEA requirements are waived for LEAs with weighted student funding flexibility, others remain in place. LEAs with weighted student funding flexibility may not be motivated to apply due to remaining accountability requirements. Implementing a local flexibility agreement could lead to funds shifting among public schools, potentially resulting in some schools losing a substantial amount of funding. Schools may face funding cuts without support from state, local, or federal funds to transition to a weighted funding system. Some LEAs may be hesitant to enter agreements due to potential loss of funds. The Title I-E authority does not currently provide federal funds to offset funding decreases. ED has proposed grants for LEAs implementing flexibility agreements, but no funds have been allocated yet. The delay in implementing Title I-E authority complicates the schedule for expanding eligibility for weighted student funding flexibility to all LEAs. Eligibility was limited to 50 LEAs before 2019-2020, but can now expand to any LEA if a majority meet requirements. However, no LEA will start implementing the flexibility until 2019-2020, posing a challenge for program expansion if more LEAs show interest. The Title I-E authority offers LEAs greater flexibility in using federal education funds, allowing them to align with state and local funds without specific restrictions. Participating LEAs can set their own priorities for the funds and experience reduced administrative burdens by not having to track federal funds separately. The Title I-E authority allows LEAs to combine state, local, and federal funds to prioritize funding for students with specific needs through a weighted student funding system. This enhances transparency in resource allocation and supports school-based management practices. Weighted student funding policies aim to increase student mobility, choice among public schools, and target funds on disadvantaged students. The authority is compared to the schoolwide program under ESEA Title I-A. The weighted student funding authority under Title I-E allows LEAs to combine funds for students with specific needs, promoting transparency and school-based management. This authority is more expansive than the schoolwide program under Title I-A, providing funding consolidation for all public schools within the LEA. However, concerns and differing views on weighted student funding are discussed in the report's \"Issues\" section. Title I-A schools with schoolwide programs already have funding consolidation authority under Section 1114, but there are differences compared to the weighted student funding system. The authority available to Title I-A schools operating schoolwide programs under Section 1114 allows for funding consolidation, while Title I-E requires all public schools in an LEA with a local flexibility agreement to consolidate funds. Schools with schoolwide programs must conduct needs assessments, develop comprehensive plans, and review them annually. Schools with schoolwide programs must annually review and revise their plans based on student needs. Schools in an LEA with Title I-E participation do not need to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment or develop a comprehensive plan. Consolidated funds must meet the intent of each federal program, with flexibility to include funds from selected ESEA programs, IDEA, and Perkins Act. Consolidated funds must adhere to supplement, not supplant requirements. Under Title I-E authority, Title I-A funds can be allocated to any public school in a participating LEA that enrolls even one student from a low-income family, unlike the current school-based allocation for schools with high concentrations of low-income students. The weighted student funding authority would result in a different allocation strategy compared to the current Title I-A program structure. The program structure of Title I-A focuses on directing funds to schools with high concentrations of poverty to address the needs of low-achieving pupils. The funding per pupil may only cover substantial educational services when combined for larger groups of students. This approach aims to target the greatest pupil needs by concentrating resources on high-poverty schools. Under a weighted student funding process, Title I-A funds would be dispersed among public schools based on the number of low-income students, potentially benefiting more schools. Concerns about economies of scale argue against spreading grants to all schools in a locality, as aid per student may only be effective when combined for a significant number of pupils. This could be a challenge for schools with few low-income students. However, combining Title I-A funds with state and local funds could address this issue. Under a weighted student funding process, Title I-A funds would be combined with state and local funds to allocate more funding to high-poverty schools, giving additional weight to students from low-income families. This could result in increased funding for relatively high-poverty schools, especially in districts that had not previously adopted weighted student funding policies. Eligible federal programs may also see an increase in funding as a result of this flexibility. Under Title I-E flexibility, eligible federal programs may focus more on school-level fund use. Limited data exists on fund distribution to schools. Comprehensive data on federal education funds per public school could analyze the impact of switching to a weighted student funding system. Title I-A of ESEA requires states to include school expenditure data in report cards, detailing per-pupil expenditures of federal, state, and local funds at the LEA and school levels. The new reporting requirement mandates that per-pupil expenditures be detailed for every LEA and public school in the state, including information on the steps taken to provide this data. This will include the breakdown of aggregate federal funds allocated or used at the school level, although disaggregation of funds under Title I-E programs is not required. LEAs have the option to delay reporting per-pupil expenditures until the 2018-2019 school year report cards are issued. The Title I-E authority allows for a transformation of Title I-A funds from a school-based program to an individualized grant, representing a significant change in federal education funding strategy. This shift may impact the allocation of federal funds at individual schools under weighted student funding systems. Title I-A funds are to be used to serve the lowest-achieving students or all students if the school meets the 40% low-income threshold. The funding per student is modest and is assumed to be sufficient for large numbers of students from low-income families. There are requirements for the authorized uses of Title I-A funds to meet the special educational needs of disadvantaged students. The weighted student funding pilot offers a different approach with accountability requirements still in place for public schools receiving Title I-A funds. The Title I-A funds will be combined with state and local funds into weighted grant amounts for all public schools in the LEA, following students if they transfer among schools. This approach differs from traditional Title I-A programs, potentially reducing administrative burdens but also waiving some requirements for targeting services to students with the greatest needs. The Title I-E authority's individualized grant approach could serve as a model for future expansion. The Title I-E flexibility authority allows for the inclusion of students from public schools in other LEAs or possibly eligible students from private schools. Participating LEAs must ensure that the purposes of eligible federal programs in their weighted student funding systems are met, which may be challenging initially. This includes the allocation of Title I-A funds and other federal program funds to schools. The U.S. Department of Education offers various grants and programs such as EFIG, EL, ESEA, ESSA, IDEA, LEA, OEG, SEA, SSAE, and TANF."
