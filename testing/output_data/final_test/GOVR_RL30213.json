    "content": "President Clinton signed into law P.L. 106-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000, which appropriates funds for various departments including the District of Columbia. H.R. 3194 provided appropriations solely for the District of Columbia and Title I of Division A of P.L. 106-113 allocates $436 million in special federal payments to the District. The Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 created the Authority and CFO to improve city services and achieve financial solvency in the District of Columbia. Reforms, federal assistance, improved tax collections, and a better economy led to consecutive budget surpluses in FY1997 and FY1998. The FY1998 surplus was partly due to the National Capital Revitalization Act of 1997. The National Capital Revitalization Act of 1997 allocated over $5 billion in federal funds to the city, transferred financial responsibility for prisons and court operations, and increased the federal share for Medicaid. By the end of FY1998, the District had a general fund balance of $112 million, projected to reach $282 million by the end of FY1999. The District's proposed FY2000 budget includes a $150 million operating reserve requirement. The District's proposed FY2000 budget would result in a projected year-end surplus of $313 million. In 1998, there were changes in the city's political leadership, with former CFO Anthony Williams elected as mayor. Additionally, new members were elected to the Council of the District of Columbia. In December 1997, reform-minded candidates were elected to the Council of the District of Columbia and the city's school board. The school board challenged the Authority's power and reached an agreement to regain control of public schools by June 30, 2000. Additionally, there were changes in the composition of the Authority from June to August. During June to August 1998, the President appointed four new members to the five-member Authority, including a new chair. Robert P. Watkins and Dr. Alice Rivlin were appointed in mid-June, Constance Newman was reappointed in July, and Eugene Kinlow and Darius Mans were appointed in August. Dr. Rivlin became the new chair, replacing Dr. Andrew Brimmer, while Joyce Ladner, Edward Singletary, and Stephen Harlan stepped down. The President signed the District of Columbia Management Restoration Act of 1999, repealing the District of Columbia Management Reform Act of 1997. This act restores management authority to the mayor for the city's nine largest departments, allowing the mayor to appoint and dismiss department heads. It also gives the Council authority to confirm mayoral appointments without the concurrence of the Authority, aiming for greater accountability and clarity in responsibility. The change in leadership at the Authority and the election of Mayor Anthony Williams have led to statutory changes clarifying the lines of responsibility and authority between the mayor and the Authority. Mayor Williams successfully lobbied for control of the nine major agencies, transferring power to hire and dismiss department heads from the Chief Management Officer to the mayor. This shift has changed the Authority's role from direct management to oversight, with management reforms progressing unevenly across different agencies. The police department in the District is facing challenges with response time issues in their emergency and non-emergency telephone systems. The city is losing $1.8 million annually due to maintaining unused telephone lines. Additionally, the city's property management department has been leasing blighted and abandoned buildings for years. Two critical studies of the Council's operations were released in early 1999. The DC Appleseed Center released a study criticizing the Council's reliance on emergency legislation and operational problems. The Council's fragmented committee structure, patronage in staffing, and lack of professional analysis staff were highlighted as issues. The DC Appleseed Center study criticized the Council for its fragmented committee structure, patronage in staffing, and lack of professional analysis staff. Recommendations include abolishing the current committee structure, creating a centralized resource of trained public policy staffers, improving information dissemination, and providing timely distribution of proposed bills to Council members. The District of Columbia public schools faced challenges in meeting student needs despite opening on time in September 1998. Changes in leadership occurred, with General Julius Becton resigning and Arlene Ackerman taking over. Five new school board members were elected in November 1998, and a memorandum was signed in late October 1998 promising the return of authority to the Board of Education. The Authority promised to return responsibility and authority to the elected school board by June 30, 2000, after declaring a state of crisis in the school system in 1996. The elected board challenged the Authority's power in 1998 and gained some input on school discipline and facilities. The elected board also retained the power to grant charters for public charter schools, leading to an expansion of such schools in 1998. In 1998, public charter schools in the District of Columbia received charter school designation, with the number expected to reach 29 by September 1999. Approximately 5% of the total student population attends public charter schools. Special education services are provided to nearly 10% of the public school population, with an expected increase to 11,000 students. The school system has budgeted $167 million for special education services for FY1999, which is 30% of the total budget. Delays in the assessment process increase the number of students placed in private educational institutions, adding to the cost of special education. Concerns about these delays led to a provision in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 to extend the time period for assessment from 50 to 120 days. Additionally, two receivers were appointed by the Superior Court in September 1998 to improve educational instruction at the Oak Hill Prison School for District youth offenders. The Council established a special committee to investigate special education services at Oak Hill Prison School. The superintendent made changes to address longstanding problems, including transferring special education assessments to school principals. The courts continue to have a significant role in the District government's operations. The District government's proposed budget for FY2000 allocates 7% of total general fund expenditures to be controlled by court-appointed receivers, totaling $352 million for three agencies. Two additional agencies are also under court-appointed receivers. In September 1998, receivers were appointed to manage Oak Hill Prison School due to dissatisfaction with educational services provided to youth offenders. The judge was dissatisfied with educational services at Oak Hill Prison for youth offenders in Laurel, Maryland. Receivers were appointed to manage the school, with the possibility of returning operations to the District school system before the next school year. The Housing Authority could also return from receivership by 2000. Legislation introduced by Council Chair Linda Cropp aims to maintain the agency's independent status. Despite progress in public housing, other agencies under receivership are not ready to return to District government control. No additional funding was requested by the Clinton Administration or the Authority for the District of Columbia. The Clinton Administration did not request additional funding for the District of Columbia in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for FY1999. However, in the FY2000 budget recommendations, the Administration proposed $393 million in federal payments for the District. This budget also includes $17 million for college access legislation, $80.3 million for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, with a $20 million increase for parole and probation activities. The proposed increase in funding would support parole, probation, and offender supervision activities. The public defender and pretrial services agencies would receive $7.6 million more in federal assistance payments. The budget does not include funding requests for mental health activities, school construction, or special education, which were included in the District's consensus budget. The District is seeking $117.3 million in mental health assistance, $73.1 million in school construction assistance, and $30 million for special education. The federal government included $30 million in special education funding in its FY1999 payments to address longstanding problems in processing and evaluating students with special needs. The House and Senate pass a concurrent budget resolution for each fiscal year, establishing spending ceilings for allocation of funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a revised suballocation of $410 million for the District, while the House approved $453 million for FY2000. The budget does not include funding for mental health activities, school construction, or special education. The Senate bill, S. 1283, would appropriate $410.7 million in budget authority for FY2000 for the District of Columbia. The Council approved a $4.7 billion budget for FY2000, including $614.1 million in federal payments and a $150 million reserve fund. They also passed a tax parity act to align the District's tax structure with neighboring states. The tax parity act passed by the Council in Maryland and Virginia is projected to reduce property and income taxes by $300 million over five years. There is debate among city leaders and congressional hearings on the measure. Democrats raise concerns about improving services before tax cuts, while Republicans support the cuts to encourage business development and retain middle-class families. Congress appropriates federal payments to the District and reviews its budget, which must be approved by the District subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees must approve and may modify the District's budget. The House and Senate versions of the budget are reconciled in a joint conference committee and must be passed by both chambers. The final budget is then sent to the President for approval or veto. The Senate approved a bill providing FY2000 appropriations for the District of Columbia, with a decrease in federal funding compared to the previous year. The Senate Appropriations bill for FY2000 included funding increases for court operations, court services, and offender supervision in the District of Columbia. It allocated additional funds for the Superior Court, parole revocation, probation activities, pretrial services, and public defender services. The bill also earmarked funds for drug screening and testing activities and recommended a federal payment for in-state tuition for eligible DC residents seeking college admission in neighboring states. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1 million for a crime-fighting initiative to reduce illegal drug sales. The District of Columbia expects to receive $1.919 billion in federal funds for FY2000, including grants for state and local governments. The approved budget includes $5.334 billion in total operating expenses, with a 5% limit on salary increases for Council members. This would result in an annual salary of $84,635 for council members. The Senate bill approved an increase in council member salaries to $92,464, with the council chair's salary set at $102,000. Additional funding was allocated for economic development, public education, and public safety activities. The Senate bill approved an increase in council member salaries to $92,464, with the council chair's salary set at $102,000. Additional funding was allocated for economic development, public education, and public safety activities. The Committee recommended creating a separate appropriations for Defender Services for the District of Columbia Courts due to misuse of funds in previous years. The Senate Appropriations Committee made only a few changes in how the District's proposed budget would use funds. The Senate Committee reduced the City Administrator's office funds to $12.8 million, $12.3 million below the FY2000 budget. This increase from FY1999 reflects transferred responsibilities and funding. The bill also mandates a $150 million reserve fund. The Senate Committee bill mandates a $150 million reserve fund for the city to protect against future expenditure overruns or revenue shortfalls. District officials argue that the city's budget surplus and projected fund balance exceed Wall Street's fiscal health threshold. The bill includes a provision for District officials to report planned expenditures to Congress. The Senate Committee bill, S. 1283, includes provisions prohibiting the use of District revenues for certain activities. It also establishes a deadline for the removal of inmates from a correctional center in Ohio. Additionally, the bill mandates a $150 million reserve fund for the city to protect against future expenditure overruns or revenue shortfalls. District officials are required to report planned expenditures to Congress. The Committee bill for the District of Columbia includes a provision for a 4% surplus general fund balance and allows excess funds to be used for debt reduction or non-recurring expenses. It also permits tax abatement for revitalizing commercial properties in empowerment zones. The Senate passed the bill with few spending changes on July 1, 1999. The Senate passed the Committee-approved bill for the District of Columbia with few spending changes. During floor debate, the Senate considered eight amendments, passing six and withdrawing two. One withdrawn amendment aimed to extend the prohibition on using funds for a needle exchange program, while the other sought to remove a $17 million federal contribution for tuition assistance. Adopted floor amendments include requiring the arrest and termination of parole for prisoners found with illegal drugs and mandating a study of the District's criminal justice system by the General Accounting Office. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill providing FY2000 appropriations for the District of Columbia, with $453 million in federal payments, $166 million less than FY1999. The bill includes a reduction in court operations funding and the creation of a defender services account for indigent persons. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $46.1 million increase in funding for parole revocation, probation, and public defender services. They also recommended a $17 million federal payment for in-state tuition status for DC residents and $1.2 million for a citizens complaint review board for police misconduct charges. The District's budget includes $4.694 billion in general fund operating expenses and $676 million in enterprise funds. The House Appropriations Committee bill would increase funding for economic development, public education, and public safety activities, while reducing funds for the City Administrator's office. It also requires the city to maintain a $150 million reserve fund. The bill includes general provisions that were also in the Senate-passed bill. H.R. 2587, like the Senate bill, prohibits the use of District revenues for abortions except in certain cases. It also sets a deadline for removing inmates from a correctional center in Ohio. The House bill includes provisions not in the Senate bill, such as lifting the prohibition on federal funds for a needle exchange program to combat HIV/AIDS. The Committee bill includes provisions to allocate general fund surpluses for seasonal cash needs, repayment of cash borrowed from the Water and Sewer Fund, and reducing long-term bond indebtedness. This differs from the Senate bill which allows surplus funds above a 4% general fund surplus to be used for debt reduction or non-recurring expenses. The House passed H.R. 2587, allowing surplus funds above a 4% general fund surplus to be used for debt reduction or non-recurring expenses. During floor debate, seven amendments were considered, with three passed, two rejected, and two withdrawn. One withdrawn amendment aimed to penalize possession of tobacco by minors, while the other would have allowed funds for automated external defibrillators. An amendment to bar adoption by unmarried couples was rejected. The House rejected an amendment to bar adoption by unmarried couples and also rejected an amendment to prohibit the use of funds for gaining congressional voting representation for District residents. They passed an amendment extending the prohibition on using funds for a needle exchange program, despite arguments that it could reduce HIV infections from needle sharing among drug addicts. The House approved amendments for a sex offender registry and public disclosure of medical marijuana ballot results, but prohibited the District from legalizing or reducing penalties for possession. The Senate approved a bill providing FY2000 appropriations for the District of Columbia, which includes $430 million in federal payments. This is $189 million less than FY1999 but $19 million more than the Senate recommended. The bill also includes a reduction of $21 million for court operations. The FY2000 appropriations for the District of Columbia include a decrease in federal payments, with a reduction in court operations funding. The budget also allocates funds for various programs such as defender services, tuition support, foster care adoption incentives, and parole revocation services. Additionally, there is an increase in funds for economic development activities and general fund operating expenses. The FY1999 appropriations for the District of Columbia include an increase in funding for public education by $78 million and public safety activities by $30 million. The City Administrator's office funds are reduced to $12.8 million, and the city is required to maintain a $150 million reserve fund. General provisions in the conference committee bill prohibit the use of federal and District revenues for certain purposes. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act of 1992 would provide health care coverage and benefits to unmarried couples not related by blood. The conference committee-approved bill includes provisions to prohibit needle exchange programs and decriminalizing medical marijuana in the District of Columbia. It also includes funding for general operating expenses, special federal payments, court operations, and defender services. The conference committee bill for the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000 includes funding for court operations, defender services for indigent persons and abused children, offender supervision activities, a reserve of $150 million, and federal funds for innovative programs to increase adoption rates for children in foster care. President Clinton vetoed the bill due to objectionable provisions interfering with local decisions. The President vetoed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000 due to objectionable provisions, including funding restrictions on needle exchange programs, abortion, and marijuana use for medical purposes. He supported provisions for a tuition assistance program for District students. The House and Senate passed bills appropriating funds for the District of Columbia for FY2000, including provisions on abortion, medical marijuana, and needle exchange programs. The House bill did not include provisions for cellular towers in Rock Creek Park. The Senate version of H.R. 3064 includes provisions for expedited consideration of cellular towers in Rock Creek Park, opposed by the city for bypassing local zoning authority. The conference committee's version of H.R. 3064 for FY2000 includes social riders and prohibitions on the city's use of funds for certain purposes, such as defeating legislation or abortion services. The conference committee bill includes provisions to limit attorney compensation for special education cases, allow negotiation for new rates, and restrict the city's Corporation Counsel from assisting in court challenges for voting representation in Congress. The conferees agreed on provisions regarding private lawsuits, including pending suits on voting representation in Congress. A provision was included to prohibit the use of federal or District funds for a needle exchange program, with a possible compromise for private funding. The bill also includes provisions for expedited placement of cellular antennae in Rock Creek Park, addressing concerns of circumventing District government powers. The new provision clarifies that it does not affect existing local authority or environmental laws. The Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act for FY2000, attached to the bill during conference consideration, includes a 0.97% across-the-board cut for discretionary programs. This would result in a $4.2 million reduction in federal payments to the District of Columbia for FY2000. The bill also includes earmarked projects for the Community Development Block Grant Economic Development Initiative. The House and Senate approved the conference report on H.R. 3064, but President Clinton vetoed it on November 3, 1999 citing concerns about funding priorities. A new bill, H.R. 3194, was introduced and passed by both chambers on November 3, 1999. Conferees were appointed, and the bill originally focused on appropriations for the District of Columbia. On November 18, 1999, a conference committee attached four other appropriations bills to H.R. 3194, renaming it the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2000. The House and Senate approved the bill, which included $436 billion in special federal payments to the District of Columbia, and President Clinton signed it into law as P.L. 106-113 on November 29, 1999. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2000, signed into law as P.L. 106-113, includes provisions limiting public funds for abortion and prohibiting the implementation of certain initiatives in the District of Columbia. It also allows organizations receiving public funds to administer privately funded needle exchange programs to reduce the spread of HIV. P.L. 106-113 allows the mayor, superintendent of public schools, and control board to set new compensation rates for attorneys representing students in special education cases. The law also includes provisions on private lawsuits, voting representation, and funding for a needle exchange program. The controversy surrounding the creation of a needle exchange program in the District's appropriations bills for FY2000 touched on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning of illegal drugs. Proponents argue that such programs reduce the spread of HIV among drug users, while opponents believe it amounts to government endorsement of drug use. The debate also includes discussions on addressing public health concerns through drug treatment programs and the city's ability to implement such programs without congressional interference. The conference committee versions of H.R. 2587 and H.R. 3064 would have prohibited federal and District funds for a needle exchange program. The House passed a bill including this provision, while the Senate did not. The debate surrounding the issue involves home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug activities. The conference committee version of H.R. 3064 continued the prohibition against public funding for a needle exchange program. A compromise was reached to allow private funding for such programs but still prohibit the use of federal and District funds. Prevention Works is the only entity currently operating a privately funded needle exchange program. The House version of H.R. 3194 included a provision to prevent organizations receiving federal or District funds from using private funds for needle exchange programs. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act prohibits public funding for needle exchange programs but allows private funding. Controversy surrounds the medical marijuana initiative provision in the bills, which prohibits the implementation of Initiative 59 for medical marijuana use. The House Appropriations Committee version of H.R. 2587 initially prohibited federal funds for tallying the results of the ballot initiative, but later included a ban on federal and District funds for implementing any law legalizing marijuana. The conference committee version allowed tallying votes on medical marijuana but maintained penalties for marijuana use. Opponents of the conference committee provision argue that it undermines home rule by prohibiting the counting of a medical marijuana ballot initiative. However, a District Court ruling allowed the initiative to proceed, stating that Congress cannot stifle political speech. During the implementation of Initiative 59, Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval. Language prohibiting the initiative was included in various bills, but District officials tried unsuccessfully to remove a provision requiring a $150 million reserve fund in future budgets. The city argued that the reserve fund was unnecessary due to recent surpluses. The city is required to maintain a reserve fund due to recent surpluses. Legislation directs the use of general fund surplus for cash shortfalls, debt repayment, and one-time expenses. Additionally, a federal contribution of $17 million is included for in-state tuition for eligible residents. The initiative grants eligible residents of the District of Columbia in-state tuition status for college admissions in Maryland and Virginia. Congress completed action on the tuition assistance program, with enabling legislation signed by the President. The Senate passed H.R. 974, signed into law as P.L. 106-98. Congress expressed concerns about the District's court system management, criticizing fund allocation for lawyers representing abused children. H.R. 2587 included provisions for a GAO report on the justice system and transferring funds for legal representation. The Senate passed H.R. 974, signed into law as P.L. 106-98, which includes provisions for transferring funds for legal representation of abused and neglected children and indigent persons to a separate account to prevent misspending. Superior Court Administrator Ulysses Hammond resigned amidst scrutiny over court operations mismanagement and budget shortfalls. P.L. 106-113 prohibits the use of federal or District funds for abortion services except in specific cases. Since 1979, Congress has restricted the use of public funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia, with limitations based on endangerment of the mother's life or pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. The District can use its own funds for abortion services, but federal funds have been restricted to specific cases. President Reagan and President Bush both played a role in modifying the District of Columbia's appropriations act regarding abortion services. President Reagan pushed for the inclusion of District funds and the removal of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services. President Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue but eventually signed a bill prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases where the mother's life was endangered. The District successfully fought for the removal of limitations on funding for abortion services in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1994, which also reinstated rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. The District of Columbia's success in securing funding for abortion services was short-lived due to limitations imposed by the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1996. District officials hoped for the removal or modification of the abortion provision, but it remained unchanged in subsequent appropriations acts. President Clinton's veto did not lead to any changes, and the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services continued in subsequent legislation."
