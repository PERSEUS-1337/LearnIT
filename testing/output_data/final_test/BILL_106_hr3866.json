    "content": "The \"Annual Assay Commission Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress finds it important for citizens and buyers of US Mint products to know that gold, silver, and platinum coins are of proper size, weight, and purity. An assay commission performed these functions from 1792 to 1977, and since then, the US Mint has produced bullion coins of .999 fine silver, .9995 fine platinum, and gold of either .900 or .999 fine. Since 1982, the US Mint has produced millions of gold and silver commemorative coins, selling over $1 billion worth. Numismatists are involved in marketing coins, with an annual assay being important. An annual ceremony is needed to ensure coins meet statutory requirements and involve the public in the assay process. SEC. 3. ANNUAL ASSAY REQUIRED. Annual assay shall be held to test and examine the fineness and weight of coins in the presence of the Director of the Mint. An assay commission, appointed by the President, will conduct the annual assay. Members of the assay commission, appointed by the President, must be numismatists with no compensation, serving for one year and not eligible for re-appointment for at least 5 years. The assay commission, appointed by the President, meets annually on the second Wednesday in February at a U.S. mint location to carry out their duties. The meeting may continue if necessary. The assay commission, appointed by the President, meets annually on the second Wednesday in February at a U.S. mint location to carry out their duties. If a majority of members fail to attend a scheduled meeting, the Director of the Mint can call a meeting at another convenient time. The expenses of the commission will be paid by the Secretary from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Each superintendent of a U.S. mint will select and transfer coins according to regulations set by the Secretary of the Treasury. The United States mint selects and transfers specimen coins for assay without discrimination. For circulating coins, random samples are taken for testing based on specific quantities issued. For other coins, a similar process is followed for assay and testing. The United States mint selects specimen coins for assay without discrimination, ensuring random samples are taken for testing based on specific quantities issued. The United States mint selects random specimen coins for assay, ensuring unbiased testing. The coins are protected, sealed, and labeled with relevant details. If the coins meet standard fineness and weight regulations, the assay commission reports the trial as satisfactory. The assay commission certifies any coin deviations to the Director of the Mint and the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action. Specimen coins can be sent for laboratory testing to ensure compliance with legal requirements. The Director of the Mint is required to submit an annual report. The Director of the Mint prepares an annual report that includes the assay commission's report and laboratory test results, which is then submitted to Congress. The Director of the Mint may produce assay commission medals for members, with bronze copies available for sale to the public."
