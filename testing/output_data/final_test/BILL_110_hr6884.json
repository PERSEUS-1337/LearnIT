    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bone Marrow Failure Disease Research and Treatment Act of 2008\". The Congress finds that between 20,000 and 30,000 Americans are diagnosed annually with bone marrow failure diseases, which have a debilitating impact and no single cure. The prevalence of these diseases is expected to increase as the population ages, with evidence suggesting higher occurrence in minority populations. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute have conducted research on bone marrow failure diseases, particularly in Asian American and Hispanic/Latino populations. The National Marrow Donor Program Registry connects potential donors with those suffering from these conditions. A more comprehensive Federal effort is needed to find a cure for these disorders. The Federal Government should increase research support and collaborate with organizations to combat and cure acquired bone marrow failure diseases. The Federal Government is urged to enhance research efforts and work with organizations to address and find cures for acquired bone marrow failure diseases. A new National Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry is established under section 317T of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish the National Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry within 6 months of the enactment of the section, collecting data on these diseases and considering recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases. The National Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry aims to identify the incidence and prevalence of these diseases in the United States and collect data on individuals diagnosed with them, including age, race, geographic location, sex, family history, and other relevant characteristics. The Secretary will determine factors related to acquired bone marrow failure diseases, including genetic and environmental factors, treatment approaches, outcomes for individuals, and any other relevant factors. The Secretary will establish an Advisory Committee on Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases within 6 months of the enactment of this section. The committee will facilitate research into the causes and treatments of these diseases. The Advisory Committee on Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases will be appointed by the Secretary and include representatives from national patient advocacy organizations, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Advisory Committee on Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases will include representatives from national patient advocacy organizations, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, clinicians experienced in diagnosing and treating these diseases, epidemiologists with data registry experience, researchers in the field, and entities operating related programs and databases. The Advisory Committee on Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases will provide recommendations to the Secretary on the National Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry. The Secretary may award grants for the management and data collection of the registry. The Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry defines acquired bone marrow failure diseases as myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pure red cell aplasia, acute myeloid leukemia from MDS, or large granular lymphocytic leukemia. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. SEC. 4. Pilot studies through the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct pilot studies to identify environmental factors causing bone marrow diseases. Collaboration with the Radiation Injury Treatment Network is allowed for data augmentation and joint research projects. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for $1,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013. SEC. 5. Minority-focused programs on acquired bone marrow failure diseases are added to Title XVII of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish outreach programs for minority populations affected by bone marrow diseases, providing information on treatment options and clinical trials. The Secretary will establish outreach programs through the national minority health resource center and minority health consultants to connect Hispanic, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities with services for bone marrow diseases. The Secretary may collaborate with various organizations to disseminate information on treatment options for bone marrow diseases. Grants and cooperative agreements will be awarded for research on these diseases in a competitive manner. Research funded under this section will focus on factors affecting acquired bone marrow failure diseases in minority populations. $2,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013 for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to improve diagnostic practices and quality of care for patients with acquired bone marrow failure diseases. The term \"acquired bone marrow failure disease\" includes myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pure red cell aplasia, acute myeloid leukemia, and large granular lymphocytic leukemia."
