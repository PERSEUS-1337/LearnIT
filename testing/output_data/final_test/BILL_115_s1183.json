    "content": "The \"FDA Regulatory Efficiency Act\" establishes a Third-Party Quality System Assessment Program under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA shall establish a third-party quality system assessment program to accredit persons to assess requestor's quality systems for device safety and effectiveness. Accredited persons will certify that the quality system meets specified criteria for in-scope devices. The Secretary will rely on these certifications for safety determinations. The FDA will rely on third-party certifications to determine the safety and effectiveness of in-scope devices, instead of requiring specific submission requirements like premarket notification or Special PMA Supplement. Device-related changes refer to modifications made to devices that are substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The FDA will rely on third-party certifications for device-related changes, including manufacturing changes subject to a 30-day notice and changes qualifying for a Special PMA Supplement. Other changes related to devices or manufacturing processes will be determined by the Secretary as appropriate. The Secretary determines the scope of in-scope devices for certification under this section. In-scope devices are agreed upon by the requestor and accredited person. Premarket notification refers to section 510(k) notifications. Quality system refers to methods and controls for device design, manufacture, and servicing as described in section 520(f). Requestor is the device manufacturer seeking certification of their quality system. The term 'Special PMA Supplement' refers to a PMA supplement under specific regulations, while '30-day notice' refers to a notice described in a certain section. The accreditation process and qualifications for accreditation of persons under this section follow specific guidelines. Accredited parties are used to conduct assessments, with initiation of assessment services authorized on a specific date. Beginning after the final guidance is issued, accredited persons can assess quality systems for in-scope devices at the requestor's initiation. Compensation for these assessments is agreed upon between the accredited person and the device registrant. The accredited person assessing a requestor's quality system must be selected from a list published by the Secretary. The criteria for certification of a quality system will be specified by the Secretary in guidance issued under this section. The guidance under this paragraph will specify evaluative criteria for assessing and certifying a requestor's quality system for in-scope devices. It will also include criteria for accredited persons to apply for waivers and exemptions. The Secretary is required to issue draft guidance within 12 months of the FDA Regulatory Efficiency Act. The Regulatory Efficiency Act requires the Secretary to issue final guidance within 12 months of the draft guidance for assessing and certifying a requestor's quality system for in-scope devices. An accredited person must submit a summary of the assessment to the Secretary within 30 days, including certification that the requestor meets specified criteria. The Regulatory Efficiency Act mandates the Secretary to provide final guidance for certifying a requestor's quality system for in-scope devices within 12 months of draft guidance. An accredited person must submit an assessment summary to the Secretary within 30 days, certifying that the requestor meets specified criteria, including any waivers or exemptions applied. The Secretary must provide final guidance for certifying a requestor's quality system within 12 months of draft guidance. An accredited person must submit an assessment summary within 30 days, and the certification is deemed accepted by the Secretary on the 30th day. The Secretary may deem the certification provisional beyond the 30-day period. The Secretary may deem the certification provisional beyond the 30-day period, suspended pending further review, or cancelled based on additional information needed, unwarranted assessment, or other justifications deemed appropriate. Acceptance of certification is automatic after 30 days. After the Secretary's initial action on a certification, if deemed acceptable, written notice of acceptance is issued to the accredited person. Requestors or accredited persons can notify the Secretary for program evaluation purposes, including an annual summary report for device-related changes subject to premarket notification. The accredited person must submit an annual summary report to the Secretary describing changes made to in-scope devices and indicating effective dates of such changes. Requestors with certified quality systems must notify the Secretary of device-related changes without prior submission of a 30-day notice. The requestor must notify the Secretary of changes made to in-scope devices in their next periodic report, describing the changes and indicating effective dates. If device-related changes are made without a Special PMA Supplement, notification must be provided in the next periodic report under section 814.84(b) of title 21. The requestor must notify the Secretary of changes made to in-scope devices in their next periodic report under section 814.84(b) of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations. The notification should describe the changes, provide a full explanation of the basis for the changes, and indicate the effective dates. Information submitted will be used for program evaluation purposes. The certification for device-related changes remains valid for 2 years and can be renewed. It does not affect the need to comply with submission requirements for non-device-related changes. The Secretary retains the authority to conduct inspections. The Secretary may revoke a requestor's certification if their quality system no longer meets specified criteria. The requestor must be notified in writing within 10 business days of the revocation and must comply with submission requirements for any device-related changes. After revocation, the requestor can seek re-certification. The Secretary can revoke a requestor's certification if their quality system no longer meets criteria. The evaluation of the third-party quality system assessment program must be completed by January 31, 2021, based on information from device manufacturers. A report must be submitted within 1 year after the evaluation. The Secretary must issue a report on the evaluation findings within 1 year on the FDA website, including recommendations for the program's continuation and expansion. The program will cease to be effective on October 1, 2022. This section does not limit the Secretary's authority to request and review. The Secretary's authority to request and review assessments of certified requestors is not limited. Amendments are made to various sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include references to section 524B. Amendments are made to sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include references to section 524B and correct references to sections 510(k) and 502(t)."
