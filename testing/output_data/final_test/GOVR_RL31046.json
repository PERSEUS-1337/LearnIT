    "content": "The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2003 (H.R. 1646/S. 1401/S. 1803) authorized the Department of State's operations and programs through FY2003, establishing U.S. policy on various issues. Congressman Hyde introduced H.R. 1646 in 2001, which was passed by the House and Senate committees. The legislation was signed into law by President Bush in 2002. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2003 (P.L. 107-228) was signed into law by President Bush on September 30, 2002. This legislation authorizes foreign policy activities and programs for the State Department and related agencies, influencing U.S. foreign policy and setting spending ceilings for foreign assistance programs. The State Department appropriations legislation authorizes spending for various activities such as salaries, embassy operations, and foreign service benefits. Congress passed the first stand-alone foreign relations authorization bill since 1994 (P.L. 107-228), setting spending ceilings for foreign policy agencies. In the 107th Congress, legislation often addresses foreign policy issues like nonproliferation, human rights, and arms sales to Taiwan. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2002 and FY2003 included provisions for arms sales to Taiwan, allowing the President to sell Kidd-class destroyers. In the 107th Congress, legislation addressed arms sales to Taiwan, allowing the President to sell Kidd-class destroyers. Representative Brad Sherman proposed an amendment to treat Taiwan as the \"equivalent of a major non-NATO ally\" for defense transfers, providing tangible support and enhanced status for various assistance programs. In the defense area, expedited review in satellite licensing. Authority under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide defense assistance to Taiwan. Representative Gary Ackerman introduced an amendment to require annual consultations with Congress and Taiwan on defense articles and services. The Senate's Foreign Relations Authorization Act sought to require briefings every three months on discussions between executive agencies and Taiwan on arms sales. The Committee on Foreign Relations aimed to ensure consultations between the executive branch and Congress on arms sales to Taiwan. The Senate incorporated S. 1803 in H.R. 1646 and passed it, authorizing the sale of four Kidd-class destroyers to Taiwan. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003, enacted as P.L. 107-228, allows the Department of State and other agencies to detail employees to the American Institute in Taiwan. It also requires consultations with Congress every 180 days on U.S. security assistance to Taiwan and authorizes the sale of the destroyers. Section 326 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 has implications for assigning government officials to AIT, including active-duty military personnel for the first time since 1979. President Bush signed the bill into law on September 30, 2002, criticizing Section 1206 for potentially implying a change in the 'one China' policy of the United States, which remains unchanged. The President argued that this section interferes with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 and the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002 brought close coordination between the executive and legislative branches on arms sales to Taiwan, requiring detailed briefings on potential sales of defense articles or services to Taiwan. The Senate's Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2003 continues the requirement for briefings on arms sales to Taiwan. P.L. 107-228 includes provisions related to China, such as denying visas to those involved in coercive organ transplants. The \"Tibetan Policy Act of 2002\" supports Tibetan aspirations for identity preservation. The \"Tibetan Policy Act of 2002\" urges the U.S. government to facilitate dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama, monitor the progress of negotiations, and support economic projects on the Tibetan Plateau that benefit the Tibetan people. The \"Tibetan Policy Act of 2002\" includes provisions for Tibetan self-sufficiency, participation in project phases, use of Tibetan language, respect for culture and traditions, opening a U.S. consular office in Lhasa, Tibetan language training for U.S. foreign service officers, advocacy for the release of the 11th Panchen Lama and political prisoners in Tibet, establishment of a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Affairs, and funding for Ngawang Choephel Exchange Programs. The \"Tibetan Policy Act of 2002\" includes provisions for Tibetan self-sufficiency, participation in project phases, use of Tibetan language, respect for culture and traditions, opening a U.S. consular office in Lhasa, Tibetan language training for U.S. foreign service officers, advocacy for the release of the 11th Panchen Lama and political prisoners in Tibet, establishment of a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Affairs, and funding for Ngawang Choephel Exchange Programs. Additionally, there are separate entries for Tibet in various mandated reporting requirements, and provisions on Taiwan in the legislation that could impact U.S.-China relations. The Taiwan Relations Act allows for a State Department employee to be detailed to the American Institute in Taiwan, treats Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally for arms sales, requires consultation with Congress on Taiwan's defense requests, and calls for peaceful resolution of the Taiwan situation. It also mandates the display of the American flag at U.S. offices in Taiwan. The House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 1646 on May 4, 2001, with reporting requirements on Colombia and a visa prohibition for illegal armed groups. The bill was approved by the House on May 16, 2001, without changes to conditions on assistance to Colombia and neighboring countries under the Andean Regional Initiative. Required reports focus on Colombian opium elimination, Plan Colombia's impact on Ecuador, alternative development programs, and the transfer of counter-narcotics activities to Colombian nationals. The Senate approved H.R. 1646 on May 1, 2002, incorporating a security assistance measure. The conference report on H.R. 1646 filed on September 23, 2002, includes requirements for reports on Colombia, broadening to include the Department of Defense's activities. The conference report on H.R. 1646, approved by the House and Senate in September 2002, became law (P.L. 107-228) on September 30, 2002. It requires the Secretary of State to submit yearly reports on State or Defense Department activities in Colombia, focusing on alternative development, recovery, resettlement, judicial reform, the peace process, and human rights. The report on State or Defense Department activities in Colombia focuses on alternative development, recovery, resettlement, judicial reform, the peace process, and human rights. It also emphasizes the transfer of counter-narcotics activities from U.S. businesses to Colombian nationals, particularly the Colombian anti-narcotics police. The Secretary of State must provide yearly reports on these activities, including details on the businesses involved, payments made, and steps to address any delays. The State or Defense Department must provide reports on payments to businesses in Colombia, justifying agreements, assessing risks to personnel, and planning for the transfer of activities to Colombians. A comprehensive strategy for U.S. activities in Colombia, focusing on opium cultivation eradication and Plan Colombia's impact on neighboring countries, must be submitted within 150 days. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL31383(pdf) on the Andean Regional Initiative. Under Sections 489-490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the President was required to certify by March 1st that drug-producing and transit countries are cooperating with the United States in counter-narcotics efforts to avoid sanctions. Sanctions included withholding U.S. foreign assistance and opposition to loans from multilateral development banks if certification was not fully met. Congressional disapproval could also trigger sanctions, subject to presidential veto. Following the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the drug certification process was a subject of Congressional attention, particularly focused on Mexico. Despite complaints from various countries about the unilateral nature of the process, Mexico, in particular, expressed dissatisfaction even though it was regularly certified as cooperative. After the election of Vicente Fox as President of Mexico in July 2000, legislative measures were introduced to modify the drug certification requirements. These initiatives were discussed during meetings between President Bush and President Fox in 2001. In mid-February 2001, a meeting took place in Mexico, followed by another meeting in the United States in early September 2001. S. 1401, the Foreign Relations Authorization for FY2002-FY2003, proposed modifications to drug certification procedures for certain countries. The President would need to identify major drug-transit or drug-producing countries by October 1 each year, designating those that have failed to make substantial efforts in counter-narcotics. The House International Relations Committee reported out H.R. 1646 (Foreign Relations Authorization for FY2002-FY2003) on May 4, 2001, without any provisions on drug certification. The Senate approved H.R. 1646 on May 1, 2002, after incorporating the text of a Senate measure on security assistance (S. 1803) approved in December 2001. Congressional action on the Foreign Relations Authorization bills was pending, and the drug certification requirements were temporarily modified by enactment of the Foreign Operations. The drug certification requirements were temporarily modified by the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002 (H.R. 2506/P.L. 107-115), waiving the requirements for FY2002 and requiring the President to designate only countries that had failed to meet international counter-narcotics obligations. The bill for FY2003 would extend these modifications, while the House bill did not contain a similar provision. Section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization bill deals with International Drug Control Certification. Section 706 of the bill requires the President to report annually on major drug transit or producing countries that have failed to make substantial efforts in adhering to international counter-narcotics agreements. US assistance may be withheld unless deemed vital to national interest or if the country shows significant counter-narcotics efforts. Section 706 of the bill requires the President to report annually on major drug transit or producing countries that have failed to make substantial counter-narcotics efforts. The President may apply drug certification and sanctions procedures at his discretion. The Joint Explanatory Statement suggests directing U.S. Executive Directors to vote against loans for countries failing to qualify for assistance. This section aims to designate and withhold assistance from countries that have \"failed demonstrably\" in their counter-narcotics efforts. The President is required to report annually on countries that have failed to make substantial counter-narcotics efforts. He has the discretion to withhold assistance and apply sanctions against non-cooperating countries. The bill was approved by the House and Senate in 2002 and signed into law as P.L. 107-228. East Timor gained independence in 2002, with the US establishing diplomatic relations and providing economic aid. The US withdrew military personnel but continues to support the UN presence and assist in police training. The aid program focuses on developing East Timor's coffee industry. The US aid program for East Timor in FY2003 supports the country's coffee industry and includes democracy support for various sectors. It also includes a military aid program and measures outlined in the East Timor Transition to Independence Act of 2002, authorizing funding, promoting economic assistance, establishing broadcasting programs, and conducting a security assistance study. The Bush Administration has worked to secure these initiatives in Congress. The Bush Administration has pushed for a softening of congressional restrictions on U.S. contacts with the Indonesian military to cooperate against terrorism. $50 million has been allocated for training programs for the Indonesian police and military, with additional funds for counter-terrorism training. Congress has also removed restrictions on Indonesian military participation in the IMET program. The final bill from Senate conferees did not address international family planning issues. The Foreign Operations Appropriations FY2003 bill includes provisions on population assistance, the Mexico City policy, and U.S. contributions to the UN Population Fund. The debate on international family planning and abortion policies dates back to the 1960s when Congress prohibited the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related activities. The Mexico City policy, implemented in the 1980s, restricted funds for foreign NGOs involved in such activities. President Clinton reversed the position of his predecessors in 1993 by allowing restricted funds for foreign NGOs involved in promoting abortions. The House and Senate have had opposing views on the Mexico City issue in the past six years. In FY2000, Congress tied U.N. arrears payments to White House acceptance of modified Mexico City restrictions. President Clinton reluctantly agreed to the abortion restrictions to facilitate U.N. arrears payments, marking the first time Mexico City conditions were included in legislation signed by the President. The impact on USAID family planning programs in FY2000 was minimal, except for the loss of $12.5 million in population assistance as required by the legislation. President Bush reinstated the Mexico City Policy in 2001, prohibiting the use of taxpayer funds for abortions or promoting abortion. He maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance. President Bush maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance in 2001 to prevent abortion by providing quality family planning services. USAID issued policy guidelines to implement this directive, similar to those from the 1980s and 1990s under the Mexico City policy. Critics argue that the certification requirement will limit funding to experienced organizations, reducing healthcare for women in developing nations. Critics of the Mexico City policy argue that it denies funding to experienced family planning organizations, leading to cutbacks in services and potentially more abortions overseas. They also believe it undermines relations with foreign NGOs and imposes restrictions on how funds can be used, increasing USAID costs. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that it prevents organizations from using USAID funds for abortions or lobbying efforts, addressing the issue of fungibility. The Mexico City policy does not stop organizations from conducting family planning operations overseas but requires them to adhere to conditions or operate without U.S. Government support. The House International Relations Committee adopted an amendment to overturn the Mexico City policy, but it was later deleted from the bill by the full House. The Administration threatened to veto the bill if the committee language remained. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee did not address the international family planning issue when marking up the Foreign Relations Authorization bill. Legislation identical to H.R. 755 was reported favorably, but global warming provisions were dropped in conference to avoid controversy. Both H.R. 1646 and S. 1401 expressed a \"Sense of Congress Relating to Global Warming.\" The bills H.R. 1646 and S. 1401 expressed the sense of Congress regarding global warming, emphasizing the need for the US to lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and participating in international climate change negotiations. The wording of the bills varied slightly, but they shared similar concepts and goals. The Kyoto Protocol, completed in 1997, includes legally binding requirements for 38 industrialized nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. The United States, although engaged in international climate change negotiations, rejects the Kyoto Protocol and will not participate in it. The United States rejects the Kyoto Protocol due to concerns about developing countries and the economy, as stated in S.Res. 98. President Bush's objections to the protocol suggest a need for policy modification. P.L. 107-228 addresses the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa and globally, while H.R. 2069 focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The Global Access to HIV/AIDS Prevention, Awareness, Education, and Treatment Act of 2001 and The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2002 were passed. Provisions on U.S. international AIDS policy were dropped in conference. $1 million was authorized for HIV/AIDS scholarships under the State Department's Fulbright program. The Congress urged the United Nations to adopt an HIV/AIDS mitigation strategy for peacekeeping operations. The United Nations Security Council debated the adoption of an HIV/AIDS mitigation strategy for peacekeeping operations, prompted by concerns over the spread of HIV in conflict zones, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Some argued that peacekeepers could potentially spread the virus, while others, like India, expressed resentment at this notion. The United Nations Security Council discussed an HIV/AIDS mitigation strategy for peacekeeping operations due to concerns about the spread of HIV in conflict zones, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Some feared peacekeepers could spread the virus, while others highlighted the lack of resources for HIV testing in many countries. A report found that the UN has taken steps to reduce HIV spread during peacekeeping operations, but challenges remain. P.L. 107-228 includes provisions related to human rights issues, calling for increased funding for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and assigning individuals to embassies as political officers responsible for monitoring human rights. The provision in P.L. 107-228 includes funding for a Human Rights and Democracy Fund of $21.5 million for FY2003. This fund aims to support human rights defenders, assist victims of violations, respond to emergencies, and promote democracy. Additionally, it expands requirements for annual country reports on human rights to include actions taken by the United States to address such violations. The United States takes actions to address human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture. Reports must include information on compulsory recruitment of individuals under 18 by armed groups. An annual report to Congress describes any former IMET participant's involvement in human rights violations. Assistance programs for trafficking victims should support local NGOs. The House adopted an amendment to provide assistance for victims of trafficking and violence in other countries, including hotlines, shelters, and education. The amendment also addressed U.S. military and economic assistance to Lebanon, requiring certification for economic aid to Lebanon unless their armed forces are deployed to the border with Israel. The Government of Lebanon must extend control along the border with Israel to avoid a $10 million reduction in U.S. assistance programs. Assistance to Lebanon includes IMET grants and ESF funds for reconstruction, economic opportunity, democracy support, and environmental practices. The provision to reduce assistance stems from a political and security vacuum in southern Lebanon. The reduction in assistance to Lebanon is due to the political and security vacuum in south Lebanon since Israel withdrew from the \"security zone\" in 2000. Lebanon has not deployed forces to the international border with Israel, particularly in the disputed Shabaa farms area. The stalemate between Israel and Lebanon over this issue allows Hezbollah to maintain a military presence near the border. Supporters of Section 1224 in H.R. 1646 believe reducing assistance to Lebanon will pressure them to deploy troops to the border with Israel, potentially reducing Hizballah's influence and curbing military operations against Israel. Opponents argue that Syria's influence over Lebanese defense and foreign policy through stationed troops and intelligence agents hinders Lebanon's autonomy. Opponents of Section 1224 in H.R. 1646 argue that Lebanon's ability to fulfill conditions for presidential certification is impractical and terminating assistance programs could damage U.S.-Lebanese relations. The provision also reiterates the congressional position on moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move opposed by past administrations. The U.S. administrations have opposed unilateral action on the permanent status of Jerusalem, while Congress supports Israel's claim to the city. Sections 214(b), (c), and (d) of H.R. 1646 show congressional support for Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The 1993 Declaration of Principles stated that Jerusalem's status would be negotiated, and the U.S. has not recognized Israel's claim to all of Jerusalem. The authorization legislation H.R. 1646 and S. 1401 included measures such as \"right-sizing\" American embassies, private funding for educational exchange programs, promotion of minority hiring in the Department of State, and funding for a Middle East Radio Network. Congress expressed concern over management issues at the Department of State and required changes in the FY2001 Appropriations Act. The FY2001 Appropriations Act required the creation of a new Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources position, but this provision was not included in the final law. The State Department currently does not have a Deputy Secretary of State for Management. Recommendations were made in the late 1990s to \"right-size\" American overseas posts by maintaining an appropriate level of staff and expertise. Establishing an appropriate level of staff and expertise at overseas posts can reduce expenditures and improve U.S. effectiveness in foreign policy. H.R. 1646 requires the Secretary of State to create a task force on right-sizing overseas posts, with a preliminary report due within 120 days of enactment. The report must outline the task force's objectives, measures for achieving them, and the responsible Department official. The Secretary of State is required to establish a task force on right-sizing overseas posts, with progress reports to be submitted to Congress every six months in 2003. An interagency working group will also be formed to develop plans for right-sizing U.S. overseas presence, with similar reporting requirements. Section 302 of S. 1401 mandates the establishment of internal and interagency task forces to review overseas presence issues and report findings. Additionally, the State Department requested machine-readable visa fees to be a permanent appropriation in its FY2002 budget. The State Department requested machine-readable visa fees to become a permanent appropriation in its budget. The fees amounted to $327.9 million in FY2000, $395.1 million in FY2001, $478.9 million in FY2002, and a request for $642.7 million in FY2003. Legislation authorized these fees through FY2003, with a cap of $460 million for that year. Additionally, there have been concerns about minority recruitment at the State Department, particularly in the Foreign Service, leading to the establishment of a recruitment program in 1980. In response to concerns about minority recruitment at the State Department, Congress allocated funds for a recruitment program in 1980. Subsequent legislation provided funding for partnerships with colleges to promote minority hiring, with Secretary of State Powell advocating for increased diversity in the Foreign Service. Congressional appropriations in FY2003 included $2 million for minority recruitment and required reporting on minority participation in the Foreign Service exam and hiring. The legislation includes provisions for minority recruitment efforts in the State Department, such as establishing a database to report on minority hiring, earmarking funds for minority hiring, and expanding recruitment to historically Black colleges and Hispanic-serving institutions. Secretary of State Colin Powell advocated for increased diversity in the Foreign Service. Colin Powell emphasized the importance of cultural exchanges in foreign policy, especially for nations transitioning to democracies like Russia. Legislation authorized funding for American Corners in Russia to provide information about U.S. history, government, and values. The bill also highlighted the decline in funding for international educational exchanges and encouraged private sector involvement. Section 402 authorizes the establishment of private, nonprofit organizations to promote international cultural, arts, and educational exchanges with funding from U.S. corporations and private sector entities. The Secretary of State can solicit funds, appoint a board of directors, and recommend specific programs for the entity. Each organization must report annually to Congress and undergo independent financial audits. This section did not pass. Section 223 of S. 1401 proposes creating an advisory committee on cultural diplomacy to develop initiatives for public diplomacy expansion. The final law includes Section 224 which establishes a temporary advisory committee on cultural diplomacy to explore public-private partnerships for expanded public diplomacy activities. It also authorizes $20 million for the Middle East Radio Network of VOA in addition to the regular broadcasting operations funding. Congress had previously authorized Radio Free Iran and Radio Free Iraq, showing increasing interest in broadcasting to the Middle East. In P.L. 105-277, Congress authorized Radio Free Iran and Radio Free Iraq. VOA allocated $6 million for Arabic programming in 2001. After September 11th, Congress provided $12.25 million in supplemental funding for VOA broadcasts in Arabic, Farsi, Pashto, Dari, and Urdu, as well as for RFE/RL broadcasts in various languages. P.L. 107-148 established Radio Free Afghanistan. P.L. 107-228 authorized appropriations for FY2003 for U.S. contributions to international organizations, including funding for peacekeeping. The measure amended the cap on the U.S. share of U.N. peacekeeping contributions for calendar years 2001-2004, calling for payment at the beginning of each year. It supported retaining the 25% U.S. assessment for the IAEA but capped the U.S. share for the U.N. regular budget at 22%. President Bush announced the U.S. return to UNESCO in 2002, with renewed participation expected in FY2004. P.L. 107-228 expressed Congress's support for the President submitting a report on the merits and costs of U.S. return to UNESCO. H.R. 1646 authorized appropriations for U.S. contributions to international organizations, including $944.067 million for assessed contributions, $844.139 million for peacekeeping operations, and $186 million for voluntary contributions. The House funded international organizations at the level requested by the Bush Administration, with additional funding for UNICEF and to cover the U.S. return to UNESCO. Representative Leach sponsored an amendment for funding to allow the U.S. to return to UNESCO, which was adopted by the Committee. The Committee report (H.Rept. 107-57) recommended rejoining UNESCO, despite opposition from some members. Representative Tancredo's amendment to remove funding for UNESCO was rejected. Representative Leach argued for UNESCO's credibility. The U.S. currently contributes $2-3 million annually to UNESCO for worthwhile projects. If the U.S. rejoins, it would have to fund all projects. For more information on UNESCO, refer to CRS Report RL30985(pdf), UNESCO Membership: Issues for Congress. The House amended conditions for releasing U.S. arrears to international organizations, increasing the peacekeeping assessment level. Conferees agreed on a plan to pay the final installment of arrears. The U.S. peacekeeping assessment level was raised to 28.15% with the enactment of P.L. 107-46 (S. 248), allowing payment of arrears. Additional conditions were placed on releasing the final installment of arrears, including regaining a seat on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and submitting a detailed accounting of contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations. The Security Assistance Act of 2002, contained in P.L. 107-228, includes various provisions such as arms control agreements, military assistance, nonproliferation efforts, and expedited munitions licensing. Title XII authorizes appropriations for military assistance. Title XII of P.L. 107-228 authorizes appropriations for security assistance programs, including Foreign Military Sales and International Military Education and Training. Technical changes to existing legislation and provisions for reporting requirements are detailed, along with authorization for transferring naval vessels in Title XVII and funding guidance for expediting munitions licensing in Title XIV. (For funding levels, see CRS Report RL31311). Concern about weapons of mass destruction is also addressed. The Security Assistance Act provides increased financial support for export control assistance and the International Atomic Energy Agency, with provisions for amending existing legislation related to Iran and North Korea, as well as reporting requirements on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Subtitle A under Title XIII of H.R. 1646, as enacted, includes provisions for weapons of mass destruction detection equipment for export control services. P.L. 107-228 also authorizes an additional $10 million for the IAEA's program to secure radioactive sources. Subtitles B and C, regarding Russian debt reduction and nonproliferation assistance coordination, were Senate initiatives not in the House version. Subtitle D, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2002, was a House initiative. The Russian Federation Debt for Nonproliferation Act of 2002, a House initiative, aims to use a portion of Russia's foreign debt for nonproliferation programs. The program authorizes the President to enter into a Nonproliferation Investment Agreement to ensure funds are used for approved projects and not diverted. The Russian Federation Debt for Nonproliferation Act of 2002 aims to use a portion of Russia's foreign debt for nonproliferation programs. The bill includes provisions to ensure funds are spent in Russia, address intellectual property rights issues, and require an annual certification of progress in reducing proliferation. Introduced by Senator Biden and Rep. Ellen Tauscher, the bill also includes a provision for a \"Center for Independent Press and the Rule of Law.\" The Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2002, similar to previous bills, aims to restrict U.S. contributions to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund for use in Iran. The amendment to Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act would apply restrictions if IAEA programs in Iran conflict with U.S. nuclear nonproliferation goals. The Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2002 aims to restrict U.S. contributions to IAEA programs in Iran that are inconsistent with U.S. nuclear nonproliferation goals. The bill requires assessments of IAEA projects, annual reviews, and detailed reports on Iran's Bushehr reactor project and IAEA technical assistance. The Security Assistance Act also amends the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 to specify report content and clarify sanctions for transferring conventional weapons. The IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund provided over $1.5 million in assistance to Iran's civilian nuclear power program, including nuclear safety training for the Bushehr reactor. U.S. voluntary contributions make up almost 27% of the Fund, with assessed contributions providing 25% of the IAEA's total budget. The U.S. has a history of withholding funding for projects in Cuba. Supporters of the legislation believe that cutting U.S. voluntary contributions would not hinder the IAEA's work in Iran. The United States debates reducing funding for IAEA assistance to Iran's Bushehr nuclear project. Critics fear it may limit monitoring of the project for nuclear weapons programs, while others argue for support based on Iran's compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Legislation allows for a waiver of funding reduction under certain conditions. Nuclear and missile proliferation in South Asia remains a concern despite US efforts to build cooperative relations with India and Pakistan. Legislation emphasizes the importance of maintaining nonproliferation objectives in the region while upholding US obligations under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The legislation emphasizes the need to prevent nuclear and missile proliferation in South Asia, urging the US to work with India and Pakistan to secure nuclear devices by September 2003. This effort does not imply recognition of either country as a nuclear weapon state. The President must report on progress by March 1, 2003. The legislation aims to prevent nuclear and missile proliferation in South Asia by working with India and Pakistan to secure nuclear devices by September 2003. Authorization of State Department appropriations is required every two years, typically passed in the first year of a new Congress for the following even/odd year authority. Various fiscal year appropriations acts have been passed in the past to fund the State Department. The State Department authorization legislation has been passed in various fiscal year appropriations acts, including P.L. 104-208, P.L. 105-277, P.L. 106-113, and P.L. 107-228. Authorization for FY2003 was signed in September 2002, with funding up to $900 million authorized through FY2004."
