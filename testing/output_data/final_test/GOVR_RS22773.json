    "content": "The federal restrictions on state and local sanctuary policies are outlined in PRWORA \u00a7 434 and IIRIRA \u00a7 642. PRWORA prohibits any limitations on sharing immigration status information with federal authorities, while IIRIRA extends this to all levels of government. The City of New York challenged federal provisions on sharing immigration status information. The mayor issued an Executive Order conflicting with federal laws. The Court of Appeals ruled that the federal laws do not violate the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine. The Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine prohibits the federal government from compelling states to enact specific regulatory standards or participate in enforcing federal law. While Congress may not directly require states to share immigration status information, preventing states from blocking their agents from sharing existing information with federal authorities may be allowed. Some localities have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, but the exact number is unclear. In 2006, Congress mandated the Office of the Inspector General to oversee this issue. In 2006, Congress required the Office of the Inspector General to study whether states and localities receiving federal compensation for incarcerating criminal aliens were cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The OIG found only two jurisdictions with official \"sanctuary\" policies: the State of Oregon and the City and County of San Francisco. The OIG report identified two jurisdictions with official sanctuary policies, but concluded that neither violated federal law. The report did not provide a comprehensive estimate of jurisdictions violating IIRIRA \u00a7 642. The report did not identify if jurisdictions receiving less than $1 million were violating federal law under IIRIRA \u00a7 642. Some states and localities have implemented a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach regarding immigration status, which may result in agencies lacking information to share with federal authorities. In the 110th Congress, several bills were introduced related to this issue. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to limit sanctuary policies and increase sharing of immigration information by state and local authorities. Some proposals aimed to mandate reporting of immigration information to the Secretary of Homeland Security and tie compliance to funding under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Other proposals required law enforcement to provide information on apprehended aliens violating U.S. immigration laws and offered grants to agencies assisting in enforcement. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to modify requirements on states and localities regarding sharing immigration-related information with the federal government. H.R. 150 and S. 95 proposed withholding funds from states unless they reported certain immigration-related information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to modify requirements on states and localities regarding sharing immigration-related information with the federal government. S. 95, introduced by Senator David Vitter, would prohibit funds for the Community Oriented Policing Services Program from being used against IIRIRA \u00a7 642. H.R. 264, the Save America Comprehensive Immigration Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, would repeal IIRIRA \u00a7 642 and PRWORA \u00a7 434, allowing states and localities to restrict sharing immigration-related information with federal authorities."
