    "content": "Semantic structure extraction for spreadsheets involves detecting table regions, recognizing structural components, and classifying cell types. Automatic extraction is crucial for transforming data from various table structures into a standard schema for data analysis and knowledge discovery. A novel learning-based framework has been developed to capture spatial correlations and semantics in spreadsheets, utilizing a multi-task approach, recent language model advancements, and a large human-labeled dataset. Evaluation shows the effectiveness of this framework. The proposed multi-task framework for semantic structure extraction in spreadsheets outperforms training tasks separately. Spreadsheets lack enforced syntax or standards, requiring manual data transformation for analysis. Techniques for automated data transformation are desired, involving three tasks: detecting table regions, recognizing components, and classifying cell types. The proposed multi-task framework for semantic structure extraction in spreadsheets addresses challenges in table detection, component recognition, and cell type classification. The tasks are interdependent, with opportunities for leveraging outcomes from prior tasks to improve current task performance. The framework aims to solve these tasks jointly, with a focus on preventing error propagation and utilizing additional cues from other tasks. The study introduces a multi-task framework for extracting spreadsheet table structures, including table detection, component recognition, and cell type classification. They create a labeled dataset and propose a featurization scheme for model training. The multi-task framework outperforms training tasks separately, with cell type classification categorizing cells into types like value, value name, index, and index name. The text discusses the use of a multi-task framework for extracting spreadsheet table structures, including table detection, component recognition, and cell type classification. It introduces a labeled dataset called SemanticSheet and proposes a featurization scheme for model training. The dataset contains 4,290,022 sheets with diverse table structures. The text introduces the SemanticSheet dataset for semantic table structure extraction, containing tables with annotated bounding boxes and structural component annotations. It emphasizes the importance of labeling quality and effective cell features, leveraging hand-crafted features and learning-based representations. The text introduces the SemanticSheet dataset for semantic table structure extraction, emphasizing the importance of effective cell features. A model incorporating BERT for semantic embeddings and a point-wise CNN for complexity control is proposed for multi-task learning in table semantic structure extraction. The framework utilizes a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) backbone for learning spatial correlations between cells and shared feature representations for multi-task learning. Relationships in coarse-to-fine tasks are leveraged by incorporating the results of table detection and component recognition as additional feature channels. ResNets are used as the backbone, excluding pooling layers to maintain cell-level precision. CNNs for structural component recognition and cell type classification consist of five convolutional layers. The study utilizes a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) backbone for multi-task learning, incorporating table detection, component recognition, and cell type classification. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% test sets, with joint training using combined loss functions. Evaluation includes Error-of-Boundary (EoB) metric for table detection, accuracy for header separation lines, and average F1 for predictions. Comparison with Mask RCNN shows improvements, and a comparison between single-task and multi-task training is conducted. Our method outperforms all baselines in table detection evaluation. The multi-task approach shows improvement over the single-task version, indicating the benefit of incorporating other tasks. Component recognition accuracy also sees gains with the multi-task framework. Cell type classification results demonstrate a significant improvement over Mask R-CNN. The joint framework enhances value name, index, and index name predictions. An experiment evaluates the effectiveness of language models in the multi-task framework. By incorporating semantic features extracted by BERT, the proposed model achieves higher accuracy in all tasks, with a 6.4% F1 gain for index name prediction and a 5.7% F1 gain for value name prediction."
