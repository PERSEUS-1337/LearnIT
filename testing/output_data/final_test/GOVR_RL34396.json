    "content": "The America COMPETES Act addresses concerns about insufficient investment in science and engineering research, STEM education, and workforce development. It authorizes funding increases for federal agencies like NSF, NIST, and DOE, and establishes new STEM education programs. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for federal agencies like NSF, NIST, and DOE, and establishes new STEM education programs. Funding for new programs will depend on subsequent appropriations, and increased authorization levels may not guarantee increased funding. The act's impact on programs is discussed in relation to the President's FY2009 budget submission. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding for NIST's Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) and Industrial Technology Services (ITS) programs. The ITS includes the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and the Technology Innovation Program (TIP). The act authorizes $541.9 million for STRS and $131.5 million for TIP in FY2009. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget proposed $535.0 million for STRS and zero for TIP. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget proposed eliminating TIP, with zero funding, and reducing MEP funding. The DOE's mission is to advance national security, promote innovation, and support environmental cleanup. The DOE is a major supporter of basic physical sciences research, conducted at national laboratories and universities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes the establishment of ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes within DOE. The DOE's FY2009 budget did not propose funding for ARPA-E or Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. Instead, the Bush Administration suggested establishing Energy Frontier Research Centers at universities or nonprofit organizations. Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) are collaborations funded by the DOE to integrate basic and applied research, with a focus on transformative research. The FY2009 budget requested approximately $100.0 million for EFRCs, with initial five-year awards ranging from $2.0-5.0 million annually per center. Additionally, the DOE authorized the establishment of STEM education programs at the K-12 and post-secondary levels. The DOE established STEM education programs at K-12 and post-secondary levels, including specialty high schools, summer internships, and teacher institutes. A new position was created to oversee STEM programs, along with a fund for STEM education funded by 0.3% of DOE's budget. The FY2009 DOE budget submission referenced the America COMPETES Act but did not specify which educational programs it was responding to. The Office of Nuclear Energy planned to allocate 20% of its research funds for university research to support U.S. nuclear science and engineering education. The Office of Science mentioned the America COMPETES Act in relation to STEM educational programs but did not clarify if they were new initiatives or modifications to existing programs. The Early Career Awards were not mentioned by the DOE Office of Science. The Bush Administration identified DOE STEM education programs and the early career researcher program in the America COMPETES Act as included in the FY2009 budget request. Programs like Summer Institutes and Early Career Awards for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Researchers were linked to existing DOE programs. The DOE requested funding for various fellowship programs and institutes in FY2009, including the Early Career Awards program and the PACE fellowships. The requested funding amounts were lower than the authorized levels in the America COMPETES Act. In FY2009, the DOE requested $19 million for PACE fellowships, exceeding the authorized level of $12 million in the America COMPETES Act. The programs have additional requirements, such as prioritizing teachers from various school districts and underrepresented groups. The budget request did not mention establishing a DOE STEM Education fund or appointing a DOE STEM education program director. The ED's mission is to promote student achievement and global competitiveness through educational excellence and equal access. The ED promotes global competitiveness through educational excellence and equal access. It establishes policies and distributes federal financial aid for education. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs, including Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow and Math Now. Funding was appropriated for the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program in FY2008 to support higher education programs in STEM and foreign languages. The FY2009 ED budget proposed eliminating certain programs. The FY2009 ED budget proposed eliminating a program for teacher certification, redirecting funds to the America COMPETES Act's Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Program. This new direction aimed to increase access to classes and tests for low-income students, prepare teachers in high-need schools, and involve non-federal organizations in funding. The America COMPETES Act authorized $75.0 million for this program in FY2009, with a budget request of $70.0 million. The ED FY2009 budget proposed funding Math Now at $95 million, supporting previously existing API activities with $22 million and America COMPETES Act activities with $47 million. The Advancing America Through Foreign Language Partnership Program funds partnerships between institutions for postsecondary language learning, with a budget request of $24 million for new awards in languages like Arabic and Chinese. No funding was mentioned for the Summer Term Education Program or P-16 Alignment in the ED budget summary. The NSF supports science and engineering through funding basic research and state-of-the-art tools primarily at U.S. colleges and universities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes $5,742.0 million for NSF's research and related activities, with a requested funding of $5,594.0 million in the President's FY2009 budget. Some programs may not be funded as they are below the specified organizational level in budget documents. In the NSF's FY2009 budget request, funding levels for various programs such as EPSCoR and IGERT were below authorized amounts. The President's budget also requested lower funding for EHR programs compared to the America COMPETES Act authorization. Programs like the Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Mathematics and Science were funded well below authorized levels. The NSF's FY2009 budget request proposed funding levels below authorized amounts for programs like EPSCoR and IGERT, as well as EHR programs. The Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Mathematics and Science Education Partnership were also funded below authorized levels. The Graduate Research Fellowship program received more funding than authorized. The Bush Administration did not request funding for new NSF programs authorized in the America COMPETES Act. The 110th Congress responded by developing a budget resolution setting spending amounts for each budget category. The House and Senate of the 110th Congress approved the Concurrent Budget Resolution for 2009, supporting increased funding for education, innovation, and economic growth. The resolution allocated funds for Function 250 (General Science, Space and Technology) and other functions to maintain the nation's leadership in these areas. The Concurrent Budget Resolution for 2009 allocated increased funding for education, innovation, and economic growth. Function 250 (General Science, Space and Technology) and other functions received additional funding for scientific research and education. The resolution also included allocations to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, which then distributed funds among their subcommittees. The federal agencies under the America COMPETES Act programs are divided among at least three Appropriations subcommittees. During the 110th Congress FY2009 appropriations process, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported on funding for various agencies including NSF, NIST, NASA, and OSTP. Both committees included funding for TIP and MEP, with TIP receiving half of the authorized amount and MEP close to the authorized funding. The House and Senate committees reported funding levels for various agencies during the 110th Congress FY2009 appropriations process. TIP received half of the authorized amount, while MEP was close to its authorized funding. The DOE Office of Science authorized level is $5.2 billion, with the House committee approving $4.9 billion and the Senate committee $4.6 billion. The House committee recommended $15 million for ARPA-E, while the Senate committee did not provide any funding. The Department of Education saw varying funding levels approved by the Senate and House committees for different programs. The Senate and House committees recommended funding levels for various agencies during the 110th Congress FY2009 appropriations process. The House subcommittee did not provide funding for two new programs authorized by the America COMPETES Act, citing concerns about low-income schools. Both committees recommended funding the National Science Foundation at the level requested by the Bush Administration. The 110th Congress funded federal government programs related to the America COMPETES Act through an interim continuing resolution. The 111th Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) in 2009, providing funding for NIST, NSF, ARPA-E, and DOE's Office of Science. NIST received funding for Scientific and Technical Research and Services ($220 million) and Construction of Research Facilities ($360 million), while DOE's Office of Science was funded at $1,600 million. No funding was provided for the MEP or TIP programs. Funding was provided for various programs under the America COMPETES Act in 2009. This included funding for NSF's Research and Related Directorate, Education and Human Resources Directorate, and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction. Congress also allocated funds for programs such as Major Research Instrumentation, Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, Math and Science Partnerships, and Professional Science Master's Programs. Additionally, an extension of the continuing resolution was signed into law on March 6, 2009. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) was signed into law on March 6, 2009, extending funding for America COMPETES Act programs until March 11, 2009. The bill was passed by the House on February 25, 2009, and by the Senate on March 10, 2009. President Obama signed the bill on March 11, 2009. The act provided funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, including STRS funding of $472.0 million. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) provided funding for various programs. The Department of Energy received $4.8 billion, with ARPA-E receiving $15 million. The Department of Education received $2 million for a new program. Funding for construction and maintenance was $172.0 million, with TIP and MEP receiving $65.0 million and $110.0 million respectively. The House committee did not provide funding for a new Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) program, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $43.5 million. National Science Foundation NSF funding is less than recommended by both committees. Funding for the Experimental Programs to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) is $133.0 million, the same as reported by the House Committee on Appropriations. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program would receive $55.0 million, the same as recommended by the Senate committee. Table 1 summarizes the congressional activities for each of the America COMPETES Act programs. The funding for America COMPETES Act programs varied, with some funded at authorized levels while others were not. ARPA-E received $415.0 million in FY2009, exceeding the authorized amount. Maintaining funding levels at authorization levels in the future may pose challenges for research and education programs. The America COMPETES Act programs' funding varied, with some funded at authorized levels while others were not. The budget proposed by the Bush Administration at DOE did not align with the Act, making it difficult to determine program status. The Obama Administration may provide clarity by aligning existing programs with the Act. Currently, there is insufficient evidence that new programs under the Act are funded. The FY2009 appropriations funded various programs for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Researchers, including the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. Federal agencies face challenges in obligating funds quickly, especially those provided through the ARRA. The DOE's Office of Science plans to take specific actions with ARRA funds. The Director of the Office of Science (SC) plans to use ARRA funds for facility construction, operations/infrastructure, research programs, and computing support. This includes accelerating ongoing construction projects, updating laboratory infrastructure, supporting research programs, and enhancing computing capabilities. The Office of Science plans to use ARRA funds for facility construction, operations, research programs, and computing support. A program to support graduate students and early career scientists is under discussion within DOE. ARPA-E faces challenges as a new organization without a director or staff. The Obama Administration has set up a website, http://www.recovery.gov, for agencies to track ARRA funds. NSF and NIST are making plans to allocate new awards, while states must improve data collection for additional funding. ARPA-E lacks a director and staff, posing challenges for the organization. NIST, DOE, and NSF have recovery websites for tracking ARRA funds."
