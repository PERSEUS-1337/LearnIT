    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Innovation Competitiveness Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that the United States must lead in creating new technologies and skilled workforce for industrial progress. Research, innovation, and human capital are key strengths to maintain America's scientific and technological capabilities amidst global competition. The US remains attractive for innovating talent and entrepreneurial activity. The United States must lead in creating new technologies and skilled workforce for industrial progress. Research, innovation, and human capital are key strengths to maintain America's scientific and technological capabilities amidst global competition. Technology transfer of publicly funded research is critical for optimizing taxpayer investment. Active marketing and educational campaigns by Federal agencies on research and development activities are important. Development activities are crucial for matching inventions with commercial enterprises and facilitating rapid dissemination of new invention applications. Technology transfer has evolved into a broad activity with multiple stakeholders and users, necessitating the aggregation of resources into a single electronic format to enhance access, administration, education, monitoring, and efficiency within the government and stimulate interaction from the private sector. The 2003 Department of Commerce survey found that only 34% of Federal laboratories had industrial advisory committees, which can improve communication and maximize the impact of research. As the innovation process evolves in a competitive global arena, it is important to identify metrics to measure program effectiveness. Identifying metrics to quantify program effectiveness is increasingly important, considering a wide range of steps in a complex process and unique characteristics of industries and licensing institutions. Local and regional impacts from Federal research activities stimulate economies and improve education. State governments are active in providing support. State governments play a significant role in supporting Federal research and development activities, with half of all States receiving substantial funding annually. There is a need for a comprehensive data system to provide detailed information on Federal research investments, enabling State and local officials to identify new collaboration opportunities. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES.\" is a section related to outreach activities in a document or legislation. The Technology Transfer Director within the Department of Commerce oversees technology transfer activities, coordinates with the Interagency Working Group, technology partnership ombudsmen, and ensures effective coordination of outreach activities. The Technology Transfer Director in the Department of Commerce oversees activities at National Laboratories and research facilities, coordinates technology transfer practices, and disseminates information about opportunities. The Technology Transfer Director oversees technology transfer activities, coordinates procedures, and disseminates information on opportunities for technology transfer. The Director also reviews and modifies procedures to better achieve the goals of the section. SEC. 4. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.

The Director will also work with industry, trade associations, and professional societies to develop research tools and practices. The Director will collaborate with industry, trade associations, and professional societies to conduct experimentation, analysis, testing, verification, and demonstration of improved tools and practices for technology transfer. This includes identifying best practices and metrics to quantify effectiveness, considering differences in technology, market dynamics, intellectual property, and mission variations between licensing institutions. Additionally, there will be a focus on developing reliable data to improve workforce education and address critical workforce issues, such as the availability of scientists, engineers, and skilled employees. The Director will oversee a dissemination and technical assistance program to assist with the immediate dissemination and implementation of practices, standards, and codes developed by the Technology Administration. The Director will submit reports to the Senate and House committees detailing proposed studies and activities within 120 days of the Act's enactment. Annual progress reports summarizing Technology Administration activities will be submitted 12 months after the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. SEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCACY AND ASSISTANCE. The Secretary designates a small business advocate to increase small business participation in procurement, research, and technology activities at National Laboratories. The advocate reports on small business involvement and provides training and information on how to participate effectively. The small business advocate is designated to increase participation in procurement, research, and technology activities at National Laboratories. This includes submitting effective proposals, resolving disputes related to intellectual property rights, raising awareness of small business capabilities, and establishing guidelines for a small business program under this Act. SEC. 6. COORDINATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH STATES. The Secretary will establish a State and Industry Task Force to identify areas where the Federal government can support State research and development efforts. The Task Force will have 9-15 members from various sectors appointed by the Secretary. The State and Industry Task Force will have members serving 3-year terms, with staggered appointments for continuity. The Task Force will elect a chairperson and Federal agencies must cooperate by providing necessary information. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.
