    "content": "The OASDI program provides monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their family members. Revenues from payroll taxes and taxation of benefits fund these benefits, which are a significant source of income for many recipients. Annual surpluses are invested in government bonds to earn interest. The OASDI Trust Funds invest in nonmarketable U.S. government securities to earn interest, providing a third source of revenue. The trust funds had $2.9 trillion in assets at the beginning of 2018 and are managed by the Board of Trustees according to the Social Security Act. They only invest in special, nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities, following current law restrictions. Investing in equities would deviate from their current investment practice. Investing in equities by purchasing company stock in the open market would deviate from the OASDI Trust Funds' current investment practice of investing in nonmarketable U.S. government securities. This expansion of investment options could lead to government ownership and influence on private companies, although it may never come to pass. Policymakers may be motivated by the historically higher returns on equity investment to consider changes to the Trust Funds' investment options and practices. The Social Security Act establishes the Board of Trustees of the OASDI Trust Funds, with the Secretary of the Treasury as the managing trustee, outlining duties and instructions for investment activities. The managing trustee of the OASDI Trust Funds is directed to invest surplus funds in interest-bearing securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, known as special issues. These securities are available for investment to meet the trust funds' needs, with fixed maturity dates. Excess revenues from these investments are deposited into the General Fund for other government spending needs, tax reductions, or debt reduction. The managing trustee invests surplus funds in special issues with fixed maturity dates. The interest rate earned is based on the average market yield on government securities due at least four years in the future. Special issues can be redeemed at any time for par value, ensuring they cannot lose value. Redemption of non-special issues may occur at the prevailing market rate. The trust funds' value is not negatively affected by early redemption of special issues. The managing trustee may purchase non-special issues if deemed in the public interest. The 1957-1959 Advisory Council on Social Security Financing recommended amending the Social Security Act to allow investment in public issues only when they provide a yield equal to or greater than special issues. The Act does not specify how trust funds' investments should be redeemed, but trustees have adopted policies to address this. Special issues are redeemed before maturity only when necessary. The redemption of special issues in the OASDI Trust Funds follows specific policies to prevent low-yield issues from being redeemed and reinvested at higher rates. Actuarial Note Number 142 outlines the investment principles, emphasizing the importance of nonintervention in the trust funds' finances. The 1957-1959 Advisory Council highlighted the need for investments to yield equal to or greater than special issues. The Council on Social Security Financing recommends that trust fund investments should be limited to US Government obligations to avoid interference with the private economy or State affairs. Investing in private corporations or State/local government securities could have negative financial and political consequences for the social security system. The principle of nonintervention is upheld through the use of special issue securities as the primary investment mechanism for the OASDI Trust Funds. The OASDI Trust Funds primarily invest in U.S. government securities to avoid market disruptions and interference with the Federal Reserve. These securities offer high protection as they are backed by the government's full faith and credit. Trust fund investment policies aim to operate neutrally, earning a risk-free return. The trust funds' investment policies aim for neutrality, ensuring they neither advantage nor disadvantage the funds compared to other Federal accounts. This principle is required by law and administrative policies to maintain similar investment results to private sector investors in Federal securities. The trust funds' investment policies aim for neutrality by only redeeming special issues when needed and ensuring even maturities. Active management is unnecessary due to Social Security Act parameters and limited investment options. Note 142 explains the policy of early redemption and spreading maturities to neutralize liquidity advantages. The trust funds' investment policies prioritize security and neutrality through minimal management. Figure 1 shows returns from 1940 to 2017, with average and effective interest rates explained. Effective rates have been higher since 1985 due to earlier acquisitions at higher interest rates. The trust funds' investment practices result in lower interest rates on assets acquired in earlier years. Special issues acquired in 1989 with an average rate of 8.7% were reinvested in 2003 at a lower rate of 4.1%. The OASDI Trust Funds' investment practices have been criticized for potentially impacting long-term solvency. Critics argue that a better return on investments in the past could have put the funds in a stronger financial position. This is due to a funding shortfall caused by demographic factors, which may require a payroll tax increase or benefit reduction to restore solvency. The 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended investing in equities to improve long-term financial position. The Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB) affirmed this in reports from 2005 and 2010, stating that equities offer a higher rate of return and reduce portfolio risk for the OASDI Trust Fund. The SSAB recommended investing in equities to improve the OASDI Trust Fund's financial position, citing higher returns and reduced risk. Declining interest rates led to lower reinvestment returns, with projections showing this trend continuing. Despite expected interest rate increases, maturing holdings would still be reinvested at lower rates. The value of asset reserves in the Trust Funds grew from 1983 to 2017, with provisions like increasing the full retirement age established in the Social Security Amendments of 1983. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 established provisions such as increasing the full retirement age and taxing Social Security benefits, leading to annual surpluses in the OASDI Trust Funds from 1983 to 2017. However, interest rates fell during this period, and by the end of 2017, the trust funds were projected to be at peak value. In 2018, program costs were projected to exceed revenues, requiring assets to be drawn down to cover expenses. Trustees also projected that costs would continue to exceed revenues for the next 75 years. The 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended investing trust funds in equities to address demographic implications of the aging baby boom generation. Critics are concerned about investing in private companies. Some critics are concerned that government intervention in the market through investing in private companies could lead to \"socialism by the backdoor method.\" The advisory council also highlighted practical disadvantages such as the need for a comprehensive investment policy to ensure a reasonable rate of interest and security of principal, potentially risking investment income or loss of principal. Investing trust fund assets in index funds, such as the largest 500 companies, may lead to government support for chosen companies, potentially incentivizing questionable accounting practices. Deceptive accounting methods could inflate stock prices and market capitalization to benefit the company. Investing trust funds in private equities or bonds could introduce instability to financial markets. Fluctuations in trust funds' balance may disrupt private markets and create liquidity crises. The lack of liquidity is a reason critics cite for not investing in social projects such as housing or hospitals. Trust funds would need to redeem special issues to provide capital for purchasing equities, requiring an increase in publicly held debt, tax revenue, or cash investment. Investing trust funds' assets in equities could introduce instability to financial markets due to higher risk and volatility. While it may improve financial health, it could pose challenges for a system reliant on dedicated funding sources. Investing trust funds' assets in equities could introduce instability to financial markets due to higher risk and volatility. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index outperformed the trust funds' effective interest rate in 21 of 35 years from 1983-2017, with an average return of 12.7% compared to 5.8%. The equity market experiences higher volatility, similar to the Railroad Retirement Board's challenges. The Railroad Retirement Survivors' Improvement Act established the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) independently of the federal government and the RRB. The NRRIT aims to increase RRB funding by investing in non-U.S. government securities, with diversified portfolios to minimize risk. Investment returns from FY2003 to FY2016 averaged 7.9%, exceeding expected returns of 8%. The NRRIT achieved returns of 8%, higher than if invested solely in government securities. NRRIT's assets are smaller than OASDI Trust Funds, with $26.5 billion in FY2017 compared to $2,892 billion for OASDI. Research analyzed OASDI Trust Funds' cash flows from 1983-2016 to model performance with alternative investments. The study by Burtless et al. in 2017 analyzed the impact of incorporating equity investments into the OASDI Trust Funds starting in 1984 and 1997. The trust funds ratio, a measure of asset reserves compared to projected costs, was used to assess financial health. Results showed scenarios with equity investments and their effects on the trust funds ratio. The analysis in Figure 4 shows that if the OASDI Trust Funds had invested in equities in the past, they would have higher levels of assets today. Investing in equities in 1983 would have increased reserves enough to cover an additional 1.2 years of program costs, while investing in 1997 would have covered an additional 0.88 years of costs. However, even with equity investment, the trust funds would still face long-term insolvency. Investing in equities from 1983 to 2008 would not have significantly improved the financial situation of the trust funds, as shown by the analysis. Despite some downturns, incorporating equity investments would have put the trust funds in a better financial position today. However, the current investment strategy has resulted in a similar trust funds ratio with less risk and minimal cost. In alternative scenarios, the trust funds would have owned less than 10% of the total stock market value today. The trust funds would have owned less than 10% of the total stock market value today due to phased-in equity purchases. OCACT maintains estimates on policy options affecting long-range solvency, with current law showing a -2.84% actuarial balance. Policy options for equity investing can be assessed by their impact on actuarial balance. The 2018 Annual Report suggests a 2.84-percentage-point increase in payroll tax rate or a reduction in benefits to maintain program solvency. Investing trust funds in equities is not projected to significantly improve long-term solvency. Option G1, investing 40% of funds in equities, is the best-performing but still results in depletion by 2035. The 2018 Annual Report suggests a 2.84-percentage-point increase in payroll tax rate or a reduction in benefits to maintain program solvency. Investing trust funds in equities is not projected to significantly improve long-term solvency. Once the trust funds are depleted, the OASDI program's cost is projected to remain greater than revenues indefinitely. The Burtless et al. research examined how the trust funds would have fared by including alternative investments from 1984 to 2016 and projected performance from 2017. Policy options without revenue increases do not impact solvency once trust funds are depleted. The researchers' simulations require Congress to pass legislation to restore balance to the OASDI Trust Funds. This involves raising payroll taxes to eliminate the funding shortfall, projected to require a 2.58-percentage-point increase. This increase would extend solvency from 2034 to 2091 if enacted in 2016. Once balance is restored, there is no longer a long-term funding shortfall. The authors present two scenarios for the OASDI Trust Funds. The first scenario continues current policy with funds invested in special issues. The second scenario increases reserves invested in equities by 2.67 percentage points per year until no more than 40% of assets are equities. Monte Carlo simulations model these scenarios once the program is balanced. Results show outcomes for trust funds ratios based on simulated special issue returns. The simulations in the study show trust fund returns grouped by percentiles, with the 95th percentile indicating trust fund ratio of 100% in 2091 and the 5th percentile showing depletion by 2083. The simulations align with the Trustees' 2018 Annual Report, with the 50th percentile extending solvency to 2090 and the 5th percentile maintaining solvency through 2082. The simulations in the study demonstrate improved financial adequacy and solvency of trust funds through 2071 and 2082 respectively. Incorporating equity investments could potentially increase the trust funds' long-term financial position, with a mixed portfolio valued at 330% of projected costs at the end of the projection period. Equity investments improve trust funds' long-term financial position, with a mixed portfolio outperforming the special issue-only practice in most scenarios. Including equities could enhance the Social Security program's solvency after eliminating the long-term funding shortfall, representing a significant policy change. The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) has achieved higher annual rates of return compared to the OASDI Trust Funds from 2003 to 2017. The NRRIT's board consists of seven trustees with expertise in financial management and pension plans, selected by labor unions and railroad management. The NRRIT trustees are limited to three-year terms and hire independent investment managers. Safeguards include fund reserves of four to six years' worth of benefits and automatic payroll tax adjustments. Acquiring similar reserves for OASDI Trust Funds would require significant revenue-increasing or benefit-reducing measures. To bring the OASDI Trust Funds into balance, substantial revenue-increasing or benefit-reducing measures are needed, such as a 2.58 percentage point increase in the payroll tax. Even with potential equity investments, achieving a trust funds ratio of 400% is not projected until 2035. Implementing automatic payroll tax adjustments may be challenging for policymakers due to the high coverage rate of Social Security in the United States. An automatic increase in the payroll tax may occur during low equity returns to maintain a specific trust funds ratio. A higher trust funds ratio, like 600%, could prevent the need for a tax increase. Positive equity returns could lead to a payroll tax decrease. The NRRIT manages $26.5 billion in assets, while the OASDI Trust Funds manage $2,892 billion. The NRRIT, as an independent entity, has less federal oversight. The RRB Office of the Inspector General has raised concerns about the lack of oversight for the NRRIT compared to federal agencies. This lack of safeguards may pose risks to the long-term solvency of the OASDI Trust Funds. Legislation may be needed to address these issues and improve financial stability. Investing trust funds' assets in equities could improve solvency, with potential benefits over government bonds. Phasing in equity investments gradually could minimize risks. The RRB's practices offer a framework for equity investment, but would require a departure from current investment principles. This shift could lead to higher costs and risks, but potentially greater returns. Trust Funds managed at low cost with minimal risk and no direct intervention in private equity markets."
