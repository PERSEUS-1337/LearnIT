Legal issues surrounding gig worker classification have sparked debate on the pros and cons of this growing sector. Workers' willingness to participate suggests benefits of gig work over traditional employment. Gig work offers benefits such as ease of finding employment, flexibility in choosing jobs and hours, and opportunities for bridge employment. However, concerns exist regarding the lack of labor protections and the precarious nature of gig work. Members of Congress are questioning the size and classification of the gig workforce. The gig economy matches providers to consumers for on-demand work. Gig workers sign agreements with companies through online platforms to provide services. This model raises legal and policy questions about worker protections and benefits. The gig economy operates through on-demand companies where providers offer services and are compensated. Business models vary, with some companies allowing providers to set prices or choose jobs, while others control pricing and assignments. The gig economy spans various sectors such as driver services, personal and household services, business services, delivery services, and medical care. Providers are typically classified as independent contractors, not employees, by on-demand companies. The gig economy allows providers to offer services and transact with clients through on-demand companies. Providers have the ability to select jobs, set their hours, and control aspects of their work. This model differs from traditional freelance work as tech-platform companies reduce entry costs for providers and attract workers with diverse characteristics. Operating costs are lower for gig workers as they do not need to establish a company or market to consumers. On-demand companies in the gig economy collect a portion of job earnings as commissions and control the brand, setting gig work apart from traditional freelance models. On-demand companies in the gig economy have a stake in attracting and retaining clients by brokering jobs through their platform. They are selective about providers, requiring background checks and credentials. Companies like Upwork control the provider-client relationship, prohibiting providers from working with clients outside the platform for a certain period. The gig economy platforms like Upwork and Handy restrict providers from working with clients outside their platform for a specific period. The federal government lacks statistics on the gig economy workforce, relying on private-sector studies and academic research for information. Characterizing gig workers is challenging due to various factors. Measuring gig workers poses challenges, including defining the gig economy precisely and designing surveys to identify individuals meeting this definition. Survey questions must consider how workers perceive their gig activity, and data collection strategies should accommodate dynamic participation. The infrequency of gig work in the population complicates obtaining reliable estimates of workers' characteristics. Adapting labor force survey instruments to measure these new areas may also be necessary. Adapting existing labor force survey instruments to measure gig work may require significant time and funding. Federal statistics on self-employment and nontraditional work arrangements offer insights into the gig workforce, but are imperfect measures. The Bureau of Labor Statistics previously collected data on contingent workers and alternative employment arrangements. The Bureau of Labor Statistics previously collected data on contingent workers and alternative employment arrangements, including independent contractors, on-call workers, and temporary help agency workers. However, the data from 2005 may not be relevant to the current gig economy workforce, as it predates the rise of tech-platform companies like Uber and Lyft. New data collection in 2017 is expected to provide more accurate information on the size and characteristics of the gig workforce. The BLS plans to include new questions in the 2017 CWS to measure gig work, focusing on how workers obtain customers through electronic matching platforms. The classification of gig workers as independent contractors or employees remains an open legal question. Self-employment data from the CPS may offer insights into this workforce. The average number of unincorporated self-employed workers in the US showed a gradual decline from 2002 to 2016. The self-employment data from the CPS shows a gradual decline in the number of unincorporated self-employed workers in the United States from 2002 to 2016. Recent trends do not indicate significant growth in independent contractors in the gig economy, possibly due to challenges in measuring gig workers accurately. The data does not capture if self-employed workers use tech-based platforms to find clients, complicating the interpretation of self-employment trends. The self-employment data from the CPS shows a gradual decline in the number of unincorporated self-employed workers in the United States from 2002 to 2016. Recent trends do not indicate significant growth in independent contractors in the gig economy. Challenges in measuring gig workers accurately include the inability to decompose data into gig economy and traditional work, self-reported data, and some gig workers being classified as employees. Census Bureau statistics on nonemployers may reflect trends in gig work. The number of establishments and their receipts increased steadily from 2002 to 2014, with temporary declines during the 2007-2009 recession. Census data show a rise in nonemployer businesses, while BLS data indicate a decline or modest growth in self-employment. Differences in data interpretation may be due to how survey respondents view their activities. Some individuals may not consider their income-generating activities as \"work,\" leading to discrepancies in labor force data. The gig economy is not fully captured in labor force data, with some individuals not considering their income-generating activities as \"work.\" IRS data may count self-employed individuals with multiple nonemployer businesses multiple times. Research on gig workers shows they make up a small share of total workers, less than 1% in major studies. Research shows that gig workers constitute less than 1% of total employment and often use gig work to supplement income. A study by economists Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger found that the number of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements, including gig work, increased from 10.7% in 2005 to 15.8% in 2015. Specifically, approximately 0.5% of workers were estimated to be operating in the gig economy. The JPMorgan Chase Institute researchers estimated that around 0.5% of workers engaged in gig work through online platforms in 2015. They identified gig workers by tracking checking deposits from on-demand platforms among their primary checking account holders from 2012 to 2016. The study found a growth in the number of adults receiving income from labor platform providers until June 2016, with a slowdown in growth since December 2015. In June 2016, 0.5% of adults with a JPMC checking account received income from gig work. The study shows significant movement in and out of gig work, with 16% of gig workers being new entrants in June 2016. 52% of workers who earned income through the gig economy between 2012 and 2014 ended their gig careers within 12 months. Gig work is often used to supplement income from other sources. Various organizations have different methods for estimating the gig economy workforce, leading to varying results. The estimation methodology for gig workers varies among researchers, with different approaches such as using administrative data and Google Trends. Estimates range from 0.4% to less than 1% of the U.S. working-age population being gig workers. Uber Technologies collaborated with economist Alan Krueger to analyze data from Uber drivers, revealing that 464,681 drivers were actively partnered with Uber. In 2012 to 2015, the number of active Uber drivers significantly increased from 162,037 to 464,681. However, the rise in drivers may not reflect long-term trends due to the potential adoption of driverless car technology. Survey data shows that most Uber drivers were male, aged between 30 and 49, and nearly half had a college degree. Over 60% of drivers had another job, indicating that Uber was not their sole source of income. The flexibility in work hours offered by Uber was a key attraction for drivers. MBO Partners conducts an annual survey of independent workers, focusing on demographics, income, and use of on-demand platforms for work. The sample includes 1,100 individuals who regularly work independently. In 2014, around 900,000 contractors used online talent marketplaces like Freelancer.com, and 500,000 used tech platforms like Uber. The gig economy involves 500,000 workers using tech platforms like Uber and Lyft. The classification of workers as employees or independent contractors is crucial for federal labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act. These laws provide protections and benefits to employees, including minimum wage and overtime pay. The FLSA only applies to employees, not independent contractors. Determining whether an individual is an employee is essential for enforcing these laws. Courts determine employee status based on the economic reality of the working relationship, considering factors like control, opportunity for profit or loss, skill requirement, permanency, and integration with the employer's business. In July 2015, a Lyft driver in Florida filed a complaint. In July 2015, a Lyft driver in Florida filed a complaint with a federal district court alleging a violation of the FLSA. The driver claimed Lyft controls all aspects of drivers' work, pay rates, and working hours. In December 2015, Lyft and the driver reached an agreement to dismiss the case. Similarly, Uber drivers have also alleged FLSA violations, such as unpaid hours, minimum wage, and overtime compensation. Uber tried to compel arbitration for the drivers' claims. Uber sought arbitration for drivers' claims based on its services agreement, which includes a provision for arbitration in disputes related to the employment relationship. The court in Suarez ordered drivers to submit their claims to arbitration, finding the provision not unconscionable. This has led to limited case law on the FLSA's application to Uber drivers. Drivers have also alleged violations of state worker protection laws, raising questions about their employment status. In a separate case, California's labor commissioner determined a former Uber driver was an employee under state law. In Berwick v. Uber Technologies, a former driver sought unpaid wages, reimbursement for using her own vehicle, and penalties for failure to pay prompt wages. The commissioner determined that Uber controlled its drivers like employees, awarding the driver mileage expenses and interest on unpaid expenses, but dismissing claims for wages, liquidated damages, and penalties. The former Uber driver's claims for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and penalties were dismissed by the commissioner due to lack of evidence. Uber initially appealed the decision but is now part of a larger settlement effort. A proposed $84 million settlement for Uber drivers in California and Massachusetts was denied by a federal district court in August 2016, citing it as unfair and inadequate. The Private Attorneys General Act allows private plaintiffs to recover civil penalties. A proposed settlement involving Uber drivers was rejected by a California court for providing little relief to drivers. The settlement would have given the majority of the funds to the state and paid administrative costs and attorneys' fees. Section 7 of the NLRA grants employees the right to self-organization and collective bargaining. The NLRA requires an employer to negotiate in good faith with a labor organization that becomes the exclusive representative for a bargaining unit of employees. Independent contractors are excluded from the NLRA's definition of employee, so employers are not required to negotiate with them. Seattle is considering legislation to allow for-hire vehicle drivers to be represented by an exclusive driver representative for collective bargaining rights. Seattle City Council is considering legislation for for-hire vehicle drivers to have an exclusive driver representative for collective bargaining rights. Some question the legitimacy of the measure, citing the NLRA's exclusion of independent contractors. The gig economy workers may benefit from easier entry and exit from work and flexibility in choosing jobs and hours. However, federal labor protections mainly focus on employees and employers, with the FLSA covering 89% of the nation's wage and salary workers. The FLSA covers 89% of the nation's wage and salary workers, providing protections like minimum wage and overtime. Independent contractors are generally not covered by these provisions, as they are not economically dependent on an employer in a traditional employment relationship. The FLSA guarantees a minimum wage rate for covered workers above the federal rate, while workers not covered by the FLSA, like independent contractors, have no guaranteed minimum wage. Overtime compensation under the FLSA requires payment at one-and-a-half times the regular rate for hours worked over 40 per week. Unemployment compensation is provided through the federal-state UC program, financed by employer taxes, with eligibility based on qualifying wages and employment in covered work. Eligibility for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) benefits is tied to an individual's work history with an employer and does not include independent contractors. In traditional employment relationships, employers are responsible for payroll taxes, while independent contractors are responsible for self-employment taxes. In the gig economy, workers may not have access to traditional employment benefits like health, retirement, and life insurance offered by employers. Data in Table 1 show that full-time employees have higher access to these benefits compared to independent contractors. In the gig economy, workers may have limited access to traditional employment benefits provided by employers, with full-time employees having higher access rates compared to independent contractors. The difference in access rates between full-time and part-time workers highlights the importance of traditional employment arrangements in providing benefits. Independent contractors may need to seek alternative means to access these benefits typically offered to full-time employees. Access to benefits for gig economy workers is uncertain, with concerns about the number of workers involved and whether gig work is their primary source of income. There is also worry about the lack of benefits and protections compared to traditional employment relationships. Benefits for independent contractors in the gig economy would likely need to be provided through a nonemployer mechanism. Access to benefits for gig economy workers is uncertain, with concerns about the number of workers involved and whether gig work is their primary source of income. Independent contractors in the gig economy may need benefits provided through a nonemployer mechanism. Congressional attention is drawn to the availability of benefits and protections for gig workers, raising policy-related considerations on which protections and benefits should be available to these workers. One proposal suggests creating a new employment category for gig economy workers called independent workers. These workers would receive benefits like insurance and tax withholding but not labor protections based on hours worked. This addresses concerns about benefits for gig workers and the difficulty of tracking hours in gig employment. In the gig economy, determining responsibility for enforcing protections and providing benefits to workers working for multiple businesses is a key consideration. Access to benefits outside traditional employment relationships could be facilitated by intermediaries like nonprofits. In the on-demand economy, there is a push for creating models that allow workers to contribute to a common fund for health, retirement, and other benefits. Portable benefits or risk-pooling mechanisms could help provide benefits to workers in the gig economy."
