A qualified business is defined as a person owning 10 or fewer broadcast stations with a fair market value equal to or greater. An interest in a broadcast station is considered qualified if it represents 50 percent or more of the total net assets of the entity. For telecommunications sales, certain criteria must be met for individuals, partnerships, or corporations to qualify based on net assets and average after-tax income. The rules for determining a qualified business in telecommunications sales include limitations on the number of prior purchases and specific criteria for net assets and after-tax income. The term 'income' refers to taxable income reduced by the net income tax for the year, with rules for determining average after-tax income. All persons treated as a single employer are considered one person for this subsection. 'Telecommunications business' is defined as any business providing communication services by wire. The term 'telecommunications business' refers to any business providing communication services by wire, cable, radio, satellite, or other technology governed by the Communications Act of 1934 or the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Special rules apply to stock of a corporation operating a telecommunications business in a qualified telecommunications sale. If gain would be recognized on a sale due to subsection (b), the taxpayer can elect to reduce the basis of depreciable property held immediately after the sale. The reduction amount is determined by the Secretary's regulations. For property acquired in an involuntary conversion, refer to section 1033(b). If a telecommunications business is resold within 5 years, there is a recapture of tax benefits. If a qualified telecommunications sale results in a recapture event within 5 years, the purchaser's tax will increase by 20 percent of the consideration or the dollar limitation. An exception applies if the taxpayer reinvests in another qualified sale within 60 days. The term 'recapture event' in a qualified telecommunications sale refers to any sale or disposition of assets or stock acquired in the initial sale, or in the case of subsection (c)(2), any sale of a telecommunications business or transaction resulting in loss of control.
