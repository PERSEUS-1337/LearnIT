These changes focused on disciplining children with disabilities while balancing school safety and ensuring a free appropriate public education. The amendments provide schools with increased flexibility in handling misbehavior by children with disabilities. The IDEAAmendments of 1997 allow schools to place children with disabilities in interim alternative educational settings for up to forty-five days if involved with drugs or weapons. An impartial hearing officer can order a change in placement if leaving the child in the current setting is likely to result in harm. P.L. 105-17 ensures that educational services continue for children with disabilities even if suspended or expelled. The final regulations under P.L. 105-17 were promulgated on March 12, 1999 after receiving feedback from various sources. The discipline provisions were controversial, especially regarding short-term suspensions, and were altered from the proposed regulations. Despite significant changes in the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, further amendments have been proposed but not yet passed into law. The 108th Congress passed H.R. 1350 in both the House and Senate, but conferees have not been appointed. It is important to briefly review the history of IDEA's discipline provisions before discussing the statutory and regulatory changes. The history of IDEA's discipline provisions dates back to its enactment in 1975 as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, motivated by the lack of appropriate education for children with disabilities. Judicial decisions like PARC v. State of Pennsylvania and Mills v. Board of Education highlighted the constitutional issues, leading to pressure on states to provide services for children with disabilities. In response to pressure from advocates, Congress enacted P.L. 94-142 to provide grants to states for education of children with disabilities. The law included a \"stay put\" provision to prevent discrimination by keeping children in their current placement during disputes. This provision remains in the current version of IDEA, addressing issues related to children with disabilities exhibiting challenging behavior. In 1988, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of children with disabilities exhibiting violent behavior in the case of Honig v. Doe. The Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, emphasizing the need to provide education for emotionally disturbed students. The Supreme Court's ruling in Honig v. Doe stated that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students but can temporarily suspend them for up to 10 days in cases of immediate threat. This led to the creation of the Honig injunction, allowing schools to seek judicial relief in extreme cases. Congress later amended IDEA to allow schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative setting if they brought a firearm to school. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 expanded provisions to include weapons and drugs. Schools must conduct a \"manifestation determination\" before suspending or expelling a disabled student for more than ten days. If behavior is unrelated to the disability, the school can proceed with suspension or expulsion but must continue to provide education services. If behavior is related to the disability, the school must notify of any change in placement and parents can invoke the stay put provision. The Honig injunctions allow for changes in placement if it is believed to prevent harm to the student or others. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 codified existing laws regarding educational services for disabled children, even if they are suspended or expelled. The committee made contentious changes to the IDEA reauthorization, focusing on school safety for children with disabilities. They added a new section to strike a balance between ensuring safe school environments for all children and disciplining those who jeopardize safety. The committee added specific guidelines for disciplining children with disabilities in order to ensure safe school environments for all children. Children with disabilities may face disciplinary procedures, including suspension for up to ten days or placement in an interim alternative education setting for up to forty-five days in certain situations. Children with disabilities may be placed in an interim alternative educational setting for up to forty-five days if they pose a risk of harm to themselves or others. A manifestation determination review is conducted to assess the link between the child's disability and behavior. If the behavior is not related to the disability, long-term disciplinary actions like expulsion may be taken, but educational services must continue. School officials can seek a Honig injunction if agreement with parents cannot be reached. Additionally, temporary changes in placement or suspension can be ordered for up to ten days. The new provision in P.L. 105-17 allows for the removal of a child with a disability from their current placement for up to ten consecutive school days for any violation of school rules, similar to what would be applied to children without disabilities. The regulations clarified that these ten days are not limited to a specific school year and can be for any incidents of misconduct as long as it does not constitute a change in placement. The regulations allow for the removal of a child with a disability for up to ten consecutive school days for misconduct, as long as it does not result in a change in placement. Schools must provide necessary services to help the child progress in the curriculum and meet their IEP goals during suspensions. The school personnel determine necessary services, including behavior assessment plans and manifestation determinations for changes in placement. P.L. 105-17 expanded interim alternative placements for weapons and drugs, not just firearms. P.L. 106-25 clarified that schools can remove a child with a weapon at school. The interim alternative education setting for a child with a weapon at school is determined by their IEP team. P.L. 105-17 requires a behavior assessment plan within ten days if one does not exist. The IEP team must review and modify the behavior intervention plan if necessary. The IEP team considers strategies for addressing behavior, including positive interventions. P.L. 105-17 allows for an interim alternative educational placement for up to forty-five days if current placement poses a risk of harm. The placement must enable the child to participate in the general curriculum. The concept of a manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of IDEA by the Department of Education. P.L. 105-17 mandates that a determination regarding the relationship between a child's disability and behavior must be made by the IEP team in certain circumstances to ensure appropriate services and modifications are provided to address the behavior. The IEP team must determine the relationship between a child's disability and behavior in specific circumstances, such as when considering a change in placement for disciplinary reasons. If the behavior is related to the disability, the school may review and potentially change the child's placement. If not related, the school can suspend the child for up to ten days or seek a legal injunction. The IEP team must consider if a child's behavior is related to their disability when determining disciplinary actions. If behavior is not related, standard disciplinary procedures may be applied, but a free appropriate public education must still be provided. Parents have the right to request a hearing if they disagree with the determination. The IEP team must make three determinations to find that behavior is not related to the disability. The child's IEP and placement were appropriate, special education services and behavior intervention strategies were provided as per the IEP. The IEP team must determine if the child's disability affects their understanding and control of behavior subject to disciplinary action. If parents request a hearing for disciplinary action involving an interim alternative educational setting, the child remains in that setting until a decision is made. The final regulations state that if a child is placed in an interim alternative educational setting for more than ten days and the school wants to change the placement, the child remains in the original placement if parents challenge the change. An expedited hearing may be held if there are safety concerns. The regulations also mention that if a hearing officer agrees with the parents on a change of placement, it must be treated as an agreement between the agency and the parents. The final regulations state that if a child is placed in an interim alternative educational setting for more than ten days and the school wants to change the placement, the child remains in the original placement if parents challenge the change. An expedited hearing may be held if there are safety concerns. If a hearing officer agrees with the parents on a change of placement, it must be treated as an agreement between the agency and the parents. The state of Virginia previously refused to comply with the OSEP interpretation of IDEA, leading to judicial decisions. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that IDEA did not require educational services for expelled children with disabilities to receive funding. Congress was advised to amend the statute to avoid judicial controversies, resulting in the addition of a qualifying phrase in P.L. 105-17 extending FAPE to suspended or expelled children with disabilities. The Department of Education's final regulations clarified that schools must provide services to children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled, starting from the eleventh day of suspension. P.L. 105-17 allows children to assert IDEA protections if the school knew they had a disability before the disciplinary action. The Department of Education's final regulations clarified that schools must provide services to children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled, starting from the eleventh day of suspension. The law states that the LEA is deemed to have knowledge if the parent has expressed concern in writing, the child's behavior or performance shows the need for special education, the parent has requested an evaluation, or teachers have expressed concern to the special education director. This caused concern among school officials about casual hallway comments indicating knowledge of a child's disability. The Department of Education clarified that concerns about children with disabilities should be expressed to the director of special education or other personnel according to the agency's child find system. Previous judicial decisions raised issues about when children with disabilities could be referred to law enforcement. P.L.105-17 allows reporting crimes committed by children with disabilities and sharing disciplinary information to prevent violence in schools. The Amendments allowed states to require inclusion of disciplinary actions in records of children with disabilities for safety reasons, following FERPA guidelines. Congress made changes in 1997 regarding reporting crimes by children with disabilities to prevent school violence. Amendments to discipline provisions in education legislation were proposed but not included in the final legislation. Representative Norwood's amendment aimed to treat special needs students the same as non-special needs students in disciplinary actions. This would have removed the requirement to provide educational services to children with disabilities who are suspended or expelled for certain actions in states that do not mandate such services for non-disabled children. The Senate amendment, like the House amendment, proposed uniform disciplinary policies for children with disabilities in certain situations under IDEA. It included procedural protections and alternative placements for these children. In 1999, both the Senate and House passed amendments related to discipline in education legislation, but they were not included in the final legislation. The Child Safety and Protection Act proposed amendments to IDEA regarding disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities in certain situations, specifically related to carrying weapons or illegal drugs at school. These proposed amendments were not enacted. In the 108th Congress, IDEA reauthorization bills included amendments related to disciplining children with disabilities. H.R. 1350 passed the House in 2003, and the Senate incorporated S. 1248 in H.R. 1350 in 2004. Both bills allowed school personnel to suspend a child with a disability for up to ten school days, but differed on other placement changes. The Housebill proposed deleting many provisions while the Senate bill suggested revisions for uniform school discipline. The bill H.R. 1350 aims to establish a uniform school discipline code, simplifying the current system. It allows school personnel to temporarily change the placement of a child with a disability who violates the code to an alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days. This change can be extended if required by state law for safety and educational reasons. The Senate bill aims to simplify school discipline procedures and ensure a safe educational environment. It allows school personnel to move a student to an alternative educational setting for up to forty-five days for serious offenses, regardless of disability manifestation. The bill also requires notifying parents of disciplinary actions and providing procedural safeguards. The House and Senate bills aim to ensure that children with disabilities continue to receive educational services when removed from their current placement for disciplinary reasons. Parents and LEAs have the right to request a hearing if they disagree with disciplinary decisions or placement. Both bills also address the provision of behavioral intervention services. The House and Senate bills address disciplinary actions for children with disabilities, allowing for a change in placement if there is a risk of injury. The bills differ on the use of a manifestation determination, with the House bill removing the requirement to determine if behavior is a result of the child's disability. The Senate bill, H.R. 1350, maintains the concept of a manifestation determination but with revised language. It allows for disciplinary actions without a prior determination for short-term suspensions or in cases involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury. In other situations, the IEP team must review relevant information to determine if the behavior was due to the child's disability before changing their placement. The Senate bill maintains the concept of a manifestation determination, allowing for disciplinary actions without prior determination in certain cases. Changes are proposed for placements during appeals, interim alternative educational settings, and manifestation determinations. Both the House and Senate bills propose changes to the current law regarding placement of a child with a disability during appeals by a parent. H.R. 1350 (Senate) allows the child to remain in the interim alternative educational setting in specific situations, such as when there is a challenge to disciplinary procedures. The Senate bill proposes expedited hearings within twenty school days for challenges to placement or manifestation determinations, removing the provision for current placement and expedited hearings. The House bill includes a stay put requirement for changes in placement due to code of conduct violations by a child with a disability. The House and Senate bills aim to remove provisions regarding current placement during appeals and expedited hearings for children with disabilities. The Senate bill includes a requirement for an expedited hearing within twenty school days, while the House bill includes a stay put requirement for changes in placement due to code of conduct violations. The House and Senate bills address disciplinary actions for children with disabilities. They both require school personnel to express concerns about a child's behavior to the director of special education. The House bill specifies concerns about behavior or performance, while the Senate bill focuses on patterns of behavior. The Senate bill proposes adding a new situation where the LEA is deemed to have knowledge if a child demonstrates a pattern of behavior indicating a need for special education. Additionally, there is an exception where the LEA is not deemed to have knowledge if the parent has not agreed to an evaluation of the child."
