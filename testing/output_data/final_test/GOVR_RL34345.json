Some states have imposed penalties on activities that facilitate unauthorized immigration, leading to legal challenges on federal preemption and Fourteenth Amendment grounds. Legal challenges in federal court regarding restrictions on employment for unauthorized aliens have resulted in conflicting rulings. Some measures have been upheld as valid, while others have been struck down or settled out of court. This highlights the challenges faced by states and localities in regulating aliens within their jurisdictions in compliance with federal law. Court decisions have limited the legal basis for state and local legislation affecting aliens. The scope of state and local authority to regulate aliens has been limited by federal immigration laws, such as employer sanctions and welfare reform. These laws have broadened substantive regulation of aliens and established procedures for determining eligibility for employment and benefits. Despite state and local efforts to deter illegal immigration, conflicting court rulings have curbed their ability to regulate immigration-related matters. Conflicting court rulings have limited state and local authority in regulating immigration law, including measures targeting unlawfully present aliens. The Supreme Court is considering whether federal law preempts an Arizona statute requiring employers to use E-Verify for employee work eligibility. The report discusses constitutional issues raised by state and local laws intended to deter unauthorized aliens by limiting their access to housing, employment, and public benefits. It also addresses recent federal court cases on the constitutionality of such measures. An estimated 37 million foreign-born persons reside in the US, with almost a third potentially present without authorization. The number of unauthorized aliens residing in the United States has grown significantly over the past two decades, reaching a high of more than 11 million in 2008. Despite a decline in unauthorized migration in recent years, some states and localities have enacted measures to deter their presence, including limiting employment and housing opportunities for unauthorized aliens. Some states and localities have enacted measures to restrict unlawfully present aliens' access to employment, housing, and public benefits. While few local measures have been enacted, several states have adopted restrictions on employers hiring unauthorized aliens and their eligibility for public benefits. No state has specifically barred unlawfully present aliens from renting private dwellings, but some localities have implemented such measures. These restrictions have faced legal challenges on various grounds. Restrictions on unlawfully present aliens' access to employment, housing, and public benefits have faced legal challenges alleging preemption by federal immigration law, violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprivation of due process rights. Preemption, equal protection, and procedural due process are key legal concepts in these challenges. One essential aspect of the federal structure of government is that states can be precluded from taking actions that conflict with federal law. An act of Congress may preempt state or local action in three ways: express preemption, field preemption, or conflict preemption. The delineation between these categories is important in legal challenges regarding restrictions on unlawfully present aliens' access to employment, housing, and public benefits. The delineation between categories of preemption in legal challenges involving restrictions on unlawfully present aliens is not rigid. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, gives federal power to regulate which noncitizens may enter or remain in the United States. Congress established a comprehensive framework for alien admission and removal, with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 amending the INA to combat unauthorized alien employment. The Supreme Court views this system as central to immigration policy. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants rights to legal aliens but also enforces penalties for unlawful presence, including employer sanctions and deportation. The Supreme Court has not ruled that all state laws related to aliens are preempted by federal power. In De Canas v. Bica (1976), the Court stated that state regulations only tangentially related to immigration may not be invalidated without congressional action. Field preemption claims against state laws must conflict with federal law to be justified. The De Canas Court ruled that state laws related to immigration must not conflict with federal law to be justified. The Equal Protection Clause ensures equal protection of the laws but does not guarantee equal treatment for all persons. Not all classifications between individuals are invalid under this clause. The standard of judicial review for state and local laws is either rational basis or strict scrutiny, depending on the classification involved. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection, limiting states in restricting rights and privileges. In Plyler v. Doe (1982), the Supreme Court ruled that a Texas statute prohibiting unauthorized alien students from receiving free public education violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court applied an \"intermediate\" standard of review, finding that unauthorized immigrants are not a \"suspect class\" and education is not a \"fundamental right,\" but still requiring a \"substantial state interest\" to justify the restriction. Ultimately, the Court found that the state's interests were not sufficient to uphold the statute. The Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe (1982) struck down a Texas statute that prohibited unauthorized alien students from receiving free public education. The Court found that the state's interests, including conserving educational resources and preventing an influx of illegal immigrants, did not justify the restriction. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause applies to all persons in the United States, ensuring that states do not arbitrarily interfere with key interests like life, liberty, and property. Procedural due process rules aim to prevent mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property by ensuring fair procedures. The necessary procedures vary based on the circumstances and interests involved. In Matthews v. Eldridge, the Supreme Court established the standard for assessing due process requirements, considering the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the value of additional procedural safeguards. The Due Process Clause requires states and localities to provide individuals with the ability to contest the basis of any deprivation of a protected interest. This includes notice, a hearing before an impartial tribunal, and additional procedural protections when necessary to prevent unfair deprivations. These protections only apply to direct government actions that result in a deprivation of a protected interest. Government actions that deprive a person of a protected interest do not apply to indirect adverse effects. States and localities can restrict the hiring of unauthorized aliens, subject to preemption and procedural due process challenges. Congress amended the INA to regulate the employment of unauthorized aliens, prohibiting their hiring or continued employment. Violators may face consequences. The INA prohibits the hiring of unauthorized aliens, with violators facing cease and desist orders, penalties, fines, and imprisonment. State and local laws imposing sanctions on employers of unauthorized aliens are preempted by federal law. State and local laws imposing sanctions on employers who discharge authorized workers while retaining unauthorized workers are expressly preempted. Laws pertaining to the issuance of business licenses, not just professional licenses, are not expressly preempted but could potentially be impliedly preempted. The inclusion of an express preemption clause does not prevent implied preemption principles from applying. State and local measures could still potentially be found unconstitutional if they conflict with federal law or frustrate its purpose. State and local measures targeting employers of unauthorized aliens through \"licensing and similar laws\" may face conflict preemption rather than express preemption. Courts generally apply a presumption against preemption due to the traditional regulation of employment being within states' police powers, despite the expansion of federal regulation with the enactment of IRCA. The enactment of IRCA by Congress made regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens a central concern of federal immigration policy. Despite the presumption against preemption based on historic state and federal regulation balance, state or local measures could still be found to be impliedly preempted depending on their terms and jurisdiction of reviewing courts. The pervasiveness of the INA's provisions regarding employment of unauthorized aliens could lead to Congress preempting the field. State and local measures regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens could face preemption challenges based on conflict preemption grounds if they are inconsistent with federal law. While field preemption regarding alien employment has not been widely recognized, the exclusion of certain laws from express preemption suggests Congress may not intend to fully occupy this regulatory field. State and local measures regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens may face preemption challenges if they conflict with federal law. These measures could include standards for determining unauthorized employment, sanctions for violations, and verification procedures different from federal requirements. Not all differences between state and federal laws would necessarily lead to preemption. Courts may interpret federal law differently when determining if state and local measures conflict with it. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found conflict preemption in state and local laws requiring the use of E-Verify for employee work authorization, based on their interpretation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The pilot program that evolved into E-Verify was initially prohibited from being mandatory by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Third Circuit ruled that state and local laws mandating E-Verify usage conflict with federal law. However, the Ninth and Tenth Circuits have found that such laws are not preempted as Congress intended for widespread E-Verify use. The Supreme Court is considering this issue, along with laws that would penalize businesses hiring unauthorized aliens. The Third Circuit recently found that state or local measures requiring employers to verify work authorization could be preempted on conflict grounds if they promote policies inconsistent with federal law. The court noted that federal verification requirements under IRCA balance deterring undocumented immigration, minimizing burdens on employers, and protecting authorized workers from discrimination. The Third Circuit found that local verification requirements promoting deterrence over minimizing burdens on employers and preventing discrimination could be conflict preempted. This could lead to courts striking down state and local verification requirements that lack protections against discrimination, diverging from federal law. The possibility of state or local measures being found unconstitutional as applied, particularly if they are deemed to regulate immigration rather than affecting aliens. Some argue that licensing and verification requirements could deter alien employment, potentially conflicting with federal law. The De Canas Court rejected arguments that a California statute restricting the employment of unlawfully present aliens was per se preempted as a regulation of immigration. Arguments that licensing and/or verification provisions could constitute impermissible regulations of immigration may have more success in future litigation, especially if the state or local measure is not narrowly tailored and based on legitimate purposes. State or local regulations prohibiting day labor centers may raise fewer preemption issues as federal law does not address them. Zoning and employment fall under states' police powers. Restrictions on day labor centers targeting local issues may be allowed, but could face preemption challenges. Other constitutional issues may arise from restrictions on day labor centers or solicitations. State and local restrictions on hiring unauthorized aliens could be challenged on procedural due process grounds, such as revoking business permits. Due Process Clause protects property and liberty interests related to employment and licensing. State and local measures penalizing employers for their employment contracts may be deemed unconstitutional if they do not provide a fair process for employers to contest the basis of the penalties. This process should include notice, a hearing before an impartial tribunal, and the opportunity to challenge findings regarding their employment practices. Additional procedural protections may also be necessary. However, employers may not necessarily be denied procedural due process if the measures do not provide guidance on determining employees' work eligibility or give specific instructions to employers. State and local measures that provide procedural protections for employers similar to federal guidelines under INA \u00a7 274A may be more likely to withstand due process challenges. Issues may arise with measures barring unlawfully present aliens from renting housing, raising concerns under preemption doctrine and the Fourteenth Amendment. State or local restrictions on employment due to denial of housing may face preemption challenges as they could be viewed as regulating immigration. Courts have found such measures to be impermissible regulations of immigration because they classify individuals based on their own criteria. State or local measures that deny unlawfully present aliens from renting housing may face challenges as they could be seen as regulating immigration. This could potentially be unconstitutional due to field or conflict preemption, even if they do not directly preempt federal laws. The INA criminalizes activities related to harboring unauthorized aliens, potentially preempting state or local measures denying them housing. This could lead to conflict preemption due to federal discretion in alien removal. The federal government has broad discretion in alien removal, and state or local verification requirements could impose burdens on the federal government. State or local measures denying housing to unauthorized aliens may face challenges under the Fourteenth Amendment. The extent to which states can restrict access to housing based on alienage is uncertain. The Supreme Court's stance on state classifications based on alienage has evolved over time, with earlier decisions upholding state laws denying rights to aliens. However, the Court has gradually restricted states' ability to exclude aliens from certain activities. While some earlier decisions have been questioned, it is well established that states have limitations in excluding aliens. The Supreme Court has established that states can impose greater restrictions on unauthorized aliens compared to citizens or legal immigrants, especially when the regulation does not involve children. A federal court upheld an ordinance regulating housing leasing to unauthorized aliens, stating it was not discriminatory and served a legitimate government interest in reducing crime. Alienage-based restrictions affecting children or spouses of unlawfully present aliens lawfully residing in the US may face legal challenges. In the 1948 case of Oyama v. California, the Supreme Court ruled that a California statute discriminated against the citizen child of an alien by imposing burdens not placed on children of U.S. citizens. State or local housing restrictions on unlawfully present aliens could face legal challenges, similar to the Oyama case, especially if they impact the property rights of U.S. citizen family members. Measures restricting unlawfully present aliens from renting or occupying private dwellings could impact property interests of landlords and tenants, violating the Due Process Clause. Government actions terminating leases deprive parties of property-related rights such as sale, occupancy, use, enjoyment, and rent. Monetary penalties and incarceration for violators further infringe on property interests. Local measures prohibiting the rental of housing to unlawfully present aliens may violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause by depriving property owners and tenants of protected interests. Procedural protections must be provided to minimize unfair deprivations, such as giving landlords notice and a hearing before suspending licenses and allowing tenants to challenge their designation. Denials of services and benefits to illegal aliens may face fewer legal challenges compared to measures regarding employment and housing. Local measures prohibiting housing rental to undocumented immigrants may violate Due Process Clause. Procedural protections are necessary to minimize unfair deprivations. Denials of services and benefits to illegal aliens may face fewer legal challenges compared to employment and housing measures. The scope of benefits denied and the involvement of state or local personnel in assessing immigration status are key factors in potential legal challenges. The extent to which states and localities can deny benefits based on unlawful presence in the US is still uncertain. After legal cases established constitutional principles on alien eligibility for government benefits, Congress passed the PRWORA in 1996 to define benefits for unauthorized aliens. The Act prohibits certain benefits for noncitizens unlawfully in the US and outlines which local benefits must be provided regardless of immigration status. PRWORA prohibits federal benefits for unlawfully present aliens, but they may qualify for state benefits under certain conditions. The denied benefits include grants, contracts, loans, retirement, welfare, health, disability, housing, food, unemployment, and postsecondary education. Exceptions include emergency medical treatment under Medicaid, disaster relief, immunizations, and services like soup kitchens and shelters. The PRWORA prohibits federal benefits for unlawfully present aliens, but they may qualify for state benefits under certain conditions. State and local government contracts, licenses, grants, loans, and assistance are generally barred for unauthorized aliens, except for emergency medical care, disaster relief, and immunizations. Courts have yet to weigh in on the issue of denying services to unlawfully present aliens. Courts have yet to determine when localities can require lawful presence for services. Some services that may be denied to unlawfully present aliens include bus tours, leadership training, rental assistance, health care, access to libraries and parks, and use of day labor centers. The interpretation of \"local public benefit\" and denial of specific benefits will depend on whether they encourage illegal immigration. Services like health care and rental assistance may be considered local public benefits, while access to parks or libraries is less clear. Some state and local measures restricting services to unlawfully present aliens could conflict with federal anti-discrimination laws. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on national origin, which does not require U.S. citizenship. The Supreme Court clarified that national origin refers to birth country or ancestry. The Supreme Court clarified that national origin refers to birth country or ancestry, and Title VII prohibits discrimination based on national origin, regardless of citizenship status. State or local measures restricting employment of unauthorized aliens must comply with Title VII, as discrimination based on citizenship could lead to national origin discrimination. The Fair Housing Act (FHA) also prohibits discrimination in housing sales or rentals based on national origin, similar to Title VII which prohibits discrimination based on citizenship that could lead to national origin discrimination. Employers may inadvertently discriminate on national origin by using citizenship tests as a pretext. The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on national origin, similar to Title VII which prohibits citizenship discrimination that could lead to national origin discrimination. Courts have found that citizenship discrimination does not automatically constitute national origin discrimination under the FHA, but it would be prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin. State or local measures enforcing housing complaints solely based on national origin are impermissible. Landlords complying with ordinances barring unlawfully present aliens from tenancy must avoid national origin discrimination to prevent legal challenges under the FHA. The district court in Lozano v. City of Hazleton dismissed the plaintiffs' facial challenge to a local ordinance targeting unlawfully present aliens, leaving open the possibility of an \"as applied\" challenge. An employment or housing ordinance aimed at unauthorized aliens could potentially violate 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, which prohibits discrimination based on national origin. The curr_chunk discusses the rights of persons within the United States under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, specifically addressing whether unauthorized aliens are protected under the statute. The Supreme Court has recognized unauthorized aliens as \"persons\" under the Fourteenth Amendment, suggesting they may also be protected under \u00a7 1981. This could have implications for potential discrimination challenges against state or governmental actors. Unauthorized aliens may be protected from discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, potentially holding states or localities liable for violations. While the Supreme Court has acknowledged unauthorized aliens as \"persons\" under the Fourteenth Amendment, it remains unclear if \u00a7 1981 prohibits discrimination by private actors. Some courts have ruled that the statute applies to private discrimination against aliens, but the issue remains unsettled. The State of Arizona has enacted measures to test legal limits on unauthorized immigration, including the Legal Arizona Workers Act of 2007. This act requires employers to use E-Verify and suspends or revokes licenses for hiring unauthorized aliens. It has faced legal challenges but its E-Verify and licensing provisions have been upheld by the courts. Arizona has enacted measures to test legal limits on unauthorized immigration, including the Legal Arizona Workers Act of 2007. The E-Verify and licensing provisions of this act have been upheld by the courts. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court regarding provisions related to unauthorized aliens, leading to oral arguments in December 2010. Arizona further sought to deter unauthorized aliens by enacting S.B. 1070 in April 2010, which criminalizes certain conduct related to unlawfully present aliens. Arizona enacted S.B. 1070 in April 2010 to deter unauthorized aliens, including provisions for state and local law enforcement to ascertain immigration status. Enforcement of many provisions has been enjoined by a federal district court due to preemption concerns. Legal challenges have been filed, including claims of potential racial profiling. Arizona's S.B. 1070 was enacted in April 2010 to deter unauthorized aliens, with provisions for law enforcement to check immigration status. Many provisions have been blocked by a federal court due to preemption concerns, leading to legal challenges including claims of racial profiling."
