    "content": "The 115th Congress will face water resource issues related to development, management, and protection. Challenges include making investment decisions with fiscal constraints, maintaining aging federal infrastructure, responding to floods and droughts, and balancing demands for water supplies and ecosystem management. These issues have a federal connection and often arise at the regional level. The report discusses budget limitations, federal project operations' environmental impacts on threatened species, and recent congressional activity. It also covers the federal role in water resources, major agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, and policy issues such as financing infrastructure investments and improving drought and flood preparedness. It does not address municipal water systems or wastewater infrastructure. The 114th Congress focused on federal water resource management agencies and specific water use sectors like energy, agriculture, navigation, recreation, and municipal and industrial use. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act) authorized various water resource and water quality activities, including addressing issues like the California drought and drinking water infrastructure. The WIIN Act authorized 30 new Corps construction projects at a federal cost of over $10 billion and made changes to Corps policies and authorities. It also expanded EPA's authority to operate a credit program for nonfederal water projects. Some provisions of the WIIN Act were controversial. The WIIN Act included controversial provisions related to California drought and Reclamation facility operations, addressing water projects, drought-related programs, and fish and wildlife management. Controversy surrounded how the Act approached Endangered Species Act implementation, particularly regarding federal biological opinions for species protection. Title III of the WIIN Act authorized new water storage projects and ecosystem restoration initiatives, including the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and activities in various river basins. Congress provided more funding for the Corps and Reclamation than requested by the President, with prohibitions on earmarks. The 114th Congress increased funding for Corps and Reclamation projects without earmarks. The 115th Congress may address pending measures and new proposals related to water resource infrastructure investments, federal permitting, and approvals. The 115th Congress may address federal permitting and approvals for water resource projects, oversight of WIIN implementation and funding, authorization of new federal water projects, private infrastructure development, ecosystem and environmental protections, invasive species, regional aquatic ecosystem restoration efforts, and federal navigation improvements in inland waterways and coastal harbors. The 115th Congress may address issues in particular river basins, such as federal reservoir operations and endangered species designations. River basins of interest include the Sacramento, San Joaquin, Missouri, Colorado, Klamath, Rio Grande, and Columbia Rivers. The 115th Congress may oversee ecosystem restoration efforts in various regions, including the Everglades, Gulf Coast, and Great Lakes. They may also address concerns about water quality, endangered species protection, and the effects of drought and floods on habitats. Additionally, Congress may respond to updated planning guidance for federal water projects and efforts to incorporate climate change adaptation into agency plans. The 115th Congress may consider federal efforts to restore large-scale aquatic ecosystems impacted by development and water projects in regions like the Everglades, Bay-Delta, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, Chesapeake Bay, and Klamath Basin. Legislation for governance frameworks and restoration plans may be addressed. The 115th Congress may focus on legislation for governance frameworks and restoration plans for aquatic ecosystems like the Salton Sea, Everglades, and Gulf Coast. Funding challenges for restoration initiatives may be addressed, with a potential emphasis on evaluating efficiency and effectiveness of existing projects. Ecosystem restoration efforts may be evaluated for water resource management and conservation of listed species. The federal government has long been involved in efforts to facilitate navigation, expand irrigation, and reduce flood and drought losses in large river basins across the country. Federal projects by the Corps and Reclamation include dams and navigation projects. Recent federal involvement also includes municipal water supply development, protection of water-related resources, and support for recreation. Increasing pressures on water supplies have led to conflicts, especially in the West and Southeast, due to factors like population growth and environmental concerns. Congress plays a significant role in water resources management, addressing issues such as population growth, environmental regulation, water contamination, and climate change. They are responsible for authorizing and funding regional projects, while also sharing responsibilities with state and local governments. Congress sets policies for federal water projects and allocates funds for construction and maintenance within the context of conflicting objectives. Congress makes decisions on water resource management within the context of conflicting objectives, legal decisions, institutional mechanisms, and events like floods and droughts. The number of federal water construction activities decreased in the late 20th century due to fiscal constraints, changing priorities, limited construction locations, and environmental impacts. Recent droughts, floods, and other factors continue to influence decision-making. Recent drought, flood, and development pressures have led to increased proposals for federal financial assistance for new water infrastructure projects. Large dams and water diversion structures in the US were mainly built by Reclamation or the Corps for irrigation, navigation, flood control, and other benefits. Reclamation manages dams and reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water to millions of acres of farmland and people. The Corps of Engineers operates nationwide, providing water to farmland and people, operating power plants generating electricity, and constructing flood damage reduction and navigation projects. They maintain thousands of miles of waterways, harbors, dams, and reservoirs, as well as levees. The Corps of Engineers operates and maintains 900 miles of levees, with the rest managed by nonfederal entities. The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service also assists in water resources development for flood control and conservation. Various federal agencies have water-related programs, but this report focuses on the Corps' projects, programs, and policies. The report focuses on the projects, programs, and policies of the Corps and Reclamation, including activities related to navigation, flood control, and ecosystem restoration projects. Congress authorizes Corps water resource activities in an omnibus authorization bill. For more information on federal water projects and programs, refer to CRS Report RL30478 and CRS Report R42653. The Corps authorizes water resource activities through an omnibus bill, typically titled as a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), enacted biennially. Recent bills in 2014 and 2016 authorized new studies and projects based on Administration recommendations. Corps facilities, like reservoir management in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, are often contentious. Congress funds Corps activities through annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts and sometimes uses supplemental bills for emergency activities. The 115th Congress may address Corps-related issues such as funding for response and recovery for coastal and riverine floods, efficacy of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, investments in deepening coastal harbors, and Corps policies on water-supply storage pricing. The curr_chunk discusses various topics related to the Corps projects in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, including water supply, public-private partnerships, tribal consultation policies, easements, flood risk reduction, coastal flood risk, budgeting, recreational policies, and security of Corps facilities. It also mentions Reclamation's construction of large water projects like Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. Reclamation projects like Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam primarily provide water for irrigation, hydropower, and flood damage reduction. In 1987, Reclamation shifted its focus to managing water resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner. Increased population, drought, fiscal constraints, and various water demands have led to controversial alterations in project operations and allocations. Reclamation projects face controversy over water rights, contractual obligations, and local economies. Unlike the Corps, there is no regular authorization vehicle for Reclamation projects. Project authorizations have slowed since the 112th Congress due to congressional earmark moratoria. Reclamation facilities are central to debates over river management during drought and climate change. During droughts, Reclamation water management in various river basins faces controversies exacerbated by low water flows, leading to extended litigation. Issues with pumps in the Bay-Delta affecting water users and endangered species have been particularly contentious during California's recent drought since 2012. Provisions in the WIIN Act address some of these disputes. Key Reclamation-related water project and management issues for the 115th Congress include drought response, water storage projects, Safety of Dams program, aging infrastructure, water reliability in Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley, Colorado River management, Indian water rights settlements, and Klamath River Basin issues. Congress may also focus on oversight of Reclamation's mission and future role in western water supply. The 115th Congress is focusing on key Reclamation-related water project and management issues, including drought response, water storage projects, Safety of Dams program, aging infrastructure, water reliability in Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley, Colorado River management, Indian water rights settlements, and Klamath River Basin issues. Congress is also overseeing Reclamation's mission and its future role in western water supply. The WIIN Act authorized federal support for Reclamation projects in a new financing model, allowing Reclamation to pay up to 50% and 25% of the costs of new federal and nonfederal water resource projects, respectively. These new authorities may impact the financial requirements and types of projects prioritized for federal support. The WIIN Act granted the Secretary of the Interior authority to construct certain Reclamation projects with specific appropriations. Congress has increased funding for alternative water technologies like recycling, aquifer storage, and desalination to address water shortages in the West. The 115th Congress is also addressing water resource policy issues such as infrastructure financing, federal partnerships, and project funding. The aging U.S. water infrastructure, including dams, locks, and levees, requires major capital investments to prevent failure with significant local and national impacts. Despite increased funding needs over time, comprehensive federal funding solutions have not been enacted, leading to proposals for alternative funding mechanisms such as loan programs or modifications for infrastructure projects. Some propose alternative funding mechanisms like loan programs or using project revenues to fund infrastructure repairs and upgrades. The 114th Congress considered legislation for increased reporting on aging infrastructure backlog. Additionally, there are calls for expanded authorities and funding for water infrastructure investments. Some stakeholders advocate for expanded authorities and increased funding for water infrastructure investments, including alternative technologies and nonstructural approaches. Frustration has been expressed over the slow pace of authorization and federal funding for water resource projects. The WIIN Act recently authorized increased nonfederal contributions to Reclamation project costs. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) expanded nonfederal entities' ability to fund Corps projects, raising questions about federal funding levels, local sponsor financing, and project selection. Title X of WRRDA 2014 introduced the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program, authorized by the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, provides loans and loan guarantees for flood damage reduction, water supply, and wastewater projects. Modeled after the TIFIA program for transportation projects, WIFIA was expanded in the WIIN Act to address drought mitigation. The EPA portion of the program is funded, while the Corps' portion remains unfunded. Funding for water resource projects is often debated in congressionally directed spending discussions. The earmark moratoria in Congress have impacted the funding and authorization of water resource projects, leading to changes in how projects are funded and supported. Some projects that previously received congressional support have seen reduced or zero funding in recent appropriations bills. There have been proposals to exempt Corps and Reclamation projects from earmark moratoria. Congress may consider exempting Corps and Reclamation projects from earmark moratoria and providing additional funding for restoration activities in various ecosystems, including the Everglades, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, California Bay-Delta, Chesapeake Bay, Salton Sea, and Klamath Basin. Legislation may be considered for governance and comprehensive restoration plans, with oversight over implementation activities. Congress may focus on evaluating existing and newly authorized restoration initiatives to determine efficiency in fund allocation and achievement of objectives. Ecosystem restoration efforts will be assessed for balancing water resource demands and species conservation needs, amidst potential challenges in funding and decision-making in the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress may address drought planning and preparedness through oversight hearings or drought policy legislation, as no overarching national drought policy currently exists. Responsibilities for drought planning are divided among different levels of government and federal agencies, with the National Integrated Drought Information System coordinating drought information. The ongoing widespread drought in California since 2012 has led to various impacts like water supply limitations, reduced agricultural production, and degraded wildlife habitat. The 115th Congress may address drought planning and preparedness through oversight hearings or legislation. Responsibilities for drought planning are divided among different levels of government and federal agencies. The ongoing drought in California since 2012 has led to water supply limitations, reduced agricultural production, and degraded wildlife habitat. Congressional attention also focuses on periodic flooding, with various agencies involved in flood response and mitigation efforts. State and local governments play a primary role in floodplain management. The 115th Congress may consider ways to reduce flood risk by improving infrastructure, protecting natural flood mitigation, and promoting pre-disaster recovery plans for vulnerable areas."
