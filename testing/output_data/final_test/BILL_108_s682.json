    "content": "The Genomes to Life Research and Development Act may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Genomes to Life initiative by the Department of Energy focuses on systems biology and proteomics to understand biochemical networks in living organisms. It builds on the Human Genome Project to study genetic interactions for cellular activities crucial to life and addresses national security, energy, and environmental challenges through science and technology. The 21st century will be driven by science and technology, with a focus on understanding biological systems for developing new technologies related to detection of biological and chemical agents, energy production, carbon sequestration, and bioremediation. These advances will strengthen U.S. science, technology, and medicine. Public support for research and development is needed for significant advances in areas such as multiprotein complexes and gene regulatory networks. The development of new scientific instruments and specialized facilities will be required to advance Genomes to Life research. Contributions from individual researchers and multidisciplinary research teams are necessary to advance systems biology and proteomics. The Department of Energy's Office of Science is well-suited to manage systems biology and proteomics research. It is the principal federal supporter of research in physical and computational sciences, genomics, and life sciences. The Office supports research by individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams, as well as manages special user facilities for researchers in both university and industry.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY PROGRAM. The Secretary will implement the Genomes to Life Program in systems biology and proteomics. The program plan will focus on developing knowledge and capabilities for energy, environmental cleanup, and climate change mitigation. Long-term goals include U.S. energy independence. The Genomes to Life Program aims to address key issues such as identifying new biological sources of fuels and electricity, understanding the Earth's natural carbon cycle, and stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to counter global warming. The program also focuses on advancing environmental cleanup and providing the science and technology basis for new industries in biotechnology within the next decade. The Genomes to Life Program aims to address key issues such as identifying new biological sources of fuels and electricity, understanding the Earth's natural carbon cycle, stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and developing cost-effective cleanup strategies for Department sites. The program also focuses on capturing key biological processes in engineered systems and supporting technology transfer activities. The Genomes to Life Program aims to address key issues such as identifying new biological sources of fuels and electricity, understanding the Earth's natural carbon cycle, stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and developing cost-effective cleanup strategies for Department sites. It also supports technology transfer activities to benefit industry and other users of systems biology and proteomics. Coordination with industry and federal agencies is essential, and funds are awarded based on scientific and technical merit after impartial review. Funds are available for projects to develop special equipment, instrumentation, or facilities for research purposes. The Genomes to Life Program supports research in systems biology and proteomics, focusing on projects like identifying multiprotein complexes, characterizing gene regulatory networks, studying microbial communities, and developing computational methods. Facilities may include those for production and characterization of biological components. The Secretary encourages collaborations among universities, laboratories, and industry at facilities for protein production, proteome analysis, molecular machine imaging, and cellular systems modeling. All facilities have a mission of technology transfer to other institutions.
