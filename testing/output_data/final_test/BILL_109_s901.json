The \"Flexibility for Champion Schools Act\" allows states to receive waivers for provisions related to adequate yearly progress under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. States must meet certain requirements, including establishing academic content standards in reading, writing, and mathematics. The State must establish academic content standards in mathematics, writing, science, United States history, and civics, and test students in these subjects at least once in elementary, middle, and secondary school. The State must make the results of student testing available to the public, aggregated and disaggregated by student groups, as required by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The State sets pass-rate goals on tests for each school and local educational agency, determined by the State educational agency and not subject to change by the Department. The State determines conditions for students with disabilities and limited English proficiency to take tests, complying with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Schools and local educational agencies are held accountable by the State. The State holds schools and local educational agencies accountable for meeting pass-rate goals and addressing achievement gaps on State tests. Consequences are determined for those that fail to meet the goals, with the State's decision being final.
