    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consortia-Led Energy Advancement Networks Act\" or the \"CLEAN Act\". It establishes clean energy consortia. The Secretary will establish Clean Energy Consortia to promote clean energy technology, maintain a technological lead, and support collaborative research and development with various stakeholders. Clean energy technology encompasses energy production from various renewable resources, energy transmission efficiency, energy storage improvements, enhanced energy efficiency for buildings and industry, and the development of a Smart Grid integrating renewable energy sources and demand response. The term \"cluster\" refers to a network of entities involved in the research, development, finance, and commercial application of clean energy technologies, facilitating the sharing of resources and expertise. A Clean Energy Consortium is defined as a group supporting projects related to clean energy technologies, with qualifying entities including research universities, government institutions, and NGOs. The Secretary of Energy oversees this initiative. The Secretary of Energy has ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Clean Energy Consortium program. They select grant recipients through a competitive process and coordinate innovation activities with other Department of Energy entities. The Consortium specializes in unique clean energy technologies and conducts translational research to commercialize energy technology. Entities eligible for support under this section include consortia composed of 2 research universities, which receive guidance on national energy research priorities and convene conferences to share research results and collaborate with other Department of Energy entities and industry representatives. Entities eligible for support under this section must consist of 2 research universities with a combined annual research budget of $500,000,000, along with additional qualifying entities. These entities must have a binding agreement outlining the partnership structure, governance, conflicts of interest policy, accounting structure meeting Department of Energy requirements, and an External Advisory Committee. Funding must also be received from States and consortiums. Clean Energy Consortia support translational research activities for commercial application of clean energy technologies. They issue awards to qualifying entities and operate as nonprofit organizations. Funding is received from States, consortium participants, or other non-Federal sources. Each Consortium must develop and publish proposed projects on the Department of Energy's website. The Department of Energy's website outlines plans, programs, project selection criteria, and terms for project awards. Conflict of interest procedures are established to ensure transparency in decision-making. Policies are in place to prevent Consortium resources from displacing private sector investment. The Consortium oversees project solicitations, reviews proposed projects, and selects projects for awards, including investment from private sector entities. Private entities investing in clean energy technologies participate in due diligence, award review, and provide guidance. Parties with a history of commercial application of clean energy technologies also contribute to Consortium projects. The Consortium oversees project solicitations, reviews proposed projects, and selects projects for awards, including investment from private sector entities. Consortia distribute awards to support clean energy technology projects conducting translational research, with a focus on specific technology areas. Each Consortium establishes an External Advisory Committee with members having relevant scientific and technical expertise. The External Advisory Committee oversees the Consortium's plans, programs, project selection criteria, and project awards to ensure compliance with conflict of interest policies. Committee members, excluding those representing Consortium members, serve for a maximum of 3 years and must adhere to conflict of interest policies. The Committee consists of 5 members selected by the Consortium. The External Advisory Committee oversees the Consortium's plans, programs, and project awards to ensure compliance with conflict of interest policies. Committee members serve for a maximum of 3 years and must adhere to conflict of interest policies. The Committee consists of 5 members selected by the Consortium, 2 members selected by other qualifying entities, 2 members selected at large by other Committee members, and 1 member appointed by the Secretary. The Secretary may disqualify an application or revoke funds if conflict of interest procedures are not followed. Grants are made in accordance with the Energy Policy Act. The Secretary will award grants to 6 regional Consortia on a competitive basis for up to 5 years, with a possible extension of 5 additional years. Grants will not exceed $120,000,000 per fiscal year and must be used exclusively to support project awards. The grants awarded to Consortia must be used exclusively to support project awards, with a limit of 10 percent for administrative expenses. Construction of new buildings or facilities is not allowed, and annual audits are required to ensure compliance with the grant usage. The Secretary must transmit audit reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office. The GAO can review audits and has full access to Consortia's records. The Secretary can revoke awards if a Consortium misuses them."
