    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Flexible Pell Grant for 21st Century Students Act\" and introduces Flexible Pell Grants. The \"Flexible Pell Grant for 21st Century Students Act\" introduces amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding Federal Pell Grants. Eligible students can now receive additional Pell Grants if enrolled in an eligible program for extra payment periods, not exceeding 150 percent of the original grant amount. The institution must inform students that Pell Grants count towards duration limits. An eligible student must meet requirements and accelerate progress. Progress is defined by completing credit hours in an academic year. The financial aid administrator may waive the requirement for a student to complete credit hours if circumstances beyond their control prevented them from doing so. The financial aid administrator can waive credit hour requirements for students in cases of circumstances beyond their control, such as illness or unavailability of necessary classes. The term 'academic year' in relation to an eligible program at an institution is defined by the institution. If a student receives a Federal Pell Grant spanning 2 award years, the institution determines the award year for the additional period. Students can choose to decline part of a Federal Pell Grant for a payment period, with the institution setting a reasonable deadline for this. The Secretary must provide an annual status report to each student receiving a Federal Pell Grant. The annual status report for Federal Pell Grant recipients includes information on remaining eligibility, estimated grant amounts, calculation details, potential impact of changes in financial circumstances or funding availability, and an explanation of how the estimate was determined. The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) shall apply with respect to award years beginning on or after July 1, 2017."
