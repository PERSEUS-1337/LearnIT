    "content": "The report examines the FBI's intelligence program reform, focusing on its implementation in the field and the acceptance of intelligence policy. It addresses Congress's interest in the FBI's progress and suggests options for further changes. Appendices provide contextual information on FBI intelligence reform post-9/11 attacks. The FBI has introduced reforms to transform into a more intelligence-driven agency to prevent terrorism. Director Robert S. Mueller III aims to centralize control over fragmented intelligence capabilities and improve the FBI's intelligence program. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, Director Robert S. Mueller III has restructured the FBI's intelligence program by creating a new Directorate of Intelligence (DI) at Headquarters and establishing Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) at each of the FBI's 56 field offices to enhance the Bureau's intelligence capacity. This effort has been part of broader intelligence reform initiatives following the 2001 attacks, with Congress passing legislation to provide the FBI with additional authorities in the Intelligence Community. The FBI has implemented changes in response to criticism of its intelligence activities related to counterterrorism. Before 9/11, the FBI was unable to produce significant intelligence products and struggled to address the terrorist threat. The 9/11 Commission supported the reforms initiated by the FBI. The 9/11 Commission endorsed FBI reforms post-9/11, emphasizing improved intelligence capabilities under Director Mueller. It recommended an integrated national security workforce within the Bureau, consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists. The Commission rejected the idea of a separate domestic intelligence agency. The 9/11 Commission endorsed FBI reforms post-9/11, emphasizing improved intelligence capabilities under Director Mueller. It recommended an integrated national security workforce within the Bureau, consisting of agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists. The Commission rejected the idea of a separate domestic intelligence agency. President Bush approved the recommendation for the establishment of an integrated national security workforce at the FBI. A security workforce at the FBI, including agents, analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists, is recommended for improved intelligence capabilities. President Bush approved the establishment of this workforce and instructed the Attorney General and FBI Director to provide a comprehensive plan within 90 days. The plan addresses analysis, products, sources, and field issues. The FBI responded to a White House Memorandum by issuing a classified report outlining steps taken for the FBI Intelligence Program. The report addressed performance measures in five areas including resources, authority, and intelligence operations. The FBI's classified report analyzed by the WMD Commission highlighted shortcomings in the DI's integration with national security efforts, lack of authority, and failure to create a specialized workforce. The WMD Commission recommended a fluid system for coordination between the FBI and CIA in collecting foreign intelligence within the United States. It criticized the FBI for not promoting integrated intelligence efforts and engaging in unnecessary turf battles with the CIA. The WMD Commission recommended the establishment of a National Security Service within the FBI, following the rejection of creating a separate agency for domestic intelligence collection. This decision was supported by the President in a memorandum issued on June 29, 2005. The President supported the creation of a new National Security Service within the FBI, combining counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and intelligence divisions. The service would be under the coordination of the DNI and subject to the Attorney General's authorities. The Attorney General, in collaboration with the DNI and other agencies, was directed to implement specific initiatives for the new National Security Service. The White House directed the creation of an FBI National Security Service, to be funded through the National Intelligence Program and to establish workforce programs. The organization will be headed by an FBI Executive Assistant Director or equivalent, with a yet-to-be-determined relationship with the DNI. The White House memorandum establishing the National Security Service is vague about the DNI's authority over the new entity. Procedures for communication between the DNI and the FBI's National Security Service will determine the extent of the DNI's influence. The lack of clarity regarding the DNI's authority over the new National Security Service has led to contradictory comments from executive officials. General Hayden referenced his past dual-hatted role, suggesting the new FBI intelligence chief must be sensitive to both the DNI and FBI director. However, a Department of Justice official stated that the Director of the National Security Service's reporting structure remains unclear. The Director of the National Security Service will report to the Director of the FBI and have a relationship with the Director of National Intelligence on budget issues. The DNI's authority over the FBI's new intelligence chief is described as 'communicate with' rather than 'issues orders to'. This relationship could represent a significant change from past practice where the former Director of Central Intelligence largely deferred to the FBI director on intelligence operations. The FBI's relationship with the Director of National Intelligence and the creation of a National Security Service within the FBI have raised concerns among civil liberties groups. The Attorney General is required to report on the progress of implementing new procedures within 180 days. The true impact of these changes may not be fully understood until months after implementation. Timothy Edgar from the ACLU expressed concerns about the proposal to create a National Security Service within the FBI, fearing it could undermine constitutional rights and lead to political manipulation. Critics worry about the potential erosion of the FBI's law enforcement ethic and the agency falling under the control of a spymaster reporting directly to the president. Attorney General Gonzalez stated that the DNI will control the FBI's intelligence budget, but intelligence officials will not direct law enforcement. Despite some criticism, many believe the FBI has taken a sound approach to intelligence reform. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act emphasizes improving the FBI's intelligence capabilities and establishing a national intelligence workforce within the Bureau. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act strengthened the FBI's intelligence program by giving the director supervision over national intelligence projects. The act also provided new personnel authorities and recruitment measures for the FBI. While some believe the FBI's reform efforts were successful, the WMD Commissioners recommended creating an integrated National Security Service within the Bureau for a more effective approach to intelligence operations. The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) recommended that the FBI focus on intelligence management and not get bogged down by operational tasks. They also suggested that the FBI rely on other American intelligence agencies for foreign intelligence collection and vice versa. The Public Discourse Project (PDP), established by former Commissioners of the National Commission on the Terrorist Attacks, aims to assess the progress of intelligence reform post-9/11. PDP plans to issue a report card on the implementation status of the Commission's recommendations, with a focus on FBI and CIA reforms. The first panel discussion highlighted the FBI's progress in intelligence dissemination but lack of improvement in other areas. The FBI has shown progress in intelligence dissemination but lacks improvement in other areas, such as information technology. There is still a lack of clarity and diffused accountability among agencies responsible for counterterrorism intelligence. FBI intelligence analysts are sometimes treated poorly, and there are differing opinions on whether the FBI should retain its domestic intelligence mission. The Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General released a report on how the FBI handled intelligence information before 9/11, which highlighted ongoing issues. The DOJ OIG report highlighted systemic problems within the FBI related to counterterrorism investigations, including information sharing issues between the CIA and FBI, inadequate oversight, lack of understanding of CIA procedures, inconsistent documentation of intelligence, lack of priority given to counterterrorism, and the impact of the wall on FBI criminal investigations. The DOJ OIG Report highlighted issues in FBI counterterrorism investigations, including CIA-FBI information sharing problems. House and Senate committees approved FY2006 FBI spending bills, calling for more progress in intelligence program reforms. House Appropriations Committee recommended implementing WMD Commission recommendations. The House panel directed the Attorney General to create a new position within the FBI for National Security oversight. The Administration agreed to let the Director of National Intelligence help choose a powerful intelligence chief at the FBI. The details of the new service and its chief's authorities are still unclear. The President has given the DNI concurrence authority with the FBI Director in filling the new position. The FBI has undergone significant changes since the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act, with the Director of National Intelligence now having authority in selecting a senior FBI official for national security oversight. Despite a substantial budget increase, the FBI has yet to realign its workforce to prioritize counterterrorism efforts. The FBI has enhanced its national security and intelligence training but lacks capacity to train new hires adequately. The Committee recommends additional funding for the Directorate of Intelligence and a new regional intelligence and training center. There is debate over whether the FBI's reforms are sufficient, with some suggesting the need for a separate domestic intelligence service. The debate over the FBI's intelligence reforms includes differing views on the need for a separate domestic intelligence service independent of the FBI. One school of thought believes the FBI's vision for reform is sound but faces capacity constraints, while another school of thought argues that the FBI's reform vision is fundamentally flawed. Key issues include personnel recruitment, morale building, training, and retention measures. The debate over FBI's intelligence reforms includes differing views on the need for a separate domestic intelligence service independent of the FBI. One school of thought believes the FBI's reform vision is fundamentally flawed, lacking full control over all elements of the intelligence cycle. The optimists argue that the FBI has a coherent vision for integrating its criminal and national security missions, making organizational and budgetary changes. The FBI is making organizational, business process, and budgetary changes to implement policy and legal changes. Adherents believe the FBI can meet national security demands by overcoming hurdles such as capacity limitations. Some argue that additional resources may not be necessary for the FBI's budget. The skeptics doubt the effectiveness of the FBI's budget increase from $3.1 billion in FY2000 to $5.7 billion for FY2006, questioning the synergy between law enforcement and intelligence in counterterrorism efforts. They argue that the FBI's vision for intelligence reform is flawed, with limited personnel and budget constraints hindering progress. The FBI's newly created Directorate of Intelligence faces constraints in personnel and budget control, with limited oversight over intelligence activities and collection. Some suggest integrating intelligence analysis and collection, while others propose establishing a separate domestic intelligence agency. Director Mueller pledged to refocus FBI efforts after the 9/11 attacks. Director Mueller vowed to refocus FBI efforts post-9/11, prioritizing counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber crime. He aimed to enhance intelligence capabilities by centralizing control, emphasizing intelligence as core to the FBI's mission. Plans included establishing dedicated staffing for intelligence agents and improving the intelligence cycle. The FBI implemented changes post-9/11 to strengthen its intelligence capabilities, including assigning agents as collectors, target developers, and reporters, incorporating a strategic intelligence unit, analysis into each FIG, and integrating partners fully. They also added an ASAC for each Field Office to guide the national security mission. The FBI made organizational changes post-9/11 to enhance its intelligence program, including establishing the Office of Intelligence (now DI), Field Intelligence Groups in all field offices, hiring more analysts and Special Agents for intelligence, creating new training and information systems. The restructuring aims to support an integrated intelligence program, with new positions and entities being formed by the FBI Director. The impact of the newly appointed EAD for National Security on these changes is uncertain. The FBI Director has established new intelligence-related positions and entities to enhance the Bureau's intelligence capacity. The Directorate of Intelligence (DI) within the FBI manages intelligence collection and analysis, develops sources to fill gaps, and standardizes dissemination procedures. The FBI has established the Directorate of Intelligence to centralize control over its intelligence program, following steps taken since the 9/11 attacks to improve intelligence operations. This includes creating a dedicated analysis section and centralizing the Counterterrorism intelligence program under a new Office of Intelligence. Director Mueller took three additional actions to centralize control over the FBI's intelligence program. He directed the Office of Intelligence to implement an integrated FBI-wide intelligence strategy, elevated intelligence to full program status, and established the new position of Executive Assistant Director for Intelligence (EAD-I). This included managing a single intelligence program across the FBI's four investigative/operational divisions and establishing a new Office of Intelligence (OI). The Office of Intelligence (OI), now known as the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) by Congress, was established to implement an integrated FBI-wide intelligence strategy, develop career paths for intelligence analysts, improve strategic analysis, oversee intelligence requirements and collection, ensure intelligence sharing within the FBI and with other agencies, and manage FBI's participation in the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). The DI, led by an Assistant Director reporting to the EAD-I, consists of six units focusing on various intelligence functions. Director Mueller has emphasized the importance of the EAD-I, now the DI, in overseeing FBI intelligence functions and implementing new authorities. The DI, led by an Assistant Director under the EAD-I, consists of six units focusing on intelligence functions. The Office of Intelligence oversees FBI intelligence functions and adjusts resources based on national requirements. Critics argue that the lack of authority within the EAD-I is a concern, particularly in controlling FIG analysts and intelligence resources. The DI's control over field offices' counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations is also questioned. The FBI's intelligence program underwent significant changes, with the establishment of Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) in each field office being a key reform. The Commission found that the Directorate lacks authority in directing intelligence gathering and controls only a small portion of the Bureau's intelligence spending. The FIGs, comprised of analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists, play a crucial role in improving the FBI's intelligence operations at the field level. The FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) consist of analysts, linguists, and surveillance specialists responsible for field intelligence operations under FBI headquarters' direction. Formerly, Bureau intelligence analysts were mainly involved in day-to-day tasks, but FIGs now focus on tactical analysis, intelligence collection, report dissemination, and security. Reports officers sift through raw intelligence to determine dissemination within the FBI and other agencies. The FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) aim to integrate law enforcement and intelligence operations in the field by establishing intelligence units in each office. They also seek to elevate the importance of analysts within the FBI culture and empower them to analyze available intelligence and direct special agents to fill gaps in intelligence collection. The FBI's Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) progress through three phases, similar to software releases, with versions \"1.0 through 3.0.\" In version \"1.0,\" analysts are brought together and new analysts are hired. Version \"2.0\" involves managing the intelligence cycle and analyzing/disseminating collected intelligence. In version \"3.0,\" special agents are tasked to collect intelligence against identified gaps. The FBI's goal of giving analysts authority to task special agents is uncertain. The FBI's goal of analysts having authority to task special agents remains uncertain. The 9/11 Commission and WMD Commission noted analysts still perform menial tasks, indicating the FBI may be falling short of this goal. Despite some progress, analysts often lack the institutional standing to direct special agents for intelligence collection. The FBI is still primarily driven by investigations, with special agents determining intelligence collection. Analysts can direct special agents if they have credibility, but institutional authority from FIGs is lacking. The success of the FIGs is attributed to the credibility analysts have in directing intelligence collection. The FBI uses a structured requirements process to prioritize intelligence collection, focusing on filling gaps in understanding terrorism. The FBI instructs special agents to collect intelligence to fill gaps in understanding domestic terrorism. Unclassified versions are shared with state and local law enforcement to broaden intelligence collection. The requirements process is seen as a positive development, but field agents' acceptance will depend on their willingness to conform to a more formal intelligence process. Intelligence priorities are set by analysts, with special agents responsible for gathering necessary intelligence. A key aspect of an effective intelligence organization is aligning collection resources with national priorities and gaps. The intelligence cycle involves regular interaction between analysts and collectors to incorporate new information and refine collection requirements. The 9/11 Commission expressed concerns about gaps between announced reforms and actual practices in field offices, where resources could be allocated to local issues instead of national security missions. The FBI faces challenges in prioritizing national security requirements over lower-priority criminal justice cases. Field offices may prioritize law enforcement over intelligence-gathering, despite efforts to align collection resources with national priorities. There is mixed acceptance of the intelligence requirements process, with some believing special agents are better suited to determine intelligence collection needs. The formal intelligence collection process is still in its early stages, with room for improvement in harnessing intelligence to address identified gaps. The FBI is facing challenges in prioritizing national security requirements over lower-priority criminal justice cases. Some officials rely on reactive intelligence collection rather than fitting information into existing requirements, raising questions about the effectiveness of FBI intelligence analysts and the new FIG structures. The cultural change necessary for an effective and formalized intelligence cycle remains to be seen. The FBI is working on implementing a formalized intelligence cycle, focusing on tactical and strategic analysis and dissemination of intelligence. The WMD Commission noted progress in tactical analysis but expressed concern about lagging strategic capabilities. Analysts are historically focused on tactical support, with limited time for strategic analysis. The FBI is facing challenges in allocating time for analysts to conduct long-term strategic analysis, leading to a lack of strategic analysis compared to the CIA. Despite an increase in Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs) dissemination, there is still a shortage of strategic assessments. Field offices handle analytical functions differently, with some needing more staff for strategic analysis. The FBI established a National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) in July 2002 to coordinate its network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and Counterterrorism Watch. Critics argue that local FIG management may not be allocating enough resources to strategic analysis, which is a core principle of FBI intelligence reform. The FBI's Counterterrorism Watch (CT Watch) tracks terrorist threats and shares information with JTTFs, DHS, and local law enforcement. The number of JTTFs has increased from 35 to 103 since 2001, with over 5,000 participants. The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was established in 2003 to issue threat assessments based on intelligence analysis from various federal agencies. The FBI established the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) in accordance with P.L. 108-458, transferring functions from the Terrorist Threat Integration Center. The NCTC had over 600 employees by early 2005, with the FBI criticized for intelligence sharing failures. Director Mueller created the Executive Assistant Director for Law to address these issues. The FBI established the Executive Assistant Director for Law Enforcement Services to improve intelligence sharing with state and local law enforcement. The agency is formalizing its intelligence program by embracing the traditional intelligence cycle. The FBI established the Executive Assistant Director for Law Enforcement Services to enhance intelligence sharing with state and local law enforcement. The agency is formalizing its intelligence program by implementing a strategic plan to improve intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination processes. The FBI is working to improve its intelligence cycle by enhancing its functional capabilities and integrating with its IC counterparts. Despite changes, observers believe that structural and cultural factors are hindering the establishment of an integrated intelligence cycle. The success of this effort may rely on the performance of the Directorate of Intelligence in managing intelligence collection, production, and dissemination within the FBI. The FBI has established field demonstration projects to assess intelligence capabilities at field offices and make recommendations for improvements. Congress has approved significant increases in FBI spending, with a budget of $5.7 billion requested for FY2006 to finance new positions. The FBI has requested $5.7 billion for FY2006 to finance 2,086 new positions, including 615 Agents and 508 Intelligence Analysts. The House Appropriations Committee supports the increase but is concerned about the imbalance between funding for staff and infrastructure improvements. The FBI requested $5.7 billion for FY2006 to add 2,086 new positions, including 615 Agents and 508 Intelligence Analysts. The panel reduced personnel funding to 1,629 new positions and allocated the difference to various programs. Despite the increase in analyst hires, infrastructure support for Bureau analysts is still lacking in critical areas. The FBI has hired new analysts but lacks infrastructure support, leading to retention issues. Despite a decrease in turnover, 35% of analysts hired since 2002 do not plan to stay for the next five years. This could be due to inadequate funding for infrastructure support. The FBI faces retention issues with analysts, as 270 out of 777 hired since FY2003 are expected to leave in the next five years. The Department of Justice OIG found that analysts with advanced degrees are more likely to leave within two years of being hired. There is a challenge in balancing analytic resources between counterterrorism and criminal investigations, despite Director Mueller prioritizing counterterrorism. The FBI faces retention issues with analysts, as many are expected to leave in the next five years. There is a challenge in balancing analytic resources between counterterrorism and criminal investigations, despite Director Mueller prioritizing counterterrorism. The deployment of analytic resources does not reflect this priority, with a significant portion dedicated to supporting criminal investigations. The FBI justifies this by stating that information from criminal cases often leads to important leads in counterterrorism cases. The FBI has enhanced human resource authorities provided by the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The FBI faces retention issues with analysts, as many are expected to leave in the next five years. To address this, P.L. 108-447 provided funding for new positions for intelligence analysts and the establishment of an FBI Ready Reserve Service. The FBI also increased the mandatory retirement age and offered retention and relocation bonuses to employees with unique qualifications. Despite efforts to establish Senior Intelligence Officer positions, only half of the announced positions are focused on regional and/or functional threats. The FBI is creating Senior Intelligence Officer positions in various geographic and functional areas, pending approval in August 2005. These positions include roles in counterterrorism, counterintelligence, global crime, and financial intelligence. There may be challenges in how these new positions will interact with existing roles in congressional affairs, information technology, and legal issues. Questions may arise regarding the influence of these new positions in national security and intelligence policy disputes. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to oversee the Intelligence Community. One key issue for the DNI is assessing the FBI's intelligence program reforms, including centralized decision-making, implementation challenges, congressional oversight, and resource adequacy. FBI's new centralized management structure under Director Mueller aims to enhance intelligence priorities and coordination between headquarters and field offices for effective counterterrorism efforts. Director Mueller has implemented six key structural changes to centralize authority within the FBI, including establishing a new DI with broad authority, creating an Office of Intelligence, and forming a National Security Branch to integrate with the Intelligence Community. This aims to improve decision-making and enhance the FBI's ability to address critical issues. Centralizing decision-making at the FBI will address critical weaknesses identified by the JIC Inquiry. It will improve intelligence correlation, strengthen analysis capabilities, enhance internal and external intelligence sharing, and enforce intelligence priorities in the field. Director Mueller has implemented structural changes to achieve this goal. The FBI is shifting focus towards collecting and analyzing intelligence to prevent terrorist acts, aiming to improve intelligence program, establish priorities at field offices, and enhance headquarters-field coordination. Centralized decision-making is seen as a way to achieve these goals, with supporters optimistic about progress in the next few years, while skeptics question its effectiveness. Skeptics doubt that structural changes can overcome the FBI's entrenched law enforcement culture and lack of intelligence experience, hindering the effectiveness of centralized decision-making at FBI Headquarters. Former Attorney General Janet Reno considered closing down surveillance under FISA if it hindered criminal cases, as law enforcement priorities often prevail over intelligence. FBI field personnel may focus more on prosecuting criminal cases with longer jail terms, leading to intelligence being used to support criminal investigations rather than counterterrorism efforts. Skeptics doubt the FBI's ability to overcome its law enforcement culture and lack of intelligence experience. Skeptics doubt the FBI's ability to shift its law enforcement culture towards prioritizing intelligence in preventing terrorism. They question the Bureau's understanding of collecting and analyzing intelligence on potential counterterrorism targets, suggesting that centralized decision-making may not correct this deficiency. Critics doubt the FBI's ability to collect intelligence on potential counterterrorism targets effectively. They argue that despite efforts to develop detailed collection requirements, agents may still gather evidence for criminal cases instead of focusing on strategic intelligence needs. Critics fear that without a strategic approach to intelligence collection, the FBI will continue to prioritize quantity over quality in gathering information. The FBI faces challenges in implementing reforms to shift focus towards strategic intelligence analysis and filling intelligence gaps. Transforming the entrenched law enforcement culture to prioritize intelligence in counterterrorism and counterintelligence is a fundamental challenge. Effective reform implementation will be crucial for success, requiring recruitment of intelligence professionals with operational and analytical skills. The FBI must implement programs to recruit intelligence professionals with operational and analytical expertise, establish formal career development paths, and improve information management and technology. Timely implementation is crucial post-9/11. Intelligence sharing within the FBI, other IC agencies, and federal, state, and local agencies must be enhanced for collected intelligence to be useful. Despite past failures like the Virtual Case File, progress has been made, and Congress will monitor the development of the new Sentinel system. The FBI has faced challenges in recruiting and retaining intelligence professionals post-9/11, leading to infrastructure demands that were not adequately prepared for. Congress may explore ways to ensure executive continuity in information technology leadership. The agency has increased its analytical cadre and special agents for national security, but rapid hiring has strained its resources. Limited progress has been made in improving information management and technology, with the development of the new Sentinel system being monitored by Congress. The FBI faces challenges in recruiting and retaining intelligence professionals post-9/11, leading to infrastructure demands not adequately prepared for. Limited progress in providing training opportunities for newly hired analysts, lack of senior level positions and promotion opportunities, and delayed implementation of performance appraisal systems. The agency has fundamentally changed hiring criteria post-9/11 but struggles with a lack of specialized positions for intelligence analysts. The FBI and CIA have blurred distinctions between domestic and foreign intelligence collection post-9/11. Despite improved coordination, both agencies still clash over turf, especially in gathering intelligence within the United States. Lack of coordination has jeopardized ongoing intelligence activities. The FBI and CIA have agreed to a memorandum of understanding to better coordinate intelligence activities, marking the first such agreement in nearly two decades. The MOU outlines procedures for when targets of interest travel to the United States from overseas. Critics question if the FBI's field leadership can support Director Mueller's reforms due to lack of national security experience among Special Agents-in-Charge. According to a former senior FBI official, most Special Agents-in-Charge (SACs) lack national security experience, with only nine out of 56 coming from divisions other than the Criminal Division. This lack of expertise may lead to a continued focus on law enforcement rather than intelligence in terrorism cases. While some argue that leaders with national security expertise are crucial in today's threat environment, Director Mueller has prioritized intelligence and terrorism prevention. Some SACs uncomfortable with these new priorities have chosen to retire, but critics believe it will take years of voluntary attrition to align field leadership with the new approach. The need for field leadership more attuned to intelligence at the FBI is highlighted, with concerns raised about the short tenure of senior executives. There is a call for leaders to stay longer than 15 months to implement significant cultural change. The importance of an integrated intelligence cycle, involving collectors, analysts, and consumers, is emphasized for strong outcomes. The intelligence cycle is accountable to its constituent elements in a non-linear fashion. Consumers provide feedback to collection requirements, collectors are accountable to analysts for intelligence gaps, and the FBI lacks a well-developed system for intelligence tasks. The FBI faces challenges in implementing an effective intelligence cycle due to cultural issues, with some questioning its ability to adapt. Optimists believe the FBI can evolve to become a proactive intelligence agency, while skeptics argue for separating intelligence and law enforcement functions. FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces play a key role in sharing information with state and local law enforcement. The FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) have expanded to 103 in operation today, functioning as intended to prevent terrorism and promote national security. There have been occasional tensions between state and local law enforcement agencies and the FBI regarding intelligence sharing. Congress has various policy and budgetary options regarding the FBI's intelligence program. The White House approved the WMD Commission's recommendation to establish a National Security Service within the FBI, raising questions about the organization for intelligence. Will this new structure lead to cultural changes needed at the FBI? Will it empower FIGs to manage intelligence activities better? The National Security Service will be led by an EAD or senior FBI official, raising questions about the status of existing EAD positions. The establishment of a National Security Service within the FBI raises questions about the relationship between the DNI and the leader of the service, as well as the status of existing EAD positions for Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence and Intelligence. Legislative options may vary depending on different perspectives, with skeptics advocating for more far-reaching changes and optimists favoring targeted implementation. The skeptics question the synergy between intelligence and law enforcement, doubting the need for FBI's domestic intelligence mission post P.L. 108-458. Optimists fear turnover in FBI leadership could hinder reform efforts, with attrition rates among intelligence professionals posing a threat to the intelligence program. The intelligence analyst hiring increase from 1,023 in FY2001 to 2,700 in FY2006 is concerning due to attrition factors and lack of internal training infrastructure. Congress passed retention measures, but FBI's implementation is uncertain. Possible legislative options include structural/organizational and budgetary changes, with differing opinions on creating a separate agency. Policymakers are urged to reconsider creating a separate intelligence agency in the US if FBI reforms fail. Supporters believe a dedicated agency could better focus on intelligence, but skeptics warn of organizational challenges and the risk of separating law enforcement and intelligence functions. The White House has approved establishing such a service, but through a memorandum rather than formal legislation. The White House approved the creation of a new assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice through a memorandum, not formal legislation. The new National Security Service within the FBI, also established via memorandum, lacks legal codification, allowing for potential unilateral changes in the future. Congress may consider codifying the new organization within the FBI to ensure its functions are explicitly specified in law. The National Security Service, now part of the White House plan, may require amendments to update its functions within the FBI. Key factors include the authorities of the EAD for National Security, relationships with DNI, FBI Director, and Attorney General, and engagement with Special Agents in Charge and FIGs. Areas of interest for Congress include FBI-CIA cooperation, terrorist funding analysis, and empowering Special Agents in Charge and FIGs. One approach to address turf battles between the FBI and CIA is through aggressive oversight to ensure cooperation in intelligence collection. Congress could review the MOU between the agencies to monitor implementation and assess FBI's focus on terrorist financing, including the adequacy of resources for FIGs. Congress could consider oversight of the FBI's FIGs to ensure appropriate terrorist financial analytic capability and address career path inequities. Management attention at field offices and budget harmonization with the National Intelligence Program are key areas for review. Additionally, the appointment of Assistant Special Agents in Charge (ASACs) solely for intelligence activities could be explored. Strategic options focus on aligning the National Intelligence Program budget with the DI's internal budgetary authorities. Tactical options involve budget tradeoffs within the FBI intelligence program. The WMD Commission found that the EAD-I controlled only 4% of FBI's intelligence spending, raising concerns about DNI's influence over the FBI's National Intelligence Program. The bulk of the Bureau's intelligence spending is outside EAD-I's control, mainly in the Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence Divisions. The Attorney General is tasked with overseeing the FBI's National Security Service's intelligence activities according to a White House memorandum dated June 29, 2005. The FBI's National Security Service's intelligence activities should be funded through the National Intelligence Program, aligning with the DNI's authority to develop the budget. The internal structure of the FBI's budget should specify total intelligence spending, as the current figure does not represent the full amount. Congress may need to consider appropriating the FBI's NIP portion through different subcommittees for consistency with the IC budget. The FBI's intelligence program is funded by the House and Senate intelligence committees, with a portion of the budget allocated for intelligence-related activities. Congressional oversight and support for the FBI's intelligence program may not necessitate changes in funding procedures, despite calls for consistency within the Intelligence Community budget. The FBI's budget increase raises questions about the necessity of additional resources for their vision. There are debates on whether 500 more intelligence analysts are needed, with tradeoffs between staff and infrastructure. The $5.7 billion request includes funding for counterterrorism agents and intelligence analysts. The FBI's budget increase includes 2,945 counterterrorism agents and 2,746 intelligence analysts, with an additional 500 analysts for the war on terrorism. Funding for intelligence reform should be tied to measurable personnel achievements, such as training programs and performance appraisals. The FBI's budget increase includes additional counterterrorism agents and intelligence analysts for the war on terrorism. Proposed strategies for intelligence reform include regional training programs, Internet terminals for analysts, expanded human resource authorities, new performance evaluation systems, and mechanisms to ensure field intelligence collectors fill assigned gaps. The subcommittee may establish reporting requirements if conditional funds are chosen. The subcommittee may establish reporting requirements for the FBI in various areas if funds are appropriated. Funding could be allocated for 500 intelligence analysts, with the rest dedicated to new personnel for administrative and training roles. Congress could also require that analysts not be diverted to non-analytical tasks. Congress could require that analysts not be diverted to non-analytical tasks. Three formal categories of intelligence are defined: Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence, and Criminal Intelligence. The FBI is a statutory member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and plays a role in intelligence activities related to criminal organizations involved in various illegal activities. The FBI, under the supervision of the Attorney General, conducts counterintelligence activities within and outside the United States, coordinating with other agencies in the Intelligence Community as required. The FBI is responsible for producing and disseminating foreign intelligence and counterintelligence, as well as conducting research and development of technical systems related to these functions. The agency also collects intelligence within the United States with authorization from IC officials, dating back to 1908. During the Cold War, the FBI successfully penetrated Soviet leadership and arrested several U.S. citizens for espionage, including John Walker, Larry Wu-Tai Chin, Jonathan Pollard, and Ronald Pelton. FBI Special Agent Robert P. Hanssen also spied for the Soviet Union and Russia. FBI Special Agent Robert P. Hanssen spied for the Soviet Union and Russia, pleading guilty to 15 espionage-related charges in 2001. Former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Ana Belen Montes was arrested in 2001 for spying for Cuba. The FBI has been praised for its successes but criticized for targeting U.S. citizens during the Palmer Raids and COINTELPRO Program for alleged subversive activities. In the mid-1960s, the FBI surveilled prominent Americans like Martin Luther King, Jr., collecting \"racial intelligence.\" In the 1980s, the FBI violated the constitutional rights of members of CISPES. Congressional investigators found that the FBI's activities targeted domestic political activities protected by the First Amendment. In response to these abuses, the Department of Justice imposed domestic intelligence collection standards on the FBI in 1976. President Carter signed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, establishing legal procedures for electronic surveillance in the US. Critics argue that prior regulations weakened FBI's intelligence capabilities until the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act granted additional authority. Levi Guidelines were criticized for hindering domestic intelligence collection. The FBI faced restrictions that hindered domestic intelligence collection, leading to a transfer of responsibilities within its counterterrorism program. This resulted in an intelligence program that was criticized for contributing to the failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks. Previous attempts to reform FBI intelligence in 1998 and 1999 were considered failures. The FBI's intelligence program was historically fragmented, with three operational divisions controlling their own programs. In 1998, the FBI established the Office of Intelligence to address the issue of stove-piping. Dissatisfied with the results, the FBI launched a second round of reforms in 1999 to integrate intelligence analysis more thoroughly in support of investigations. The FBI's Office of Intelligence was replaced by the Investigative Services Division (ISD) to centralize FBI analysts, but operational divisions resisted the change. After 9/11, analysts were returned to their original divisions as the ISD was disbanded due to the FBI's law enforcement mindset hindering integration efforts. Efforts to integrate intelligence at the FBI were hindered by resources being redirected to traditional counter crime programs. There was little sustained senior level support for an integrated intelligence function with the IC. The 9/11 Commission found a gap between policy goals and their implementation at FBI field offices. The progress of FBI intelligence reforms post-9/11 is a topic of debate. The FBI faced challenges in changing its organizational culture post-9/11, likened to turning around an aircraft carrier. Despite difficulties, national security demands timely results."
