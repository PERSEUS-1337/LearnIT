    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Breath of Fresh Air Act\" and includes findings. The \"Breath of Fresh Air Act\" findings reveal that 25 million people, including 7 million children, have asthma. Asthma leads to 13 million reported attacks annually, with 2 million emergency visits. Each day, 30,000 experience attacks, and 11 die from asthma in the US. Additionally, 5 million asthma sufferers are under 18, with 1 in 10 school-aged children affected. Minorities face higher risks, with African-Americans three times more likely to die from asthma and Hispanics potentially exposed to air pollution due to living in non-compliant areas. Approximately 80% of Hispanics, 65% of African-Americans, and 57% of Whites live in areas failing to meet national air quality standards. SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM FOR NEBULIZERS. The Secretary of Education will provide grants to local educational agencies for purchasing nebulizers or providing training for schools to meet requirements. Local educational agencies must submit an application to be eligible for the grant. To be eligible for a nebulizer grant, schools must be public or private and served by a local educational agency. The agency must provide matching funds equal to 25% of the grant amount, unless waived by the Secretary based on specific criteria. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 requires that a local educational agency demonstrate certain criteria for each school using nebulizers, including having a full-time certified school nurse, trained personnel, integration into emergency response plans, and procedures for maintenance. The school ensures parents are informed about nebulizer availability, prescription medication procedures, and authorization for medical use. Priority for grants is given to areas with high asthma prevalence, schools without nebulizers, and those with a significant presence of individuals on school grounds. During a typical day, students, staff, and visitors are present on school grounds. The terms used in this section follow the definitions in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2018. SEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not create liability for nebulizer use or supersede State laws regulating nursing."
