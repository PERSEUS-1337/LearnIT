    "content": "The Quadrennial Defense Review for 2001 is a mandated assessment of national defense strategy, analyzing force structure, modernization plans, military infrastructure, and the defense budget to establish a roadmap for defense programs for the next 20 years. This review is crucial for the nation's national security strategy in the new millennium, following various defense-related studies in the 1990s aimed at reshaping American military strategy post-Cold War. General Colin Powell introduced the term \"Base Force\" to represent the minimum armed forces needed for the US to meet national security objectives, including the ability to conduct two major theater wars simultaneously. The 1993 Bottom Up Review (BUR) recognized global security changes and emphasized conflict prevention through democracy promotion and peaceful resolution. The BUR highlighted the importance of peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, with Iraq and North Korea identified as potential regional threats requiring US military response. The 1993 Bottom Up Review (BUR) recognized global security changes and emphasized conflict prevention through democracy promotion and peaceful resolution. It highlighted the importance of peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, with Iraq and North Korea identified as potential regional threats requiring US military response. In response to criticisms, the Commission on Roles and Missions (CORM) was mandated by Congress in the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act. The CORM suggested a major quadrennial strategy review and a clear vision for future joint operations by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Congress directed the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review to conduct a fundamental and comprehensive examination based on one of the CORM recommendations. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) described a strategy of \"shape, respond, prepare\" to address threats including weapons of mass destruction, advanced technologies, and organized crime. It retained the two-MTW construct as its force shaping tool, leading to criticism as a budget-driven assessment of military force structure. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) faced criticism from the National Defense Panel (NDP) for its less ambitious defense transformation plan and reliance on the two-major theater war (MTW) construct. The NDP recommended scaling back legacy systems and emphasized the need for a comprehensive reassessment of defense strategies to meet future challenges. The 2001 QDR is now in progress, presenting an opportunity for further review and potential changes in military force structure. The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review is currently underway, providing an opportunity to assess future U.S. security challenges and develop a military strategy to protect national interests. The results of the review are not binding and may be altered by the administration. The 106th Congress mandated the Quadrennial Defense Review every four years to examine national defense strategy, force structure, modernization plans, budget, and other defense elements to establish a program for the next 20 years. The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review aims to delineate a military strategy consistent with the National Security Strategy, define defense programs for executing missions, and identify budget plans. The Secretary of Defense must consider various technologies for force structure options over the next 20 years. The Joint Staff is responsible for gathering data and formulating inputs from various military entities for the Quadrennial Defense Review. The organization is led by a general officer steering committee and includes eight panels covering different aspects of defense. The input from each panel goes to a Preparation Group with support from an Integration Group. Guidance and issue resolution are provided by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, Service Operational Deputies, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The OSD will form six major issue panels for the QDR report: strategy, force structure, capabilities and investment, information warfare, intelligence, space, personnel, readiness support infrastructure, and joint organizations. Process issues include timing of the QDR, military strategy framing, and avoiding a budget-driven process. The QDR process, mandated every four years, aims to define a strategy that defends U.S. national interests. The National Security Strategy is due in June 2001, with the QDR report following by September 30, 2001. If the administration changes the security strategy significantly, the DoD may need more time to formulate its strategy and concepts. Some suggest a different approach to the review process. Some suggest a different approach to the QDR review process, proposing a broad strategic review to establish priorities before conducting a more extensive study. This method could impact the administration's budget submission in 2002 and help translate the National Security Strategy into a revamped defense strategy. It may require Congress to amend current QDR legislation. The two-MTW construct, originally designed to counter major conventional conflicts, is now being questioned in the current security environment. Critics argue that emerging asymmetric threats like terrorism and information warfare may require a different force sizing approach. However, changing this construct could be seen as a lack of resolve by allies and impact security commitments. Some allies perceive a lack of resolve in backing away from current security commitments due to a budget mismatch in funding military strategies. Estimates show a significant shortfall in funding for various commitments, putting a strain on the budget. The goal of the QDR process is to create a defense strategy within budget constraints to maintain a credible force. Increasing funding may be necessary to address future threats and maintain deterrence. Defense specialists suggest increasing the defense budget, restructuring current costs, or adjusting the current defense strategy to address budget constraints. Congress should ensure the DoD QDR organization emphasizes jointness and total force thinking. Regional commanders-in-chief competing for limited resources and transformation strategies of each service may require reassessment of procurement decisions. The United States is moving further into the information age, with the methods of estimating risks, constructing strategies, and transformation philosophies affecting the outcome of the QDR. Translating the QDR into a coherent defense strategy will require challenging choices by Congress and the Bush Administration."
