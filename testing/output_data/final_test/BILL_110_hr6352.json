    "content": "The \"Communities Committed to College Tax Credit Act of 2008\" allows for a credit for contributions to a trust used to provide need-based college scholarships under section 30D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Communities Committed to College Tax Credit Act of 2008\" allows a 50% tax credit for designated qualified college scholarship funding contributions made to a qualified scholarship funding trust. A qualified scholarship funding trust is a trust established in the US by a tax-exempt organization primarily for educational purposes. It is part of a plan by local education agencies to provide scholarships to children, with a written governing instrument requiring trust income to be used for this purpose. A qualified scholarship funding trust must use income exclusively for qualified scholarships for students pursuing higher education and demonstrate financial need. Trust assets cannot be distributed for any other purpose. The national qualified college scholarship funding contribution limitation is $1,000,000,000, allocated among registered trusts based on the number of school age children of sponsoring agencies. The amount of contributions to a qualified scholarship funding trust is limited to the allocation amount based on the number of school age children of sponsoring agencies. The maximum allocation per trust for qualified college scholarship funding is $200,000,000. Any amount not allocated to a trust will be distributed among other registered trusts. The tax credit for a taxable year cannot exceed the regular tax liability reduced by certain credits, over the tentative minimum tax for that year. The section applies to contributions made within a 3-year period after enactment. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to contributions made on or after the 180th day after the date of enactment in taxable years ending after such date."
