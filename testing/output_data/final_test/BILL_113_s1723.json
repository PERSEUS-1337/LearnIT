    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"No Obamacare Kickbacks Act of 2013\". The Congress finds that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act applies civil penalties for violations of the False Claims Act to kickbacks involving Federal health care programs. The Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight stated that the Department of Health and Human Services has broad authority to regulate the Federal and State Marketplaces. The CCIIO suggests that qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act are similar to Medicare Advantage plans in terms of regulatory authority and receiving Federal dollars. The Federal Government facilitates applications and enrollment in qualified health plans through federally-funded call centers, web portals, and consumer assistance personnel, similar to how it is done for Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Benefit programs. Health care programs involving Federal programs can result in penalties under the Social Security Act and False Claims Act. The amendment clarifies the application of anti-kickback laws to qualified health plans, marketplaces, and programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It includes plans funded under specific subtitles of the Act and related programs. The amendment is retroactively effective to the enactment of the Act.
