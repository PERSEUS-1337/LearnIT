    "content": "Nepal has undergone significant changes in recent years, including the end of the civil war, abolition of the monarchy, and establishment of a multi-party democratic republic. The former Maoist insurgents are now part of the government, and efforts are underway to draft a new constitution. Despite positive trends, challenges remain as the country transitions from a Hindu monarchy to a representative democracy under the leadership of Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal. Before a May 2011 deadline, Nepal faced a political vacuum for seven months due to a deadlock in the Constituent Assembly. The logjam was broken when Maoist candidate Prachanda withdrew from consideration for prime minister, leading to the election of Khanal with Maoist support. A \"secret\" deal between CPN UML and the Maoists helped form a new government, with disagreements over the seven-point deal initially causing delays. However, several Maoists joined the government in March 2011, indicating progress in avoiding further impasses. In March 2011, Maoists have taken up several ministries in Nepal, including Peace and Reconstruction, but not the Home Ministry. They will be given a total of 11 ministries as part of a power-sharing deal with CPN-UML. Prime Minister Khanal agreed to consider options for the future of 19,000 former Maoist combatants, signaling potential cooperation on integrating Maoist forces into the army. The two parties agreed to take turns leading the government, but analysts warn of challenges ahead due to differing interests. The government in Nepal faces challenges in completing the peace process and drafting a new constitution before the May 2011 deadline. The Constituent Assembly may extend the deadline if necessary. After 16 unsuccessful votes, a new government was finally elected in February 2011. Political parties and militant groups from the Madhes minority are pushing for their concerns to be addressed in the new constitution and federal structure. In February 2011, Prime Minister Khanal won the election with support from the Maoists and CPN UML, defeating the Nepali Congress candidate. This alliance was formed after the Maoist candidate Prachanda withdrew, leading to Khanal receiving 368 votes in the Constituent Assembly. The Marxist Leninists had previously supported a Maoist government in 2008 but withdrew due to disagreements over army control. This election outcome was a result of the 2006 peace agreement that brought the Maoists into the political process. The political process in Nepal has sparked debate on integrating former Maoist fighters into the army. The UNMIN monitoring group left in 2011, leading to the formation of a Special Committee for oversight. Maoist leaders handed over their army to the government, but details on integration into society or the army remain unresolved. The Maoists want all former combatants integrated into the Army of Nepal, while other parties suggest limiting Maoist numbers to 6,000 to 8,000 and assisting the rest in reintegration. Around 13,000 to 14,000 combatants remain in cantonments, with the resolution of this issue crucial for progress in the constitution process. The potential contentious nature of a new federal structure may lead to its deferral for later consideration. The main societal divide in Nepal is between the Madhes people of the Terai and the \"hill\" people. The Madhes people of the Terai region are unhappy with the political status quo, feeling marginalized by the \"hill\" people. They want the Terai to be unified under their dominance in any redistricting. Madhes groups have warned of violence if their aspirations are not addressed in the new constitution. The Tharu group in the Terai opposes inclusion in \"One Madhes\" and favors its own administrative district. In the 17th round of voting for a new government, Bijay Kumar Gachedhar unsuccessfully contested the prime ministership on behalf of an alliance of Madhes political parties. Former Prime Minister Prachanda resigned in May 2009 over a dispute with the former Chief of Army Staff Rookmangud Katawal regarding the integration of former Maoist fighters into the Army of Nepal. The political crisis in Nepal in May 2009 stemmed from the disagreement between the Maoists and the Army over integrating 19,000 Maoist fighters into the Nepali Army. The debate focused on the number of fighters to be integrated and whether they would be integrated as whole units or attached to existing Army units. The Nepali Congress opposed the Maoist plans and suggested placing the fighters in an industrial security force, the police, or other sectors. The Nepal Army, with approximately 95,000 soldiers, was divided into six regional divisions. The political crisis in Nepal in May 2009 was caused by the disagreement between the Maoists and the Army over integrating 19,000 fighters. The Nepal Army, with 95,000 soldiers divided into six divisions, faced challenges from Prachanda's CPN-M government and a 22-party coalition. The CPN-M obstructed parliament, held strikes, and created a crisis by blocking the national budget passage. The government, now including the communist parties, faces instability amidst Nepal's religious demographics. Nepal is a country with a predominantly Buddhist population and over 100 regional languages. The country is divided between the agriculturally productive Terai region and the mountainous areas. Nepal has been an independent kingdom since 1768 and underwent a transition from strict monarchy to a constitutional monarchy in 1959. Despite a brief period of partyless rule under the monarchy, political parties continued to exist and advocate for a return to constitutional governance. In February 1990, political parties and student groups in Nepal launched the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, leading to peaceful demonstrations in urban centers. After a deadly clash with police, King Birendra handed power to an interim government, which established Nepal as a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch. The king retained limited powers, including the ability to declare a state of emergency. In 1996, the underground CPN-M initiated a \"People's War\" in the mid-western region to replace the constitutional monarchy. The Maoists in Nepal initiated a \"People's War\" in the mid-western region to establish a one-party communist regime, fueled by government corruption and failure to improve citizens' lives. They ran a parallel government, conducted torture and bombings, and became one of the wealthiest rebel groups in Asia through bank robberies and \"revolutionary tax\" revenue. In June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra killed his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, along with other royal family members, before taking his own life. In June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra killed his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, along with other royal family members, leading to King Gyanendra being crowned. The country faced instability, with riots and disbelief in official accounts. Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala resigned in July 2001 due to fears of continuing instability and failure to address the Maoist insurgency. Sher Bahadur Deuba took over as the new Prime Minister, but Nepal faced a constitutional crisis in 2002, hindering efforts to combat the insurgency. In late May, King Gyanendra dissolved parliament and extended emergency rule, leading to a lawsuit by former members of parliament. The Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit in August 2002, despite concerns about holding free and fair elections in a country divided by rebel and army control. The prime minister promised no emergency rule during the scheduled November elections. The government considered imposing emergency rule to prevent Maoist disruption of the November 2002 elections, but opposition parties opposed it. Instead, the government decided to hold the elections in six stages over two months for better security. However, due to the risky security situation, the cabinet asked King Gyanendra to postpone the elections on October 3, 2002. After the cabinet asked King Gyanendra to postpone national elections in October 2002, he dismissed the prime minister, disbanded the cabinet, and assumed executive powers. The security situation worsened after the ceasefire collapsed between the Maoists and the government in August 2003. The king's opposition to abolishing the monarchy led to a conflict with the Maoists, ultimately leading to his direct assumption of power in February 2005 and the decline of the monarchy's influence in Nepal. After seizing power in February 2005, King Gyanendra aimed to assert control over democratic forces and defeat the Maoists using the Royal Nepal Army. Despite promises to reinstate democracy within 100 days, he failed to do so, leading to continued political unrest and arrests of hundreds of individuals. The king released some political prisoners, but many others remained under arrest. Restrictions on civil liberties persisted, with a UN human rights team monitoring the situation. The king's actions against democrats strengthened the Maoists, with a significant portion of the army focused on palace security. The king's legitimacy was weakened due to how he seized power and public perception of his son, Prince Paras Shah. The Maoists blockaded major highways in Nepal from February 13 to 27, 2005, leading to clashes with the RNA and disrupting trade. This pressure on the king's government eventually led to King Gyanendra handing over power to the Seven Party Alliance on April 24, 2006. The political parties forced King Gyanendra to hand over power to the Seven Party Alliance in Nepal after weeks of protests against direct royal rule. The alliance, consisting of various parties including Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal, worked together to oppose the monarchy and promote democracy. Six of the seven parties formed a coalition government in May 2006. The Seven Party Alliance and the Maoists reached a peace agreement in 2006, ending a decade-long insurgency. The Maoists agreed to disarm and postpone decisions on the monarchy. Constituent Assembly elections were held in April 2008, resulting in a 601-seat legislature with a mixed member system. The CPN-M is the largest party with 220 seats. The CPN-M is the largest party in Nepal's Constituent Assembly with 220 seats, followed by the NC with 110 seats and the CPN-UML with 103 seats. The Nepal Army has largely stayed out of politics, and the transition from monarchy to republic was facilitated by a tacit agreement with the army. Prachanda's decision to integrate former Maoist fighters into the Army of Nepal may have breached a tacit agreement with the military, leading to concerns about the army becoming more politicized. General Katawal, the former head of the army, opposed integration, citing unmet conditions from the 2006 Peace Agreement that ended the civil war. Critics argue that the Maoists have not fulfilled their obligations from the agreement, raising fears of further escalation. The CPN-UML, main allies of CPN-M, withdrew from the government after Prachanda dismissed General Katawal in May 2009. President Ram Baran Yadav reversed the decision and reinstated General Katawal. Inter-communal tensions have risen, especially in the Terai region, where the Madhes seek autonomy from Pahadi domination. The Madhes also have closer ties to India. The Madhes in northern Nepal seek autonomy from Pahadi domination and have closer ties to India. There are armed groups and political factions in the region fighting for autonomy, with allegations of Hindu radicals being involved in the violence. The Madhes complain about underrepresentation in government and economic discrimination, calling for self-determination through the creation of a Madhes Autonomous Region and proportional representation in government. The Madhesi in Nepal sought autonomy and fair representation in the political structure. Agitation lessened after the interim government agreed to an eight-point plan recognizing autonomous regions and promising proportional army recruitment. Widespread strikes occurred in the Terai in 2009 due to a Supreme Court decision on Vice President Jha's oath. The government added nine cabinet ministers, mostly Madhesi, to address the controversy and stabilize political dynamics in Nepal. A new regional dimension has emerged in Nepal's struggle for political stability, with Madhesi groups representing a threat. Madhesis, culturally close to northern Indians, feel underrepresented in government and face economic discrimination. Allegations suggest Hindu radicals may be involved in violence in the Terai region. Despite progress in human rights and political freedoms since the 1990s, both Maoists and security forces have committed violations. The king's dismissal of the government in 2005 led to further abuses. Nepal has faced challenges with civil rights abuses, trafficking, corruption, and mistreatment of the Tibetan community. The reinstatement of parliament in 2006 helped reverse some setbacks, but issues persist. Nepal ranked poorly in the 2010 Global Corruption Perceptions Index. The Tibetan community in Nepal has faced abuses from authorities, with arrests of Tibetans reported. Nepal serves as a transit route for Tibetans seeking refuge in India. Nepal, a key transit route for Tibetans seeking refuge in India, has been accused of human rights abuses by Human Rights Watch. The government has been criticized for excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, sexual assault of women, beatings of Tibetans in detention, and threats to deport them to China. Despite being one of the world's poorest nations with low per capita income and high inflation, Nepal remains largely insulated from international economic factors due to its reliance on agriculture. The government has restricted political activities of Tibetans in Nepal, stating they will not allow any anti-China activities. Nepal's economy relies heavily on agriculture, with major crops including rice, wheat, maize, jute, sugarcane, and potatoes. A quarter of the national budget is funded through foreign aid. Despite political instability and insurgency-related violence, Nepal's GDP is expected to grow by 3.5% to 4% in 2011. The country's industrial base is small but produces carpets, garments, and textiles for export. Tourism, remittances, and hydropower are also significant revenue sources for Nepal. Nepal has substantial hydropower potential but faces challenges such as political instability, corruption, and poor infrastructure. The economy relies heavily on agriculture and foreign aid, with key export partners including India, the United States, and Germany. Firewood is a major energy source in Nepal, and the country is trying to develop trade relations with Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The United States has provided over $1.2 billion in bilateral development assistance to Nepal since 1951. Annual bilateral U.S. assistance to Nepal averages $54 million, with two-way trade totaling $86 million in 2009. U.S. interests in Nepal include promoting democracy, civil society, and regional stability. The United States opposes the Maoists' past plans for a one-party republic and collectivization of agriculture. The CPN-M aims to re-educate \"class enemies\" and export revolution, but their commitment to these goals is unclear. U.S. assistance to Nepal focuses on promoting democracy, strengthening institutions, enhancing stability, and developing the military's capabilities while respecting human rights and democratic values. Nepal, a landlocked buffer state between India and China, faces territorial disputes and tensions along its borders. It heavily relies on India for imports, exports, and foreign investment. Limited access to China is due to the Himalayan mountain range along its northern border. Nepal's southern border with India is open, while the northern border limits access to China. India sees Nepal as strategically important for its border defenses and is concerned about Nepali instability affecting its northeastern states. Some Nepali leaders resent Indian influence and seek a more independent foreign policy, potentially aligning closer with China. Beijing provides economic aid to Nepal, which borders Tibet where the Dalai Lama seeks autonomy from China. China has sought autonomy for Tibetan regions within China. Former Prime Minister Prachanda's first trip abroad was to China, indicating China's interest in gaining political favor with the Maoists. India and Nepal have close cultural and religious ties, but the election of a Maoist-backed government may strain relations with India. Indian Foreign Secretary Nirumpama Rao met with leaders of all main political parties during her visit to Nepal in January 2011. During her visit to Nepal, Foreign Secretary Nirumpama Rao met with leaders of all main political parties, including the Maoists. She discussed the Maoists' stance on the 1950 India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which some in Nepal view as giving India too much influence. The Maoists expressed a desire to revisit the treaty, raising questions about their role in the CPN-UML government. Rao also emphasized India's commitment to a 34-point agreement with Nepal, focusing on security cooperation and border security. China's interests in Nepal add another layer of complexity to the region's dynamics. China has a strong interest in Nepal to prevent Tibetan activists from promoting the cause of Tibet. They have pressured Nepal to restrict the Tibetan exile community and have made significant inroads in developing ties with South Asian states, causing concern in strategic circles. Reports suggest Chinese agents infiltrating Tibetan exile groups in India and monitoring the Dalai Lama's activities. China's interest in Nepal aims to prevent Tibetan activists from promoting the cause of Tibet. They have pressured Nepal to restrict the Tibetan exile community and have developed ties with South Asian states. Bhutan has tensions with ethnic Nepalis, known as the Lhotshampa, who have fled Bhutan due to assimilation attempts. The tension between Bhutan and the ethnic Nepalis, known as the Lhotshampa, led to unrest in the early 1990s. The United Nations provided formal assistance in 2006, dispatching a pre-assessment mission to help resolve differences on arms management. The UN established the UN Political Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) in 2007 to monitor the management of arms and armed personnel, assist in implementing agreements, and monitor the ceasefire. UNMIN was established in 2007 to oversee the cantonment of former rebel fighters, store their weapons, assist in implementing agreements, monitor the ceasefire, and provide technical support for the election of a Constituent Assembly. Its mission was extended until January 2011."
