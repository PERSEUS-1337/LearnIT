    "content": "The \"Keeping Girls in School Act\" defines appropriate congressional committees and states its purpose and findings. The \"Keeping Girls in School Act\" aims to support empowerment, economic security, and educational opportunities for adolescent girls globally. Congress finds that adolescence is crucial for girls, with many facing barriers to education due to gender norms and conflict-affected regions. Approximately 130 million girls worldwide are out of school, with disparities in access to education persisting. Disparities in access to safe and quality education for adolescent girls lead to increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, child marriage, and violence. Statistics show that each year, 380,000 adolescent girls are newly infected with HIV, and 15 million girls worldwide are married before their 18th birthday. More than 700 million women alive today were married as children, with one-quarter to one-half of girls in developing countries becoming mothers before the age of 18. Girls under 15 are five times more likely to die during childbirth than women in their 20s. While two-thirds of countries have achieved gender parity in primary education, only 40 percent have achieved gender parity in secondary education. Adolescent girls who stay in school are more likely to live longer, marry later, have healthier children, and earn an income to support their families, contributing to the economic advancement of communities and nations. The United States Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls involves the Department of State and the United States. Girls has brought together various agencies and programs to address challenges preventing adolescent girls from attaining quality education. Over 100 public-private partnerships have been formed since July 2015 to support innovative solutions in countries like Malawi and Tanzania. PEPFAR's DREAMS Initiative aims to overcome barriers to education for adolescent girls, as highlighted in the United States Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls. The focus is on improving outcomes in secondary school completion for this demographic. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Education is a human right, with a focus on equal opportunities for girls. The US has been a leader in expanding educational opportunities for marginalized groups, especially women. Girls' education correlates with progress in gender equality and economic development, making gender parity a priority in US foreign policy. Education is a lifesaving humanitarian intervention that protects the lives, futures, and well-being of girls, contributing to economic growth and development while reducing the risk of violence and instability. Title I focuses on providing secondary education for adolescent girls. Section 101 establishes the Adolescent Girls Education Challenge Fund. The Adolescent Girls Education Challenge Fund is established to provide funds for programs promoting adolescent girls' education, economic security, and empowerment through strategic partnerships and research-based approaches. The Adolescent Girls Education Challenge Fund aims to leverage resources from various organizations to ensure sustainable finance and impact, and to provide safe and quality educational opportunities for girls to enroll, attend, and graduate successfully. $35,000,000 is authorized for the Fund annually. SEC. 102. ASSISTANCE TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, along with other Federal departments, can implement programs supporting educational opportunities for adolescent girls and addressing barriers they face. These barriers include harmful societal norms, distance from school, safety concerns, costs, inadequate facilities, prioritization of boys' education, and poor nutrition. The United States Agency for International Development Senior Coordinator for International Basic Education Assistance, in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment and the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues at the Department of State, oversees resources and activities promoting educational opportunities for adolescent girls, addressing barriers such as poor nutrition, early marriage, pregnancy, female genital mutilation, HIV infection, and discrimination based on religious or ethnic identity. SEC. 103. MONITORING AND EVALUATION. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must ensure programs under this Act use rigorous monitoring and evaluation methods to close the gender gap in secondary education and improve education quality for adolescent girls. Data collected should be disaggregated by age, gender, marital status, and urbanity. Programs must adhere to gender equality policies. SEC. 104. TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING TO CONGRESS.\n\nThe Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, in coordination with the Secretary of State, must submit an annual report to congressional committees detailing programs addressing barriers to adolescent girls' education and describing the activities and outcomes of the Adolescent Girls Education Challenge Fund.\n\nSEC. 105. SUNSET.\n\nThe authorities under this title will end when the Secretary of State certifies to congressional committees that gender parity in quality and access to secondary education for adolescent boys and girls has been achieved in countries receiving U.S. development assistance. TITLE II--UNITED STATES GLOBAL STRATEGY TO EMPOWER ADOLESCENT GIRLS\n\nSEC. 201. GLOBAL STRATEGY REQUIREMENT. The Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues must develop a United States global strategy to empower adolescent girls every 5 years, submit it to congressional committees, and make it publicly available online. The initial strategy issued in March 2016 fulfills the first requirement. The Ambassador-at-Large and Senior Coordinator must collaborate and consult with relevant federal agencies, congressional committees, civil society organizations, and local beneficiaries in developing the strategy to empower adolescent girls."
