    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electric Consumer Choice Act\". The Congress finds that the opportunity for consumers to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce from the supplier of choice is essential for a competitive national market. Exclusive rights to sell electric energy and state actions that discriminate against consumers seeking to purchase energy interstate are unwarranted burdens on commerce in today's marketplace. The Congress emphasizes the importance of consumers being able to choose their electric energy supplier in a competitive national market. State actions that discriminate against consumers seeking to purchase energy interstate are seen as barriers to commerce. The transmission and distribution facilities of all utilities are crucial for a competitive retail market where consumers can freely choose their energy supplier. The purpose of this act is to prevent any federal law from exempting exclusive rights to sell electric energy or discriminating against consumers who want to purchase energy interstate. It aims to ensure consumers can freely choose their energy supplier. SEC. 4 amends the Federal Power Act to prevent states from granting exclusive rights to sell electric energy or discriminating against consumers seeking to purchase energy interstate. SEC. 5 ensures that suppliers of electric energy have access to transmission and local distribution facilities for interstate commerce without being denied based on State actions. SEC. 6 allows states to impose reciprocity requirements under the Federal Power Act. SEC. 215 grants states the authority to prohibit electric utilities from selling energy if they own transmission or distribution facilities and do not provide unbundled local distribution service in that state. SEC. 7 repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and SEC. 8 prospectively repeals Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. SEC. 9 of the Act states that no electric utility is obligated to enter new contracts for purchasing or selling electricity under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It also clarifies that existing contracts for purchasing electricity from qualifying facilities remain unaffected by this section. SEC. 9 of the Act clarifies that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission cannot regulate retail sales or local distribution of electric energy and reaffirms the authority of states to regulate in accordance with the Constitution. SEC. 10 specifies the effective dates of certain sections of the Act."
