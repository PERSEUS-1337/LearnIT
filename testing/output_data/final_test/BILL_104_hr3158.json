    "content": "The Pilot Small Business Technology Transfer Program Extension Act of 1996 may be cited as the Program Extension Act. Section 9(n) of the Small Business Act is amended to require not less than 0.25 percent of the budget in fiscal year 1997 and each succeeding year to be allocated to the STTR program. Authorization for the STTR program is set to expire on September 30, 2000. The Comptroller General is required to assess the allocation of budget for the STTR program. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the implementation of the SBIR and STTR programs, focusing on competition, proposal quality, performance of awardees, adverse effects on sponsoring agencies' research programs, and whether awards meet required percentages. The assessment by the Comptroller General will focus on the implementation of SBIR and STTR programs, including management techniques to minimize delays, Phase III implementation, and utilization of research results by small business participants. The research examined the results of collaborations between small firms and research institutions under the STTR program, comparing it to voluntary collaborations under the SBIR program. It also looked into any potential duplication between the two programs and assessed agency compliance with outreach directives to increase participation. The assessment required by subsection (a) focuses on outreach efforts to increase participation of disadvantaged small business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in the STTR program. The report will be submitted by the Comptroller General and cover the period from October 1, 1995, to September 30, 1999. The report of the assessment required by subsection (a) must be submitted to the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and House of Representatives by February 1, 2000. The report should include appendices summarizing previous findings by the Comptroller General on the SBIR program and the pilot STTR program, as well as listing reports of other assessments of these programs by relevant entities. The Interagency Task Force on Commercialization is established. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will lead an interagency task force to promote commercialization of projects from small businesses in the SBIR and STTR programs. The task force will review obstacles faced by entrepreneurs, make recommendations to overcome them, and address other relevant issues for a comprehensive analysis. The interagency task force, led by the Small Business Administration Administrator, will include representatives from various agencies to develop practical recommendations for promoting commercialization of projects from small businesses in the SBIR and STTR programs. Public participation will be encouraged in the assessment and recommendation process. The interagency task force, led by the Small Business Administration Administrator, will consult with small businesses, organizations representing small business concerns, venture capital sources, and other relevant entities to develop recommendations for promoting commercialization of projects from the SBIR and STTR programs. Public participation will be encouraged starting from May 1, 1997. The Federal Register will publish a notice announcing the interagency task force, its members, objectives, and requesting public suggestions. Public participation is encouraged in providing ideas for the task force's assessments and recommendations. The Administrator must submit a report to the Senate and House Small Business Committees by March 1, 1999. The interagency task force will submit a report to the Senate and House Small Business Committees with recommendations for legislative or administrative action. Technical correction made to Section 9(e)(4)(A) of the Small Business Act by amending the reference from \"(B)(ii)\" to just \"(B)\"."
