This success led to the Post Office Department continuing to offer stamps to commemorate historic events and places, contributing to civic education and the hobby of philately. The revenue potential of commemorative stamps became more important when USPS was established in 1971. Social issues were also featured on stamps, such as conservation and higher education. In 1993, the Elvis Presley stamp was released, generating excitement among postal customers. The USPS has faced criticism for issuing too many commemorative stamps, leading to concerns about diminishing their value to collectors. Under Postmaster General Marvin Runyon, the policy shifted to producing fewer commemorative stamps. However, in the late 1990s, USPS began designing stamps to attract non-collectors and children, resulting in an increase in the number of commemorative stamps produced and marketed. The number of commemorative stamps issued by USPS has increased over the years, with 99 stamps planned for 2007. Controversies have arisen over errors and subject selection, leading to the hiring of a historian to authenticate designs. Only a small percentage of stamps have featured women or women's issues. The stamp honoring Frida Kahlo in 2001 received negative feedback due to her communist ties and criticism from Senator Jesse Helms. The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) was established by the PMG in March 1957 to provide expertise in selecting and designing commemorative stamps. The committee consists of 15 members with diverse backgrounds and serves three-year staggered terms. Current members include Joan Mondale, Karl Malden, Michael Brock, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. No member can serve more than three terms. The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) was established in 1957 by the PMG to select and design commemorative stamps. The committee consists of 15 members with diverse backgrounds, including Louis Gates, Jr. Members serve three-year staggered terms and the PMG appoints a chairperson and vice chairperson for two-year terms. The committee meets quarterly in Washington, DC, or as called by the chairperson to review stamp suggestions received by the USPS. CSAC employs no staff, but USPS employees analyze suggestions and form subcommittees for research on special themes. The committee's primary responsibility is to review and select stamp ideas. The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) was established in 1957 by the PMG to select and design commemorative stamps. The committee reviews and appraises all proposals for stamps, but the PMG has the final authority to determine the subject matter and designs. Members of Congress can support stamp proposals by writing to the PMG, which may result in a referral to the advisory committee. Congressional resolutions are also introduced to encourage specific stamp commemorations. In the 108th and 109th Congress, resolutions were introduced to endorse commemorative stamps, but congressional endorsement does not guarantee consideration. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform discourages introducing bills for new stamps, directing recommendations to the Postmaster General instead. The committee in the 110th Congress will not consider legislative proposals for new stamps, leaving the decision to the Postmaster General. The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee receives 50,000 nominations annually and does not prioritize those from Congress. They use 12 criteria to recommend stamp subjects, focusing on American themes and not featuring living individuals. Stamps honoring individuals are issued on significant anniversaries, with a minimum of five years after their death. Historical events are commemorated on specific anniversaries. Events and themes of national significance are considered for commemoration on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years. Local or regional events may be recognized with a special postal cancellation. Stamps are not issued to honor organizations, promote commercial enterprises, or honor specific institutions like cities, schools, or hospitals. Commercial products can be used to represent broader American culture. Requests for statehood anniversaries will be considered for commemorative postage stamps only at intervals of 50 years. Other state-related or regional anniversaries may be considered for postal stationery at the same intervals. Stamps will not be issued to honor religious institutions or individuals associated with religious beliefs. Semipostals will be issued separately from the commemorative program. Semipostals are excluded from the commemorative program and have separate criteria. Stamps for significant anniversaries of universities will only be considered for stamped cards in connection with their 200th founding anniversary. No stamp will be issued if a similar one has been issued in the past 50 years, except for traditional themes like national symbols and holidays. The USPS does not have a formal procedure for submitting stamp proposals, which can be done by letter, postcard, or petition. Once a proposal meets USPS criteria, it is listed on the committee's agenda for the next meeting. In-person appeals by stamp proponents are not allowed. The USPS encourages submitting commemorative postage stamp subjects to the committee at least three years in advance. Suggestions can be sent to the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee. USPS maintains philatelic centers in the US and 7 foreign countries to promote stamp collecting. Tracking the number of stamps saved from commemorative issues is challenging as sales and usage are not counted separately. The USPS has tried various methods to measure the retention rate for commemorative stamps, including collecting \"intent to retain\" data from customers and launching quarterly surveys. However, these approaches were costly and yielded limited results due to a high percentage of households reporting that they retained no stamps. In 1999, USPS implemented a more cost-effective design for measuring retention rates. In 1999, USPS launched a more cost-effective design using quarterly surveys to measure retention rates for commemorative stamps. The program provides net revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars for USPS, with stamps most kept by consumers."
