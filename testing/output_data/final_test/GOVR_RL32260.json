    "content": "The report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. Congress authorizes and appropriates aid, focusing on strategic interests such as support for Israel, peaceful relations with Arab neighbors, protection of petroleum supplies, and counterterrorism efforts. U.S. assistance also supports peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, as well as Jordan's stability. Since 1994, U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East has aimed at promoting stability in the region, focusing on strengthening Palestinian governance, preventing aid diversion to terrorist groups like Hamas, and encouraging democracy and socio-economic reform. This aid is driven by U.S. national security interests in the region, seeking stability in a region with energy reserves and volatile interstate relationships. Foreign aid has been used to encourage peace between Israel and Arab neighbors, strengthen bilateral relationships between the United States and Israel, and promote development to undercut radicalism in partner countries. It has also fostered close military cooperation and contributed significantly to Israel's security, Egypt's stability, and Jordan's friendship with the United States. The promise of U.S. assistance to Israel and Egypt during peace negotiations in the late 1970s helped enable both countries to take risks for peace. Israel and Egypt are the largest recipients of U.S. aid in the Middle East. There is debate over using foreign aid more aggressively to pursue objectives in the region, such as promoting democracy and human rights in Egypt or leveraging aid for the Middle East peace process. Some argue that U.S. aid should be tied to progress in extending rights to women and minorities in the Middle East, while others fear backlash from using aid to promote democracy. Critics claim U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the region by indirectly supporting Israel and bolstering autocratic regimes with similar interests. The U.S. aid in the Middle East has been criticized for its ties with autocratic regimes through military assistance, while some analysts believe it has helped protect Israel's security. Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since 1976, with strong congressional support. Israel has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since 1976, with strong congressional support. U.S. aid to Israel includes benefits not available to other countries, such as using military assistance for research and development in the U.S. and receiving all foreign assistance in the first 30 days of the fiscal year. The Obama Administration aimed to ensure Israel's security for regional peace, while the Bush Administration increased military assistance by $6 billion over a decade. The agreement between the U.S. and Israel includes incremental annual increases in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to Israel, reaching $3.1 billion a year by FY2018. This increase in assistance will allow Israel to potentially purchase sophisticated U.S. equipment, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Israel can still spend 26.3% of U.S. assistance on Israeli-manufactured equipment. Congress has taken steps to strengthen Israel's security and technological advantage over neighboring militaries. Annual FMF grants to Israel make up about 21%-22% of the Israeli defense budget. Israel is also eligible to receive Excess Defense Articles. For FY2011, the Administration requested $3 billion in FMF for Israel. Since FY1988, Congress has allowed Israel to use a quarter of its FMF funds as a cash grant for defense purchases. Israel receives its FMF aid in a lump sum at the start of the fiscal year to invest in U.S. Treasury notes. Egypt has been the second largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since 1979, receiving close to $2 billion annually. In July 2007, the U.S. announced $13 billion in military aid to Egypt over ten years. The United States has reduced economic aid to Egypt over a ten-year period, following a 3 to 2 ratio similar to aid to Israel. This reduction was part of the \"Glide Path Agreement\" reached in the late 1990s, leading to a decrease in ESF aid from $815 million in FY1998 to $411 million in FY2008. The United States reduced ESF aid to Egypt from $815 million in FY1998 to $411 million in FY2008. For FY2011, the Administration is requesting $250 million in ESF for Egypt. There is a desire to \"graduate\" Egypt from U.S. bilateral economic assistance, but there is disagreement on how aid should be reduced. Egypt wants to establish an endowment to jointly fund development projects. Some analysts believe Egypt seeks an endowment to shield aid from potential conditions. The government is seeking an endowment to protect aid to Egypt from potential conditions mandated by Congress. Congress passed a provision for an endowment of up to $50 million in economic aid to further shared interests between the United States and Egypt. Discussions and negotiations on the endowment are in early stages. The government is seeking an endowment of up to $50 million in economic aid to further shared interests between the United States and Egypt. Discussions and negotiations on the endowment are ongoing, with the Obama Administration considering a proposal for a bilateral endowment. Consultations with Congress and the Government of Egypt are ongoing to develop a vision for the endowment, but as of mid-2010, no agreement has been reached on its contours. The Egyptian government and the U.S. State Department have differing proposals for an endowment, with Egypt seeking a gradual phasing out of U.S. assistance and the U.S. aiming to start slowly to test success. Both sides agree on potential cooperation in education and science sectors, but significant seed funding of over $1 billion would be needed for daily operations. The Administration has requested $1.3 billion in FMF for Egypt in FY2011, divided into acquisitions, upgrades, and maintenance contracts. Approximately 30% of annual FMF aid is spent on new weapons systems, with a plan to replace older Soviet weaponry with U.S. equipment. Egyptian military officials seek additional funds for follow-on support due to rising costs. Egypt receives FMF funds to offset rising costs of follow-on support and EDA worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the Pentagon. Jordan has received economic and military aid from the US since 1951 and 1957, totaling approximately $11.38 billion through FY2010. Aid levels fluctuate based on threats and political differences, with a recent agreement for $660 million in annual foreign assistance over 5 years. The United States has committed to providing $360 million per year in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and $300 million per year in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to Jordan. The FY2011 request to Congress is $682.7 million for U.S. aid to Jordan, including economic and military assistance. Previous emergency supplemental bills have also provided additional funds to Jordan. The United States provides economic aid to Jordan through cash transfers and USAID programs, totaling $842 million in FY2010. Cash transfers are used for servicing Jordan's foreign debt, with 45% of the ESF allotment going towards this. USAID programs focus on democracy assistance, water preservation, and education, with a focus on optimizing water management due to Jordan's water scarcity. U.S. military assistance is aimed at upgrading Jordan's air force, including F-16 fighters and radar systems. The United States provides economic aid to Jordan through cash transfers and USAID programs, totaling $842 million in FY2010. Purchases include upgrades to U.S.-made F-16 fighters, air-to-air missiles, and radar systems. FMF grants also finance Jordan's purchase of U.S. Blackhawk helicopters for border monitoring and counter-terror capability. U.S. government has committed over $3.8 billion in bilateral economic assistance to Palestinians since 1993, with $2.3 billion provided since FY2004. Since 1993, the U.S. has provided over $3.8 billion in economic aid to Palestinians, with an average of $388 million per year since 2004. Assistance is mainly channeled through USAID's West Bank and Gaza program, with conditions for aid including Hamas acknowledging Israel's right to exist and adhering to international agreements. USAID provides assistance to Palestinians in sectors like humanitarian aid, economic development, democratic reform, water access, health care, education, and vocational training. U.S. funds are audited to prevent support for terrorist activities. Lawmakers ensure audits and inspections of USAID projects in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The United States provides assistance to Palestinians through various channels, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). U.S. contributions to UNRWA cover a significant portion of the agency's budget, making the U.S. the largest bilateral donor to UNRWA after the European Commission. This support is not considered bilateral economic aid to the Palestinians. Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned that contributions to UNRWA could inadvertently support Hamas activities in Gaza. A 2009 GAO report detailed how USAID vets contractors for its West Bank and Gaza program. The Obama Administration announced $400 million in economic aid to Palestinians in 2010, with $70 million as a new commitment. U.S. funds will be disbursed as a $240 million investment. U.S. funds will be disbursed as follows: $240 million investment by OPIC in the AMAL mortgage finance program in the West Bank, $75 million for infrastructure development in the West Bank and Gaza, $10 million for private sector enhancement, $40 million for UNRWA's Emergency Appeal in Gaza and the West Bank, $14.5 million for school rehabilitation and community infrastructure in Gaza, $10 million for new UNRWA schools in Gaza, and $5 million for water system projects in Gaza. U.S. assistance to Lebanon has increased significantly in recent years to support internal security and the economy. The U.S. has increased support for Lebanon's internal security and economy since 2005, following Syria's withdrawal and the election of the March 14th coalition. This includes economic assistance for democracy and development programs, reducing external debt, and providing military aid to train and equip the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces. Congress also ensures aid supports educational scholarships for students in Lebanon with high financial need. The Obama Administration is seeking $246.3 million in total aid for Lebanon in FY2011 to build critical institutions, particularly Lebanon's security services - the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) - to address border security, counter negative extremist elements, and curb the influence of Syria and Iran. U.S. aid also supports the UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon and Department of Defense Global Train and Equip funds for Lebanon. Since FY2006, Lebanon has received $61 million in Department of Defense Global Train and Equip funds for counterterrorism assistance. The United States promotes democracy, human rights, and reform in the Middle East, sparking debate on advocating for democracy in the Arab world and beyond as a counterweight to anti-American extremism. Advocates in the Arab world and beyond push for democratization to combat extremism and terrorism. Realists argue for prioritizing U.S. strategic interests over promoting democracy in dealing with authoritarian governments in the region. The United States is facing challenges in promoting democracy in the Arab world and Muslim-majority countries due to a shift towards realism in foreign policy. Recent events such as the victory of Hamas in Palestinian elections and Iran's nuclear program have led to a focus on regional security issues over political reform. The Obama Administration has shifted focus towards stabilizing Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, downplaying democracy promotion in foreign policy. Critics argue this approach, while officials claim a balance between realist and idealist camps. Efforts have been made to repair U.S.-Arab relations post the \"freedom agenda,\" with President Obama emphasizing that no government should be imposed by another nation. Events in Egypt and Iran continue to test the United States' commitment to promoting democracy in the Middle East. U.S. officials support reform through rhetoric, diplomacy, and financial aid, seen as a measure of the Administration's dedication. Previous administrations focused on political reform, education, and women's rights in the region. The Obama Administration has made adjustments in delivering aid programs in the Middle East, focusing on political reform, women's empowerment, and education. MEPI, a program within the U.S. State Department, supports these efforts with over $582 million in funding since 2002. MEPI, funded by over $582 million since 2002, aims to promote democracy in the Arab world by supporting indigenous Arab NGOs. Critics question its impact and whether it destabilizes autocratic regimes. Some argue it duplicates USAID's work in the region. MEPI began issuing small grants directly to NGOs in the Middle East to support political activists and human rights organizations. Congressional action facilitated MEPI's small grants program in Egypt, allowing U.S. government agencies to directly fund NGOs. MEPI grants were awarded to train election monitors for the 2005 elections in Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen, Morocco, and Kuwait. MEPI has funded various programs in countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel, focusing on women's social entrepreneurship and Bedouin women's empowerment. Hillary Clinton spoke at a college in Jeddah as part of the Saudi program. The goal is to teach women how to build businesses and leadership skills. In Israel, MEPI funds a project to empower Bedouin women in the Negev region. MEPI supports programs in countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel, focusing on women's social entrepreneurship and Bedouin women's empowerment. In Egypt, MEPI trained young political party representatives in organization and election processes. The Millennium Challenge Account funds countries committed to economic and democratic principles for development. Morocco was named eligible for Millennium Challenge Compact assistance in 2005 and signed a $697.5 million agreement in 2007. The government scores below the median in political reform but better in economic freedom and investments in people. The Compact aims to increase private sector growth through various initiatives like increasing fruit tree productivity, modernizing the small-scale fisheries industry, and supporting artisan crafts. Jordan was listed as a threshold country by the Millennium Challenge Corporation in FY2006, receiving $25 million in assistance. Prior to selection, Jordan faced criticism for its low scores on political rights and civil liberties. Jordan, a threshold country by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, received $25 million in assistance in FY2006. Despite low scores on political rights and civil liberties, Jordan did well on three indicators. Critics argue against selecting Jordan due to existing U.S. aid, access to private capital, and lack of democracy. MCC Board still chose Jordan, using Threshold assistance for water improvements. USAID implements the program, aiming to sign a Compact agreement in FY2010. The Near East Regional Democracy fund is seen as the Obama Administration's successor to previous Bush Administration democracy funding in Iran. The NERD account, managed by the Office of Iranian Affairs, allocates $10 million for expanding internet access in closed societies like China and Iran. The funding aims to strengthen local organizations promoting fair electoral processes and legal frameworks for elections. The Foundation for the Future (FFF) is a multilateral grant-making organization funded by the United States to support Arab Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in the Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) region. It was established in 2005 as part of the Bush Administration's Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA) to promote economic and political liberalization. The FFF is based in Amman, Jordan, with a satellite office in Washington, D.C. In 2005, the United States pledged $35 million to establish the Foundation for the Future (FFF) in Bahrain. In 2007, $21.3 million was obligated from the MEPI program to seed the FFF's endowment. Annual Foreign Operations Appropriations measures include limitations on funding for Palestinian organizations and institutions, such as bans on direct U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization for the West Bank and Gaza. The U.S. has restrictions on funding for Palestinian organizations like the PLO and Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza. Aid cannot be given unless certain conditions are met, including bans on funding for a new office in Jerusalem and the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. Audits are required to ensure funds are not diverted to terrorist groups. The Section states that the USAID Administrator should ensure that all contractors and sub-contractors are audited annually, and sets aside ESF funds for the USAID Inspector General to conduct audits. Bans U.S. assistance to a future Palestinian state unless the Secretary of State certifies that the leadership is democratically elected, committed to peaceful coexistence with Israel, and combating terrorism. The President can waive the certification if deemed important to U.S. The Middle East Regional Cooperation (MERC) program promotes normalized relations and science and technology in the Middle East by supporting joint projects between Arab and Israeli scientists. It was initiated by Congress in 1979 and expanded to include participation from Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Lebanon, and the West Bank and Gaza. MERC is receiving $4 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) in FY2010, with a request for $1.5 million in FY2011. The FY2011 request for Economic Support Funds (ESF) is $1.5 million. USAID's Middle East Regional Program (OMEP) receives funding from both the Development Assistance account (DA) and ESF, obligating $2 to $4 million annually for water cooperation activities. Middle East Multilaterals (MEM) was established after the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference to support peace projects, receiving $1 million in FY2010 ESF. MEM grants support the Middle East Desalination Center in Oman. In the decades following World War II, U.S. assistance to the Middle East was minimal compared to current aid flows. U.S. policy aimed to support oil-producing countries, remain neutral in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and counter Soviet influence in Iran and Turkey. Foreign aid in the 1950s and 1960s was used to achieve these objectives, with Israel receiving moderate economic aid mainly from France. Israel purchased its first advanced weapons system from the U.S. in 1962. In 1968, the Johnson Administration approved the sale of Phantom fighters to Israel, establishing U.S. support for Israel's military edge. Egypt received military aid mainly from the Soviet Union after 1955, despite U.S. attempts to court Egypt with economic aid. In the 1970s, U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East increased significantly, following a decline in aid levels after 1965 due to various factors including the June 1967 War and the Vietnam War. Egypt lost food aid from the U.S. after severing relations during the 1967 War, while Jordan and other Arab states also saw reduced aid. By 1970, Iran's aid was close to being phased out as policymakers viewed it as economically self-sufficient. After the U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam, U.S. foreign aid to the Middle East increased significantly. Large assistance packages were given to Israel and later to Egypt and other Arab governments. U.S. aid to Israel grew due to a sense of Israel being under siege after Arab-Israeli wars. Congress and public opinion supported strengthening Israel's military and economy through increased aid, with military loans rising from $30 million in 1970 to $545 million in 1971. Economic assistance shifted from project aid to commodity imports. The United States increased foreign aid to the Middle East after withdrawing from South Vietnam. Israel became the largest recipient of U.S. aid in 1976, receiving over $2 billion per year, mostly in military assistance. Egypt, in need of investment, also looked to the U.S. for economic growth. Anwar Sadat improved U.S.-Egyptian relations by seeking to reduce Soviet influence and promote economic liberalization. In the mid-1970s, improved U.S.-Egyptian relations led to economic aid resumption in 1975 and signing of disengagement agreements with Israel. The U.S. increased aid to Jordan after the 1970-1971 civil war. The 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt resulted in U.S. financial support for peace in the region, providing $7.3 billion to both parties. Since the Camp David Accords in 1979, the US has provided military and economic grants to Israel and Egypt at a ratio of 3 to 2 respectively. Egypt became the second largest recipient of US aid, helping to upgrade its defense budget and Soviet hardware. Notable events include a $2.25 billion funding package in 1985 and support for the US-led coalition against Iraq in 1991. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan have been top recipients of US aid, with Jordan becoming a leading recipient in the 1990s. In 1991, Egyptian support for the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait led to the cancellation of Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt. Congress provided Israel $650 million in emergency grants for war damages and gave them Patriot missiles. Aid to Jordan was significantly reduced after King Hussein refused to join the coalition. In 1992, Congress approved $10 billion in loan guarantees for Israel to absorb Soviet Jewish immigrants, with a penalty deducted for Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank. In 1994, the United States forgave Jordan's $702.3 million debt in recognition of their peace treaty with Israel. Congress appropriated $401 million in subsidies to cover the debt. In 1994, the United States forgave Jordan's $702.3 million debt in recognition of their peace treaty with Israel. Congress approved $400 million in grants for the Palestinians, $300 million for Jordan, and $1.2 billion for the Israelis in 2000 to implement the Wye River Agreement."
