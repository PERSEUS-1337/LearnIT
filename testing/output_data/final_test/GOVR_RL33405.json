    "content": "The House and Senate approved FY2007 defense appropriations and national defense authorization bills, with the President signing them into law. The appropriations bill includes $436.6 billion in new defense funding, while the authorization bill provides for operations abroad and other expenses. The FY2007 defense appropriations bill included $70 billion in additional appropriations as a \"bridge fund\" for operations abroad and other purposes, $4 billion below the Administration request. The Senate-passed bill provided $9 billion less than the request, allowing increases in non-defense appropriations while staying within the budget resolution cap. The conference agreement approved $70 billion in additional funds, $20 billion higher than originally provided. The FY2007 defense appropriations bill included $13.1 billion for Army and Marine Corps equipment repair and upgrades, $1.8 billion for border security, $700 million for counter drug operations in Afghanistan, $200 million for intelligence, $65 million for Predator UAVs, $20 million for peacekeepers in Sudan, and $175 million for wildfire suppression. The bill also provides over $17.1 billion for Army and $5.8 billion for Marine Corps reset costs, $100 million for Afghan counter-drug operations, and $200 million for wildfire suppression. The authorization conference agreement resolved key issues including altering DOD provisions for non-denominational prayer, promoting the head of the National Guard to four-star rank, and approving multiyear procurement of the F-22 fighter aircraft. It also expanded the President's authority to use the armed forces in domestic emergencies, allowed off-duty reservists to enroll in the TRICARE health insurance program, and provided expanded authority for the Defense Department to use funds for security assistance to foreign governments. The House and Senate have finalized agreements on the FY2007 defense appropriations bill and national defense authorization bill. Congressional action on the annual budget resolution began earlier in the year but was not completed. The House approved a compromise measure on May 18, including a cap of $872.8 billion, in the absence of a conference agreement. The House and Senate finalized agreements on the FY2007 defense appropriations bill and national defense authorization bill. The House approved a budget resolution with a cap of $872.8 billion. The \"deeming\" resolution was included in the rule governing debate on the FY2007 Interior and Environment appropriations bill. The House passed the Military Quality of Life/Veterans Affairs appropriations bill providing $58 billion for the Department of Defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported bill H.R. 5385 on July 20, providing $16.3 billion for Department of Defense military construction and family housing. Congressional action on defense budget is shown in a series of tables for FY2007 appropriations bills. The House military quality of life/VA appropriations bill includes about $42 billion for Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance accounts. The conference agreement on the defense appropriation bill follows the organization of the House-passed bill. The totals shown in the agreement do not include amounts for military personnel, operation and maintenance, and defense health from the military quality of life/VA appropriations bill. The table shows all appropriations for the Department of Defense but does not include funding for defense-related activities of other agencies. The Administration has requested about $17 billion in FY2007 for Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs, funded through the energy and water appropriations bill (H.R. 5427). The authorization bill does not directly provide funds for defense programs but authorizes the appropriation of funds. Congress may provide more, less, or the same amount as authorized in the appropriations bills. The Administration's FY2007 national defense request includes discretionary and mandatory amounts, with a $70 billion placeholder for supplemental appropriations in FY2006. The final FY2006 supplemental appropriations bill provided $67.7 billion for national defense programs. The total for FY2007 includes a $50 billion placeholder for a budget. The FY2007 national defense request includes a $50 billion placeholder for overseas operations, bringing the total discretionary request for the Department of Defense to $439.3 billion. The White House released a budget request of $513.0 billion for national defense in FY2007, with $441.2 billion for DOD operations, $17.0 billion for DOE nuclear weapons programs, and $4.8 billion for defense-related activities of other agencies. The $50 billion placeholder in the FY2007 national defense request is not meant to cover all military operation costs for the year. It serves as a temporary fund for the initial months, with the remaining costs to be covered by a later supplemental appropriations bill. The Pentagon also released the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, which highlighted key military capabilities for the future. Aspects of the FY2007 DOD request that concern Congress include new budget decisions. In the FY2007 budget, the Administration has requested $50 billion as a temporary fund for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before the fiscal year starts. This follows Congress's lead in providing similar \"bridge funds\" in previous years. The Administration will also seek additional funding through an emergency supplemental appropriations bill next year, exceeding proposed limits on discretionary spending. The Administration is requesting additional war funding that does not count against restrictive caps on regular annual defense and non-defense appropriations. War expenditures have become a significant part of total defense spending. In FY2006, Congress approved a $50 billion bridge fund and $66 billion in additional supplemental appropriations for a total of $116 billion. This amount increases defense funding by 28%. Last year's budget resolution capped total \"non-emergency\" appropriations at $843 billion. The $843 billion in appropriations for defense and non-defense programs was reduced by 1% to $835 billion. An additional $116 billion was allocated for war, increasing federal discretionary funding by 14%. Congress imposed a 1% across-the-board cut in all appropriations bills, trimming federal spending by $8.4 billion. Requests for war appropriations are not subject to the same level of review as regular defense spending. The Administration's budget amendment for a bridge fund lacks sufficient oversight and has not been submitted in advance of House action on the FY2007 defense authorization bill. The FY2007 budget for ongoing military operations is being considered through the regular defense authorization and appropriations process. The increase in funding appears significant due to a $8.5 billion cut in the FY2006 request by Congress. The Office of Management and Budget also trimmed DOD's budget to stay within overall appropriations limits for FY2007. The Office of Management and Budget trimmed DOD's FY2007 budget by $3.8 billion compared to the planned amount. Defense spending is projected to level off with modest growth rates, averaging 1.7% per year above inflation from FY2005 to FY2011. Total defense spending continues to increase, with a potential $56 billion increase between FY2005 and FY2006. The budget is tight for programs funded within the regular defense budget. The FY2006 defense budget faces cuts, leading to reductions in operations. Congress authorized active duty end-strength for the Army and Marine Corps, but plans to restore levels to pre-FY2004 baseline by FY2007. Some urge for permanent increase in authorized levels to ease ground forces' pace, but the Administration opposes due to high costs. The Administration opposes a permanent increase in authorized troop levels due to high costs. The Air Force plans to cut 40,000 positions over the next five years, while the Navy is cutting 12,000 active duty personnel. The Army is struggling to recruit and retain National Guard troops, requesting funding for only 333,000 troops in FY2007. The Army plans to reduce the number of new ARNG combat brigades to fully man and equip them within budget constraints. This change may result in some ARNG units losing personnel, affecting their ability to carry out state disaster response and homeland defense missions. State governors and National Guard leaders have criticized this plan. Congress has approved significant increases in military pay and benefits since 1999. In 1999, Congress approved substantial increases in military pay and benefits, costing up to 33% more than in the late 1990s. The FY2007 budget proposes measures to control pay and benefits growth, including a 2.2% military pay raise, the lowest since 1994. The Administration also plans to increase fees and co-pays for under-age-65 military retirees eligible for Tricare medical care. The Defense Department's 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review did not result in significant changes to ongoing programs or major weapons programs. The 2005-2006 Quadrennial Defense Review did not lead to significant changes in ongoing programs or major weapons plans reflected in the FY2007 budget request. Controversial decisions included halting procurement of the C-17 cargo plane and dropping plans to develop engines for the F-35 joint strike fighter from two manufacturers. The QDR was not meant to assess major defense programs but to provide a vision of national security challenges and needed military capabilities. The 2005-2006 Quadrennial Defense Review did not result in significant changes to ongoing programs or major weapons plans in the FY2007 budget request. The report endorsed adding 15,000 special operations troops without increasing overall military end-strength. It also supported various Navy initiatives, such as increasing \"green\" and \"brown\" water capabilities, constructing new prepositioning ships, and converting Trident II submarine-launched missiles to carry conventional warheads. However, the report left unresolved many defense policy issues. The 2005-2006 Quadrennial Defense Review did not result in significant changes to ongoing programs or major weapons plans in the FY2007 budget request. The report endorsed adding 15,000 special operations troops without increasing overall military end-strength and supported various Navy initiatives. However, it did not address the recently-released Navy shipbuilding plan for a combat fleet of 313 ships or the number of short-range fighter and ground attack aircraft needed in the long term. The report emphasized the need for long-range, prompt, global strike capabilities but did not make an explicit commitment to provide.

However, it did not address the Navy shipbuilding plan for a combat fleet of 313 ships or the number of short-range fighter and ground attack aircraft needed. The report emphasized the need for long-range, prompt, global strike capabilities but did not explicitly commit to full funding for modularizing all active and reserve combat units as planned. It endorsed capabilities in the Army's Future Combat System development program but did not explicitly endorse the program as a whole. The report mentioned restructuring the Transformational Communications Satellite program to incorporate less risky technology but did not discuss other space programs or the growing cost and security issues related to space-based systems.

The QDR did not address how to protect space-based systems from future threats or whether the U.S. security will be advanced by developing offensive space capabilities. Last year, congressional action on defense bills featured debates over policy toward military detainees and troop withdrawals from Iraq. This year, a continued debate over Iraq policy reemerged in congressional consideration of the FY2006 supplemental appropriations bill. The House approved a resolution by a vote of 256-153. The Senate debated Iraq policy in floor action on the FY2007 defense authorization bill, rejecting two amendments on troop reduction. Other issues emerged, including funding cuts in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations bill. Last year, Congress trimmed $4.4 billion from the FY2006 defense appropriations bill and applied it to non-defense appropriations, followed by an additional $4.1 billion cut in defense appropriations as part of an across-the-board 1% cut in all appropriations. The Senate added $3.7 billion to the FY2007 budget resolution cap on discretionary spending to avoid trade-offs between defense and non-defense appropriations. There is opposition in Congress to cuts in non-defense spending, with the defense bill being considered as a source of offsetting funds. The Senate also put a cap of $90 billion on total emergency funding in the FY2007 budget resolution. The Senate added $3.7 billion to the FY2007 budget resolution cap on discretionary spending to avoid trade-offs between defense and non-defense appropriations. There is opposition in Congress to cuts in non-defense spending, with the defense bill being considered as a source of offsetting funds. The Senate also put a cap of $90 billion on total emergency funding in the FY2007 budget resolution. The upcoming emergency FY2007 supplemental request, along with requests for funds for various purposes, is expected to exceed the cap. Congress may need to make rescissions, potentially cutting regular defense funding to accommodate the additional funding needed. The Senate has shown support for providing full funding for ongoing military operations in regular defense funding bills. The Senate approved an amendment by Senator McCain to require the President to include funding for Iraq in the annual budget submission. There is support in Congress for increasing Army and Marine Corps end-strengths. The FY2007 Army request trims funding for Army National Guard end-strength. Congress may mandate a higher force level. A 2.2% pay raise has been approved annually between 2001 and 2006. The Administration has requested a pay raise equal to the ECI, which is 2.2% for 2007, the lowest since 1994. There is sentiment in Congress to provide more, and opposition to proposed TRICARE fee increases for retirees due to rising medical benefits driving up military costs. The Defense Department is proposing legislative changes to increase flexibility in providing support to foreign nations, including using up to $750 million per year for building foreign military capacities for counterterrorist operations. This could potentially drive up military costs, a concern that has gained traction in Congress. Funding for National Guard and reserve equipment is also being discussed. The Defense Department is proposing legislative changes to increase flexibility in providing support to foreign nations, including using up to $750 million per year for building foreign military capacities for counterterrorist operations. Funding for National Guard and reserve equipment has become a contentious issue, with discussions on adding a representative of the Guard and reserve components to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and retiring an aircraft carrier. Senator Warner supports retiring a carrier, but there is still opposition. The issue of retiring the U.S.S. Kennedy aircraft carrier was initially addressed in the FY2006 supplemental appropriations bill, but was not approved. In FY2007, the Defense Department did not request funds for new C-17 cargo aircraft and instead asked for funding to terminate production after 180 aircraft. The Air Force proposed 7 C-17s as replacements for worn-out aircraft, while some legislators want to keep production lines open. The Air Force also proposed cutting the number of active B-52s, retiring F-117 stealth attack aircraft, and reducing the U-2 fleet. The Air Force has proposed cutting the number of active B-52s from 94 to 56 and retiring F-117 stealth attack aircraft and U-2 reconnaissance planes. Congress has rejected Air Force proposals to retire B-52s in the past. The Air Force wants to stretch out F-22 production until F-35 procurement begins, violating long-standing DOD and OMB policy. Congress has also rejected Air Force proposals violating the full funding policy. Funds to develop a second engine supplier for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are being eliminated. The Department of Defense is proposing to eliminate funds for developing a second engine supplier for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, saving $1.7 billion in development costs. Congress has held hearings on the issue, with senior DOD officials expressing reluctance. The Air Force is seeking a new refueling aircraft due to concerns about corrosion in current KC-135 air frames. Additionally, there are plans to convert Trident II missiles to carry non-nuclear warheads. The Quadrennial Defense Review prioritizes capabilities for long-range strikes, proposing to convert Trident II missiles for rapid strike missions. Congress is hesitant to fund the program until key questions are addressed. The Department of Defense plans to develop a new long-range strike system post-2015. Congress has cut funds and mandated restructuring of DOD space programs due to cost growth and schedule delays. The Administration plans to restructure the TSAT program with less risky technology. Congress is concerned about the risk reduction in space programs and the speed of new program development. Missile defense funding is a major concern, with the Missile Defense Agency deploying ground-based interceptors in Alaska without full testing. Congress may consider tying funding to the test program. Acquisition reform measures have been approved to improve cost tracking. Last year, Congress approved a measure to improve tracking of cost growth in weapons programs by requiring the Defense Department to report changes compared to original cost estimates. This revealed many programs with excessive cost growth, but Congress rejected a requirement for reevaluation compared to alternatives. Congress began action on the annual budget resolution, with both the House and Senate approving a cap of $827.8 billion on discretionary funds. The Senate Budget Committee reported its version of the budget resolution on March 10, with amendments approved on March 16. The committee recommended a level of defense spending $3.7 billion below the Administration request, but amendments added $4 billion to the recommended defense total. Senator Lott's amendment added $3.7 billion to the enforceable cap on total discretionary funding to prevent cuts in defense appropriations. The Senate also set a limit of $90 billion on total emergency funding in FY2007. The Senate Budget Committee recommended a level of defense spending below the Administration's request, with amendments adding to the total. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the budget resolution, recommending the Administration-requested level of defense spending. Republicans in the House agreed on a measure that may allow for increased funding for domestic discretionary programs while adhering to the proposed cap on total discretionary spending. The House passed the revised measure on May 18, including a cap only on non-defense emergency funding. The House and Senate did not reach a conference agreement on the budget resolution. Instead, they passed measures deeming parts of their resolutions in effect for subsequent action on appropriations bills. The House adopted its budget resolution in its entirety, while the Senate only adopted Sections 401 and 402, which established caps on regular appropriations and permitted additional funding. Section 401 set caps on regular appropriations, while Section 402 allowed emergency appropriations under specific circumstances and limits. The House and Senate each passed their versions of the FY2007 defense authorization bill, with highlights of the bills and floor actions outlined. The House approved a conference agreement on the bill on September 29. The defense authorization act was approved by the House and Senate in September. It does not provide funding for defense programs, only appropriations acts do. The House and Senate also approved their versions of the FY2007 defense appropriations bill. The House and Senate approved the defense authorization act in September, with the House focusing more on maintaining current military capabilities than on long-term defense transformation. The bill was debated in August and approved in September, with a conference agreement announced on September 21. Funding details are shown in Table 3. The committee supported larger Army, Marine Corps, and Army National Guard end-strength than the Administration wants, with potential long-term budget implications. They also trimmed higher risk missile defense technologies in favor of more immediately deployable systems and continued to cut funding for satellite programs. The committee was reluctant to support proposed cuts in weapons programs, such as halting production of the C-17 cargo aircraft. The committee did not agree to halt production of the C-17 cargo aircraft and restored funds for a second engine supplier for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They also increased the military pay raise to 2.7% and added a new health benefit for reservists. Additionally, the committee rejected proposals to reduce health care costs and approved measures to increase co-pays for some prescription drug purchases. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved most of the Administration's proposals for giving regional combatant commanders more authority and resources to build foreign military capabilities. They also approved a $50 billion bridge fund for overseas military operations in FY2007, including costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The committee slowed down programs for developing an anti-satellite laser and converting Trident II missiles to carry conventional warheads. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a $50 billion bridge fund for overseas military operations in FY2007. The bill increased Army and Marine Corps end-strength and provided a 2.7% pay raise for uniformed personnel. Tricare fees for under-65 retirees were rejected, and a task force was established to control DOD medical costs. The committee added an amendment to allow reservists (excluding federal employees eligible for government health insurance) to enroll in Tricare by paying 28% of the program cost. Last year, Congress made Tricare available to unemployed reservists at 50% cost. The House approved Tricare for reservists for the first time, while the Senate had approved it in the past two years. Congress also made over-65 military retirees eligible for DOD medical care in the FY2001 national defense authorization act. In FY2007, Congress approved over-65 military retirees to receive medical care through the DOD TRICARE program as a supplement to Medicare, costing over $11 billion. Congress intended to shift these costs to the general treasury to increase funding for weapons programs and defense priorities, but the OMB continued to score them as discretionary funds in the DOD budget. The House Armed Services Committee included a provision in the FY2007 authorization to mandate that TRICARE-for-Life contributions not be scored as part of the DOD budget after FY2007. Additionally, the bill provided the same death gratuity for civilian personnel killed in support of a military operation as for uniformed personnel, and increased the military death gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000 in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act. Funding for readiness was also addressed by objecting to cuts in ship steaming days, flying hours, and depot maintenance, with $856 million shifted from other programs in service. The committee expressed concerns about cost growth and schedule delays in the Army Future Combat System development, cutting $326 million from the requested budget. They also added funds for M-1 tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle upgrades to support Army modularization efforts. Additionally, the committee required a long-term funding profile for the Army's new modular brigade-centered force structure. The committee added funding for Army National Guard equipment and Navy shipbuilding, including advance procurement for two Virginia-class submarines. They approved funding for one DD(X)/DDG-1000 destroyer, causing concern for shipyard proponents. Last year, they had proposed eliminating the DD(X). The committee rejected funding for advance items for new aircraft carriers but supports the Navy's 313 ship plan. They added $1.4 billion for F-22 procurement and $408 million for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They also reduced funding for aircraft procurement in FY2008 by $241 million. The committee added $300 million for three C-17s in Title IX of the bill, requiring the Air Force to operate at least 299 heavy-lift cargo aircraft. They also mandated at least seven more C-17s and prohibited B-52 and U-2 retirements until replacement capabilities are available. Additionally, the committee cut $185 million from missile defense R&D. The committee cut $185 million from missile defense R&D, adding funds for GMD testing and Navy ship-based interceptor systems while reducing funding for various programs like KEI, GMD site activation in Europe, multiple kill vehicle program, and high-altitude airship sensor program. They also prohibited $200 million expenditure on the GMD program until successful intercept tests are completed and required a report on space-based interceptors. Additionally, $80 million was cut from the TSAT program and $30 million from the Space Radar due to technical risks. The committee cut $30 million from the Space Radar due to technical risks and established a new office for satellite development. They also prohibited funds for laser space technologies for anti-satellite weapons and required consultations with allies for Trident II missile conversion. Additionally, $341 million was cut from DOD information technology programs. The committee cut funding for various programs including the VH-71 Presidential helicopter, Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs, and cooperative threat reduction with Russia. They also approved a measure for competing contractors to bid on programs with large cost growth. The House Armed Services Committee approved measures for competing contractors to bid on programs with cost growth ceilings and DOD support for foreign nations in combined military operations. They did not include proposals for building foreign military capacity for counterterrorism or stability operations. The House Armed Services Committee included provisions in the authorization bill to limit defense acquisition of foreign-made goods, such as prohibiting contracts with companies receiving government subsidies and establishing a board to identify critical items for national security. They also included a provision to prohibit defense purchases from companies providing material on the U.S. Munitions List to China. The House Rules Committee considered numerous proposed floor amendments to the bill, permitting only a few of them. In a series of rules on the bill, the House permitted a total of 35 amendments, including one by Representative Skelton to reverse a measure increasing co-pays for prescription drugs. A high-profile amendment by Representative Goode allowing military personnel to support border protection passed by a vote of 252-171. This amendment has been proposed in previous years but has never been accepted in the final conference. The House had an extensive floor debate this year, approving a program to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops for border operations. There were debates on amendments for privately funded abortions for military personnel overseas, cutting funds from the Missile Defense Agency budget, and changing current procedures for Survivor benefits. These amendments were rejected by the House in votes ranging from 191-237 to 202-220. The House approved a measure to change current procedures for Survivor Benefit Plan benefits, with other amendments also approved. The Senate Armed Services Committee marked up its version of the defense authorization, approving more troops for the Army and Marine Corps. The House and Senate approved additional troops for the Army and Marine Corps, exceeding the requested numbers. Congress disagreed with the Administration's plan to reduce active ground forces. The Senate committee also proposed expanding the authority of regional military commanders for training and providing assistance to foreign nations. The committee restricted funding for a measure to two years, considering it a pilot project with an assessment to follow. Consultations with ambassadors were required, and waivers of human rights restrictions were not allowed. The Senate committee supported the Army Future Combat System (FCS) and provided the full $3.7 billion requested, but mandated a review of the program's costs. If the Army cost estimates for the FCS are unstable, Congress may consider ending it. The committee authorized $517.7 billion for defense programs, including $50 billion for overseas operations. They approved end-strengths of 512,400 for the Army and 180,000 for the Marine Corps, above the requested levels. Additionally, they authorized an end-strength of 350,000 for the Army National Guard, with provisions for equipment procurement if recruitment goals are not met. The committee approved a 2.2% military pay raise instead of the 2.7% raise authorized by the House. They rejected increases in TRICARE fees for under-65 retirees and required a full audit of DOD health care costs. The committee also allowed DOD flexibility to support foreign nations for counterterrorism operations. The committee approved $200 million per year for two years for foreign militaries in counterterrorism operations, with restrictions on regional commander spending and consultations with U.S. ambassadors. The President must develop a plan for interagency counterterrorism coordination. The Defense Department is taking on roles previously held by the State Department due to funding cuts. The committee also required a legal opinion on interrogation techniques. The committee proposed amendments to the Insurrection Act to allow the President to use armed forces for domestic emergencies. They directed the Secretary of Defense to create a UAV policy and allocated $1.5 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funds for new carriers and amphibious ships. The committee bill includes provisions such as permitting a reduction in deployable aircraft carriers from 12 to 11, rejecting the termination of C-17 production, and authorizing funds for Army Future Combat System (FCS) development. Additionally, the committee allocated funds from a $50 billion emergency fund to enhance regular service accounts. The committee allocated $515 million for Navy operations, $231 million for Army operations, and $106 million for Marine Corps operations from a $50 billion emergency fund to address readiness-related shortfalls. The committee also approved measures for defense acquisition reform, including aligning program manager tenure with program progress and linking incentive payments to acquisition outcomes. Additionally, land exchanges are being considered to build buffers around military facilities. The Senate committee approved measures to build buffers around military facilities by allowing the exchange of excess land. They also supported funding for cooperative threat reduction programs with former Soviet states and mandated an annual growth of 2% above inflation in science and technology research and development funding for the Defense Department. The Senate committee approved $9.3 billion for Missile Defense Agency R&D programs, with funds shifted to near-term projects. They added $200 million for GMD testing and $100 million for Navy interceptor system, while cutting $200 million from boost-phase Kinetic Energy Interceptor. They also trimmed $70 million from TSAT program and $66 million from Space Radar program. The Senate committee expressed support for DOD's plan to develop prompt global strike capabilities by converting Trident II missiles to carry non-nuclear warheads. They also prohibited the retirement of B-52 bombers until force requirements are reported, but allowed the retirement of up to 18 B-52H aircraft with specific upgrades. The Senate committee added funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and cut procurement funds due to schedule delays. They rejected the Air Force plan to stretch out F-22 production and added funding for 20 F-22s. The Senate began floor consideration of the defense authorization bill and debated Iraq policy. The Senate debated Iraq policy, with a vote of 93-6 to table an amendment requiring the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq by December 31, 2006. Senator McConnell brought up the measure originally authored by Senator Kerry, but it was rejected. Two other amendments were considered, one by Senator Levin for troop reductions to begin this year and another by Senator Kerry for most troops to be withdrawn by July 1, 2007. Both measures were rejected. Senator McCain also proposed an amendment to require the President to request funding for ongoing military operations with the regular federal budget. The Senate debated Iraq policy, with a vote of 93-6 to table an amendment requiring the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq by December 31, 2006. Senator McConnell brought up the measure originally authored by Senator Kerry, but it was rejected. Two other amendments were considered, one by Senator Levin for troop reductions to begin this year and another by Senator Kerry for most troops to be withdrawn by July 1, 2007. Both measures were rejected. Senator McCain proposed an amendment for the President to request funding for ongoing military operations with the regular federal budget. President has rejected legislative provisions directing budget requests as unconstitutional in the past. Clinton Administration agreed to request funding for Southwest Asia operations in regular FY1997 defense request. The Clinton Administration requested funding for ongoing military operations in Southwest Asia in its FY1997 defense request. The McCain amendment proposed including the full cost of military operations in the federal budget. The total amount for national defense in regular appropriations bills is determined by the allocation of funds among appropriations subcommittees. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions for FY2007, with different discretionary spending amounts allocated to the appropriations committees. The House allocated $872.8 billion, $475 million below the Administration request, while the Senate allocated $877.0 billion, $3.7 billion above the request. The House Appropriations Committee reported initial subcommittee allocations on May 4, subject to revision. The initial House allocations for FY2007 appropriations trim funds from defense, Military Quality of Life/VA, and foreign operations subcommittees. This allows for increases in Labor-HHS and homeland security appropriations. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the defense appropriations bill, leading to H.R. 5631. Congress had previously trimmed DOD programs in the regular appropriations bills. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee marked up the defense appropriations bill, leading to H.R. 5631. The committee approved a total of $377.6 billion in the bill, making cuts in various areas including procurement, operation and maintenance, and military personnel accounts. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a total of $377.6 billion in the defense appropriations bill, making cuts in procurement, operation and maintenance (O&M), and military personnel accounts. Cuts include $784 million from projected underexecution of approved personnel levels and $288 million from the Air Force for Operation Noble Eagle costs. Additionally, $433 million in O&M savings are from shifting Operation Noble Eagle costs to emergency appropriations. The committee redirected funds from various programs to emergency war funds in Title IX, avoiding the need for increases in military personnel accounts. They did not provide funds for the 2.7% military pay raise approved in the House-passed authorization bill or for increases in end-strength levels. The committee increased general transfer authority to $4.75 billion in the regular bill and an additional $2.5 billion in Title IX to accommodate potential requirements. The House appropriators made adjustments to various defense programs in FY2007, including cutting funding for Army Future Combat System R&D and Transformational Communications Satellite R&D, adding funds for DDG-51 destroyer modernization and F-22 aircraft procurement, and allocating money for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They also reduced funds for F-35 procurement. The House appropriators made adjustments to defense programs in FY2007, including cutting funding for Army Future Combat System R&D and Transformational Communications Satellite R&D, adding funds for DDG-51 destroyer modernization and F-22 aircraft procurement, and allocating money for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In contrast, the authorization approved $245 million, reduced funds for F-35 procurement, eliminated funds for shutting down C-17 cargo aircraft production, eliminated $38 million for converting Trident II D-5 missiles, and shifted procurement funds to be funded with emergency funds for the war. The House appropriators did not add $400 million for a second Virginia-class attack submarine in FY2009, eliminated funding for 12 EA-18G electronic warfare versions of the F-18 aircraft, and instead shifted funds to add 12 F/A-18E/F aircraft. Traditionally, House floor debate on the defense appropriations bill is brief, but this year saw a number of controversial amendments considered. The House considered controversial amendments on the floor in June 2006, including proposals to strip congressional earmarks from the bill. Less controversial amendments were approved, such as restoring funding for specific programs and prohibiting certain uses of funds. The House debated and rejected several amendments on U.S. national security policy, including measures to limit NSA surveillance activities, prevent military action against Iran without congressional approval, and prohibit permanent basing rights in Iraq. Amendments to prohibit certain provisions of the National Security Personnel System and privatization of base operation support services at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital were also discussed. Several unsuccessful amendments were proposed during the House debate on U.S. national security policy, including restrictions on NSA surveillance, military action against Iran without congressional approval, and basing rights in Iraq. Amendments to limit provisions of the National Security Personnel System and privatization of base operation support services at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital were also discussed. During the House debate on U.S. national security policy, several amendments were proposed and withdrawn, including ones related to prosthetic research funding, alternative fuel vehicles in the Navy, religious discussions in the Air Force, and social security numbers on military IDs. Representative Flake also proposed amendments to remove earmarks for specific projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee announced initial budget allocations on June 22, 2006, providing less funding for defense than requested by the Administration. This decision put the Senate at odds with the White House on budget priorities and the use of emergency appropriations. The White House criticized the House defense appropriations bill for cutting $4 billion from the request and shifting $2 billion from the regular DOD budget to emergency spending accounts. The White House warned of a veto if the final bill significantly underfunded the Department of Defense to shift funds to non-security spending. The Senate committee version of the defense appropriations bill allocates $453.5 billion for defense programs, including $50 billion for overseas operations. An additional $11.3 billion is for retiree medical benefits, bringing the total appropriation for FY2007 to $464.8 billion. The bill is $9.1 billion below the Administration's request, prompting the White House to threaten a veto if defense funding is cut to shift funds to non-defense programs. The Senate also reallocates $9.5 billion from defense to non-defense appropriations bills. The Senate bill reallocates funds from defense to non-defense appropriations, with concerns raised about shifting funding to overseas operations. The White House criticizes the practice, estimating $2 billion shifted from regular defense appropriations to additional funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate bill reallocates funds from defense to non-defense appropriations, including funds for M-1 tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle upgrades, C-17 production, and V-22 tilt rotor aircraft. Senate budget resolution sets caps on discretionary funding and emergency appropriations, posing challenges for future funding requests for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Appropriations Committee is facing challenges with future funding requests for Iraq and Afghanistan due to caps on discretionary funding and emergency appropriations. A supplemental request for Iraq and Afghanistan, along with costs for Katrina-recovery, bird flu preparations, border security, and agricultural disaster relief, is expected to exceed the cap. To address this, only part of the funding for Iraq and Afghanistan in the bill is designated as FY2007 emergency funding, totaling $42.1 billion out of $50 billion in Title IX. The Senate Appropriations Committee version of the defense appropriations bill provides $7.9 billion in FY2006 funds available on enactment, not triggering a point of order for exceeding FY2006 discretionary spending levels. The bill includes $9.1 billion in cuts, mainly in operation and maintenance (O&M) and general provisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee's defense appropriations bill includes $2.6 billion in cuts, with major reductions in Army depot maintenance, peacetime training offsets for the Army and Navy, Air Force air operations, facilities repairs, civilian personnel, and flying hour requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee's defense appropriations bill includes $2.6 billion in cuts, with reductions in Army depot maintenance, peacetime training offsets for the Army and Navy, Air Force air operations, facilities repairs, civilian personnel, and flying hour requirements. Major cuts include $53.2 million from Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), $985.3 million in rescissions of prior year appropriations, and various other reductions in different areas of the bill. The committee also provided funds for a 2.2% pay raise for personnel. The conference agreement includes a 2.7% raise for military personnel, an increase in Army and Marine Corps active duty end-strength, and funding adjustments for various weapons programs. This is in contrast to the Senate Appropriations Committee's defense appropriations bill, which includes $2.6 billion in cuts across different areas. The conference agreement includes cuts to Future Combat System R&D and Littoral Combat Ships, elimination of funds for a T-AKE cargo ship, addition of funds for an oceanographic survey ship, elimination of funds for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter procurement, addition of funds for alternative aircraft engine R&D, full funding for 20 F-22 fighter aircraft procurement, and rejection of the proposal to shut down C-17 production after FY2007. The Senate rejected the Administration's proposal to shut down C-17 production after FY2007 and made changes to funding for various aircraft programs, including cutting funds for Navy EA-18G aircraft and adding funds for F/A-18E/F aircraft. They also made cuts to Transformational Communications Satellite R&D and Space Radar funding, while providing $340 million for National Guard and Reserve equipment. The Senate debated the defense appropriations bill in August and September, with a focus on Democratic amendments and a high-profile debate on Iraq policy and civilian leadership at the Department of Defense. Senator Reid and other Democrats proposed a new direction in Iraq policy, challenging Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. The Senate completed action on the bill on September 7. The Senate debated the defense appropriations bill, with a focus on Democratic amendments and a high-profile debate on Iraq policy and civilian leadership at the Department of Defense. An amendment by Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye added $13.1 billion in emergency funds to repair and replace equipment used by Army and Marine units in Iraq and Afghanistan. Army and Marine Corps officials testified about the costs of \"resetting\" units to repair, upgrade, and replace equipment lost in overseas operations. The ongoing debate about readiness became increasingly heated. The Army and Marine Corps estimated long-term reset costs of $17 billion and $12-13 billion respectively. Senators proposed amendments to add $10 billion for resetting Army and Marine Corps units, leading to a surprise $13.1 billion amendment. Another amendment added $1.8 billion for border security. The Senate approved funding for border security as part of the defense bill, raising debates on the proper funding vehicle and finding offsets. Senator Durbin proposed $2 million for brain injury imaging, opposed by Senator Stevens due to concerns over increasing medical R&D funding in defense appropriations. Senator Inouye supported Senator Stevens in tabling an amendment related to military requirements. Veterans organizations raised concerns about funding for a brain injury center. Senator Allen later proposed adding $19 million for brain injury programs. The Senate passed almost 90 amendments during the debate from August 1 to September 7, with most being non-controversial measures for specific projects. Notable amendments included SA 4751 by Senators Stevens and Inouye. On August 1, the Senate approved a proposal by Senators Stevens and Inouye, adding $13.1 billion in emergency funds to reequip Army and Marine Corps units returning from Iraq. They also allocated $2.4 billion to National Guard and Reserve units. Additionally, the Senate approved $1.8 billion for fences and vehicle barriers on the Mexican border. Senator Durbin's amendment for an Army medical R&D program was rejected. The Senate approved several amendments, including adding $2 million for an Army medical R&D program, requiring the Defense Department to list and assess congressional earmarks, posting reports electronically within 48 hours, limiting DOD funding for conferences to $70 million, and providing $19 million for a DOD/VA brain injury program. The Senate approved an amendment by Senator Allen, SA 4883, providing $19 million for a DOD/VA brain injury center. Another amendment by Senators Feinstein and Leahy, SA 4882, to prohibit cluster munitions near non-combatants was rejected by a vote of 30-70. An amendment by Senators Kennedy and Reid, SA 4885, requiring more information on trends toward civil war in quarterly reports on Iraq was tabled by a vote of 54-44. Additionally, an amendment by Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes to privatize base support services at Walter Reed Hospital was tabled by a vote of 50-48. Senator Rockefeller's amendment, SA 4906, to eliminate parts of the bill authorizing intelligence activities was withdrawn. Finally, an amendment by Senator Conrad, SA 4907, adding $200 million in emergency funds to enhance intelligence community efforts was approved unanimously. Conrad, SA 4907, approved $200 million in emergency funds to enhance intelligence efforts to capture Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders. Schumer's amendment, SA 4897, approved $700 million for counter-drug programs in Afghanistan. Boxer's amendment, SA 4913, required a report on procedures for sectarian violence in Iraq. Kennedy and Hatch's amendment, SA 4857, prohibited privatization of civilian work if contractors offer inferior retirement benefits. Stevens and Murkowski's amendment, SA 4917, allowed reimbursement for financial hardships due to extended deployment. Reid and Obama's amendment was also approved. The Senate approved several amendments, including $20 million for African Union force in Sudan, $275 million for wildfire suppression, $65.4 million for Predator UAVs, and tabled an amendment to prohibit funds for a public relations program promoting positive coverage of the war in Iraq. Conferees reached an agreement on the defense appropriations bill on September 21. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided less money for defense than the Administration requested in the defense appropriations bill. The reductions were made up with emergency appropriations, but the White House objected to using emergency funds to offset defense cuts. The White House objected to using emergency funds to offset defense cuts, leading to a veto threat if funding was cut by more than $4 billion. Despite a compromise, defense was ultimately cut by $4 billion in the appropriations conference agreement. Issues with funding shortfalls for Army and Marine Corps equipment were also addressed. The Senate added $13.1 billion in emergency funding to meet Army and Marine Corps reset goals, increasing the total in the bridge fund to $70 billion. The conference agreement provided $17.1 billion for Army and $5.8 billion for Marine Corps reset, totaling $22.9 billion. Additional emergency funding was also added for fences and vehicle barriers on the Mexican border and counter-drug efforts. The conference agreement allocated $1.8 billion for fences and vehicle barriers on the Mexican border, $700 million for counter-drug measures in Afghanistan, $200 million for intelligence programs targeting Al Qaeda leaders, $65 million for Predator UAVs, $20 million for peacekeepers in Sudan, and $275 million for wildfire suppression. Most of these measures were rejected, with funding provided for Afghan counter-drug operations, Sudan, and wildfires. The agreement also addressed disagreements over funding for major weapons systems, including rejecting the termination of C-17 cargo aircraft production. The Administration proposes to terminate C-17 cargo aircraft production after FY2007 and buys 22 aircraft, including funds for Navy destroyers, T-AKE cargo ship, Littoral Combat Ships, and an ocean survey ship. It provides funding for Army Future Combat system R&D, slows F-35 Joint Strike Fighter procurement, and maintains development of an alternative engine. Full funding is provided for F-22. The curr_chunk adds $340 million for the development of an alternative engine, fully funds F-22 procurement in FY2007, approves multiyear procurement of F-22s, shifts funds for 4 EA-18Gs to 4 F/A-18s, provides $70 million for a new refueling aircraft, adds $290 million for National Guard and reserve equipment, and reduces funding for various satellite and launch vehicle programs. The conference agreement includes funding adjustments for various defense programs, such as adding $200 million for Ground-Based Missile Defense and $85 million for sea-based missile defense. It also provides for a 2.2% military pay raise, with the possibility of reprogramming funds if a 2.7% raise is approved. Additionally, funds are allocated for Army National Guard end-strength of 350,000 and additional Army and Marine personnel. $127 million for deploying conventional warheads on the Trident II missile is eliminated, with $5 million provided instead. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for various military operations, including training Afghan and Iraqi security forces, supporting reconstruction projects in Iraq, and studying alternatives for the global strike mission. It also prohibits the use of funds in violation of U.S. laws against torture. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill did not resolve the issue of funding for the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center. The Senate added $19 million for the center in the Defense Health Program, but the funding was not included in the final agreement. Final action on brain injury funding will be discussed in the military quality of life/VA bill. The defense authorization bill agreement was announced on September 28 and officially approved by the House on September 29 and the Senate on September 30. One of the last issues resolved was regarding military chaplains offering prayers according to their conscience. The agreement also addressed other major defense policy issues. The conference agreement on the defense authorization bill includes allowing non-deployed and mobilized reservists (excluding Federal employees) to sign up for TRICARE with a 28% premium. Despite opposition from the Administration, Congress decided to expand TRICARE eligibility. For FY2007, Congress approved higher Army and Marine Corps end-strength than the Administration wanted, funded through emergency supplemental funding. Future disputes over budget implications may arise as both services seek additional personnel. Congress also set targets for further end-strength increases in FY2008 and FY2009. The conference agreement accepted a Senate amendment to the \"Insurrection Act,\" giving the President expanded authority to use armed forces in response to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or health emergencies if state and local agencies cannot maintain order. Additionally, since September 11, 2006, the Defense Department has been granted increased authority to cooperate with foreign military forces and governments, including using funds to build the capacity of foreign militaries. The Defense Department requested expanded authorities in FY2007 to build the capacity of foreign militaries for counterterrorist and stability operations, including economic development activities. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on defense budget issues, naval transformation, navy force structure, shipbuilding plans, amphibious and maritime prepositioning ship programs, and navy attack submarine procurement. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on defense budget issues, naval transformation, navy force structure, shipbuilding plans, amphibious and maritime prepositioning ship programs, and navy attack submarine procurement. The curr_chunk lists various CRS reports on military airlift, conventional warheads for ballistic missiles, military forces size, Tricare costs, military pay and benefits, disposal of chemical weapons in the ocean, and radioactive tank waste from nuclear weapons production."
