    "content": "The Duplication Elimination Act of 2015, also known as the Act, allows for expedited consideration of GAO recommendations in Title II of a joint resolution related to the public debt limit. The Duplication Elimination Act of 2015 defines terms like 'GAO report' and 'joint resolution' for legislative changes based on GAO recommendations to reduce the deficit. The President must submit a proposed bill within 90 days of the GAO report's publication. The President must transmit a special message to Congress with a proposed joint resolution within a year of the GAO report's publication. The message should detail recommendations excluded from the resolution, reasons for exclusion, and recommendations included in the resolution. If Congress is not in session, the message is to be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives. The President must transmit a special message to Congress with a proposed joint resolution within a year of the GAO report's publication. The message should detail recommendations excluded from the resolution, reasons for exclusion, and recommendations included in the resolution. If Congress is not in session, the President shall make the message publicly available and publish a notice in the Federal Register. The proposed joint resolution will be introduced in the Senate and House on the next legislative day by the majority leaders. The joint resolution, designated by the majority leader of the House, is not referred to a committee and is immediately placed on the calendar. A motion to proceed to a joint resolution is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to postponement. If agreed to, the joint resolution remains unfinished business until disposed of. In the House of Representatives, a joint resolution is considered as read, with all points of order waived. The previous question is ordered on the resolution without intervening motion, allowing for 2 hours of debate divided equally between majority and minority leaders. A motion to reconsider the vote is not allowed, and final passage must occur within ten days of introduction. In the Senate, consideration of a joint resolution is limited to 10 hours divided equally between majority and minority leaders. A motion to further limit debate is allowed, but amendments, postponements, or other motions are not. Passage of the joint resolution must occur immediately after Senate proceedings. The Senate limits consideration of a joint resolution to 10 hours, with a vote on final passage within ten days of introduction. Appeals on procedural rulings are decided without debate. Points of order in the Senate or House are addressed promptly. In the Senate or House of Representatives, a Member may raise a point of order regarding a joint resolution's definition. Joint resolutions cannot be amended in either house. If one house receives a joint resolution from the other, it is not referred to a committee. When the House receives a joint resolution, the procedure is the same until the final vote, which will be on the other House's resolution. This rule does not apply if the Senate's resolution is a revenue measure. The subsection enacted by Congress outlines the rulemaking power in the Senate and House of Representatives regarding joint resolutions, recognizing the constitutional right of each House to change rules related to their procedures."
