    "content": "The procedures for filing information returns with the IRS remain unchanged by recent legislation. Deadlines for filing are February 28 (or March 31 for electronic filing) and copies must be provided to payees by January 31. Payees must provide their information to facilitate reporting, and the information return must accurately identify both payer and payee. The payer must request taxpayer information from the payee, who must provide it. If the payee fails to provide a taxpayer identification number, the payer must collect backup withholding at a rate of 28%. A penalty of $50 applies for each failure to provide the correct taxpayer ID. IRS regulations govern reporting of credit card and third party network transactions, creating exceptions to reporting requirements. The IRS regulations state that transactions subject to reporting under \u00a7 6050W will not be reported under \u00a7 6041 if made by credit card or through a third party network. Failure to submit accurate information returns to the IRS or provide copies to payees incurs monetary penalties. Penalties under \u00a7 6721 and \u00a7 6722 of the IRC have been revised by the Small Business Jobs Act. The penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 of the IRC have been revised by the Small Business Jobs Act to align the penalty structure. The changes are effective for returns filed after December 31, 2010, with lower penalties if corrective action is taken. The penalty for failing to file a correct return is $50 per defective return, not exceeding $250,000, with reduced penalties for early correction. Penalties for late or incorrect information returns are based on the timing of correction and the gross receipts of the payer. The penalty is $30 per return if corrected before August 1, not exceeding $150,000. Small businesses with gross receipts under $5 million have reduced penalty ceilings. Failure to provide correct and timely statements to payees incurs a $50 penalty per return, not exceeding $100,000 per payer. Intentional disregard of filing duties may result in higher penalties. Section 2102 of the Small Business Jobs Act increased penalties for failing to provide information returns to the IRS or payees in a timely manner. Penalties were raised across the board and will be updated for inflation every five years. Intentional disregard of filing duties may result in higher penalties. The Small Business Jobs Act increased penalties for failing to file information returns with the IRS, with penalties being raised and indexed for inflation. The amendments also allow for reduced penalties if corrective actions are taken. Willful failure to file may result in fines up to $25,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Willful violation is defined as a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty. Good-faith misunderstandings of the requirements do not constitute willful violations.

Section 6041 was amended twice in 2010 by PPACA and the Small Business Jobs Act, but both amendments were later repealed by the Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and Repayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011. In 2011, \u00a7 9006 of PPACA amended the reporting requirement in IRC \u00a7 6041 by removing the automatic exemption for payments to corporations and expanding the types of payments triggering the reporting requirement. The Small Business Jobs Act further expanded the payers required to comply with reporting requirements to include landlords. The recent amendment of \u00a7 6041 expanded reporting requirements to include landlords who receive rental income. Landlords may now be considered engaged in a trade or business for reporting purposes and may need to file Forms 1099 for payments related to their rental properties."
