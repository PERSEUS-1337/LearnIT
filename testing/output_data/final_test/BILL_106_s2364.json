    "content": "The \"Social Security Right to Know Act\" is the short title of the Act. It expands the Social Security account statement. The \"Social Security Right to Know Act\" amends Section 1143(a)(2) of the Social Security Act to provide information on the program's cash flow deficits starting in 2015 and the need for general tax revenues to finance benefits. The Social Security Trust Fund has claims on future Government resources to cover deficits through 2037, with revenues sufficient to pay 72 percent of benefits thereafter. The Trust Fund balances are not real economic assets but claims on the United States Treasury that will need to be financed through taxes or borrowing in the future. The Social Security Trust Fund balances do not impact the Federal Government's ability to pay benefits, as they will need to be financed through taxes or borrowing in the future. The amendments made by subsection (a) will apply to statements provided after the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF ANNUAL REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS. Expansion of the annual report of the Social Security Trust Funds to include clear and simple information based on Alternative II findings of the Chief Actuary, such as estimates of when Trust Funds' outlays will exceed cash income. The annual report of the Social Security Trust Funds will now include information on the annual excess of projected outlays over cash income, excluding certain sources like intragovernmental transfers and interest income. This data will be provided for each year up to projected program insolvency, along with the aggregate amount of excesses over a 75-year period and changes from previous reports. The annual report of the Social Security Trust Funds will now include information on the deficit or surplus in the last year of the 75-year projection period, along with the aggregate assets and unfunded obligations. It will also detail the necessary increase in payroll taxes or reduction in benefits to maintain financial balance after Trust Fund exhaustion. The annual report of the Social Security Trust Funds will now include information on maintaining financial balance by raising payroll taxes or reducing benefits if delayed for 5, 10, 25, and 50 years. It will also explain that Trust Fund balances are not real economic assets but are available to finance future benefit payments in a bookkeeping sense. The Social Security Trust Fund balances are not real economic assets but claims on the United States Treasury. When redeemed, they will need to be financed through taxes, borrowing, or benefit reductions. Information on financial balance will be presented in nominal dollars, inflation-adjusted dollars, and present discounted value in the annual report. The Board of Trustees will publish the economic model and relevant data used for financial projections in the Social Security Trust Fund report. Any changes to the model and data in the past year will also be included. A separate report to Congress will contain the same information annually by April 1st. These amendments will apply to reports after the enactment date of the Act."
