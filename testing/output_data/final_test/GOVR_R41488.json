    "content": "In October 2010, the Social Security Administration announced that beneficiaries would not receive a cost-of-living adjustment in 2011 due to a lack of inflation. This was the second consecutive year without a COLA, affecting various programs like Supplemental Security Income and veterans' pensions. The absence of a COLA for Social Security beneficiaries and veterans in 2011 led to calls for a one-time $250 payment in January 2012 to assist economically vulnerable individuals and stimulate the economy. Democratic congressional leaders plan to introduce legislation for this payment before the end of the 111th Congress. Some proposals in the 111th Congress aim to address concerns about the Consumer Price Index's accuracy in calculating Social Security COLA. Policy considerations include the economic status of older Americans and the effectiveness of one-time payments as an economic stimulus. The report discusses the design of a one-time payment proposal for Social Security beneficiaries, including the eligible population, administrative issues, and budget impact. The Social Security COLA is an annual inflation-adjustment to benefits, with automatic COLAs since 1975 based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage. The COLA for Social Security beneficiaries is based on the rate of inflation measured by the CPI-W, published monthly by the BLS. It is calculated from the third quarter of the base year to the third quarter of the current year, with the increase applied in December and payable in January. No COLA was given in January 2010 or 2011 due to a decrease in the CPI-W. Beneficiaries will not receive a COLA in January 2011 as the average monthly CPI-W fell by 0.6% from 2008 to 2010. The next COLA will be payable when the CPI-W exceeds the 2008 level. If there is a decrease in the CPI-W, Social Security benefits are not reduced, and benefits remain flat. In 2010 and 2011, Social Security beneficiaries benefited from a provision preventing a negative COLA, which kept benefit amounts from decreasing. Most beneficiaries were protected from a decrease in net Social Security benefits due to an increase in Medicare Part B premiums, but some may have experienced a reduction in benefits. In 2010 and 2011, Social Security beneficiaries faced a potential net reduction in benefits due to Medicare Part D premium increases. The absence of a COLA also impacted other Social Security provisions, keeping certain program elements unchanged from 2009 levels. In 2010 and 2011, Social Security beneficiaries did not receive a COLA, affecting other programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and causing a potential net reduction in benefits due to Medicare Part D premium increases. The SSI program provides monthly cash benefits to aged, blind, or disabled persons with limited income and assets. Veterans' Pension Benefit Programs and Railroad Retirement Board Programs also offer means-tested pension benefits that are increased by the same percentage as the Social Security COLA. Tier II benefits are increased by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA. COLAs for Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Military Retirement System are not triggered by Social Security COLA but use the same formula for computing COLAs. CSRS provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits to civilian federal employees hired before 1984. Military Retirement System includes monthly compensation, disability retirement, and survivor benefits. Both programs adjust benefits annually by a COLA. The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits to civilian federal employees hired in 1984 or later. The COLA for FERS is based on the percentage change in the CPI-W over the same measurement period as the Social Security COLA, with a formula that limits the COLA if inflation exceeds 2.0%. Benefits for non-disabled retirees aged 62 or older, disabled retirees, and survivors are adjusted annually by a COLA. Benefits for disabled veterans and survivors of certain servicemembers and veterans are not automatically indexed for inflation. The Veterans' Disability Compensation and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) provide monthly cash benefits to veterans and survivors of servicemembers. The amount is based on disability level, and a COLA is enacted annually by Congress. The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2010 provided a COLA for these benefits in 2011. The Boskin Commission, led by Michael Boskin of Stanford University, found that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) overstated inflation by 1.1% per year during 1995-96. The commission identified methodological issues such as consumers' shift to discounters and incomplete accounting for product substitution in response to price changes. The largest source of bias (0.6% per year) was attributed to difficulties in adjusting the index for new products and changes in product quality. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has since made improvements to the CPI methodology, including adjusting spending weights more rapidly. The CPI methodology has been improved by adjusting spending weights more rapidly and making technical changes to the formula. However, concerns remain about accurately capturing new products and changes in quality. The CPI-W, used for Social Security COLA, may not reflect the spending habits of retired individuals, who spend more on healthcare. Persons aged 65 and older spend over twice as much on healthcare compared to the overall population. Those aged 75 and older allocate nearly three times as much. In 1987, Congress directed BLS to create the CPI-Elderly (CPI-E) to better track elderly spending patterns. The CPI-E has increased about 0.3 percentage points more per year than the CPI-W from 1985 to 2009. However, there are technical limitations to the CPI-E and caution should be used when interpreting its data. The CPI-Elderly (CPI-E) was created in 1987 to track elderly spending patterns, as seniors spend more on healthcare. The CPI-E has historically increased more than the CPI-W, but there are limitations to its data. Healthcare quality improvements are argued to be understated in BLS inflation measures, impacting the price of healthcare for seniors. Medicare covers major medical expenses for most elderly, leaving out-of-pocket costs for items like prescription drugs and long-term care. The CPI-E tends to grow faster than the CPI-W, with average annual increases of 3.1% and 2.9% respectively from 1985 to 2010. However, the CPI-E rose more slowly than the CPI-W in certain years. Energy prices peaked in 2008 but fell sharply, with neither index recovering by 2010. Using the CPI-E instead of the CPI-W would not have led to a Social Security COLA in 2010. The CPI-E declined from 2008 to 2009, leading to no Social Security COLA in 2010. Various bills in Congress proposed one-time payments instead of a COLA, with different payment amounts and eligibility criteria. Some bills suggested using a different inflation measure for COLA calculations. H.R. 5987 would provide a one-time $250 payment to all Social Security beneficiaries. H.R. 5987 proposes a one-time $250 payment to all Social Security beneficiaries, including children, disabled beneficiaries, railroad retirees, SSI recipients, and certain veterans if no COLA is payable in 2011. The payment would be made to eligible individuals who were entitled to benefits in the months leading up to the bill's enactment. Payments would not be made to prisoners or aliens not lawfully present in the U.S. The one-time $250 payment proposed in H.R. 5987 would not be considered income for taxation purposes and would not affect federal programs. Speaker Pelosi, Senator Reid, and the President supported the payment for Social Security beneficiaries, veterans, and people with disabilities. Some Members of Congress questioned the need for the payment or suggested financing provisions be included in the legislation. The report discusses issues surrounding a one-time payment to those affected by Social Security COLA, including economic conditions of older Americans, dependence on Social Security benefits, economic vulnerability, effectiveness as economic stimulus, means testing, parity for government retirees, improper economic recovery payments, potential budget impact, and new poverty data from 2010 showing increased poverty rates. In 2009, the national poverty rate increased to 14.3%, with 43.6 million people living in poverty. The aged group saw a decline in poverty rates, dropping to 8.9%. Children under 18 experienced an increase in poverty rates to 20.7%. Social Security beneficiaries received a 5.8% COLA increase in January 2009 due to rising energy prices. In 2008, Social Security recipients benefitted from a one-time spike in energy prices and a $250 payment from ARRA. In 2009, some individuals also received a Recovery Rebate tax credit on their federal income tax returns. In 2009, lower poverty thresholds and additional income contributed to lower poverty rates for the 65 and older age group compared to 2008. Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 and older had a poverty rate of 9.4%, with those aged 80 and older being the most economically vulnerable. The poverty rate for individuals aged 80 and older is 9.4%, 1.5 times higher than the 65-69 age group. Poverty increases with age, especially among women in the 80 and older category, with a poverty rate of 11.8%. Social Security benefits are crucial for those 65 and older, with 87% receiving benefits in 2008. For a third of beneficiaries, these benefits make up at least 90% of their income. The older the age group, the greater the reliance on Social Security benefits. For over half of those aged 80 and older, these benefits make up at least 80% of their income, compared to only 30.2% of the 65-69 age group. Overall, older beneficiaries rely more on Social Security benefits as they age. Data shows that median household income for those 65 and older was $24,857 in 2008. However, over half of those 80 and older had incomes below $20,000, compared to 28% of the 65-69 age group. Lawmakers have suggested a one-time payment to stimulate demand post-recession. Despite the NBER's announcement of the end of the recession in June 2009, current economic indicators remain weak. The unemployment rate has stayed around 9.6%, and real GDP increased by 2.0% in the third quarter of 2010. Increasing government spending on infrastructure, goods and services, and aid to state and local governments could help boost economic recovery. Fiscal stimulus measures aim to increase demand by providing payments to individuals and reducing taxes. To be effective, stimulus should be timely, targeted at those who will spend it immediately, and temporary to avoid long-term deficits. Government spending creates additional income, leading to a multiplier effect on the economy. For example, extending unemployment benefits can encourage immediate spending from cash-strapped individuals. The CBO published estimates on government spending categories and fiscal policy options for boosting the economy. These temporary expenditures are deficit-financed and will increase government debt in the short term. Fiscal multipliers show the impact of different policy options on economic activity, with higher multipliers indicating more effective stimulus. For example, government spending on unemployment benefits has a multiplier of 1.9, meaning a $1 increase in spending results in a $1.90 increase in economic activity. The top three categories of fiscal policy options with the highest impact are increasing aid to the unemployed, reducing employers' payroll taxes, and reducing payroll taxes for employers who increase their payroll. Additional government spending can only work if recipients quickly spend the money they receive. CBO's 2010 report states that many elderly individuals save at rates similar to working-age populations, resulting in moderate impact on output for Social Security beneficiaries. The impact of spending on unemployment benefits is higher than a one-time payment to Social Security beneficiaries due to the higher multiplier effect. A one-time payment in lieu of a Social Security COLA is expected to provide a small economic stimulus, leading to an increase in output and employment. However, fiscal restraint may be necessary in the future to address the accumulation of government debt. The CBO study suggests that expanding government spending now and implementing fiscal restraint later is feasible. With current unused capacities and high unemployment, the nation's output is 6% below its potential. Means testing a one-time payment can target those in financial need and boost economic stimulus. Certain subgroups of the population aged 65 and older, like those aged 80 and older, are more economically vulnerable. Means testing a one-time payment could reduce costs but increase administrative challenges, potentially delaying payments. Lawmakers must decide on an income threshold that effectively targets beneficiaries without excluding many. Exploring means testing through specific low-income Medicare categories is an option not yet considered. Certain groups, like federal employees under CSRS and some government retirees, are ineligible for Social Security benefits. Certain state and local government retirees and aged, blind, and disabled residents of certain territories are not eligible for Social Security benefits or SSI benefits. Extending a one-time federal payment to these groups may pose administrative difficulties. Economic recovery payments authorized by the ARRA were limited to specific beneficiaries. Section 2202 of the ARRA authorized a $250 tax credit for government retirees not eligible for economic recovery payments, providing them with a monetary benefit equivalent to the payment. However, this tax credit was not available until the 2009 tax return in 2010. The ARRA did not provide economic recovery payments to retirees in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An audit found that over $22 million was sent to deceased individuals and incarcerated persons. The SSA accurately issued over 99.8% of payments to eligible beneficiaries. The SSA-OIG identified improper economic recovery payments sent to deceased individuals and incarcerated persons under the ARRA. Over 71,000 payments were made to ineligible recipients due to lack of awareness of deaths or improper review of files. Additionally, 17,348 prisoners received payments, which may not have been improper depending on their incarceration timing. No provisions in the ARRA or Social Security Act explicitly prohibit these payments. The ARRA does not grant the SSA or Treasury Department the authority to reclaim improper economic recovery payments, including those issued via electronic funds transfer. This has led to challenges in reclaiming money from checks issued to deceased beneficiaries that are improperly cashed by others. The estimated cost of a one-time payment in lieu of a Social Security COLA varies depending on the proposal structure, with key factors including the dollar amount of the payment and the pool of eligible beneficiaries. Some proposals suggest $150 or $250 payments to Social Security beneficiaries only, while others include beneficiaries of other federal programs linked to the Social Security COLA. The size of the eligible beneficiary pool would also depend on whether the payment is for all program beneficiaries or limited to adults. Some proposals suggest one-time payments to Social Security beneficiaries, with offset provisions to cover costs. Examples include temporary payroll tax increases for higher-wage earners and redirection of unobligated ARRA funds. Similar to the 2009 $250 economy recovery payments, these proposals aim to provide relief to adult beneficiaries. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided a one-time $250 refundable tax credit for government retirees. Nearly 54.7 million economic recovery payments were issued by SSA, VA, and RRB totaling over $13.6 billion. Proposed bills like H.R. 3536 and S. 1685 suggested one-time payments of $150 and $250 respectively to Social Security beneficiaries and other groups in 2010. H.R. 5834 (Representative Deutch) proposes a $250 one-time payment to beneficiaries of Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, railroad retirement pensions, and veterans' disability compensation or pension benefits in years without a COLA. The estimated cost of the payment in 2011 is $13.3 billion, offset by revenue provisions in the bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic Senators support a $250 emergency relief payment for vulnerable senior citizens and disabled veterans to help with increased living costs. The absence of a Social Security COLA in 2011 has prompted calls for legislative action, affecting beneficiaries of various federal programs. CBO and SSA predict a Social Security COLA will resume in 2012, with multiple bills introduced in Congress to address the issue. Some bills propose one-time payments or alternative inflation measures for Social Security COLA. Democratic leaders plan to introduce legislation for a one-time payment after the November elections to stimulate the economy and assist vulnerable seniors with rising healthcare costs. Critics argue against the necessity of a one-time payment due to previous high COLA percentages and protection against deflation. The CPI-W remained below its 2008 peak during the measurement periods for the 2010 and 2011 COLAs. Opponents argue against one-time payments for Social Security, citing budget costs and ineffectiveness as a stimulus measure. The introduction of the C-CPI-U index aimed to address concerns about the methodology of the CPI-U, specifically to eliminate substitution bias. The C-CPI-U series, introduced in December 1999, shows slower increases compared to other BLS inflation indices. It has not been incorporated into federal government programs due to revisions and delays in final data availability. The final C-CPI-U release can be delayed for up to two years after the specific month."
