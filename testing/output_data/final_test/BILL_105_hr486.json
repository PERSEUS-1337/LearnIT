    "content": "The Act titled \"Native American Telecommunications Act of 1997\" establishes Indian telecommunications policy as a new section in the Communications Act of 1934. The Congress finds that Indian and Alaskan Native people live in remote areas, with high poverty rates and low phone penetration. Phone service in Indian country is often substandard and expensive despite efforts by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the Federal Communications Commission to implement recommendations for universal service by May 8, 1997. Federal universal service policies have not adequately reached Indian country, where telecommunications services on Indian lands have historically been lacking. The United States recognizes the sovereignty of Indian tribes in relation to the States. The Federal Communications Commission is required to develop an official policy regarding its relations with American Indians and Alaskan Natives, recognizing their special needs, tribal sovereignty, and trust obligations of the United States. The policy aims to promote tribal governments' authority over communications policies within their jurisdictions and support Native Americans' interests. The policy established by the Federal Communications Commission aims to promote Native Americans' participation in telecommunications services and improve negotiations between tribes and states. It includes procedures for giving notice and opportunities for participation in proceedings affecting tribal lands. The Commission will forbear from applying any provision of the Act or regulation to ensure compliance with the trust responsibility of the United States. The Federal Communications Commission will review and revise policies every three years to promote Native American participation in telecommunications services. Amendments include including Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages in regulations. SEC. 3. ATTAINMENT OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE PRINCIPALS IN INDIAN COUNTRY. Section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to ensure the delivery of telecommunications and information services to Native Americans, including Alaskan Natives, at just, reasonable, and affordable rates as a Federal responsibility. The Commission will collect data on Native American subscribership and affordability of telecommunications and information services on Indian lands to ensure just, reasonable, and affordable rates. This data will be easily accessible to the public and used to guide actions for improving service delivery to Native Americans. SEC. 4. INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY INITIATIVES.\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to include Native American Telecommunications Infrastructure Policy Initiatives, encouraging investment and deployment of telecommunications systems on Indian lands."
