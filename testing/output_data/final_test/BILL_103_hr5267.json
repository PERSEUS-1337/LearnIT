    "content": "The \"National Composting Act of 1994\" is cited as the short title. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for coordinating composting programs under a new chapter added to the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. The Congress finds that billions of dollars are spent annually on municipal solid waste management in the United States. A substantial portion of discarded municipal solid waste is organic material that could be composted. Approximately half of this compostable material could be diverted from the waste stream by composting at home, school, work, and on farms, reducing the social and economic burden of waste management. Composting organic material enhances soil productivity by adding nutrients and disease suppressing factors, reducing erosion and run-off. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a structure for source-separated composting and the use of resulting compost to achieve 'zero-discharge' of materials at home, school, work, and on farms. Composting enhances soil productivity, reduces erosion and run-off, and is an efficient way for farmers to move towards sustainable agriculture. Federal coordination of composting and use of compost is addressed in Section 1477. The Secretary of Agriculture appoints a national composting coordinator to lead federal composting efforts. The coordinator's responsibilities include developing agreements with federal agencies for composting, creating procurement guidelines for source-separated compost on public lands, and establishing a soil conservation program for compost production and use. Establishment of a nationwide `compost from waste' program, including a Zero-Discharge Community Challenge for communities to compete for awards, and a clearinghouse for composting information accessible to the public. Establishment of a nationwide program to compost organic discards from cafeterias, develop compost programs in various industries, create guidelines for compost use in agriculture and public lands, and conduct outreach programs for backyard composting. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting and coordinating cooperative composting and compost utilization programs for homes, schools, workplaces, and farms by providing training and technical support. The text defines compost as biologically decomposed organic materials and composting as the controlled decomposition of organic matter. It also authorizes $2,000,000 for the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 for program implementation. The text introduces a new chapter on the coordination of composting, including sections on findings, purpose, definitions, federal coordination, and authorization of appropriations. It also mandates the Secretary of Agriculture to designate compost usage as an eligible activity for Federal cost sharing in soil conservation programs."
