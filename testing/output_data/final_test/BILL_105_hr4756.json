The \"Year 2000 Preparedness Act of 1998\" defines key terms such as end-to-end testing, small and medium-sized businesses, and Year 2000 compliant information technology. End-to-end testing involves testing data exchange software from initiation to receipt and acceptance. Small and medium-sized businesses are defined as those with less than 500 employees. Year 2000 compliant IT accurately processes date and time data between the 20th and 21st centuries, including leap year calculations. The \"Year 2000 Preparedness Act of 1998\" defines the Year 2000 computer problem as any issue preventing technology from processing date and time data accurately. The Year 2000 Conversion Council is established to address these issues. The President must ensure Federal agencies develop business continuity plans for uninterrupted delivery of critical services. The Congress urges the President to lead in promoting Year 2000 awareness for IT systems and critical infrastructure. The Chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council should address issues in Federal agencies not meeting the deadline. The Council on Infrastructure Assurance, along with government officials and private sector representatives, should develop a national strategy to prepare critical infrastructures for the Year 2000 date change. The Chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council is raising awareness by organizing a National Y2K Action Week. Federal agencies should assist small businesses and farmers in assessing their readiness for the Year 2000 computer problem. American family businesses, farmers, state and local governments, and private sector industry groups should prepare for the Year 2000 computer problem by assessing exposure, taking remedial steps, and formulating contingency plans. SEC. 5. Federal agency reports on the Year 2000 computer problem must be sent to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 6. The Chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council should work with industry to create guidelines for addressing the computer problem. SEC. 7. A national assessment of the Year 2000 computer problem is required. SEC. 7. The Chair of the Year 2000 Conversion Council must present a national assessment of the Year 2000 computer problem to Congress, covering critical national infrastructures and key sectors of the economy. This includes banking, finance, energy, telecommunications, transportation, and vital human services. To ensure uninterrupted computer operations by Federal agencies post-December 31, 1999, agency heads must ensure Year 2000 compliance of systems and hardware. This includes establishing testing schedules, implementing new data exchange formats, and notifying data exchange partners. To ensure uninterrupted computer operations post-December 31, 1999, agency heads must notify data exchange partners of implications if appropriate date conversion corrections are not made in time. Priority should be given to installing filters to prevent system corruption from data exchanges with noncompliant systems. Additionally, specific provisions for potential data exchange failures should be developed as part of continuity and contingency planning efforts. The agency must make timely date conversion corrections and convene quarterly meetings with data exchange partners to assess progress. Reports summarizing meeting results and data exchange corrections must be transmitted to Congress. SEC. 9. ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES: The National Institute of Standards and Technology, with the Small Business Administration, will develop a Year 2000 compliance outreach program for small and medium-sized businesses, including a self-assessment checklist, explanation of the issue, best practices, federal resources, and compliant products. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, in collaboration with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, will create a Year 2000 consumer awareness program. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, a list of government resources, compliant products, and public awareness announcements or seminars on the impact of the Year 2000 computer problem on consumer products and services. Public awareness announcements or seminars will be conducted on the potential effects of the Year 2000 computer problem on Federal Government services and the progress made in resolving the issue by Federal agencies. The House of Representatives passed the document on October 13, 1998."
