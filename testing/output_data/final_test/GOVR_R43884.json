    "content": "This report outlines the FY2015 annual appropriations measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enacted by the 114th Congress. It complements CRS Report R43796. The legislative chronology and overview of DHS appropriations sought by the Administration and proposed by Congress are provided. Prior to the 114th Congress, an FY2015 appropriations bill for DHS had not been enacted. Senior appropriators indicated pursuing an omnibus appropriations package in the lame duck session of the 113th Congress. An interim continuing resolution for FY2015 was signed into law by the President. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, was signed into law on December 16, 2014, providing an extension of continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security through February 27, 2015. H.R. 240, an annual appropriations bill, would provide DHS with $39.7 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The bill for adjusted net discretionary budget authority, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers on January 9, 2015, was considered under a structured rule on January 13 and 14, 2015. Five amendments were made in order, including \"Sense of Congress\" amendments and provisions affecting fund availability. The bill introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers on January 9, 2015, included three key amendments. The first restricted the use of federal funds for the Administration's immigration initiatives. The second prohibited funds for DACA applications, and the third required DHS to treat aliens convicted of offenses differently. The House bill introduced by Chairman Rogers on January 9, 2015, included amendments restricting federal funds for immigration initiatives, prohibiting funds for DACA applications, and requiring DHS to prioritize deporting aliens convicted of specific offenses. The bill passed the House on January 14, 2015, and the Senate adopted a similar amendment on February 27, 2015. A three-week extension of funding for DHS did not pass the House, but the Senate amended a bill to extend funding through March 6, 2015. The House and Senate passed a bill to extend funding for DHS through March 6, 2015. The President signed the bill into law as P.L. 114-3. On March 3, 2015, the House approved the Senate version of H.R. 240, which was signed into law as P.L. 114-4 on March 4, 2015. The homeland security appropriations bill provides resources to all DHS components. Funding details for FY2014, FY2015, and P.L. 114-4 are outlined in tables. DHS's discretionary budget authority for FY2015 is broken down by component. DHS's new discretionary budget authority for FY2015 is detailed by component in Table 3, showing appropriations from largest to smallest. The total discretionary appropriations do not include adjustments under the Budget Control Act, which are accounted for separately at the bottom of the table. The figures in Figure 1 display the budget authority provided in P.L. 113-76 for FY2014 and the breakdown for the FY2015 request. Neither appropriated mandatory spending nor rescissions of prior-year budget authority are reflected in the component totals. The breakdown of DHS's discretionary budget authority for FY2015 is detailed in a table, comparing the request with House- and Senate-reported bills. The levels provided under P.L. 114-4 are also shown."
