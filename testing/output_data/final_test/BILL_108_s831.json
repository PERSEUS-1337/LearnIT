COASTAL PREDICTION CENTER. Establishment of a Coastal Prediction Center for the Chesapeake Bay within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Center will gather, analyze, and organize coastal information and data for the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries to create predictive products for policymakers. The Coastal Prediction Center for the Chesapeake Bay will develop an Internet-based system for integrating and disseminating coastal information and predictions related to climate, land use, pollution, environmental quality, ecosystem health, aquatic resources, and weather. The Coastal Prediction Center for the Chesapeake Bay may enter agreements with other entities to provide data, information, and support for activities related to sediment distribution, erosion, and environmental events. This includes agreements for information products collection, processing, analysis, interpretation, and publication. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education and Training Program is established. The Director, in cooperation with the Chesapeake Executive Council, establishes a Chesapeake Bay watershed education and training program to improve understanding of the ecosystem and meet educational goals. Grants are authorized to fund projects related to the program. The Director can award grants for environmental education projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to not-for-profit institutions, consortia of institutions, schools, teachers in the watershed, or State Departments of Education within the watershed.
