    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Commonwealth of Australia Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that bilateral agreements have enhanced economic growth in the US, trade should promote sustainable development and higher living standards, and countries that open their markets empower citizens to alleviate poverty. The Commonwealth of Australia actively participates in World Trade Organization programs promoting open trade and reaffirmed its commitment to core labor standards in 1996. The United States policy on trade is outlined in Section 3. The United States seeks to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries, focusing on national treatment, rules of origin, customs procedures, standards, and safeguard provisions for industries. The United States aims to address various aspects in bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries, including safeguard provisions for industries, government procurement procedures, national treatment for foreign investors, protection of intellectual property, transparency of legal regimes, measures for electronic commerce, trade-related environmental measures, and adherence to core labor standards. The President is authorized to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia, subject to certain conditions. Fast track consideration of the implementing bill is also authorized. Whenever the President submits a bill to implement a trade agreement to Congress, it must be introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate. The bill should include necessary provisions to implement the trade agreement, along with trade-related labor and environmental protection standards, but cannot include certain amendments to existing laws. Fast track procedures apply to the implementation of trade agreements. In subsection (b)(1), add \"section 5 of the United States-Commonwealth of Australia Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001\" after \"the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988\". In subsection (c)(1), add \"or under section 5 of the United States-Commonwealth of Australia Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001\" after \"the Uruguay Round Agreements Act\"."
