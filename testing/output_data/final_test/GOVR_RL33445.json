    "content": "On March 8, 2006, U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman announced plans to negotiate a free trade agreement with Malaysia. Eight rounds of talks have been held, with a ninth round postponed. Efforts to finalize the agreement before the end of the Bush Administration were unsuccessful due to issues like Malaysia's government procurement policies. The negotiations for a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Malaysia have faced challenges, including issues with Malaysia's government procurement policies, market access for U.S. companies in services sectors, intellectual property rights protection, and access for U.S. exports. U.S. Ambassador James Keith mentioned 23 unresolved trading issues in December 2008. The negotiations remained controversial in Malaysia, with support for continuing talks on certain topics like government procurement and intellectual property rights, but some issues like rice imports were not discussed. The financial crisis in the U.S. also impacted the negotiations. In Malaysia, concerns were raised about opening up financial markets to U.S. companies due to the financial crisis. Various interest groups, including SMEs, called for terminating FTA negotiations, fearing harm. Opposition party member Tony Pua suggested a \"white paper\" to ensure negotiation team compliance with government policies. Israel's military operation in Gaza further complicated the future of the proposed FTA. Israel's military operation in Gaza led to calls in Malaysia for a boycott of U.S. products and suspension of FTA talks. Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry announced a temporary halt to FTA negotiations with the U.S. due to concerns over U.S. support for Israel's actions. The Obama Administration's stance on the negotiations remains unclear. Minister Muhyiddin informed that negotiations for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA would resume after Obama's inauguration. President Obama emphasized workers' rights and environmental issues in trade talks. Ron Kirk was nominated as U.S. Trade Representative to ensure agreements protect workers' rights and the environment. Initially planned for three rounds in 2008, only two rounds of talks were held in January and July. The third round of U.S.-Malaysia FTA talks was postponed at the request of the United States in 2008. There was a perception in Malaysia that the Bush Administration did not prioritize relations with Malaysia or FTA negotiations. Ambassador Keith reassured the press of the U.S. commitment to Malaysia, citing House Resolution 518 commemorating Malaysia's 50th anniversary. On December 30, 2007, U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Barbara Weisel confirmed the U.S.'s goal to conclude the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement by summer. The Bush Administration planned to seek congressional approval once negotiations were finished. The seventh round of formal negotiations began on January 14, 2008, with the U.S. seeking progress but no set deadline for completion. Ambassador Keith expressed hope for negotiations to be completed by the middle of the year. Ambassador Keith hoped negotiations for the U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement would be completed by mid-2008. Mixed assessments followed the seventh round of talks, with discussions on investment, trade, intellectual property, and legal issues. Both U.S. and Malaysian news agencies reported positive progress and the possibility of concluding the negotiations by summer. Press accounts of the FTA talks became less optimistic after the seventh round of negotiations. Minister Rafidah Abdul Aziz saw no need for a deadline, but Ambassador Keith warned that if the FTA with Malaysia was not completed by July, the U.S. would focus on other agreements with South Korea and Colombia. No decision was made on the next round of talks. The United States and Malaysia agreed on the next steps for the FTA talks, setting dates for the next round of negotiations. Minister Rafidah indicated that issues had been cleared, suggesting no need for further meetings. The eighth round of talks took place in Washington, DC, focusing on various trade topics. Political events in both countries overshadowed the negotiations. Political events in both nations, including the upcoming U.S. presidential elections and Malaysia's general elections, influenced the FTA talks. The uncertain status of proposed U.S. FTAs with Colombia and South Korea also played a role. The key issue for the July 2008 talks was foreign access to Malaysian government procurement contracts. Other topics discussed included competition policy, environment, labor, and financial services, with any agreements on these topics being non-binding. During the eighth round of Malaysia-U.S. FTA negotiations, progress was made in market access for U.S. agricultural exports and service providers. Malaysia excluded rice from consideration in the FTA talks, but discussions on business collaboration and capacity-building in the services sector were positive. The U.S. hoped Malaysia's government procurement reforms would advance negotiations. Minister Muhyiddin expressed willingness to explore possibilities for collaboration. The U.S. received encouragement in October 2008 when Malaysia indicated willingness to discuss government procurement in FTA negotiations. The U.S. took a pragmatic approach in negotiations, but using the Singapore FTA as a model caused issues in talks with Malaysia. Plans for the ninth round of negotiations were postponed after the U.S. presidential elections, with Minister Muhyiddin announcing it would be held in Kuala Lumpur in November 2008. In November 2008, Malaysia postponed FTA negotiations with the U.S. until the new Obama Administration took office. The U.S. expressed interest in concluding the FTA as soon as possible under the new administration. Malaysia, as a predominantly Muslim nation, has a history of supporting the Palestinian struggle against Israeli oppression. Malaysia strongly condemns Israel's military actions in Gaza, leading to calls for a boycott of U.S. goods and services. Specific boycott targets include Coca Cola, KFC, McDonalds, and Starbucks. Anti-boycott voices in Malaysia claim the boycott will hurt. On January 10, 2009, the Malaysian Bar Council urged a \"review\" of the FTA negotiations with the United States to protest what was seen as U.S. support for \"Israeli atrocities against Palestinians.\" Minister Muhyiddin announced the suspension of FTA negotiations until receiving guidance from Malaysia's Cabinet, possibly in response to events in Gaza. Prime Minister Badawi requested a formal briefing on the decision to suspend FTA talks. Minister Muhyiddin later indicated that the negotiations had been postponed at the request of the United States. Muhyiddin postponed FTA negotiations at the request of the United States until after the presidential inauguration. Key unresolved topics include IPR protection, market access for U.S. automobiles and agricultural goods, trade in services, and government procurement policies in Malaysia. Malaysian IPR regulations and enforcement are of interest to U.S. exporters, with recent tightening of laws but remaining issues. The Business Software Alliance estimated 59% software piracy in Malaysia in 2007, causing $311 million in losses. Malaysia is on the Special 301 Watch List since 2001 to monitor IPR improvements. USTR noted Malaysia's commitment to IPR enforcement but urged further improvements, including the creation of a specialized IPR court. Malaysia is concerned about U.S. preference for \"TRIPs plus\" provisions in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations. The United States prefers \"TRIPs plus\" provisions in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA, including tighter restrictions on compulsory licensing and data exclusivity. Malaysia is hesitant due to concerns about undermining its ability to use compulsory licensing for necessary drugs. Opposition in Malaysia focuses on potential cost increases for HIV/AIDS drugs and fears that stricter patent enforcement could limit access to new medications. Malaysia has utilized TRIPs' compulsory licensing provisions to provide affordable anti-retroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS patients. Malaysia's automobile industry, led by manufacturers like Proton and Perodua, has a strong presence in over 40 countries. The government has protected the industry with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, distinguishing between national and non-national cars. The Malaysian government protects the automobile industry with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, favoring national car manufacturers like Proton and Perodua. However, some protections are being dismantled to comply with WTO and ASEAN agreements. Excise taxes on vehicles remain high, with tariffs imposed on assembled vehicles and vehicle kits from outside the ASEAN region. During negotiations, Malaysia is likely to raise the issue of U.S. measures protecting its domestic automobile industry. The U.S. currently maintains a special 25% tariff on imports of pickup trucks. The U.S. Automotive Trade Policy Council supports the proposed FTA as an opportunity to break into a market that historically protected domestic producers. Malaysia has stated that rice is considered a \"strategic crop\" and would not be included in the FTA, and tariffs on other agricultural goods would not be lowered to protect its farmers, planters, and fishermen. Malaysia is steadfast in designating rice as a strategic crop and will not include it in any FTA with the United States to protect its farmers, planters, and fishermen. Concerns have been raised about U.S. SPS regulations as a non-tariff trade barrier. The U.S. is urging Malaysia to remove or reduce restrictions on agricultural goods trade, including SPS measures and financial services limitations. Malaysia maintains ownership limits on insurance companies and has made changes to financial services regulations in preparation for FTA negotiations. Foreign banks are now allowed more flexibility in obtaining credit and opening branches in the country. In Malaysia, ownership limits on insurance companies are maintained, and changes to financial services regulations have been made. Foreign banks have more flexibility in obtaining credit and opening branches. Concerns have been raised about foreign participation in the financial sector due to the recent US financial crisis. Restrictions on foreign ownership in telecommunications and professional services benefit government-controlled firms. Foreign lawyers and architects face limitations in practicing Malaysian law and operating in the country. In Malaysia, foreign architects and engineers may face licensing restrictions for specific projects. Foreign accounting firms must work through Malaysian affiliates. The country prefers a positive list approach for service sectors in trade agreements. Malaysia aims to increase bumiputera participation in the economy. Foreign companies often need local partners for bids, and the procurement contract awarding process is seen as non-transparent. In July 2006, Malaysian government procurement restrictions for bumiputera were a major issue in negotiations. Malaysian negotiators were not authorized to open the procurement market. Malaysian businesses sought access to U.S. government procurement. The U.S. offered limited access to bid on $250 billion in contracts. The Malaysia government procurement market has an estimated value of approximately $20 billion. The government procurement issue was not a major topic of negotiations during talks in 2008. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA is of interest to Congress due to its potential impact on trade flows affecting U.S. businesses and farmers. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has garnered support from key figures in the U.S., including Senator Max Baucus and Representatives Jim Kolbe and Dan Burton. The National Association of Manufacturers has been a strong advocate for the FTA, while objections have been raised by Malaysian and U.S. labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and academics. Malaysia's significance to the U.S. lies in its economy, trade relations, role in countering radical Islamic organizations, democratic secular Muslim state example, membership in ASEAN and APEC, shared interest in dealing with China, and common goal of security. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was part of the Bush Administration's strategy to promote free trade and economic growth. The proposed FTA aimed to achieve the goals of APEC's \"Bogor Vision\" for free and open trade in the Pacific. With the Doha Round of trade talks facing challenges, FTAs were seen as a viable alternative. The USTR outlined four major goals for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations. The USTR outlined four major goals for a U.S.-Malaysia FTA, including creating new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, strengthening competitiveness, advancing strategic goals, and enhancing economic partnerships. Other benefits mentioned were cementing a vibrant economic relationship, increasing exports, diversifying exports, increasing investment, sharing knowledge, enhancing economic growth, and lowering costs. In Malaysia, the Ministry of International Trade is leading the negotiations with objectives to seek better market access for goods and services. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia aims to enhance market access, promote bilateral trade and investment, improve competitiveness, and build capacity through a proposed FTA. The FTA is seen as comprehensive, covering liberalization of goods and services, investment protection, and economic cooperation. Malaysian industries support the FTA for increased access to the U.S. market. Malaysia aims to benefit from greater access to the U.S. market through a proposed FTA, with industries such as clothing, ceramics, lumber, rubber, and electronics expected to gain. The FTA is also expected to increase inward foreign direct investment from the U.S. and other nations. Malaysia already has FTAs with several countries in Southeast Asia and is in negotiations with others, including Chile, for bilateral FTAs. The U.S. and Malaysia initiated negotiations for a bilateral FTA in June, aiming to strengthen relations and advance strategic interests in Asia. Malaysia's role as a moderate, democratic Muslim nation is significant in U.S. foreign policy, with hopes for the FTA to reinforce shared values. The Bush Administration hoped that the proposed FTA with Malaysia would strengthen shared interests, promote common values, and enhance cooperation in various areas including counterterrorism and defense. Opposition to the FTA has emerged from labor unions, environmental groups, and \"anti-globalization\" organizations in both countries. Labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and opposition political parties in Malaysia have also voiced concerns about the FTA. Labor organizations oppose FTAs without worker and environmental protections, citing concerns about previous agreements lacking enforceable rights. They advocate for adherence to ILO standards, dispute settlement mechanisms, and preventing partner countries from weakening labor laws post-approval. Obama showed some support for these concerns during his campaign. During his presidential campaign, Barack Obama expressed support for labor unions' concerns about labor provisions in FTAs with Colombia and South Korea. In Malaysia, only 9.5% of the labor force is represented by trade unions, with reports of delays in legal recognition. Immigrant workers, mainly from Indonesia, face abuse and exploitation. Opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been organized by Malaysians. Organized opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been led by Malaysians, with petitions from farmers and fishermen expressing concerns about the impact on rice farming and fishing industries. A coalition of opposition parties, workers, and small businesses in Malaysia called for a halt to negotiations until an economic and social impact study is conducted. Special interest groups, like Public Citizen, also oppose FTAs based on the NAFTA model. In Malaysia, concerns about the impact of a potential FTA on pharmaceutical drug costs, particularly for HIV/AIDS treatment, have arisen. Additionally, U.S. relations with Israel could complicate negotiations as Malaysia does not have diplomatic ties with Israel and requires export licenses for goods sent there. U.S. laws aimed at undermining boycotts and trade embargoes against Israel may further complicate the situation. Opposition to the FTA negotiations has also been fueled by U.S. support for Israel's military operations in Gaza. During recent congressional consideration of FTAs, opposition concerns have been addressed through legislation or commitments from the Administration. For example, in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Bush Administration promised actions to address labor, sugar, and textile interests' concerns. This included allocating $40 million for labor and environmental enforcement assistance in FY2006 and maintaining funding levels through FY2009. The Administration also assured that the DR-CAFTA would not impact the sugar program through FY2007. The text discusses the operation of the sugar program through FY2007 and promises made for the textile and apparel industry in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. Free trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to trade and investment by eliminating tariffs, import quotas, and non-tariff barriers. They also provide access to services, open markets for investment, strengthen protection of intellectual property, address government regulations, and include a dispute settlement process. FTAs aim to reduce barriers to trade and investment by eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Winners of FTAs are exporters, investors, and consumers, while losers are companies and workers in import-competing industries. The US has signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Malaysia, and has FTAs with Singapore, Australia, and is negotiating with South Korea. An FTA with Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on many U.S. exports, particularly in the information technology sector. However, more competitive U.S. exports like motor vehicles, polyethylene, and motorcycles face high duties in Malaysia. The potential impact of an FTA depends on the relative tariff rates of the two nations. The potential impact of an FTA with Malaysia depends on various factors, including the relative size of the two nations, bilateral trade flows, FDI, and existing trade relations. Malaysia has been one of the fastest-growing economies, with GDP and per capita income larger than many countries with FTAs with the U.S. In 2007, Malaysia's per capita income was $6,724, with a purchasing power parity of $13,570. The United States is Malaysia's largest trading partner and foreign investor. Malaysia was the tenth largest trading partner of the United States in 2007. U.S. investment in Malaysia totaled $1.8 billion in 2008, making it the second largest foreign investor after Australia. FTAs can divert trade towards involved countries and create more trade by lowering tariffs. FTAs can increase trade by reducing tariffs and trade barriers, leading to a substitution effect. U.S. exports to Malaysia remained stable around $10 billion annually from 2000 to 2005, then increased to over $12.5 billion in 2006 before dropping to $11.7 billion in 2007. U.S. imports from Malaysia grew until 2006 but declined in 2007. The U.S. trade deficit with Malaysia widened by 63.5% from 2001 to 2006 but narrowed by 10.7% in 2007. Malaysia's exports to the U.S. rose from just over $20 billion in 2000. According to Malaysia, exports to the United States increased from $20 billion in 2000 to $30 billion in 2006, then dropped to $27.5 billion in 2007. Imports from the United States rose from $13.6 billion in 2000 to $16.4 billion in 2006, decreasing by $500 million in 2007. Malaysia's trade surplus with the United States was $6.5 billion in 2000 and $11.6 billion in 2006. The U.S. is Malaysia's top export market, followed by Singapore, Japan, and China. Malaysia's exports to the U.S. declined from 19.7% to 15.6% in the last three years, while China's share increased from 6.6% to 8.8%. Malaysia's top source of imports is Japan, while the United States has dropped to fourth place since 2005. China and Singapore have surpassed the United States as suppliers of imported goods for Malaysia. Malaysia has FTAs with Japan and Singapore and is negotiating with Australia, India, New Zealand, and Pakistan. China has an FTA with ASEAN, which includes a trade in services agreement. The proposed FTA with the United States would put U.S. exporters on par with China, Japan, and Singapore. Malaysia is not a major services trading partner for the United States. Total services trade with Malaysia has been relatively low, amounting to less than $2 billion per year from 2000 to 2004, and just exceeding $2 billion in 2005. Despite its small role in overall services trade with the United States, certain sectors like telecommunications, financial services, and insurance are interested in better access to Malaysia's market. The U.S. is already Malaysia's top export market for goods, and a U.S.-Malaysia FTA could strengthen this relationship. The discussed FTA would provide better access for U.S. service providers to Malaysia's market. U.S. companies had invested over $15 billion in Malaysia by 2007, with a significant portion in manufacturing, particularly in computer and electronic equipment manufacturing. U.S. investments in chemical manufacturing operations in Malaysia have also been increasing. U.S. companies obtained approval for several manufacturing projects in Malaysia, with a focus on electronic equipment and chemical industries. The U.S. investment in Malaysia focused on electronic equipment and chemical industries. The U.S.-Malaysia FTA faced challenges due to the expiration of the President's Trade Promotion Authority. Various scenarios were considered for the proposed FTA with Malaysia to be reviewed by Congress. Congress may consider extending, renewing, or revising Trade Promotion Authority for the U.S.-Malaysia FTA. Alternatively, they could pass temporary or limited TPA for the agreement, as done with the Uruguay Round Agreements. Congress could also review the FTA without TPA, similar to the U.S.-Jordan FTA, allowing for potential amendments to the trade agreement. Legislative policy options include consultations with the Executive Branch, oversight hearings on U.S. trade policy with Malaysia, and working with interest groups. The U.S. trade policy and relations with Malaysia and other nations are being discussed, along with consultations with interest groups supporting or opposing the proposed agreement. P.L. 107-210 allows for consultations with the Executive Branch during and after negotiations, potentially leading to changes in the agreement before signing. The comparison of U.S. and Malaysian tariff rates is complex due to the thousands of products with varying rates. Average MFN tariff rates apply to most countries and members of the World Trade Organization. The average MFN tariff rates for most countries and WTO members apply, including the U.S. and Malaysia. Malaysia's average tariff rate is higher than the U.S., with peaks in certain product categories. Both countries protect their agricultural sectors, with Malaysia maintaining high rates on items of interest to U.S. agriculture. The Malaysian tariff rates for grains, rice, oranges, apples, wheat flour, prepared food, beef, pork, ham, yogurt, chocolate products, and baby food range from 5% to 168%. In contrast, the United States imposes a 350% tariff on tobacco products exceeding the import quota, with a 12.1% tariff within the quota. Malaysia's average MFN tariff rate is 8.7%, higher than the U.S.'s 4.0%, particularly in sectors supported for industry growth like transport equipment at 25.6%. The average Malaysia tariff rates for transport equipment, non-electrical machinery, and electrical machinery are significantly higher than the U.S. rates. Average applied tariff rates are indicators of a nation's actual level of tariff protection, which can be influenced by special trade arrangements with other nations. In 2006, Malaysia had an average applied tariff rate of 8.4%, more than twice the U.S. rate of 3.7%. The applied tariff rate for industrial goods in Malaysia is 9.1%, compared to 3.7% in the United States."
