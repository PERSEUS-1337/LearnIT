The rates of tax applicable are based on specific fuel types and vehicles. If the reduction in taxes would exceed the Federal on-budget surplus, the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, will protect the Social Security Trust Fund. The Secretary will adjust tax reductions if they exceed the Federal surplus, ensuring a pro rata reduction for each tax rate. Trust fund deposits for Highway and Airport funds will be maintained by treating the revenue reduction as taxes received. The applicable period for these changes is from April 15, 2000, to before January 1, 2001. During the applicable period from April 15, 2000, to before January 1, 2001, there will be a temporary reduction in the tax on aviation fuel as specified in the Internal Revenue Code.

Claims must be filed within 6 months of the tax reduction date. On the tax reduction date, if liquid is held by a dealer, the dealer must request a refund or credit from the taxpayer within 3 months. No credit or refund is allowed for liquid in retail stocks. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided in this section. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in section 6412 of the Code, with \"dealer\" including a producer. The \"tax reduction date\" is April 16, 2000. Rules similar to section 6412 of the Code apply for this section. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCKS TAX.

The definition follows guidelines outlined in section 1563 of the tax code, with a substitution of \"more than 50 percent\" for \"at least 80 percent.\" The principles of subparagraph (A) apply to a group of persons under common control, even if not all are corporations. Other laws, including penalties, applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 or 4091, also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a). SEC. 4. Benefits of tax reduction should be passed on to consumers. The sense of Congress is that consumers should immediately benefit from tax reductions, and transportation fuel producers should lower prices accordingly. A study will be conducted to ensure the tax reduction is passed on to consumers. The Comptroller General of the United States will report the results of a study on tax reduction to the Senate and House committees by September 30, 2000."
