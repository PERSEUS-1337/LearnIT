    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Presidential Credit Availability and Economic Recovery Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that adequate credit is essential for economic revitalization and growth. Financial institutions are burdened by unnecessary regulations, costing billions and limiting credit availability for small businesses, contributing to high unemployment rates. The President should have the authority to provide financial institutions relief from regulatory burdens to offer immediate credit relief to all sectors of the economy, especially small businesses, to sustain economic growth and reduce unemployment rates. The Act aims to authorize the President to increase credit availability, enhance economic recovery, and promote sustained noninflationary economic growth by suspending laws that burden insured depository institutions. The term \"insured depository institution\" is defined in the Act. Presidential responsibility and authority are outlined in the legislation. The President is required to review all statutory and regulatory provisions affecting insured depository institutions within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The review includes analyzing the purposes, effectiveness, costs, and relationship of these provisions. The President has the authority to suspend the applicability of any Federal law affecting insured depository institutions through an executive order. The President can suspend Federal laws or regulations affecting insured depository institutions if determined unnecessary or less effective than other alternatives. The President can suspend Federal laws or regulations affecting institutions, customers, or the economy if the cost of compliance outweighs the benefits, or if it negatively impacts credit availability in the United States. A Presidential order issued under this section must be published in the Federal Register and becomes effective 30 days after publication, unless a shorter period is deemed necessary for the public interest. Prior to suspending a law, regulation, or guideline, the President must consult with key financial officials. The President is also required to notify specific Senate and House committees before issuing any orders. SEC. 7 of the Act prohibits the President from suspending laws related to the safe operation of depository institutions, anti-discrimination in financial services, monetary policy, or enforcement actions. SEC. 8 states the Act is effective upon enactment, while SEC. 9 specifies the President's authority to suspend laws under the Act ends on January 1, 1997."
