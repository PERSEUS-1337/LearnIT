    "content": "In this paper, a Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) is proposed to enhance sequence-to-sequence models for conversational modeling. The LTCM incorporates a neural topic component to generate more diverse and interesting responses by leveraging learned latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTCM compared to baseline models in human evaluations. The Sequence-to-Sequence model (seq2seq) BID35 is widely used in natural language processing tasks like machine translation and summarization. Neural conversational models BID32 BID30 employ seq2seq-based models for open-domain conversational modeling. However, these models struggle with generating rational responses due to the lack of explicit knowledge representations. Goal-oriented dialogues BID45 use dialogue ontology to facilitate rational conversations. The use of dialogue ontology in neural network-based task-oriented dialogue systems helps constrain conversation scope and guide system responses by retrieving knowledge from a pre-defined database. Despite challenges in building a general-purpose knowledge base, progress has been made in conditioning seq2seq models on coarse-grained knowledge representations for rational responses. In this work, a hybrid conversational model called Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) is proposed to learn latent representations and their use in conversations. LTCM combines a seq2seq model with a neural topic model to capture local dynamics and global semantics. Recent advancements in neural variational inference have led to the application of latent variable models in conversational modeling. The Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) combines a seq2seq model with a neural topic model to capture local dynamics and global semantics. LTCM passes the latent variable to the output layer of the decoder and only back-propagates the gradient of the topic words to the latent variable, resulting in more diverse and interesting responses. The LTCM model can generate diverse responses by sampling from learnt topic representations. Experiments were conducted to understand seq2seq-based latent variable models better, providing insights for future model development. The model combines a seq2seq conversational model with neural topic models to enhance response generation. The seq2seq model decoder is an RNN language model that maximizes conditional probability. It uses hidden states and updates to generate responses, but faces challenges during optimization, even with LSTM or GRU cells. The seq2seq model decoder, utilizing LSTM or GRU cells, struggles with optimization due to difficulties in memorizing long-term dependencies. This leads to a focus on language modeling and suboptimal results. A latent variable conversational model incorporates a stochastic latent variable at the sentence-level to introduce diversity. The model's objective function involves variational inference to optimize the variational lower bound. The inference network q(\u03bd|u, m) is used to approximate the true posterior during training in latent variable conversational models. KL loss annealing is a key optimization trick, gradually increasing the KL term to encourage encoding information in \u03bd efficiently. Probabilistic topic models capture global semantics in document sets. Topic models like neural topic models are used to capture global semantics in document sets. They group words into topics based on word co-occurrence, with each topic representing a word cluster. One example is the Gaussian-softmax neural topic model, which integrates into seq2seq models. The model generates topics using word distributions and Gaussian parameters. The likelihood of a document is calculated based on these topics. The Gaussian-softmax model constructs \u03b8 from a Gaussian draw and initializes \u03b2 as a network parameter. It makes the bag-of-words assumption, sacrificing local transitions for global semantics. The Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) combines seq2seq and topic modeling for improved response coherence. The Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) combines seq2seq and neural topic model for better response coherence. It uses a sentence-level latent vector \u03bd for input-output semantics mapping, with a parametric isotropic Gaussian for word generation. The LTCM model combines seq2seq and neural topic module, introducing a random variable l t to decide the topic contribution to the output. The hard decision of l t sets two gradient routes for the model during training. The LTCM model combines seq2seq and neural topic module, introducing a random variable l t to decide the topic contribution to the output. Gradients are back-propagated to the entire network or only flow through the seq2seq model. Preventing the topic model from learning stop-words aids in extracting global semantics. The logits of seq2seq and neural topic model are combined additively for easier training. The parameters of LTCM are denoted as DISPLAYFORM3 and L is the vocabulary size. During training, observed variables are input u, output m, and topic word indicators l 1:M. Inference uses variational inference to approximate the log-likelihood objective. The variational lowerbound of Equation 7 is derived using BID13 to approximate the log-likelihood objective. The neural variational inference framework BID27 BID23 and Gaussian reparameterisation trick BID15 BID29 are used to construct q(\u03b8|u, m). The inference network q(\u03b8|u, m) approximates the true posterior during training by producing samples to compute stochastic gradients. The LTCM performance was evaluated using a subset of Reddit 2 data, consisting of 1.7 billion messages. A random subset of 15 million single-turn conversations was selected for the experiment, with a preprocessing step setting a 50-word limit for source and target sequences. Non-Roman alphabet sentences were removed, filtering out 40% to 50% of examples. The LTCM model was implemented on the NMT 3 code base BID21, with three model types compared: vanilla seq2seq (S2S) and Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM). A 4-layer LSTM with 500 hidden units was used for both encoder and decoder, with a GNMT style encoder and residual connections for optimization. Layer Normalization was applied to LSTM cells, with a batch size of 128 and a dropout rate. The LTCM model used a 4-layer LSTM with 500 hidden units for encoder and decoder, with batch size of 128 and dropout rate of 0.2. Adam optimizer was used with a fixed annealing schedule. KL annealing strategy was explored for the latent variable conversational model. Regularizations were applied to the \u03b2 matrix. Evaluation metrics included perplexity, variational lowerbound, KL loss, sentence uniqueness, and Zipf coefficient of generated responses. The sentence uniqueness and Zipf coefficient of generated responses were evaluated for latent variable conversational models. Approximated perplexity was reported due to the difficulty in assessing exact perplexity. Different decoding strategies were used, with the seq2seq model exploring both greedy and random sampling. Each model generated five responses per prompt, resulting in 50K responses for testing. Sentence uniqueness and Zipf coefficient were used as proxies to assess diversity. The corpus-based evaluation in Table 1 compared the performance of baseline seq2seq models using greedy decoding and random sampling. S2S-sample showed higher response diversity but lower quality. The sentence uniqueness score of S2S-greedy was unexpectedly low. Pairwise preference assessment in Table 3 indicated generic response issues. Latent variable conversational models did not show significant improvements in response diversity. The latent variable conversational models, including LV-S2S and LV-S2S with KL annealing, did not outperform the seq2seq model in terms of response diversity. However, the KL annealed model showed potential for higher uniqueness scores. On the other hand, LTCM models sacrificed lowerbound performance for increased response diversity. The LTCM models sacrificed lowerbound performance for increased response diversity, indicating that encoding discourse-level diversity into the latent variable may not be a bad idea. The latent variable of LTCM can encode more useful information, leading to more relevant responses tailored to the user prompt. LTCM generates more diverse responses compared to baselines by encoding more information into the latent space, despite slightly higher lowerbound and KL loss. Further discussions on evaluating conversational agents follow in the next section. To evaluate conversational agents like BID39, human evaluation is necessary. Judges were recruited on AMT to rate responses generated by paired models. Each judge rated five responses based on interestingness and appropriateness. Quality assessment results are shown in TAB2, with averages calculated for generated responses and maximum scores across prompts. The judges on AMT rated responses from paired models based on interestingness and appropriateness. The average of maximum scores across prompts was calculated for quality assessment. Judges also stated a preference between the two systems at the end of the task. The judges on AMT rated responses from paired models based on interestingness and appropriateness. The average of maximum scores across prompts was calculated for quality assessment. Table 4 shows comparisons of different models, with LTCM performing the best in terms of interestingness and appropriateness. This variance in response quality could be beneficial if reinforcement learning is introduced to fine-tune the latent variable BID40. The Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) outperformed other models in a pairwise preference test for generating diverse and interesting responses. The learned gate in LTCM aligns with human intuition and enhances response generation. The model shows promise for general-purpose conversational modeling. The Latent Topic Conversational Model (LTCM) combines seq2seq and neural topic model to generate diverse responses. Both corpus-based evaluation and human assessment confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Future work includes studying the learned representations to control the meaning of responses.
