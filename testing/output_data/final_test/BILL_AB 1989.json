    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the interconnectedness of water and energy resources, known as the water-energy nexus. Energy used in California's water system accounts for a significant portion of electricity and natural gas consumption, with potential for emission reductions. Saving water also saves energy, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts. New projects in California's water supply systems aim to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions by maximizing energy efficiency. The Legislature appropriates funds to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state, with a focus on the water-energy nexus. Beginning in the 2015\u201316 fiscal year, 35 percent of annual proceeds are continuously appropriated for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs. This includes allocations to the Transportation Agency for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program and the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program. Twenty percent of the annual proceeds of the fund is appropriated to the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program. No less than 10 percent of this amount is to be spent on affordable housing. Additionally, 25 percent of the annual proceeds are appropriated to the High-Speed Rail Authority for project acquisition, construction, environmental review, and design costs. In the 2017-18 fiscal year, $200 million annually is appropriated from the fund to the State Water Resources Control Board for a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This excludes funds subject to Section 39719.1. The State Water Resources Control Board will develop a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Eligible project categories include water recycling, stormwater capture, groundwater cleanup, desalination, water conservation, irrigation technologies, clean energy generation, energy-efficient water pumps, and leak detection in pipelines. The program aims to fund projects that reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions, such as leak detection in pipelines and water appliance efficiency. Projects must align with state policy to reduce reliance on the Delta for water supply. Public funds for private water companies must benefit ratepayers and be overseen by the Public Utilities Commission. The board may adopt guidelines to implement the program, which are not subject to rulemaking requirements."
