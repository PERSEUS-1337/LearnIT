    "content": "The \"Vision Care for Kids Act of 2009\" is a new law that provides grants for vision care for children under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may award grants to States for providing comprehensive eye examinations and treatment to eligible children under the age of 9 years. The Secretary may award grants to States for providing educational materials on recognizing signs of visual impairment in children to parents, teachers, and health care practitioners. Eligible children are low-income children who are not eligible for medical assistance under the State plan or child health assistance under the State child health plan. The text discusses eligibility criteria for low-income children to receive health benefits under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. Children must not have health insurance coverage, be part of a group health plan, or receive assistance from any State or Federal health benefits program. The text outlines exceptions for children eligible for child health assistance under the State child health plan under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. It states that certain paragraphs shall not apply if the plan does not cover specific examinations, treatments, or services. The Secretary will develop criteria for the grant program and data collection related to vision assessment. States must submit an application detailing existing children's vision programs and how grant funds will be used to complement state efforts. The funds will be used to complement existing State efforts, including partnerships with non-profit entities. The plan includes identifying eligible children, ensuring funds are used appropriately, providing examinations, treatments, and services, and giving priority to children with the lowest income. States must agree to evaluations within 1 year of receiving the grant and annually thereafter. The State must submit evaluations of vision services utilization and children's status under the grant, including data collection and reporting as per guidelines. At least 80% of the grant amounts must be spent on specified purposes. The State must allocate grant amounts for specific purposes, with restrictions on expenditure percentages for different purposes. Matching funds from non-Federal sources are required for at least 25% of the costs of activities under the grant. Non-Federal contributions can be in cash, kind, or services, but not from the Federal Government. Grants must supplement, not supplant, other funds. Definitions include a child as under 18 or 19 and still in school. The section discusses the eligibility criteria for a comprehensive eye examination for individuals under 19 years old who are full-time students. It also authorizes appropriations for funding the program for fiscal years 2010 to 2014. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 31, 2009."
