    "content": "The \"Support Renewable Energy Act of 2010\" requires the use of renewable energy to comply with federal renewable electricity standards. Section 610 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, amended by the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, defines 'light-pipe technology' as equipment using a reflective pipe to transport solar radiation for interior illumination without generating heat gain. The term 'renewable energy' means electric energy that does not generate net interior heat gain and integrates automatic lighting controls to adjust building lighting requirements. The term 'renewable energy' includes energy produced through customer-sited renewable energy equipment such as solar water heating, solar space heating, biogas, geothermal heat pumps, and other innovative renewable energy sources. The term 'solar daylight' refers to a system that uses prismatic lenses, glazing, reflectors, or concentrators to convey natural light into a building without generating net interior heat gain. The legislation includes provisions for issuing renewable energy credits equal to 100% of displaced electricity by qualifying renewable energy equipment and allocating these credits to the utility, project owner, and end user who paid for the equipment. The legislation provides for renewable energy credits for qualifying equipment purchases, installations, and maintenance, allocating credits to utility, project owner, and end user."
