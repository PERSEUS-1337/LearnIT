    "content": "The \"Student Success Act of 2001\" authorizes individuals to enter into contracts for funding postsecondary education by paying a percentage of future earned income. These human capital investment contracts are valid and enforceable, preempting any state laws restricting assignments of future wages. Terms and conditions of these contracts are outlined in section 102. The \"Student Success Act of 2001\" allows for human capital investment contracts where eligible students sell percentages of future income to fund education expenses and income taxes. The contracts must specify the percentages of future earned income and comply with certain conditions outlined in the legislation. The investment contract for eligible students must specify the percentages of future earned income to be paid, with maximum amounts for each year and potential adjustments based on income levels. No student can enter into a human capital investment contract if it exceeds the aggregate limitation on obligation. The human capital investment contract sets a limit on the total percentage of a student's future earned income that can be paid under all contracts, not exceeding 20%. The contract specifies the maximum period for payment, not exceeding 180 months, with possible extensions for deferrals. The human capital investment contract allows for a deferral of payments under certain conditions, such as under-employment or unemployment. Repayment does not begin until the student stops attending an eligible institution or no longer meets deferral requirements. The human capital investment contract allows for deferral of payments during periods of unemployment or underemployment. Repayment starts when the student stops attending an eligible institution or no longer meets deferral requirements. A human capital investment contract allows for deferral of payments during periods of unemployment or underemployment, with a maximum deferral period of 48 months. The contract also specifies terms for early repayment based on the remaining term of the payment period. Additionally, before entering into the agreement, the student must be provided with a disclosure document stating that the agreement is not a debt instrument. The human capital investment contract allows for payment deferral during unemployment or underemployment for up to 48 months. The agreement states that the student's payment amount may vary based on future income and cannot be discharged through bankruptcy.
