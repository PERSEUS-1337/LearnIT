    "content": "The Act titled \"Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Restoration Act of 2006\" defines key terms like Tribe, Member, and Secretary. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, a political successor to the Pembina Treaty of 1863, continues to reside in Montana, having ceded their lands in North Dakota over a century ago. The Little Shell Tribe petitioned the Federal Government for reorganization in the 1930s and 1940s under the Indian Reorganization Act, but lacked financial resources to purchase land due to the Depression. The Little Shell Tribe, despite the Federal Government's lack of funding for land acquisition, maintained its separate community with political leaders. Alongside other tribes, they filed suits for additional compensation for lands ceded to the United States, receiving awards under Acts of Congress in 1971 and 1982. The Little Shell Tribe petitioned for recognition in 1978 through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but their petition is still pending. The Tribe has had continuous dealings with the United States Government, the State of Montana, and other federally recognized Indian Tribes of Montana since the 1930s. Federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana is extended, allowing them to access federal laws and regulations applicable to Indian tribes. The Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana and its members are eligible for federal services and benefits provided to recognized Indian tribes, regardless of reservation status or residence location. The service area for federal services to Tribe members includes Blaine, Cascade, Glacier, and Hill Counties in Montana. Additionally, the Act reaffirms the rights of the Tribe. SEC. 6. REAFFIRMATION OF RIGHTS. This Act does not diminish any existing rights or privileges of the Tribe or its members. It does not affect any legal claims the Tribe may have to enforce rights wrongfully denied prior to the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. MEMBERSHIP. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 18 months, following the Tribe's Constitution guidelines. The Secretary will acquire 200 acres of land for the Tribe's benefit, with the option to acquire more land under the Indian Reorganization Act."
