    "content": "The increase in slamming, unauthorized change of a consumer's telephone service provider, has led to regulatory and legislative efforts to protect consumers. The 105th Congress held hearings and introduced bills, but no legislation was passed. The 106th Congress introduced measures to strengthen slamming regulations, but they were not enacted. Subsequent Congresses did not introduce legislation on slamming, leaving federal enforcement to the FCC, which continues to take actions to deter slamming. The latest rules went into effect on November 28, 2000. The FCC implemented new rules on November 28, 2000, allowing states to handle slamming complaints. Additional regulations on PIC change charges and third-party verification services were also introduced. The impact of these rules is being closely monitored by various stakeholders. Consumers now have a choice of around 500 long-distance carriers, but some still face challenges in making their selection. Unauthorized switching, known as \"slamming,\" can occur due to various reasons, leading to consumers losing their choice of telecommunications provider. This results in lower quality of service, higher rates, and loss of special features. Consumers may not realize they have been slammed until they see unfamiliar charges on their bills, which can go undetected for months. This practice negatively impacts both consumers and telecommunications suppliers. Slamming, the unauthorized switching of telecommunications providers, distorts the marketplace by increasing the customer base of the carrier that has illegally switched the consumer. Despite regulations in place, slamming continues to be a major consumer concern, with thousands of complaints filed annually. The FCC's slamming team resolved numerous complaints in 2004, resulting in consumer refunds totaling $800,000. The potential for slamming to increase as competition in telecommunications services grows has led to a significant level of consumer complaints. Efforts to prevent slamming include revising FCC rules and increasing penalties for violators, although legislation addressing the issue has not been passed. The FCC has rules to protect consumers from unauthorized switching of long distance carriers, enforced through investigations of complaints. Industry is self-regulating to stop slamming, with state bodies and law enforcement also taking action. Legislation on slamming has not been introduced in recent Congresses. FCC rules require long distance companies to obtain subscriber authorization before switching, with protections against exorbitant rates. Unauthorized changes absolve subscribers from payment for up to 30 days, with refunds set at 150 percent split between the carrier and subscriber. Violations result in fines and penalties, with FCC imposing forfeitures and consent decrees on companies from 1994 to 1999. Proposed notices of liability were also issued against companies. The FCC has taken enforcement actions against violators, issuing $7.6 million in proposed notices of liability against 5 companies. In the past decade, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau has imposed nearly $30 million in slamming enforcement actions. Various fines and penalties have been levied against companies for slamming violations, including a $1.2 million fine in a joint federal/state effort and the revocation of operating authority for a telecommunications provider in 1998. The FCC imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the Fletcher Companies for slamming and other violations of the Communications Act and FCC rules. The companies are now barred from providing interstate telecommunications services without FCC consent. Despite receiving over 1,400 complaints, the FCC was unable to collect the $5.7 million in forfeitures. The action was taken to prevent the companies from resuming operations and engaging in harmful conduct towards consumers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the FCC's authority to address unauthorized switches, with more stringent rules to combat slamming. It prohibits carriers from illegally changing a subscriber's designated carrier, with new penalties in place. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave the FCC more power to prevent unauthorized switches in telecommunications services, including local and long-distance calls. It introduced stricter rules to combat slamming, with penalties for carriers who illegally change a subscriber's designated carrier. State utility commissions can also enforce these rules within their state boundaries. Violators must pay back all charges collected from subscribers since the unauthorized switch occurred to prevent financial gain from illegal activities. The FCC adopted new regulations in December 1998 to comply with the Act. The FCC adopted new regulations in compliance with the 1996 Act, with the liability provisions being stayed by the D.C. Court of Appeals. Revised slamming liability rules were issued by the FCC on May 3, 2000, meeting court approval and lifting the stay on June 27, 2000. These rules focus on consumer liability, verification methods, and consumer assistance, absolving slammed consumers of liability for charges incurred for the first 30-day period after an unauthorized switch. Unauthorized carriers must refund 150% of charges to the authorized carrier if payment was made by the consumer. The authorized carrier can keep 100% of the consumer's bill, with the remaining 50% returned to the consumer. The FCC has given primary enforcement responsibility to states for slamming issues, with the FCC stepping in if needed. 37 states, DC, and Puerto Rico have taken on this role. Verification procedures for carrier switches have been strengthened, including methods like consumer signatures, electronic authorizations, third-party verifications, and Internet-based LOAs. These methods apply to both inbound calls. The FCC has implemented verification procedures for carrier switches, including methods like consumer signatures, electronic authorizations, third-party verifications, and Internet-based LOAs. These procedures apply to both inbound calls and telemarketing calls initiated by carriers, with rules also applied to changes in local and long-distance carriers. Wireless carriers are exempt from these rules. The FCC has also applied verification procedures to carrier freeze requests, requiring clear solicitations and informing consumers on how to lift freezes. These procedures do not preempt state law and are considered a state minimum, with the possibility of additional verification procedures for intrastate carrier changes. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that the FCC exceeded its authority in enforcing slamming rules related to customer verification. The court vacated fines imposed on AT&T for slamming, stating that the FCC's requirement for \"actual authorization\" exceeded its statutory authority. The court emphasized that carriers only need verification, not actual authorization from the subscriber. The FCC issued new rules in 2003 to strengthen third-party verification procedures for carriers. Initiatives were established to make it easier for consumers to file complaints, including a website, toll-free number, and electronic interface with carriers. These changes aimed to improve industry response time and speed up the resolution of complaints. The FCC, in conjunction with CC docket 98-170, adopted rules to enhance consumer protection against inaccurate billing practices. These rules, effective April 2, 2001, include allowing Internet LOAs for carrier changes and requiring a three-way call verification method. The FCC, in conjunction with CC docket 98-170, adopted rules to enhance consumer protection against inaccurate billing practices, including new complaint reporting requirements for carriers and carrier registration requirements to prevent slamming. The Government Accountability Office conducted an investigation into slamming issues and regulatory efforts, including a case study of the Fletcher Companies. The Government Accountability Office conducted an investigation into slamming practices and regulation, finding that neither the FCC, states, nor the telecommunications industry effectively protect consumers from telephone slamming. Some states have taken action to prevent slamming, but others lack regulations. The industry's approach to combat slamming seems market-driven rather than consumer-oriented. The GAO report highlighted the vulnerability of consumers and the industry to large-scale fraud, particularly slamming by long-distance providers. The FCC's efforts to deter slamming were discussed in hearings, with some expressing concern over the findings. FCC Chairman Kennard defended the FCC's actions, stating that the tariff filing procedure criticized by the GAO was not intended as a deterrent to slamming. The GAO report confirmed slamming as a significant issue for consumers, leading the FCC to work on new rules to combat slamming and cramming. Senator Collins requested a study on state and federal actions against telephone service abuses, resulting in a report focusing on slamming and cramming. The report revealed a high number of complaints and the need for stronger regulations. The 105th Congress examined legislation to protect consumers against slamming, but no final measure was passed before adjournment. Similar legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress but was not enacted. No slamming measures were introduced in subsequent Congresses. The FCC's strengthened slamming rules and enforcement actions may not be enough to deter slamming, leading to potential congressional legislation. Two bills, S. 58 and S. 1084, were introduced in the 106th Congress regarding slamming. Senator Collins introduced S. 58 to address slamming and cramming issues, emphasizing the need for consumer protection. Senator McCain introduced the \"Telecommunications Competition and Consumer Protection Act of 1999\" (S. 1084) to address slamming issues by increasing consumer protections and enforcement at federal and state levels. The bill aimed to deter slamming through notification and verification requirements for switching long distance carriers. The \"Telecommunications Competition and Consumer Protection Act of 1999\" addressed slamming issues by increasing consumer protections and enforcement at federal and state levels. It authorized stiff penalties for slamming, extended FCC authority over violators, required local telephone companies to report slamming complaints, allowed consumers to get refunds, and protected consumer's rights to use the PIC freeze option. S. 1084 required the FCC, FTC, and telecom carriers to develop a code of practices to protect consumers from slamming. The code included provisions for verifying service changes, restricting negative marketing, notifying subscribers of changes, and prohibiting unfair practices. Carriers had to give victims of slamming credits and damages of $500. Compliance was voluntary, but non-compliant carriers would face FCC regulations. The FCC had to publish a report on slamming every six months. The bill required the FCC to compile and publish a report every six months listing slamming violations by carriers. Several bills were introduced in the 105th Congress to address slamming issues, but no legislation was passed. The \"Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998\" (S. 1618) passed the Senate with an amendment, but H.R. 3888 did not reach the Senate floor for consideration before the Congress adjourned. The Senate passed the \"Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998\" (S. 1618) with a 99-0 vote on May 12, 1998. The bill aimed to prevent slamming by requiring explicit permission before changing a subscriber's long distance provider and establishing a process to resolve slamming complaints. It also increased penalties for slamming violations. The \"Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998\" (S. 1618) aimed to prevent slamming by requiring explicit permission before changing a subscriber's long distance provider. It also strengthened the complaint procedure and banned negative option marketing. Companies charged with slamming had to resolve complaints within 120 days or face penalties. The \"Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998\" (S. 1618) established a complaint process at the FCC with minimum penalties for offenders. The FCC had to resolve slamming complaints within 150 days and could award compensatory and punitive damages within 90 days. Fines of $40,000 for first-time offenders and $150,000 for subsequent offenses were set, with the FCC authorized to prosecute those who refused to pay. Individual subscribers could recover up to $500 from slammers and choose not to pay the slamming carrier. The \"Consumer Anti-Slamming Act of 1998\" (S. 1618) imposed penalties on intentional slamming offenders, including criminal penalties and a ban on offering telecommunications services. Switchless resellers had to post a bond with the FCC before offering long distance services. The bill allowed slamming victims to pursue complaints through state courts and required telecom companies to report slamming violations quarterly to the FCC. The FCC was required to report slamming violations quarterly to identify patterns of slamming. A report to Congress was due by October 31, 1998, listing the top ten carriers with the most complaints and fines imposed on violators. The FCC also had to issue a report on telemarketing practices for service changes and consider third-party verification for these changes. The \"Telecommunications Competition and Consumer Protection Act of 1998\" (H.R. 3888) passed the House with an alternative approach to combat slamming, establishing a voluntary code of conduct as an alternative to FCC regulation. Failure to comply would result in FCC regulation, with the FCC required to establish a voluntary code of \"Subscriber Protection Practices\" within 180 days. Minimum standards were outlined in the bill. The bill H.R. 3888 established a voluntary code of conduct for telecommunications carriers to address slamming, with minimum standards outlined. The FCC was required to review the code every two years to ensure consumer protection. Carriers had 10 days to comply with the code or face potentially more stringent FCC regulations. Specific requirements were detailed for carriers not operating under the voluntary code. The FCC was required to compile and publish a report ranking carriers by verified complaints, with penalties for worst performers. Carriers found slamming faced fines up to $1 million, with provisions for subscriber credits and state enforcement authority. The House-passed H.R. 3888 contained a different approach to combat slamming compared to the Senate counterpart, S. 1618. Negotiations between the House and Senate to reconcile differences continued, but H.R. 3888 was not brought to the Senate floor and slamming legislation was not enacted. The telecommunications industry acknowledged the slamming issue, but there was no agreement on how to address it. CompTel called for \"zero tolerance\" of intentional slamming and urged industry self-policing, including investigating allegations, repaying victims, and terminating employees involved. They also advocated for uniform slamming requirements to reduce consumer confusion and supported fines for proven cases of slamming. Some concerns have been raised over legislative proposals to address intentional slamming in the telecommunications industry. Controversial issues include the implementation of PIC freeze programs and the methodology used by the FCC to develop slamming statistics. While some prefer voluntary private-sector initiatives, others advocate for strict enforcement of current regulations and consumer education to combat slamming. Some support additional legislation to combat slamming complaints despite existing FCC regulations, citing the rise in complaints as proof. Supporters argue that the extent of the problem and potential for further abuse necessitate new laws. A critical GAO report on FCC efforts gave momentum to legislation in the 105th and 106th Congresses. Some argue for stronger legislation to combat slamming, citing the need for increased penalties and more robust measures to protect consumers and suppliers of telecommunications services. The U.S. Appeals Court stay of the FCC's slamming rules liability provisions in May 1999 further supports the call for new laws. However, there is not a unified approach on the specific regulations that should be included in the legislation. Some concerns have been raised about proposed consumer protections in telecommunications legislation, particularly regarding the burden on smaller carriers. Mandatory third party verification and requiring switchless resellers to post a \"surety bond\" have faced criticism. The Telecommunications Resellers Association argues that these provisions discriminate against small businesses and limit consumer choice. Other provisions in the legislation have also sparked concern. Some concerns have been raised about proposed consumer protections in telecommunications legislation, particularly regarding the burden on smaller carriers. Provisions for full reimbursement to consumers if they are slammed have raised worries about potential fraudulent claims. AT&T argues that fines to slammers could create the wrong incentive structure. There are also concerns about holding long distance carriers accountable for unwanted switches that may be the fault of local exchange carriers. The PIC freeze is a practice used to prevent slamming in the long distance market by freezing a customer's primary interexchange carrier. This prevents unauthorized changes without the customer's express approval. While effective, concerns have been raised about the potential for misuse and inhibiting competition. The FCC initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking in response to concerns about charges for changing PICs for end users, stating that significant industry changes have occurred since the establishment of the $5 PIC change charge safe harbor in 1984. This led to a further notice of proposed rulemaking in May 2004 to refresh policies and examine cost support information. The FCC adopted a new fee structure for interstate PIC changes on February 10, 2005. PIC change charges, typically covered by the customer or new interexchange carrier, will now be based on processing method with safe harbor rates of $1.25 for electronic changes and $5.50 for manual changes. Local exchange carriers can charge more with documentation or less than the safe harbor rate. Intrastate carrier change charges are under state jurisdiction, but if switching both intrastate and interstate providers simultaneously, the PIC charge for changing the interstate carrier is reduced. The FCC extended the effective date for revised PIC charge tariffs to January 1, 2006. Concerns were raised about the misuse of the PIC freeze option to protect local exchange carriers' market share. Some view the expanded use of the PIC freeze as unnecessary. Some argue for an independent third party to oversee carrier changes and freezes to prevent abuse of the PIC freeze, while local exchange carriers defend its use to combat slamming issues. The FCC encourages carriers to prevent slamming and notes variations in how the PIC freeze is implemented. The implementation of the PIC freeze program varies among carriers, with many carriers claiming that potential abuses like high charges or difficulty in switching do not apply to most programs. The FCC's methodology for determining slamming statistics has been criticized, particularly in how it compares slamming offenders based on complaints per million dollars of company revenue. The FCC's methodology for determining slamming statistics has been criticized for potentially understating the revenue-to-complaint ratio for smaller companies and resellers. Resellers are not required to report revenue unless it exceeds $109 million, leading to assumptions that may overstate revenue and favor larger carriers like LCI International Inc. LCI criticizes FCC's methodology for determining slamming statistics, stating that larger carriers benefit due to their higher revenue. LCI recommends calculating slamming rate ratio by dividing complaints by new customers. H.R. 2112 and H.R. 2120 aim to increase penalties for slamming incidents. H.R. 3050, H.R. 3749, and H.R. 3888 are measures introduced to prevent fraudulent practices in soliciting telephone service subscribers and improve consumer protection against slamming by telecommunications carriers. H.R. 4176 (Markey) and S. 1051 (Campbell) are bills introduced to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to protect consumers against fraudulent practices in telecommunications services.
