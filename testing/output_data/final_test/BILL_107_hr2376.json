A report will be submitted to Congress within 90 days after the project ends, containing findings and analysis of the project's ramifications. SEC. 3. The Secretary must report to Congress within 45 days of this Act on actions taken to provide disaster relief to Pacific Coast groundfish fishery communities. Recommendations for legislative changes may be included. The Secretary of Commerce will implement a fishing capacity reduction plan for the Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery, developed in consultation with affected parties. The plan aims to reduce fishing capacity through a reverse auction process, without expanding the fishery failure or impacting other fisheries or regions. The fishing capacity reduction plan for the Pacific Coast groundfish fisheries will be implemented by the Secretary of Commerce. The plan includes significant reductions in fishing capacity and must meet specific requirements outlined in the section. The Secretary will expedite the adoption of the plan by publishing notice, allowing for public comment, and adopting final regulations within specified timeframes. The fishing capacity reduction plan for Pacific Coast groundfish fisheries includes permanently revoking licenses, permits, and privileges for certain fisheries, and notifying the Secretary of Transportation to revoke fishery endorsements for surrendered permits. The fishing capacity reduction plan for Pacific Coast groundfish fisheries involves permanently revoking licenses, permits, and privileges for vessels, ensuring they cannot be transferred to a foreign flag. Vessels removed from the fisheries are made permanently ineligible to participate in any fishery worldwide, with owners agreeing to operate under the United States flag or be scrapped. Owners and permit holders must relinquish any claims associated with the vessels, permits, and catch history.

The Secretary is authorized to use funds for the fishery capacity reduction plan, with $25,000,000 from an industry fee system. The industry fee portion will be financed by a reduction loan. Additionally, the Secretary will establish an industry fee system under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

The Secretary of Transportation has duties related to the fishery capacity reduction plan. The Secretary of Transportation shall revoke fishery endorsements and refuse approvals for vessels identified by the Secretary, as part of the fishery capacity reduction plan. Regulations will be adopted after public comment. The Secretary of Transportation will adopt final regulations within 6 months to prohibit surrendered reduction permit vessels from fishing on the high seas or under foreign jurisdiction while flying the US flag. Regulatory flexibility exemptions apply to meet program deadlines. SEC. 5. COLLECTION OF INDUSTRY FEES. The Secretary will make agreements with California, Oregon, and Washington to collect program fees from vessel purchasers. The fees will be deducted by the first buyer and forwarded to the State, which will then send them to the Secretary. Fish-processing vessels that harvest and process fish are also considered purchasers. Fish-processing vessels that both harvest and process fish or receive fish from a harvesting vessel and process it on board are considered the first ex-vessel fish purchaser. They must forward the appropriate fees to the State at the same time and in the same manner as other fees or taxes. SEC. 6.
