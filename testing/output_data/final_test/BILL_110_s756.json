    "content": "Funding allocated for equipment reset and other equipment needs of the National Guard. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau highlighted equipment shortfalls for the Army and Air National Guard, with a significant percentage poorly equipped. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves noted the increased operational tempo but inadequate resourcing for the reserve components of the Armed Forces. The lack of sufficient and ready equipment is a problem for both the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces. The equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable, reducing the US capability to respond to major contingencies. Despite proposed budget increases for equipment in the National Guard, historical data shows unreliable funding allocation. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves reported significant reductions in procurement funding for the Army National Guard from 1999 to 2005. Planned expenditures for equipment were not reliably carried out, with budget discrepancies revealed in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The Army National Guard's procurement funding discrepancies were highlighted in fiscal years 2003 to 2005, with concerns raised about equipment shortages for disaster response. The Comptroller General found that before current overseas operations began, the majority of the combat forces of the Army National Guard were supplied with approximately 65 to 79 percent of their required equipment. As of November 2006, nondeployed Army National Guard forces nationwide still had approximately 64 percent of the total amount of authorized dual-use equipment, including authorized substitute items, based on their warfighting missions even as overseas and domestic missions have expanded. Authorization of Appropriations: There is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Defense for the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard for equipment reset. The Army National Guard and Air National Guard require funding for equipment reset and procurement to achieve full readiness. For fiscal year 2008, $2.1 billion is allocated for National Guard equipment procurement, $1.3 billion for Army National Guard operation and maintenance, and $4.36 billion for other equipment procurement and reset. For fiscal years 2009 through 2013, $4.36 billion is allocated for equipment reset, with $2.6 billion for the Army National Guard and $1.76 billion for the Air National Guard. Additionally, $280 million is designated for National Guard Personnel in the Air Force, $720 million for Operation and Maintenance in the Air National Guard, and $575 million for National Guard and Reserve Equipment procurement, primarily for the Army National Guard. For Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard receives $1.3 billion. Other equipment procurement and reset receive $4.36 billion, with $2.6 billion for the Army National Guard and $1.76 billion for the Air National Guard. National Guard Personnel in the Air Force get $280 million, and Operation and Maintenance for the Air National Guard is allocated $720 million. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress assessing the defense industrial base's capability to produce equipment to be procured using authorized amounts. If the assessment determines a lack of capability, recommendations must be included. The report to Congress will include recommendations for actions and investments needed to develop the capability to produce equipment if the defense industrial base lacks the necessary capability."
