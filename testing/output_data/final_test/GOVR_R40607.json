    "content": "This report examines the impact of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on access to medicines, particularly through patents. Patents grant exclusive rights to inventors for a period of 20 years, allowing them to recoup R&D costs and invest in future innovations. However, concerns exist that patents may lead to high drug prices that exceed production costs. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) set minimum standards for IPR protection and enforcement. Countries have strengthened IPR protection through various trade agreements. Congress shapes U.S. trade policy by passing laws authorizing trade programs and setting negotiating objectives. Within Congress, there is significant interest in promoting and protecting intellectual property rights (IPRs) through trade policy for economic, health, safety, and national security reasons. IPR-based industries are seen as crucial for U.S. innovation, productivity, economic growth, employment, and international trade. Counterfeiting and piracy are believed to cause billions of dollars in revenue and trade losses annually for U.S. IPR-based industries. Policymakers are also concerned about the health and safety risks posed by counterfeit goods, including pharmaceutical drugs, and the potential for trade in infringing products to support organized criminal networks. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) considers the protection and enforcement of international IPR standards to be a top priority. The USTR prioritizes international IPR standards in trade policy through various mechanisms like the Special 301 process and GSP. Patents can impact drug affordability, especially in low-income countries, affecting access to medicines. This raises concerns about the balance between innovation incentives and public health. The lack of access to essential medicines in poorer parts of Africa and Asia is a major global health issue, with infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases causing illness, death, and poverty. This highlights a conflict between free market policies and public health concerns, where the commercialization of healthcare may lead to some individuals being unable to afford necessary medications. Access to medicines for the world's poorest, afflicted with neglected tropical diseases, is crucial. The United Nations set Millennium Development Goals to end poverty by 2015, including universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment by 2010. Cooperation with pharmaceutical companies is key to providing affordable essential drugs in developing countries. Access to medicines has improved significantly in recent decades. Access to medicines has improved significantly in recent decades, with 42% of those in need of HIV/AIDS treatment having access in 2008 compared to 33% in 2007. There is ongoing debate about the balance between providing long-term incentives for innovation through patents and ensuring affordable access to medicines. Concerns about \"over-access\" leading to misuse and drug resistance are also raised. The debate over patents, trade policy, and access to medicines involves various stakeholders, including high-income countries, developing countries, generic drug manufacturers, and middle-income countries. Governments are grappling with balancing economic interests and public health outcomes through trade policy. This debate is part of a broader discussion on the relationship between international trade policy and global public health, with increasing overlap between the two. The global pharmaceutical industry, classified as a high-technology industry, heavily relies on intellectual property rights, specifically patents, to encourage research and innovation. Patents grant exclusive rights for new products and processes, driving R&D investment for innovative solutions to global health issues. A patent is a legal right granted for new inventions, allowing the holder to exclude others from using or selling the invention for 20 years. It does not automatically grant the right to sell the invention, as regulatory laws may need to be followed. Patents provide exclusive monopolies in the market, enabling inventors to recoup R&D costs and invest in future innovations, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. The cost of creating a new medicine is around $800 million, with patents seen as crucial for innovation in medicine by allowing right holders to recover R&D costs and invest in future research. Financial incentives for innovation are considered essential, especially during economic downturns, as tighter credit markets may lead to reduced R&D spending by pharmaceutical companies. Critics question the high estimates of R&D costs, suggesting that they include both actual expenditures and economic opportunity costs. Critics argue that a significant portion of profits from patented drugs goes towards marketing and lobbying instead of new innovations. Pharmaceutical companies often use publicly-funded research for commercial drug development. While patents incentivize innovation, some question their economic validity in markets with insufficient financial incentives. The WHO recognizes the importance of intellectual property rights (IPRs) as incentives for innovation in pharmaceuticals. However, it acknowledges that IPRs alone may not be sufficient for developing treatments for diseases with limited market potential. There are three main types of diseases classified by the WHO based on the level of market-based incentives they offer for research and development. Type I diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, provide strong financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies have strong financial incentives to invest in treatments for Type II diseases prevalent in developing countries. However, for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, limited demand from high-income countries means market-based incentives are not enough for R&D investment. Type III diseases, like dengue fever and African sleeping sickness, have virtually no developed country demand, leading to little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in R&D. Investment in R&D for diseases like neglected tropical diseases is low, with less than 10% of global health research funds directed towards major health problems affecting 90% of the world's population. Poverty-related conditions contribute to the prevalence of these diseases, such as unsafe water and poor sanitation. The pharmaceutical needs of developed and developing countries are increasingly similar, with diseases like Type I diseases now affecting developing countries as well. The WHO estimates that 80% of chronic disease burden is in low- and middle-income countries. Outbreaks of infectious diseases like H5N1 and H1N1, along with drug resistance, may drive R&D for diseases affecting all populations. Pharmaceutical patents, economic development, taxes, tariffs, and other factors influence drug pricing. Patents granting a monopoly can increase drug costs by delaying production. Pharmaceutical patents can raise drug costs by delaying generic competition, criticized for enabling high prices that exceed R&D costs. Generic drugs, copies of expired patents, lower global drug prices by demonstrating bioequivalence without repeating research. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984 in the US addresses this issue. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 in the United States allows the FDA to approve generic drugs based on bioequivalence data, reducing costs and speeding up market entry. Generics competition lowers drug prices, prompting innovator companies to lower prices or develop new drugs, benefiting public health. An increasing resistance to treatments against malaria, tuberculosis, and various bacteria has been observed in the past few decades, particularly affecting developing countries. Access to essential medicines is crucial for public health outcomes, as defined by the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. Governments facing resource constraints in healthcare provision may need to rationalize their public health policy choices. Governments should rationalize public health policy choices, including provision of essential medicines. Essential medicines satisfy priority health care needs, selected based on efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. They should be available in adequate amounts, with quality assurance, affordability, and flexibility in implementation. Pharmaceutical drug prices can be a barrier for low-income countries in accessing essential medicines. Pharmaceutical drug prices can be a significant barrier to accessing essential medicines, especially in developing countries. Some countries have publicly-funded pharmaceutical markets, reducing costs for consumers. However, higher-priced drugs may limit government funding for public health care. There is ongoing debate on how patent protection impacts access to essential medicines. The WHO maintains a Model Essential Medicines List (EML) to help governments select medicines for public health needs. Some argue that the EML may not be comprehensive and exclude essential medicines based on cost concerns. Patents can raise medicine costs, but the EML considers multiple criteria in decision-making. The number of essential medicines under patent is in constant flux. The global pharmaceutical market is heavily influenced by patents on essential medicines, which are constantly changing due to expirations, new patents, and updates to the WHO's Model Essential Medicines List. International trade in pharmaceutical products is dominated by developed countries, with the market expected to grow by 4-6% in 2010. The economic downturn may impact demand for pharmaceuticals, although the market is generally less price-sensitive compared to other commodities. The global pharmaceutical market, influenced by patents on essential medicines, is not immune to global economic factors. Emerging market economies are expected to drive growth in pharmaceutical sales. In 2007, total global production in the pharmaceutical industry was $319 billion, with the US and the EU contributing the most. The global pharmaceutical industry is dominated by a few multinational corporations based in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, and France. High-income countries are the main producers, but developing countries like China and India are increasing their share of production. Industry consolidation is increasing as generic companies enter the market. In 2007, India and China saw significant growth in their share of the global pharmaceutical market. The United States, Japan, and Europe remain the largest markets, while developing countries account for a smaller portion of sales. Emerging market economies are starting to shift the geographic balance in pharmaceutical sales. The global pharmaceutical market is shifting towards emerging market economies, with 17 countries identified as \"pharmerging\" markets expected to drive growth. Factors contributing to this shift include changes in the global economy, healthcare environment, and the growth of the generic drug market. China is projected to lead in sales growth, followed by Brazil, India, and Russia. The pharmaceutical industry in emerging markets is expected to generate significant sales growth over the next five years. The United States pharmaceutical market is also projected to rebound in 2010, with consumer spending forecasted to increase by 3.3%. Generic drugs will impact prices but increase availability and sales. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is predicted to grow by 7.2% in 2010, with total trade increasing as both exports and imports of pharmaceuticals rise. However, imports have grown faster than exports, leading to a trade deficit. This trend raises questions about the industry's competitiveness and the increasing role of other countries in the global pharmaceutical market. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is growing, with total trade increasing as both exports and imports of pharmaceuticals rise. However, imports have outpaced exports, leading to a trade deficit. Intellectual property rights have become a cornerstone of international trade agreements, with the TRIPS Agreement setting minimum standards. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property protection in international trade. Adherence to this agreement is required for WTO membership and can be enforced through the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding Mechanism. Efforts by the US, European countries, and the IPR business community in the late 1980s elevated IPR as a trade issue during the Uruguay Round of the GATT. The TRIPS Agreement established minimum standards for intellectual property protection in international trade, making it a key issue during the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Some argued that IPR protection should not be seen as a trade issue, especially concerning public health in developing countries. Developing countries regulated public health independently before the TRIPS Agreement, with little involvement of international IPR regimes. IPR protection and enforcement are crucial for economic growth by promoting trade, investment, and technology transfer. Developed countries argue that patent protection is essential for public health as it incentivizes R&D for pharmaceutical solutions. Critics of the TRIPS Agreement, including many developing countries, believe it primarily benefits developed countries and raises costs for IPR-sensitive goods. Developing countries prefer discussing IPR issues under WIPO. Developing countries prefer discussing IPR issues under WIPO, a UN agency that administers international IPR treaties. They acceded to the TRIPS Agreement after negotiating goals in the Uruguay Round. Critics argue that the TRIPS Agreement is biased towards IP right holders and that high-income countries had greater bargaining power. Stakeholders are critical of the agreement, stating it benefits developed countries economically. The Doha Declaration in the WTO trade negotiations addressed concerns of developing countries regarding the TRIPS Agreement's impact on public health. It confirmed that the agreement should not hinder measures to protect public health and committed member states to interpret it in a way that supports public health and access to medicines. Debate continues on provisions related to pharmaceuticals in the TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration. The TRIPS Agreement poses challenges for developing countries in terms of implementation, compulsory licensing, parallel importing, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Developing countries face the need for more resources, technical expertise, and legal changes to comply with the agreement compared to developed countries. The Doha Declaration allowed for delays in implementation for developing and least developed countries. The TRIPS Agreement exempts inventions that were already in existence. The TRIPS Agreement exempts pharmaceutical inventions that were in the public domain before its implementation. Concerns arise about the impact on generic medicines trade. While first-line HIV/AIDS treatments are available as generics, newer ARVs are patentable under TRIPS. Critics of the TRIPS Agreement raise concerns about its impact on countries with strong generic drug industries like India, which began offering patents for pharmaceutical products in 2005 to comply with the agreement. Questions arise about how this may affect India's future generic supplies of ARVs and treatments for other diseases. Public health advocates express concerns about the full implementation of patents under TRIPS. Some public health advocates are worried that full implementation of the TRIPS Agreement could impact countries' access to generic medicines. Brazil and Thailand rely on India's low-priced generics for HIV/AIDS treatments. Enforcement of IPR laws can be weak, and compulsory licenses may be issued to allow production of patented items by domestic parties. Compulsory licenses allow domestic parties to produce patented items without the patent holder's permission, authorized by Article 31 of TRIPS. Governments can issue compulsory licenses under specific conditions, such as during a national emergency or for public non-commercial use. The patent holder must be paid adequate remuneration in such cases. Compulsory licenses under TRIPS allow production without patent holder permission, with restrictions on domestic market sales. Advocates see them as vital for affordable medicine access, but critics fear long-term harm to access and innovation due to potential market repercussions. Some argue that compulsory licenses in developing country markets do not significantly impact pharmaceutical industry profits or research. The controversy surrounds defining a \"national emergency\" under the TRIPS Agreement, with the Doha Declaration allowing countries to grant compulsory licenses for crises like HIV/AIDS. Low-income countries have issued limited compulsory licenses for pharmaceutical drugs under patents. The \"underuse\" of Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement is attributed to fear of trade sanctions and corporate litigation. National governments and multinational companies support the Doha Declaration but oppose implementing compulsory licensing. Low-income countries may lack resources to issue compulsory licenses and fear negative impacts on their business environment. In contrast, middle-income countries like Brazil and Thailand use compulsory licenses to negotiate price reductions for pharmaceutical products. Compulsory license threats are seen as a viable option for countries with sufficient manufacturing capabilities. Compulsory licenses under Article 31(f) of the TRIPS Agreement are limited to countries with manufacturing capacity and a sizable market that can impact pharmaceutical companies' profits. The Doha Declaration recognized the challenges faced by WTO members without manufacturing capabilities in using compulsory licensing. The Declaration directed members to find a solution to address this issue. The WTO members agreed to waive the domestic market provision of the TRIPS article on compulsory licensing for exports of pharmaceutical products for \"HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other epidemics\" to LDCs and countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. This decision was incorporated as an amendment to the TRIPS agreement at the Hong Kong Ministerial in December 2005, pending ratification by two-thirds of the 153 WTO member states. 54 countries/regions are currently part of this agreement. The WTO members agreed to waive the domestic market provision of the TRIPS article on compulsory licensing for exports of pharmaceutical products for \"HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other epidemics\" to LDCs and countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. 17 countries (including Hong Kong, China, the 27 countries of the European Union, Mauritius, Egypt, Mexico, Jordan, Brazil, Morocco, Albania, Macau-China, Canada, Bahrain, Colombia, Zambia, Pakistan, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) have ratified the amendment. The deadline for ratification has been extended to December 31, 2011. The system allows for the issuance of compulsory licenses to produce and export drugs, subject to various restrictions. The TRIPS Agreement waiver allows for the export of pharmaceutical products for epidemics to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. Supporters argue it balances innovation and access to medicines. Concerns include financial incentives for drug development and illegitimate drug export. Developing countries may struggle with safeguard provisions and political instability. Some commentators criticize the country-by-country nature of notification requirements for parallel importing under compulsory licenses. Only Rwanda has used the WTO system to import HIV/AIDS medicines from Canada. The debate continues on whether middle-income countries like Brazil, Thailand, India, and China should take advantage of the TRIPS Agreement waiver. Supporters argue for acknowledging the unique needs of middle-income countries in international trade policies on innovation. Compulsory licensing in middle-income countries may be seen as an industrial policy tool to develop domestic pharmaceutical industries. Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals allows for cost-effective access to lower-priced medicines, but some argue it does not address underlying issues in national drug pricing strategies or manufacturing. Some pharmaceutical companies oppose parallel importation of drugs, claiming it hinders tiered-pricing and may lead to diversion of drugs to higher-income markets. Concerns also exist about the impact on drug supply in exporting countries. In the United States, there is ongoing debate on parallel importing, with innovator pharmaceutical industries typically opposing imports of generic medicines. The 111th Congress introduced bills to increase access to more affordable medicines. The 111th Congress introduced bills to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from foreign countries for personal use, but such provisions were not included in the final health care legislation. If passed, Canada could be a major source of parallel imports of prescription drugs, with some supporting the idea to access cheaper drugs. Differences in drug prices between Canada and the U.S. are influenced by factors like government price controls and negotiating ability. Despite the prohibition of \"grey market\" importation in the U.S., Americans can still access drugs through Internet pharmacies. Parallel importation of prescription drugs from foreign countries, particularly Canada, has raised concerns about drug pricing and safety. While some consumers see it as a way to lower drug costs, pharmaceutical companies worry about counterfeit drugs and shortages. The issue also raises questions about patent rights and intellectual property rights exhaustion. The TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration do not directly address these concerns. The Doha Declaration states that WTO members can choose their own IPR exhaustion regime. Concerns exist about the quality of pharmaceuticals in international trade, particularly regarding counterfeit drugs that deceive consumers. Counterfeit drugs can include mislabeled, incorrect ingredients, or incorrect quantities. Tracking counterfeiting is challenging due to its secretive nature. Data on counterfeiting comes from various sources, including national regulatory bodies. Data on counterfeiting is gathered from various sources, including national regulatory authorities, enforcement agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and non-government organizations across different regions. Different methods used by these groups to collect data can complicate efforts to compile and compare statistics. Some companies may be hesitant to disclose information on intellectual property rights infringement issues for fear of affecting product marketing. The WHO estimates that in many countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, 10% to 30% of medicines sold are counterfeit, while in developed countries with stronger regulatory systems, the prevalence of counterfeit drugs is much lower, constituting less than 1% by some estimates. Counterfeit medicines are a concern, especially when purchased from unauthorized online sites. Generic medicines, while legitimate, are sometimes questioned for their quality. Some countries detain shipments of generic medicines for inspection due to fears of counterfeiting. Increased seizures of intellectual property rights may help reduce counterfeit drugs. Increased IPR seizures can help limit counterfeit drugs, reducing health risks. However, confusion between counterfeit and legitimate generics may lead to seizures of legitimate generics and delays in medicine delivery. NGOs are concerned that industrialized countries use this strategy to discourage generic drug production. The U.S. government prioritizes stronger international IPR protection through trade policies, including multilateral negotiations, regional and bilateral FTAs, and unilateral tools. The USTR aims to promote strong IPR protection in regional and bilateral FTAs, secure market access for U.S. businesses, and respect the Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement. The U.S. has multiple FTAs in force and negotiates TRIPS-plus provisions, including data exclusivity and patent term extensions for pharmaceuticals. The USTR also seeks to limit compulsory licenses and parallel importing in some cases. The USTR promotes strong IPR protection in FTAs, including TRIPS-plus provisions for pharmaceuticals. Critics argue that these provisions limit developing countries' ability to issue compulsory licenses and engage in parallel importing, contradicting the Doha Declaration. Some argue that U.S. rigidity on IPRs may hinder trade negotiations with countries like Thailand, as concerns about public health and access to generic medicines arise. Critics question why countries would enter into FTAs with the United States due to stringent IPR standards. The U.S. trade policy regarding pharmaceutical IPRs has shifted somewhat in response to concerns about public health in developing countries. A bipartisan trade deal in 2007 between former President George W. Bush and congressional leaders made changes to the U.S. FTA template, making patent linkage and patent term extensions optional. This deal also included provisions to potentially shorten the period of data exclusivity for marketing approval. The Obama Administration is reviewing U.S. trade policy, including IPRs and pharmaceuticals. Domestic trade policy tools are available for U.S. efforts to advance international patent protection and enforcement, with the USTR \"Special 301\" Report being a prominent tool. This report identifies countries with inadequate IPR protection and enforcement regimes. The USTR's Special 301 report evaluates countries' IPR infringement levels, impact on the U.S. economy, enforcement of IPR laws, progress in improving protection, and commitment to trade agreements. Countries can be identified for insufficient IP protection even if complying with TRIPS. The USTR categorizes countries based on severity of violations, with \"Priority Foreign Countries\" facing potential trade sanctions. Countries identified for inadequate intellectual property protection may face trade sanctions, including suspension of trade concessions or import restrictions. \"Priority Watch List\" countries have concerning practices but do not meet all criteria for Priority Foreign Country status. \"Watch List\" countries have less severe inadequacies. \"Section 306\" countries are monitored for compliance with IP agreements. USTR's Special 301 list prompts countries to improve IPR practices, with out-of-cycle reviews conducted for further monitoring and potential status changes. The USTR uses various tools to protect intellectual property rights, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) which grants preferential duty-free entry to certain products from developing countries based on their IPR policies. Countries on the USTR Special 301 watch list may face withdrawal of GSP benefits. Trade preferences, not trade concessions, are withdrawn, so countries cannot claim a WTO violation. Russia, Lebanon, and Uzbekistan were being evaluated for IPR protection in 2008. The USTR believes in a strong international IPR regime to benefit the U.S. economically and support public health. Trade policy is not the primary tool for promoting public health, as per a recent GAO report. U.S. government efforts to increase access to medicines involve various policy areas, including foreign, health, and education. Initiatives are in place to enhance developing countries' access to medicines, with the U.S. Department of State balancing IP rights and access to medicines through public health initiatives. The United States advocates for greater availability of generic drugs through initiatives like PEPFAR, which supports access to low-cost antiretroviral drugs in developing countries. The FDA introduced an expedited approval process for these drugs. Congress may consider incorporating public health input into trade policy and addressing implications for U.S. access to medicines. The United States emphasizes access to generic drugs through initiatives like PEPFAR and an expedited FDA approval process. There are concerns about the balance between intellectual property protection and public health in U.S. trade policy, with advocates arguing for safeguarding public health as a legal and moral imperative. Access to medicines is seen as a fundamental human right by many human rights organizations. Some argue that protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in U.S. trade policy supports public health, while others criticize the USTR Advisory Committee structure for favoring private sector interests over public health concerns. This imbalance allows commercial interests to influence U.S. trade negotiating positions, impacting the WTO's agenda. According to a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, there were 16 Industry Trade Advisory Committees (ITACs) during the review period, two of which had a single public health representative each. The Intellectual Property Committee and the Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Health Science Products and Services Committee had 20 and 33 members, respectively. Defenders of the advisory system argue that public health representation is included in the most relevant ITACs. Lawmakers and USTR officials stated that having two public health representatives on one committee was unnecessary, as they couldn't find other viable candidates with different perspectives. Some lawmakers have urged the USTR to reform the trade advisory committee system by creating new committees addressing public health issues in developing countries. H.R. 2293 was introduced to ensure public health views are represented in U.S. trade policy through a Public Health Advisory Committee on Trade with members having expertise in trade and public health issues, excluding those with commercial interests in health services. The bill aims to increase public health representation on trade advisory committees by creating a Public Health Advisory Committee on Trade. It would require non-governmental public health officials to be appointed to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations. Representative Van Hollen also introduced legislation in the 110th Congress to reform the trade advisory system, which included provisions for a Public Health Advisory Committee on Trade. Some caution against creating a trade advisory committee solely focused on health issues to avoid insulating trade policy discussions from public health concerns. Critics worry that the USTR may limit consultations with the proposed health committee to technical issues, neglecting broader implications for public health. Industry advocates may oppose legislation diluting industry representation on ITACs, arguing they were meant for USTR-industry consultation. Other avenues for input on FTA negotiations include USTR's public hearings and Federal Register comments, raising questions about the weight of public health input compared to ITACs. Some observers question the influence of U.S. industry interests, like PhRMA, on USTR's country identifications in the Special 301 report. Concerns are raised about limited input from public health advocates, generic drug manufacturers, and other groups, potentially impacting the legitimacy of the report. Concerns about industry influence on the Special 301 trade policy tool and the need for public health considerations in future trade agreements, including the use of the May 10, 2007 bipartisan trade deal as a template for intellectual property rights provisions. Questions also arise about the applicability of this template based on a country's income status. Some stakeholders question the application of changes to FTA patent provisions in recent FTAs with low-income countries like Peru, Panama, and Colombia, compared to the FTA with middle-income country South Korea. There are calls to revisit the IPR provisions in the May 10, 2007 bipartisan trade deal, with pharmaceutical industry representatives hoping for a reversal of the scale-down in patent provisions. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) believes the pharmaceutical industry was unfairly targeted in the trade deal. However, concerns exist that revisiting the deal may reopen previously resolved issues. The TRADE Act of 2009 could lead to a re-evaluation of trade agreements, including IPR provisions. Global health advocates and generic pharmaceutical companies may resist changes to IPR provisions to increase access to medicines. The bill requires a review of economic, environmental, and health impacts of trade agreements, with a focus on not limiting flexibilities and rights established in the WTO Doha. The United States-Peru FTA incorporates provisions from a bipartisan trade deal, reflecting IPR and public health measures. Some argue that a strong international IPR regime benefits the U.S., but concerns exist about always seeking higher standards. Compulsory licenses may be necessary for global health or security threats, as seen with the anthrax scare in 2001. The United States and Canada issued compulsory licenses for Cipro and Tamiflu, drugs produced by Bayer and Roche respectively, to ensure affordable access. This raised concerns about the limitations of patent regimes and the impact on U.S. interests. Roche agreed to increase production by sub-licensing the patent to other manufacturers. Higher vaccine and drug prices due to IPR protection may discourage developing countries from sharing virus samples with the WHO. Indonesia limited sharing H5N1 virus samples during the avian influenza pandemic over concerns of patented vaccines being unaffordable. Indonesia resumed sharing samples with the condition of negotiating for more equitable vaccine sharing. As China, India, and other industrializing countries increase patent applications, the global patent landscape may shift. In 2009, U.S. patent filings decreased by 11.4%, while China saw a growth rate of 29.4% in patent filings. These shifts in patents and the pharmaceutical marketplace could impact medicine costs in the U.S. and other developed countries. Some advocate for greater public involvement in providing pharmaceutical solutions for diseases and expanding U.S. trade policies beyond patents and compulsory licensing. The WHO Global Strategy on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual Property suggests exploring various incentive mechanisms for R&D targeting public health needs in developing countries. Innovative mechanisms like advance market commitments, patent pools, and innovation prizes can steer pharmaceutical R&D towards addressing public health needs in developing countries, but may shift more risks to governments."
