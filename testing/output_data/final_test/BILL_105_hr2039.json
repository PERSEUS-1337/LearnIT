    "content": "The Congress finds that the original Cheyenne-Arapaho Indian Reservation in western Oklahoma, including the Fort Reno Military Reservation, was established by the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty of 1867. The Fort Reno Military Reservation lands hold cultural and religious sites for the Tribe. The land in Canadian County, Oklahoma, is taken into trust for the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes. It includes specific sections in Township 12 and 13 North, Range 8 West, Indian Meridian. Additionally, a portion of the land may be used by the Bureau of Prisons. The Secretary may lease land to the United States for use by the Bureau of Prisons at the Federal Reformatory in El Reno, Oklahoma, with the consent of the Tribe's Business Committee. The Act allows for nonrevocable easements, licenses, permits, or commitments granted by the Secretary of War or Agriculture before the enactment date to continue for a specified time. These may be renewed at the Secretary's discretion. Revocable easements, licenses, permits, or commitments existing on the enactment date can be continued or renewed indefinitely by the Secretary. The Secretary may continue or renew easements, licenses, permits, or commitments on described lands if they are revocable or indefinite and in the public interest. For lands used by the Bureau of Prisons, only easements limited to specific purposes and in effect before the Act's enactment date may be continued or renewed. The land described in section 2 is located in Township 12 North, Range 8 West, Indian Meridian, and the southeast quarter of section 36, Township 13 North, Range 8 West, Indian Meridian. It is useful for maintaining the sewage disposal plant on the land. The Secretary has the authority to make federally owned buildings and facilities available to the Tribe for their use, as well as convey them to the Tribe in accordance with the 1956 Act. The Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma residing in Canadian County, Oklahoma, are eligible for federal services and benefits as if they were on or near an Indian reservation. This Act does not affect any treaties or rights secured to the Tribe or any other Indian tribe. Definitions include the Secretary of the Interior and the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma."
