    "content": "This report provides an overview of the professional experiences and qualifications of current U.S. circuit court judges. Senators often highlight important qualifications when supporting judicial nominees, such as prior judicial experience and prosecutorial background. The nominee to the First Circuit has 32 years of experience in complex civil litigation and has served in various prestigious legal positions. The nominee to the Seventh Circuit brings almost 12 years of judicial experience from serving on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and as a trial judge. The nominee for the federal bench has 7 years of experience in commercial litigation at a prestigious law firm before serving as a state judge. Judicial nominees are evaluated by the American Bar Association based on professional qualifications such as integrity, competence, and courtroom experience. The ABA recommends nominees to have at least 12 years of legal practice and significant trial experience. The committee considers that distinguished accomplishments in law or similar trial work experience can compensate for a lack of courtroom experience in prospective nominees for the circuit court. Appellate judges focus on reviewing briefs and lower court records, so trial experience is less crucial for them. Scholars also study how judges' pre-judicial career experiences may affect their decision-making processes. Some studies suggest that prior judicial experience does not significantly impact judicial decision-making, while others found that judges with non-private practice work experience are less likely to rely on certain sources in interpreting the law. Concerns have been raised about the lack of career diversity among federal judges. The lack of diversity among federal judges is seen as problematic, as it can diminish the institutional performance of the courts. Having judges with varied career experiences brings distinct perspectives to the bench, leading to more effective decision-making. This report aims to inform Congress about the professional qualifications and experiences of circuit court judges.
