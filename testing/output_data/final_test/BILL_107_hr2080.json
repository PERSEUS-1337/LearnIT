    "content": "DENIAL OF ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION FOR ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITIES HAVING EXCESS PROFITS. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to deny accelerated depreciation for electric generating facilities with excess profits. This means that the depreciation deduction for such facilities will be determined under the alternative depreciation system, and any previously allowed accelerated benefits will be recaptured. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 denies accelerated depreciation for electric generating facilities with excess profits. Excess profits occur if the facility's pretax rate of return exceeds 15 percent. The pretax rate of return is calculated by dividing the taxpayer's net income by the average net investment in the facility. Any previously allowed accelerated benefits will be recaptured by including them in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year. The net investment in a facility is the excess of the aggregate adjusted bases of the property over the taxpayer's indebtedness. Net income from operating an electric generating facility is the excess of gross income from sales. The net income from operating an electric generating facility is the excess of gross income from sales over allowable deductions directly related to the facility's operations. Sales to related persons are treated at the price of the first sale to an unrelated party, minus transmission costs. Adjusted basis is considered for these calculations. Adjusted bases and depreciation deductions are determined as if subsection (g) applied to the facility for all taxable years. Only interest on indebtedness allocable to the facility is considered. Previously allowed accelerated benefits are calculated as the excess of depreciation deductions under section 167(a) for prior years over what would have been allowable under the alternative depreciation system of subsection (g). The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. Exemptions are provided for facilities using renewable energy sources such as wind, sun, or water power. The adjusted basis of property with recaptured amounts included in gross income will be increased."
