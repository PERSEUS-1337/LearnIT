    "content": "Since the Clean Air Act in 1970, US air quality has significantly improved with a 59% decrease in emissions of major pollutants. However, emissions from shipping remain a concern as most ocean-going ships lack pollution controls. New regulations for smaller ships were implemented in 2008 and 2009, but existing engines in many vessels are still uncontrolled. Ocean-going ships typically use bunker fuel, which contributes to pollution. Ocean-going ships use bunker fuel with high sulfur content, contributing to pollution in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area. These ships are a major source of nitrogen oxides, emitting more than power plants and refineries combined. Emissions from ships need to be reduced by over 90% to meet national air quality standards. According to the AQMD, particulate emissions from marine vessels in the Los Angeles area contribute to significant cancer risks and over 700 premature deaths annually. The issue extends beyond L.A. and California, with more than 40 U.S. ports in nonattainment areas for air quality standards. Oceangoing ships are a major source of emissions, but not the only one. Ships are a major source of port emissions, but not the only one. Ports also utilize tug boats, connect to land-based transportation networks, operate truck terminals, and provide power to ships at rest. Pollution in ports requires a multi-faceted approach, governed by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78). The MARPOL 73/78 Convention applies to ships of flag states that have ratified it, with about 150 countries representing over 98.7% of world shipping tonnage. It also applies to ships of non-signatory states operating in waters under the jurisdiction of parties to MARPOL. The Convention has six annexes covering various sources of pollution from ships and provides a framework for implementation. Annex VI, adopted in 1997 and in force since 2005, addresses the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships by limiting the sulfur content of fuel used in oceangoing ships. Annex VI of the MARPOL 73/78 Convention limits sulfur content in bunker fuel to 4.5% for oceangoing ships, with special Emission Control Areas at 1.5%. It also restricts NOx emissions from engines and regulates VOC emissions from tankers in ports. Additionally, it prohibits ozone-depleting substances and incineration of PCBs on ships. The United States banned PCB production and use in 1976 and strictly regulates disposal. Legislation to implement Annex VI of MARPOL 73/78 was enacted in 2008 after ratification consent in 2006. The President signed the implementing bill in July. The Annex VI standards, implemented in 2008 after ratification consent in 2006, apply to oceangoing vessels registered in the United States and ships in U.S. waters or emission control areas. The United States participated in negotiations to strengthen Annex VI, leading to more stringent limits on fuels and emissions approved by the IMO in October 2008. The IMO approved more stringent limits on fuels and emissions on October 10, 2008. The new limits reduce sulfur content in bunker fuel to 3.5% starting January 1, 2012, and further to 0.5% on January 1, 2020. Sulfur Emission Control Areas will also have reduced sulfur content limits. Additionally, nitrogen oxide emissions from marine engines will be reduced with new standards phased in. EPA implemented stricter NOx limits for ship engines constructed after 2011, with reductions of 20% for engines built before 2016 and 80% for those built after. The agency had already enforced regulations equivalent to 1997 Annex VI standards before Congress enacted the legislation in 2008. EPA categorizes ship engines into three groups, with the largest being diesel engines with a per-cylinder displacement of 30 liters or more. The EPA implemented stricter NOx limits for ship engines built after 2011, with reductions of 20% for engines built before 2016 and 80% for those built after. Ship engines are categorized into three groups, with the largest being diesel engines with a per-cylinder displacement of 30 liters or more, known as \"Category 3\" engines. EPA's emission standards for Category 3 engines only apply to vessels flagged or registered in the United States, which accounted for a small percentage of the world's ocean-going ships in 2007. The EPA's emission standards for Category 3 engines in the United States will have little impact on overall pollution from ocean-going ships. The more stringent requirements will only apply to new and remanufactured engines, leading to gradual improvements. EPA aims to achieve more substantial emission reductions through standards for marine fuel, affecting both new and existing engines. The new C3 standards will require cleaner fuel, building upon existing lenient requirements. In 2009, EPA established stronger emission standards for marine Category 3 diesel engines, aligning with Annex VI amendments. The new regulations aim to expand the use of cleaner fuels and designate U.S. waters as Emission Control Areas under the annex. EPA had initially set a deadline of April 2007 for the standards but later extended it to December 2009. The EPA proposed designating U.S. waters as an Emission Control Area (ECA) under Annex VI, setting lower sulfur limits for bunker fuel. The proposed ECA includes the entire U.S. coastline, Southeastern Alaska, and the main Hawaiian Islands up to 200 nautical miles from shore. The sulfur limits are set to be 10,000 ppm by August 2012 and 1,000 ppm by January 1, 2015. Additionally, new regulations for marine engines and low sulfur fuel requirements in ECAs starting in 2015 were proposed by the EPA in July 2009. New marine engines will need to meet low sulfur fuel requirements in ECAs starting in 2015, with Tier 2 standards applying to new engines from 2011 and Tier 3 standards effective in 2016. Tier 2 aims for a 15-25% reduction in NOx emissions, while Tier 3 targets an 80% reduction using aftertreatment technology like selective catalytic reduction. These regulations have garnered support from the shipping industry and environmental groups. The World Shipping Council (WSC) and its members fully support the proposal to codify and adopt the C3 standards as proposed in the current rulemaking. The Pacific Marine Shipping Association is pleased to see the ECA proposal moving forward as planned. The Clean Air Task Force and 34 other environmental organizations view EPA's proposed C3 Marine Engine rule as a substantial step in the right direction, but they would have liked to see stronger emission standards for all new ships in U.S. waters. The EPA estimates that the benefits of its new regulations for C3 engines and fuel will outweigh the costs by at least 30 to 1. The benefits include annually preventing between 12,000 and 31,000 premature deaths, 1,500,000 work days lost, and 9,600,000 minor restricted activity days, valued at between $99 billion and $270 billion annually. The reductions in pollution are greatest near the coasts but extend inland, with estimated costs of approximately $1.85 billion in 2020, increasing to $3.11 billion in 2030. The costs of using lower-sulfur fuel in the proposed ECA are substantial, totaling $1.85 billion in 2020 and increasing to $3.11 billion in 2030. These costs are expected to be passed on to consumers of ocean transportation, resulting in minimal impacts on society. The ECA proposal also includes applying these rules to large ships on the Great Lakes, requiring them to burn low sulfur fuels. Ships on the Great Lakes would need to use low sulfur fuels under the ECA proposal. U.S. and Canadian cargo ships on the Great Lakes carry bulk cargoes like iron ore, coal, and agricultural products. Many of these ships are old, with some built as far back as 1906. Switching to distillate fuel would require significant modifications to the fuel supply system. The Lake Carriers Association estimated the cost of converting 13 steamers' powerplants to run on diesel fuel or self-unloading barges to be $20-27 million each. Another 13 vessels may face impacts from higher fuel prices. The EPA's proposed ECA and C3 regulations did not consider the significant impacts on older Great Lakes ships. The Category 3 Regulatory Impact Analysis showed that switching to lower sulfur distillate fuel would increase costs for shipping companies, with Great Lakes ships facing a greater cost increase as they operate in the proposed ECA 100% of the time. Congress addressed concerns of Great Lakes shipping companies in Section 442 of H.R. 2996, FY2010 appropriations, prohibiting the EPA from issuing a final rule including these cost increases. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is required to issue a final rule with fuel sulfur standards for existing steamships in the Great Lakes region. The rule includes waiver provisions for vessels burning residual fuel if 10,000 ppm sulfur fuel is not available. The final C3 rule includes waivers for Great Lakes vessels based on economic hardship. EPA should structure the waiver provision similar to other fuel rules, allowing parties to apply in advance. A study on the economic impact of the rule on Great Lakes carriers should be conducted within six months. Category 1 and 2 engines are used in various vessels operating in U.S. waters, such as tugs, ferries, and fishing boats. The EPA is regulating emissions from Category 1 and 2 engines, which are smaller than Category 3 engines but still powerful. New regulations aim to reduce NOx and particulate emissions by a certain percentage. Stricter standards will require ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel and high-efficiency emission controls. The EPA estimates significant reductions in various emissions with these new regulations. The EPA estimates that the benefits of the May 2008 rule will exceed compliance costs by at least 9 to 1. The rule is expected to reduce premature deaths, work days lost, and restricted-activity days annually. Health benefits are valued at $8.4 billion to $11 billion in 2030, with social costs estimated at $740 million. California has taken a leading role in implementing emission reduction measures for shipping, focusing on port activities and fuel. California has implemented measures for shipping, focusing on port activities and fuel. The state requires the use of lower sulfur fuel, emission controls on harbor vessels, alternative power for ships at marine terminals, and grants for cleaner engines. Regulations by the California Air Resources Board mandate the use of low sulfur fuels for vessels within 24 miles of the coast, with sulfur limits decreasing over time. In 2012, sulfur in fuel will be limited to 1,000 ppm in California, replacing previous requirements overturned in 2008. The state leads in imposing strict rules on diesel engines, with ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach banning older trucks from entering terminals. Trucks must meet 2007 federal standards by 2012. The Port of Los Angeles requires heavy-duty diesel trucks to meet 2007 federal standards. A $35 gate fee per 20-foot container unit helps fund truck upgrades. Truck emissions have decreased by 70% since October 1, 2008. CARB regulations for harbor craft mandate engine replacements starting in 2009. The port opened the world's first Alternative Maritime Power terminal in June 2004 for container ships to plug in and reduce emissions. The Port of Los Angeles electrified its container terminals to reduce diesel emissions while ships are docked, following a lawsuit by environmental groups. The project included installing AMP capability in two terminals and offering financial assistance to shippers for retrofitting vessels to run on electrical power. CARB and ports in San Francisco and Seattle are implementing AMP to reduce emissions. CARB awarded significant funds for emission reduction projects, with a focus on replacing older engines and trucks with lower emitting models. Trucking companies are the main recipients of these funds, aiming to reduce emissions by up to 90%. In February 2009, CARB funding for emission reduction programs was affected by a state budget crisis, suspending bond programs. Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will provide subsidies for truck and engine replacement from a container fee fund. Grants will offer $20,000 for each truck compliant with EPA's 2007 emission standards. The ports began distributing $44 million in incentive checks in December 2008 for low-emission trucks purchased under the program. Implementation of per-container fees to fund the system was delayed until February 18, 2009 due to anti-competitive concerns. The Port of Los Angeles is collaborating to provide funding for natural gas trucks purchased by port concessionaires. The Port of Los Angeles provides funding for natural gas trucks purchased by port concessionaires, with up to $100,000 available for each LNG or CNG truck and up to 80% of the cost for electric trucks. Over 400 alternate fuel trucks have been purchased, accounting for 8.5% of cargo movements at the port as of October 2009. The U.S. EPA and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 have allocated funds for diesel emission reductions at ports, with $300 million available for grants under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. At least $29 million has been awarded for diesel reduction activities at ports, including $8 million for California ports. The International Maritime Organization estimates that international shipping emitted 843 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2007, accounting for 2.7% of global CO2 emissions. Including domestic shipping and fishing vessels, the total would increase to 1.019 billion tonnes, 3.3% of global emissions. Ships use low-quality bunker fuel, contributing to greenhouse gas pollutants. Ships emit significant amounts of black carbon, nitrogen oxides, and potent greenhouse gases like HFCs and PFCs, contributing to climate change. These emissions mostly occur in international waters from vessels not registered in the United States, requiring international agreement to address. The IMO is responsible for sector-specific provisions to reduce GHG emissions from shipping, as nations have disagreed on who should take responsibility under the Kyoto Protocol. The IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee is negotiating sector-specific provisions to reduce GHG emissions from shipping. Discussions include voluntary guidelines on ship design and operational efficiency, as well as market-based instruments like a cap-and-trade scheme or a bunker fuel tax. The European Union is pushing for international control of shipping emissions, considering adding the industry to its EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The European Parliament deferred shipping from its climate measures package, awaiting IMO discussions. If IMO fails to produce results, the EU may act unilaterally. UNCTAD notes that maritime transport is more fuel-efficient and climate-friendly than other modes. Shipping is more fuel-efficient and climate-friendly compared to other modes of transport. CO2 emissions from shipping are lower than rail, road, and air transport. A container ship consumes significantly less energy than a freight aircraft, heavy truck, and rail. However, shipping generally does not compete with other modes of transport, except for high-value or perishable goods over short distances with land links. Ships move over 80% of international trade volume. GHG emissions from shipping are projected to increase unless control measures are adopted. One suggestion is for ships to operate at lower speeds to reduce emissions. However, slowing speeds may cause engine problems like vibrations and sooting. Ships can reduce GHG emissions by operating at lower speeds, leading to engine modifications or de-rating. Slow steaming policies have been implemented by shipping companies to achieve significant emission reductions, with some reporting fuel consumption reductions of 6% in a year. In 2008, the company implemented various measures to reduce emissions, including waste heat recovery systems, software to reduce energy consumption, voyage planning for fuel-efficient routes, and cleaner fuels. Alternative power sources in ports can also help lower GHG emissions. New ships with better design and propulsion can further reduce emissions. Ships can reduce emissions through hull design, propulsion efficiency, and propeller coatings. Pollution from ships and port operations is a significant source of pollutants in U.S. cities, complicating control efforts. Foreign trade growth adds to pollution burdens. Controlling pollution from oceangoing ships is complicated by foreign registration, but international agreements like MARPOL Annex VI are establishing stricter regulations. EPA and local agencies are also addressing ship pollution through the Clean Air Act. Smaller U.S.-registered vessels like ferries and fishing boats are easier to control. The technical issues of controlling pollution from smaller vessels, including Great Lakes freighters, pose challenges due to a variety of engine sizes and ship configurations. Safety is crucial in extreme weather conditions and navigating hazards. The FY2010 appropriation for EPA prohibits funds for final fuel sulfur standards for existing steamships on the Great Lakes, prompting the need for waiver provisions. Ships and port operations are significant sources of air pollution, necessitating stricter regulations. Ships and port operations are major sources of air pollution, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Congress has taken steps to address this issue by implementing emissions regulations and cleaner fuels requirements. Further actions at the state level, in the courts, and by the U.S. EPA will continue to bring attention to the issue, providing opportunities for oversight and legislation."
