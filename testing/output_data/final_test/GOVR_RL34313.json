    "content": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has monitored recalls of meat and poultry products in the United States due to contamination with E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, and botulism. A recall is a firm's voluntary removal of products from commerce when adulterated or misbranded. In February 2008, the largest-ever recall of 143.4 million pounds of beef products was announced by the USDA, in response to mistreatment of nonambulatory cattle for food. Recalls of meat and poultry products in the US have raised concerns about consumer confidence and USDA oversight. A 2004 GAO report criticized monitoring efforts and highlighted the potential for deliberate contamination. USDA has the authority to regulate meat, poultry, and their products through import regulation, inspection, and seizure of non-compliant products. The USDA regulates meat, poultry, and products, including inspections, import regulations, and recalls. The agency lacks the authority for mandatory recalls, which must be initiated voluntarily by manufacturers or distributors. The report also discusses legislative proposals to expand USDA authority in product recalls. The USDA, through FSIS, regulates the safety, labeling, and importation of meat and poultry products for human consumption under the FMIA and PPIA. FSIS can prevent non-compliant products from entering the food supply but cannot mandate recalls. Adulterated or misbranded meat and poultry products are prohibited from importation under these acts. The PPIA prohibits the importation of poultry and meat products that do not meet health and safety standards set by the act. Imported items must comply with U.S. domestic sanitary protection standards and undergo inspection and testing by FSIS. Non-compliant items can be refused entry into the United States. The FMIA and PPIA require inspection of livestock, poultry, and meat products entering the US. Inspectors ensure compliance with health and safety standards, conducting ante mortem and post mortem inspections to guarantee quality and sanitation in processing facilities. The FSIS regulates the entry of meat and poultry products into the food supply by conducting inspections of establishments for sanitation quality. If standards are not met, inspection services may be ceased, and unapproved products must be destroyed. The USDA lacks authority to withdraw products already in the food supply, relying on voluntary recalls by food companies. FSIS works with meat and poultry establishments on recalls. If an establishment doesn't conduct the recall, FSIS can detain and seize products. Recall policies are in FSIS Directive 8080.1. FSIS can detain products if they are believed to be adulterated, misbranded, uninspected, or intended for human consumption. Under regulations, FSIS can detain products that are believed to be adulterated, misbranded, uninspected, or intended for human consumption. The authorized detention period cannot exceed 20 days. If a product is detained, FSIS will issue a Press Release informing the public. Recall guidelines suggest firms identify a recall coordinator, develop a recall plan, and notify FSIS promptly. The 2008 farm bill requires establishments to promptly notify FSIS if they believe a recall is necessary. Establishments subject to inspection must promptly notify FSIS if they suspect adulterated or misbranded products have entered commerce. While not required, FSIS recommends including a recall plan in the HACCP safety prevention plan. FSIS oversees voluntary recalls and may learn of a potential recall through various sources. FSIS assembles a Recall Committee to evaluate potential recalls based on the nature of the defect, occurrence of illnesses or injuries, and public health risks. If a recall recommendation is issued, it includes reasons for the recall, classification, product identification, and estimated distribution amount. Recall classifications are determined by the level of public health risk posed by the product. Class I recalls are the most serious, involving a reasonable probability of causing serious health consequences or death. Examples include pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella on ready-to-eat products. Class II recalls have a remote probability of adverse health consequences, such as the presence of allergenic substances. Class III recalls involve situations where the product will not cause adverse health consequences, like excess water in a product. Recall classifications are based on the public health risk posed by the product. Excess water in a product can lead to a Class III recall, with different levels of distribution affected. FSIS informs the public of recalls through press releases and recall notification reports, with Class I and II recalls receiving press releases. FSIS disseminates recall information through press releases and recall notification reports, with detailed descriptions of the product, reason for recall, associated risks, and appropriate responses. Contact information is provided for questions, and product destination is indicated to alert potential consumers. Recall notification reports are issued for all recalls, including Class III recalls. FSIS publishes recall notification reports on its website, including retail stores receiving products involved in Class I recalls. The listing aims to inform consumers about products with serious health risks. FSIS monitors recall effectiveness through checks on notifying consignees and their responses. FSIS determines recall effectiveness based on risk, classification, and number of consignees. If the number of consignees with the product exceeds a critical limit, the recall is ineffective. FSIS may detain products if prompt action is lacking. If a firm fails to recall properly, FSIS may intervene or issue public warnings. A recall termination report is issued after effectiveness checks. Consumer and food safety advocacy groups have long argued for FSIS to have the authority to mandate recalls of contaminated products to ensure swift removal from the market when companies are unwilling to do so voluntarily. Despite past proposals in Congress, no legislation granting FSIS this authority has been enacted. Consumer and food safety advocacy groups advocate for mandatory recall authority for FSIS to swiftly remove contaminated products from the market when companies are hesitant to act voluntarily. GAO found in 2004 that FSIS and FDA lack effective tracking of recalls, leading to unrecovered recalled food products being consumed. Industry representatives argue that current authorities are sufficient, with few meat or poultry establishments refusing FSIS recommendations for recalls. Industry representatives argue that FSIS's existing authority to suspend or withdraw inspection services, detain products, and seize unsafe food is effective in ensuring product safety. They believe that the current system, which relies on voluntary cooperation, fosters better industry-regulator relationships compared to mandatory recall authority, which could lead to a more adversarial system. The debate over implementing a mandatory food recall system includes considerations such as due process protection for food companies and limitations on liability. Questions arise about the potential shift in burden of proof to the agency and the effectiveness of FSIS's reasons for ordering a recall. These aspects have not been widely discussed among stakeholders. FSIS lacks explicit authority to require prompt notification from companies regarding unsafe products in commerce. Many believe this is necessary for an effective recall policy. The 2008 farm bill amended FMIA and PPIA to mandate establishments to promptly notify USDA if they suspect adulterated products in commerce. Section 11017 mandates meat and poultry establishments to have recall plans available for USDA inspectors. Improved traceability capabilities could help prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. Recalls typically recover only a small percentage of products, as many are likely consumed or destroyed by purchasers. The FSIS officials have debated the effectiveness of recalls, with the 2004 GAO report stating that recovery is an important indicator of a successful recall. FSIS claims to have improved the recall process by increasing effectiveness checks and shortening completion times. These checks rely on a risk-based statistical sampling plan to contact consignees. FSIS uses a risk-based sampling plan to determine the number of consignees contacted during recall effectiveness checks. A critical number of consignees must have the product for the recall to be successful. FSIS also requires posting of retail outlets where recalled products were distributed. The agency believes this will help consumers return or destroy more products. The effectiveness of recalls and the significance of high recall numbers in relation to food safety measures are also debated. The effectiveness of recalls and the significance of high recall numbers in relation to food safety measures are debated, with questions raised about the vigilance of states compared to FSIS in conducting recalls of unsafe products. Consumer advocates argue that most recalls of federally inspected products are initiated after routine testing finds bacterial contamination, rather than in response to foodborne illness outbreaks. The FSIS reported approximately 890 meat and poultry recalls, totaling nearly 323 million pounds of products from 1994 to 2009. Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 are the main reasons for recalls, often found in ready-to-eat products and ground beef. During the period from 1994 to 2009, Listeria concerns accounted for 30% of all recalls, with nearly 109 million pounds recalled. E. coli O157:H7 concerns were associated with 20% of recalls, totaling 109 million pounds. Additionally, 21% of recalls were due to misbranded products containing undeclared substances, while 9% were caused by foreign materials like glass or plastic. Recalls from 1994 to 2009 varied in causes, including processing defects, ineligible imports, and foreign materials. Large recall volumes in certain years were often due to a single company's products. For example, in 1997, a Hudson Foods recall of ground beef due to E. coli contamination accounted for a significant portion of the total recalls. On February 17, 2008, USDA announced the largest U.S. meat recall ever, involving 143.4 million pounds of beef products from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. The recall was due to the slaughter of nonambulatory cattle for human consumption, posing a risk of mad cow disease. Approximately 50 million pounds were distributed to federal nutrition programs in 45 states, with a Class II designation indicating a remote health risk. The USDA announced the largest U.S. meat recall ever on February 17, 2008, involving 143.4 million pounds of beef products from Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. The recall was due to inhumane handling of nonambulatory cattle before slaughter, leading to a remote health risk. USDA suspended inspection at the plant after the company voluntarily ceased operations. Animal welfare advocates videotaped employees mistreating the cattle, raising concerns about the effectiveness of increased enforcement measures. The FSIS announced a recall of ground beef products from Topps Meat Company due to potential E. coli contamination. The recall expanded to 21.7 million pounds and additional product labels were added. The recall was unusual as it was initiated by a patient-reported illness linked to E. coli. The FSIS recall of ground beef from Topps Meat Company was linked to E. coli contamination. A positive E. coli O157:H7 finding in a patient's leftover product led to the recall announcement on September 25. The recall expanded to 21.7 million pounds, covering a year of production due to reworking each day's production. The CDC cited 32 related illnesses by October 6. The ConAgra Beef Company in Greeley, CO, did not follow its HACCP plan, grinding meat without proper documentation for contamination testing. The FSIS inspector did not detect the issue, leading to a voluntary recall of 354,200 pounds of ground beef products. The ConAgra Beef Company in Greeley, CO, recalled approximately 354,200 pounds of fresh and frozen ground beef products due to E. coli contamination. The recall was later expanded to 18 million pounds after 46 people in 16 states fell ill from the same strain of E. coli found in the meat. The USDA Office of Inspector General criticized FSIS's oversight of the recall as ineffective and inefficient. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) criticized FSIS's oversight of the recall of contaminated products from ConAgra Beef Company, noting that only 3 million pounds out of 18 million pounds were recovered. Problems included lack of preparedness for a recall, with some processing plants not having recall procedures in their HACCP plans. One grinder was unable to determine which customers received the recalled product. Additionally, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation recalled 295,000 pounds of poultry products due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The recall of approximately 27.4 million pounds of Pilgrim's Pride products due to Listeria contamination was expanded after a positive sample was found. Despite negative product samples, environmental sampling matched the strain of Listeria. Operations at the plant were suspended but resumed later. The recall was terminated after recovering over 5.5 million pounds, with ineffective oversight by FSIS according to OIG. FSIS oversight was found ineffective by OIG, with significant discrepancies in effectiveness check forms. Recall 015-1997 involved Hudson Foods recalling 25 million pounds of frozen ground beef patties due to E. coli contamination, with 10.1 million pounds recovered and the plant in Columbus, NE, closed. The Hudson Foods recall in Columbus, NE, involved 10.1 million pounds of beef recovered. The initial recall was limited to 20,000 pounds, but expanded due to reworking meat into subsequent days' production, highlighting flaws in the voluntary food recall system. Critics called for mandatory recall authority to prevent dangerous delays."
