    "content": "The \"USEC Privatization Amendments Act of 2009\" authorizes benefits for affected participants. The \"USEC Privatization Amendments Act of 2009\" authorizes the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to pay affected participants a one-time lump sum determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may also procure necessary information for program implementation. An affected participant is defined under section 3110(a)(6)(B) of the USEC Privatization Act. The Secretary will pay affected participants a one-time lump sum payment based on the actuarial present value of their accrued benefits under the pension plan from which a transfer of assets and liabilities was made. The total recoverable amount is determined for this purpose. The total recoverable amount is calculated as the excess of the present value of benefits that would have been accrued by affected participants under the pension plan if no transfer had occurred, over the present value of benefits accrued by all affected participants under the plan. The Secretary will determine payments under this section by considering benefits accrued and accruable under the pension plans involved in the transfer under the USEC Privatization Act. This includes benefits up to normal retirement age with adjustments for cost of living increases. The Secretary will adjust payment amounts for affected participants to account for appropriations made for the program under subsection (a) and successor plans receiving assets exceeding accrued benefits upon succession. The Secretary may make findings of facts and decisions on participant rights for payments under this Act. Regulations must be issued within 60 days of enactment, requiring applicants to consent to information release. Public notice will be given to potential eligible individuals, and applications for payment must be submitted within 240 days of enactment. The Secretary must make timely payments to affected participants within 180 days of application submission. Participants can choose to treat the payment as a rollover contribution to an IRA within 1 year of receiving the payment. Contributions to individual retirement plans are not included in gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Contributions are treated as distributions and transferred to the IRA within 60 days. Special rules apply for Roth IRAs. Contributions to Roth IRAs are included in gross income and spread over a 2-taxable-year period. Appropriations are authorized for the Secretary to carry out the Act, and affected participants can request a hearing if their rights are prejudiced by the Secretary's decision. The Secretary may give a participant notice and opportunity for a hearing regarding a decision, and based on evidence presented, affirm, modify, or reverse findings. A request for a hearing must be filed within 60 days of receiving notice. The Secretary is authorized to hold hearings and conduct investigations as deemed necessary. Judicial review is available to any affected participant after a final decision by the Secretary, allowing for a civil action within 60 days. The action must be brought in the district court where the participant resides. The court has the power to enter a final judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the Secretary's decision in a civil action brought by an affected participant within 60 days. The judgment is final but subject to review in the same manner as other civil actions. The Secretary is responsible for all payments and costs under this Act, reporting payments to participants and the IRS, and answering questions. Any action under this Act will continue despite changes in the Secretary's office. The current or former employer is not responsible for communication, payments, or answering questions for affected participants. The Act does not hold the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky, or any other entity liable for any costs or claims."
