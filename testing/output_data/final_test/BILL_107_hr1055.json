    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Payday Loan Consumer Protection Amendments of 2001\" aims to provide consumer protection in the payday loan industry. The Congress finds that payday lending targets individuals with limited access to affordable credit, with high annual percentage rates exceeding 1000 percent. State laws have been revised to exempt payday loan transactions from traditional lending restrictions. Payday lenders exploit loopholes in federal law by partnering with insured depository institutions to avoid state interest rate regulations. Lending practices that do not assess borrowers' ability to repay, encourage perpetual debt, or violate state laws are deemed unacceptable and pose a threat to the banking system. Congress intended for Truth in Lending Act protections to apply to all credit transactions, including payday loans. The provision of Truth in Lending credit disclosures should be a requirement in Federal statutes and regulations to ensure fair lending practices in payday loan transactions. The purpose of the Act is to prohibit insured depository institutions from engaging in payday lending and to clarify that Truth in Lending Act protections apply to all payday loans. SEC. 3.
