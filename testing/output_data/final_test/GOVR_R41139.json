    "content": "President Obama emphasized the need to develop clean energy sources to address economic issues related to U.S. dependence on oil. He highlighted the connection between federal deficit, trade deficit, and global warming with oil dependency. The President also discussed consumer behavior towards oil prices and how governments can influence consumption through tax and subsidy policies. The President's FY2011 budget proposal includes subsidies for alternative energy sources and increased taxes on the oil and natural gas industries to shift U.S. energy consumption patterns. This report analyzes the economic effects of proposed tax increases on the oil industry. The tax provisions in the U.S. oil industry have kept petroleum product costs low, encouraging consumption. Low gasoline prices impact residential and business decisions, holiday travel, and other aspects of American life. When gasoline prices rose to over $4 per gallon in 2008, consumers shifted towards more fuel-efficient vehicles, leading to reduced sales and profitability in the U.S. automobile industry. Shifting energy consumption from oil to alternative fuels is seen as unlikely. Shifting U.S. energy consumption from oil to alternative fuels faces challenges due to adjustment costs and technology limitations. Hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity, but gasoline-powered cars are expected to dominate. The transportation sector accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption, making it unclear how renewable fuels can significantly change this pattern. The economic recession, ongoing since 2007, along with federal support for various sectors, raises concerns about projected federal revenues and deficits. The desire to shift the nation away from oil and control the federal deficit has led to proposals to increase taxes on the oil industry. Proposed tax changes aim to equalize treatment between independent oil producers and major companies by eliminating preferential tax treatment. The impact of these tax changes on projected deficit effects to 2015 is outlined in Table 1. The White House proposes tax changes to increase revenue and reduce the deficit by eliminating preferential treatment for oil companies. The proposed changes would raise over $2.6 billion in 2011 and over half of the total deficit reduction from 2011 to 2015 would come from only two proposals. The White House proposes tax changes to increase revenue and reduce the deficit by eliminating preferential treatment for oil companies. This includes increasing taxes on the oil industry by repealing certain deductions and credits, which could raise $25 billion by 2020. The enhanced oil recovery tax credit, allowing a 15% credit for certain costs, would be eliminated, but its impact on oil supplies would be minimal unless prices are low. The repeal of the enhanced oil recovery tax credit may not significantly impact current oil supplies, especially during periods of excess supply. Supporters argue that maintaining this tax deduction is crucial for sustaining output from older wells and promoting environmental benefits through carbon dioxide injection. The potential reduction in production levels would be more pronounced in a low-profit margin environment, while high oil prices would mitigate the impact of the repeal. The marginal well tax credit, implemented in 2004 to support low-production oil and gas wells during low price periods, may not have a significant impact on production levels in a high-oil-price environment. Up to 20% of U.S. oil production and 12% of natural gas production comes from these wells. If prices remain high or the U.S. transitions to alternative energy sources, the credit may not be crucial. The repeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and gas properties is a small contribution to deficit reduction. This provision allows deductions for losses in oil and gas projects against other income. The most significant item in the proposed budget for the oil and gas industry is the repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction. The manufacturing tax deduction, enacted in 2004 to boost American employment in manufacturing, could contribute $7.3 billion to federal deficit reduction from 2011 to 2015. The deduction, applicable to the oil industry, phased in from 3% in 2005 to a maximum of 9% in 2010, aims to increase domestic manufacturing jobs. The White House estimates total tax revenue could reach $17.3 billion by 2020. The manufacturing tax deduction, aimed at boosting American employment in manufacturing, reduces the cost of labor for manufacturers. However, the oil and natural gas industries, while classified as manufacturing, may not significantly increase employment due to their capital-intensive nature. The oil and natural gas extraction industry has seen record profit levels since 2004, with high oil prices driving increased investment in exploration. Geological and geophysical expenses are necessary for resource development, and tax treatment plays a role in capital investment budgets. The tax treatment of geological and geophysical costs in oil and gas resource development is crucial for capital investment budgets. Currently, major integrated oil companies amortize these costs over seven years, while independent producers may have their amortization period extended to seven years under the Obama budget proposal. This change is expected to contribute nearly $0.8 billion in deficit reduction from 2011 to 2015. The Obama budget proposal aims to extend the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs in oil and gas resource development, potentially leading to $0.8 billion in deficit reduction from 2011 to 2015. Independent producers may reduce exploration activities in response to this tax provision, but the impact would depend on market price dynamics. High and volatile oil prices could mitigate the effects of the tax change on investment and production activities. Percentage depletion, a long-standing practice in the tax treatment of the oil industry, allows for deducting a percentage value (currently 15%) from an oil company's gross income to represent the total value of extracted oil deposits for the tax year. This allowance is limited to American production by independent producers on the first 1,000 barrels per day and is capped at 65% of the producer's net income. Major oil companies lost this benefit in 1975. The repeal of the percentage depletion allowance in 1975 affected major oil companies' profits, but their oil production remained stable. Ownership of oil in the United States is attractive for companies compared to other countries where ownership is with the national oil company. The repeal of the allowance is projected to reduce the deficit by $4.3 billion from 2011 to 2015 and over $10 billion through 2020. The Department of Interior's budget proposal includes changes in fees and revenue items affecting the oil and natural gas industries. The 2011 budget proposal includes provisions to transfer part of the cost of onshore and offshore drilling inspection fees to companies, generating revenues of $10 million each. A $4-per-acre fee on nonproducing leases is expected to yield $2.5 million. The proposal also seeks to repeal Section 365 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which prohibits charging producers for processing onshore drilling permit applications. These fees would increase the cost of oil and gas operations under DOI's management. The proposed fees on oil and natural gas facilities managed by DOI may have minor effects, as they represent a small fraction of revenues. Supporters argue they are necessary for environmentally sound resource management. However, tax changes could increase collections from the industry, potentially reducing exploration and production, raising prices, and increasing foreign oil dependence. These changes could also be seen as eliminating tax preferences favoring oil and gas over other energy sources. The proposed fees on oil and natural gas industries may have minor effects on production and consumption. These fees are argued to be necessary for environmentally sound resource management but could potentially increase prices and foreign oil dependence. Tax changes could also reduce exploration and production while eliminating preferences for oil and gas over other energy sources."
