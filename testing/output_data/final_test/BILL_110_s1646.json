The Secretary of Agriculture should provide cost-share payments to landowners for fuels management plans to protect grazing land and wildlife habitat from wildfires. Private grazing land in the United States has seen increases in cheatgrass and invasive weeds after wildfires. The Secretary of Agriculture should provide cost-share payments to landowners for fuels management plans to protect grazing land and wildlife habitat. Additionally, there are regulations in place to prevent private land from encroaching on public land and right-of-way. SEC. 3. FIRE PRESUPPRESSION CONSERVATION PROGRAM.
