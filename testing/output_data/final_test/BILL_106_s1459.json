    "content": "The \"Medicare Return To Home Act of 1999\" ensures choice for skilled nursing facility services under the Medicare+Choice program. The \"Medicare Return To Home Act of 1999\" amends Section 1852 of the Social Security Act to ensure coverage of services provided at a skilled nursing facility in a continuing care retirement community or where the enrollee previously resided. The \"Medicare Return To Home Act of 1999\" requires Medicare+Choice organizations to provide reimbursement for services at a skilled nursing facility, even without a contract, if certain factors are met. The Medicare Return To Home Act of 1999 mandates that Medicare+Choice organizations reimburse skilled nursing facilities for services provided to individuals who elect to receive care after hospitalization, as long as the facility can meet the individual's needs and agrees to accept similar payment terms. Medicare+Choice organizations must cover skilled nursing facility services to prevent hospitalization for enrollees without a preceding hospital stay if deemed necessary by the organization. Medicare+Choice organizations must cover skilled nursing facility services for enrollees residing with their spouse in the facility, as long as specific factors are met. The facility must also meet Medicare participation requirements for this coverage to apply. Medicare+Choice organizations offering plans are prohibited from denying eligibility, providing monetary incentives to accept less coverage, penalizing providers for following regulations, or giving incentives to individuals. Medicare+Choice organizations can impose deductibles, coinsurance, or cost-sharing for services covered under the plan, as long as it would have applied if the skilled nursing facility was under contract with the organization. The provisions of this subsection do not preempt state law. The subsection does not preempt state law and provides definitions for continuing care retirement community and skilled nursing facility. The amendments made by section 1819(a) shall apply to contracts entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act."
