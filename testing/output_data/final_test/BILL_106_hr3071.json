    "content": "Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is revised to include new findings. The Congress finds that there are 52.7 million students in elementary and secondary schools in the US, with a current federal expenditure of $12 million for education infrastructure. An additional $22 billion appropriation would result in $417 per student per year. The General Accounting Office reported that schools need $200 billion for repairs and upgrades, especially in urban areas with high minority populations. According to a 1991 survey by the American Association of School Administrators, 74% of public school buildings need replacement, with many built before World War II. Schools in unsatisfactory condition are mainly in central cities, serving poor or minority students. In large cities, schools still use polluting coal furnaces, posing health and safety risks to students. According to research, student achievement and behavior are affected by school building conditions and overcrowding. Areas with coal burning pollution have higher rates of respiratory illnesses. A 1995 study found that most schools lack modern technology and access to the information superhighway, especially in central cities and schools with over 50% minority populations. Old school buildings often have inadequate facilities like libraries and science labs. Overcrowded classrooms in old buildings with outdated equipment negatively impact student learning. Students in overcrowded schools score lower on exams and face disruptions in classroom activities and instructional techniques. Lunch periods start early, teachers struggle with limited room use, and there are not enough lockers, leading to disorderly behavior in jammed hallways and restrooms. School modernization for information technology is crucial for education in the upcoming CyberCivilization. The General Accounting Office highlights the lack of modern technology in schools and limited student access to 21st-century educational facilities. Computer literacy should be considered as essential as traditional subjects. Investing in school construction is vital for the national economy and security, ensuring well-equipped students who can contribute to the economy and support the best-trained Armed Forces. The shortage of qualified information technology workers is escalating, leading to the recruitment of foreign workers in America. Military manpower shortages in operating high tech equipment are acute in the Navy and increasing in other branches of the Armed Forces. The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds to local educational agencies for construction, repair, and modernization of school facilities for information technology. Federal assistance is in the form of grants. The Secretary will make grants to State educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization of elementary and secondary schools' information technology. The allocation of funds to each State will be based on the number of school-age children in the State compared to the total number in all States. To receive a grant for school construction projects, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information and assurances. The State educational agency must ensure that the projects are undertaken economically and not in an elaborate or extravagant manner. When approving projects for funding under this title, the State educational agency prioritizes safety, demonstrated need, age of the facility, and preparation for modern technology. Grants to local educational agencies may cover the total cost of construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization. The State educational agency determines funding for facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology. SEC. 12004 outlines general provisions related to funding for facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology. The Secretary must ensure that laborers and mechanics on projects assisted under this part are paid prevailing wages and work no more than 40 hours per week unless paid overtime. The Secretary has the authority to waive these requirements in certain cases. The Secretary may credit educational institutions undertaking construction projects if laborers or mechanics voluntarily donate their services to lower construction costs. The text defines \"school\" as structures for teaching students and \"State\" as including US states and DC. It authorizes $11 billion for fiscal year 2000 and the following 9 years for this purpose."
