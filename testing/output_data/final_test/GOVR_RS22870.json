    "content": "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a renewable fuel standard, leading to significant growth in the U.S. biofuels industry, particularly ethanol. Ethanol production capacity and corn demand for biofuel feedstock have increased over the years. In 2013, roughly 40% of the U.S. corn crop was used for ethanol production, with approximately 14 billion gallons of ethanol produced using 5 billion bushels of corn. In 2008, concerns over rising grain prices due to increasing demand for biofuels led to calls to amend or eliminate the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The EPA has the authority to waive RFS requirements in response to petitions, such as Texas Governor Rick Perry's request for a 50% waiver. Governors from multiple states, including Arkansas and North Carolina, petitioned the EPA for waivers of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates in 2012 and 2013 due to economic harm caused by the 2012 drought and increased grain demand. However, the EPA denied the petitions citing minimal effects on food, feed, and fuel prices. The EPA denied petitions for waivers of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates in 2012 and 2013 due to economic harm caused by the 2012 drought and increased grain demand. The EPA Administrator could waive certain parts of the RFS due to the \"blend wall,\" which limits the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline at the 10% level (E10). Stakeholders were concerned about facing this \"blend wall\" in either 2013 or 2014, leading the EPA to propose lowering the RFS mandates in cases of \"inadequate supply.\" The EPA proposed a lower overall mandate of 15.21 billion gallons for 2014, below the 2013 mandate, due to concerns over inadequate supply. Questions have been raised about meeting sub-mandates for cellulosic biofuels and other advanced biofuels, with EPA waiving most of the 2010 cellulosic biofuel carveout. EPA cited a lack of production capacity and investment in commercial-scale refineries. The EPA finalized lower cellulosic biofuel mandates for 2011 and 2012 due to limited production capacity. Court challenges led to mandates being set at zero for 2012 and reduced to 6.0 million gallons for 2013. The 2014 mandate is proposed to be between 8 million and 30 million gallons. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of renewable fuel in transportation fuels, with the 2014 mandate set to increase to 18.15 billion gallons. The majority of the mandate is met with U.S. corn ethanol, with a smaller amount from biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol from Brazil. Advanced biofuels, including cellulosic biofuel and bio-based diesel substitutes, are expected to play a larger role in meeting the mandate by 2022. The EPA proposed lowering the advanced biofuel mandate to 1.75 billion gallons, with corn ethanol capped at 15 billion gallons per year. The EISA mandates the use of cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel fuel, but production has been slow. The EPA administrator has the authority to waive the total volume of renewable fuel mandated by the RFS if there is inadequate domestic supply. The EPA administrator has the authority to waive the total volume of renewable fuel mandated by the RFS if there is inadequate domestic supply or if implementation would severely harm the economy or environment. Waivers can be initiated by a state, fuel provider, or the administrator herself, and if granted, the adjustment applies to the total national requirement. EPA cannot waive the requirement for an individual state or supplier, but must reduce the entire national mandate after consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy. The EPA administrator can waive the renewable fuel mandate if there is inadequate domestic supply or if implementation would harm the economy or environment. The criteria for the waiver are general, and EPA will not establish more specific criteria. Each waiver request will be evaluated individually, and EPA must approve or disapprove within 90 days of receiving the petition. The EPA must act within 90 days to approve or disapprove a waiver petition. If granted, the waiver expires after one year but can be extended. In 2012, EPA denied waiver petitions due to severe droughts affecting corn yields and high grain demand, leading to increased feed costs for livestock and potentially higher meat prices. EPA determined that the Renewable Fuel Standard requirements alone did not cause severe impacts. The EPA determined that the Renewable Fuel Standard requirements alone did not cause severe harm, and a waiver would do little to alleviate any problems in the states. EPA interprets the word \"would\" as requiring a high degree of confidence that implementation of the RFS program would severely harm the economy. The RFS waiver provisions call for EPA to evaluate the impact of the RFS mandate itself, considering the high threshold for harm. In November 2013, EPA proposed lowering the 2014 RFS mandate from 18.15 billion gallons to 15.21 billion gallons, citing the impact of the drought. Stakeholders raised concerns about exceeding the \"blend wall\" limitations due to fixed gasoline consumption levels in the US. Maintaining EISA levels was debated for 2014 volumes. EPA proposed using its general authority to lower RFS mandates in cases of \"inadequate supply,\" interpreting it to include constraints on delivering necessary biofuels to consumers. This encompasses factors affecting production, import, distribution, blending, dispensing, and consumption of renewable fuels. The waiver provision at CAA 211(o)(7)(A)(ii) is ambiguous as it does not specify what the term ''supply'' refers to. Evaluation of the supply of renewable fuel is best understood in terms of the person or place using the product. Various parties in the RFS program interact to drive the use of renewable fuel by consumers of transportation fuel. Supplying renewable fuel to obligated parties and terminal blenders is one part of the process, while supplying renewable fuel to the ultimate consumer as part of transportation fuel is a different aspect. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program involves supplying renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel to obligated parties and terminals as neat fuel, but consumers receive them as blends with conventional fuel. The waiver provision in the RFS does not specify the product or person/place involved in determining an \"inadequate domestic supply.\" Stakeholders have differing views on EPA's proposal, with gasoline and diesel suppliers generally supportive while biofuel producers feel EPA is overstepping its authority. EISA mandates the use of cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol from woody materials, as part of the RFS. The cellulosic biofuel mandate under the Renewable Fuel Standard was initially set to increase to 16.0 billion gallons by 2022, but due to limited production capacity, EPA reduced the mandate to 6.5 million gallons in 2010. Subsequent mandates for 2011, 2012, and 2013 were also set below scheduled amounts. EPA's proposed 2014 standard of 17 million gallons is significantly lower than the scheduled level of 1.75 billion gallons. The EPA may reduce the mandated volume of cellulosic biofuel if production is lower than required, with a deadline of November 30. The administrator can also decrease the required amounts of advanced biofuel and total volume under the RFS. In 2014, the EPA proposed lowering both advanced biofuel and overall RFS due to insufficient supply. Only the EPA administrator can decide on a cellulosic biofuel waiver. The EPA can reduce the mandated volume of cellulosic biofuel if production is lower than required. Gasoline and diesel fuel producers challenged the lowered mandates in court, leading to the 2012 cellulosic mandate being vacated. EPA set the 2012 level at zero and proposed the same for 2011, considering revising the 2013 level. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) also established a mandate for biomass-based diesel (BBD) fuel, mainly biodiesel produced from soybean oil and other vegetable oils. The BBD carve-out for renewable diesel started in 2009 at 0.5 billion gallons and increased to a minimum of 1.0 billion gallons in 2012. EPA finalized a 2013 BBD mandate of 1.28 billion gallons, with proposed levels for 2014 and 2015. The administrator may reduce the mandated amount for up to 60 days in case of significant market circumstances affecting BBD fuel prices. The EPA may extend a waiver for up to 60 days, but has not done so yet. Tax credits supporting biomass-based diesel fuels expired in 2013, potentially impacting production in 2014. If the administrator waives a significant share of requirements, future volumes must be reduced. The EPA may extend a waiver for up to 60 days, but has not done so yet. Tax credits supporting biomass-based diesel fuels expired in 2013, potentially impacting production in 2014. If the administrator waives a significant share of requirements, future volumes must be reduced. The administrator reduced the overall RFS requirement by 6.0 billion gallons in both 2017 and 2018, triggering a 6.0 billion gallon reduction in 2019 and beyond, except for waivers before 2016. Questions have been raised on how waivers would affect food and fuel markets, with effects depending on various factors like the degree of relaxation, duration, scope, extension, and prevailing supply and prices for oil, gasoline, biofuels, and feedstock commodities. The EPA did not state if there would be enough capacity to meet cellulosic mandates in future years, but noted the industry's progress and growth potential. EPA found insufficient production capacity to meet the mandates from 2010 to 2013. The EPA found insufficient production capacity to meet cellulosic biofuel mandates from 2010 to 2013, and this situation is likely to continue in 2014. If future mandates are also unachievable, investment in biofuel refineries may be limited. The EPA's proposal to partially waive RFS requirements for 2014 could hinder biofuels production capacity investment. This could also impact corn demand and prices, affecting other markets."
