    "content": "The \"Small Business Payroll Protection Act of 2007\" regulates payroll tax deposit agents under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by adding a new section. The Secretary will establish a system for registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents, with a registration fee not exceeding $100. Agents can choose to submit a bond or quarterly certification, provide required disclosures, and face penalties for being unregistered. The section provides penalties for unregistered payroll tax deposit agents and those who fail to furnish required disclosures, with a maximum penalty of $10,000 for every 90 days of noncompliance. A payroll tax deposit agent is defined as a person providing payroll processing or tax services to employers with authority to access funds for tax deposits. The section outlines penalties for unregistered payroll tax deposit agents and noncompliance with required disclosures. It includes provisions for bonding requirements, with bond amounts ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 determined by the Secretary. Bond or security must be provided in a specified form with surety. The section outlines bonding requirements for payroll tax deposit agents, with surety prescribed by regulations. Evidence of the bond must be filed with the Secretary during registration and annual renewals. Quarterly certifications can be submitted by an independent third party based on specific criteria established by the Secretary. The payroll tax deposit agent must ensure that employer taxes are held separately, not used for operating costs, and properly paid to the government. Quarterly certification reports must be filed. The payroll tax deposit agent must file quarterly certification reports with the Secretary and disclose to clients their liability for employment taxes and verification mechanisms for tax deposits. The text discusses the requirements for payroll tax deposit agents, including the need for registration, making tax deposits on behalf of employers, filing tax returns, and accessing confidential tax information. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations to implement these provisions. The Secretary of the Treasury must minimize the burden on payroll tax deposit agents for quarterly certification. Payroll tax deposit agents are subject to penalties for failure to collect or pay over tax. The amendment imposes penalties under section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code, which cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. A conforming amendment changes the word \"taxpayer\" to \"person\" in the code. The construction clarifies that the amendment does not affect the interpretation of section 6672 before the enactment of the Act. The table of sections for chapter 77 is amended by adding a new item at the end to reflect the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. VERIFICATION OF ADDRESS CHANGE. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for verifying address changes. Effective dates for the amendments are specified. The Secretary will issue a notice confirming any address change for employers making tax payments, sent to both old and new addresses. Effective 180 days after enactment."
