    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Legislative Data Transparency and Public Access Act of 2010\". Since its launch in 1995, the THOMAS website has provided free public information on Federal legislation. With the evolution of the Internet into Web 2.0, there is a push for open source information reuse through collaboration and data standardization. Allowing the public to download THOMAS's legislative data will enhance transparency and make Congress proceedings easier to follow, as recommended by the Open House Project in 2007. The Open House Project recommended that Congress provide a database of bill status and summary information accessible through the Library of Congress. Six states already publish state legislation status in a structured data format. Congress should work towards improving public access to all THOMAS data, including legislation text, in bulk. The Open House Project recommended improving public access to legislative data, including bulk legislation text. The Librarian of Congress, in consultation with other officials, will make bulk legislative summary and status data available to the public through the Internet in a searchable, sortable, and downloadable manner, free of charge and in a structured format. The Librarian of Congress provides bulk legislative data free of charge, continuously updated, and includes information on Members of Congress, committee assignments, and ZIP Codes. Standards are developed prior to data release. Congress, in consultation with relevant individuals, will develop and update standards for data downloading and public availability as deemed appropriate by the Librarian of Congress. The Advisory Committee on Thomas is established. The Advisory Committee on THOMAS is established in the Library of Congress with 16 members appointed by the Librarian of Congress, including individuals with expertise in legislative access, Internet technology, and government information. The Advisory Committee on THOMAS, established in the Library of Congress, consists of 16 members appointed by the Librarian of Congress with expertise in legislative access, Internet technology, and government information. Members serve a 3-year term and appointments must be made within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. The Advisory Committee members serve for 3 years without compensation but receive travel expenses. Vacancies are filled as per original appointment method. The Librarian of Congress provides necessary support for the Committee. The Advisory Committee meets regularly to review progress on data availability and provide advice to the Librarian of Congress. They submit reports with recommendations to the House and Senate committees."
