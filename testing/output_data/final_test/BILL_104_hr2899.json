The Congress acknowledges the importance of maintaining the Nevada Test Site for national security reasons and research and development of emerging technologies. The Nevada Test Site is crucial for national security and the development of emerging technologies in the 21st century. It supports technology development for both private-sector and military projects, nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship, nonproliferation efforts, and technological competitiveness. Additionally, it provides infrastructure for testing environmentally demanding projects and maintains readiness for the nuclear arsenal. The Nevada Test Site supports testing of environmental clean-up technologies, alternative energy sources, disarmament activities, and non-proliferation experiments. The Nevada Test Site is well-suited for various activities related to the restructuring of the US military, including treaty-compliant experiments for stockpile stewardship, non-proliferation, counter-proliferation, and counter-terrorism activities. The Nevada Test Site is suitable for activities related to restructuring the US military, including treaty-compliant experiments for stockpile stewardship, non-proliferation, counter-proliferation, and counter-terrorism. The purposes of these activities are outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to ensure operational readiness of the Nevada Test Site's nuclear testing facilities, maintain funding levels, establish a National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence for various purposes, and allow private-sector industries to utilize the site. The Act aims to maintain the readiness capability of the Nevada Test Site's nuclear testing facilities. The authorization of appropriations for maintaining the operational readiness of the underground nuclear testing facilities at the Nevada Test Site is specified, with a minimum amount set based on the 1992 appropriation. The Secretary of Energy is required to maintain staffing levels at the site sufficient for carrying out activities under the Act. The Secretary of Energy is required to maintain staffing levels at the Nevada Test Site to carry out activities under the Act. Infrastructure assessments and activities necessary for new projects at the site will be conducted by the Nevada Test Site Operations Office. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence is established. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence is established within the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site. Its purpose is to promote disarmament, demilitarization, alternative and renewable energy sources, nonproliferation and counter-proliferation of nuclear weapons, sensor development, and environmentally sensitive technologies. Activities include testing and demonstrating solar and geothermal resources, as well as developing alternative and renewable energy sources. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site aims to develop two 100-megawatt solar power plants by 2000. It also conducts a National Alternative-Fueled Vehicles Program to showcase the use of natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen as vehicle fuels. Additionally, the Center carries out activities related to disarmament and demilitarization, including demilitarization of rocket motors and conventional ordnance, assisting in disarmament efforts, and testing nonmilitary applications of technologies. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site focuses on developing solar power plants and alternative-fueled vehicles. It also conducts activities related to disarmament and demilitarization, including testing and demonstration activities for nuclear stockpile stewardship. This involves experiments to monitor compliance with international agreements on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, supporting the Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex, and developing simulator technologies for nuclear weapons design and effects. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site conducts experiments related to nonproliferation and counter-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as testing environmental technologies. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site focuses on the development of environmental technologies, including remediation of toxic chemicals and training for emergency response to hazardous accidents. The Center may also test and demonstrate other technologies as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act for fiscal year 1997 are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy, except as provided in section 4."
