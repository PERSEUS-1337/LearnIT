Congress finds that employees working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons programs were exposed to radiation and placed in harm's way without their knowledge or consent, sacrificing their health for national defense. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA) was enacted to provide compensation for beryllium- and radiation-related health conditions for workers involved in nuclear weapons production and testing programs. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA) provides compensation for workers exposed to radiation at nuclear weapons facilities. Congress designated certain atomic weapons employees at specific sites as members of the Special Exposure Cohort due to inadequate monitoring and record-keeping of radiation exposure. The Nevada Test Site played a crucial role in the United States' nuclear defense capabilities during the Cold War and beyond. President Truman designated it as the country's nuclear proving grounds in 1950, leading to numerous nuclear tests conducted there until 1992. The site remains a key location for research, testing, and development of nuclear defense technologies. The Nevada Test Site is crucial for the nation's defense capabilities, but there are challenges in accurately estimating radiation doses for workers due to incomplete radionuclide lists, inability to estimate dose from exposure to certain particles, and gaps in environmental data. NIOSH has identified several issues with accurately estimating radiation doses for workers at the Nevada Test Site, including underestimated resuspension doses, incomplete exposure data, and lack of integrity in external dose records. Additionally, there are gaps in beta, neutron, and internal dose data, with exposure from underground tests being ignored. Several underground tests, including Bianca, Des Moines, Baneberry, Camphor, Diagonal Line, Riola, Agrini, Midas Myth, Misty Rain, and Mighty Oak, were conducted. Monitoring groups instead of individuals led to unreliable personnel monitoring. Amchitka Island, where only 3 underground nuclear tests occurred, is designated as a Special Exposure Cohort. Some Nevada Test Site workers were denied compensation under EEOICPA due to flawed calculations based on incomplete or incorrect records. SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM WORKERS IN SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT UNDER ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION PROGRAM. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include workers employed at the Nevada Test Site or similar sites in Nevada from 1950 to 1993 who were present during nuclear tests or involved in related work. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include workers employed at the Nevada Test Site from 1950 to 1993 who were present during radiation releases or worked in jobs monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation. Workers at the Nevada Test Site from 1950 to 1993 were monitored for ionizing radiation exposure using dosimetry badges or bioassay. Claims for compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 must be adjudicated within 30 days of filing."
