FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk:\nCongress findings include the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines by Imperial Japanese forces, the defense efforts of United States and Philippine Forces, and the actions of the 200th Coast Artillery Regiment in December 1941.

The soldiers from the United States and the Philippines surrendered due to starvation and lack of supplies. They were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care in the \"Bataan Death March\", where thousands died from various causes. Prisoner of war camps had appalling conditions, leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners. At Camp O'Donnell, nearly 400 prisoners died per day due to poor conditions. Between September 1942 and December 1944, American prisoners of war who survived the Bataan Death March were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan and then shipped north on \"hell ships\" for forced labor. Many died due to abysmal conditions, with nearly 1,800 American lives lost in the sinking of the Arisan Maru. The prisoners who survived the Bataan Death March endured mistreatment, malnutrition, and horrific conditions until their liberation in 1945. The veterans of Bataan, representing the best of America and the Philippines, formed support groups and were honored in memorials. The United States Navy named ships after the battle to honor their valor. Many survivors have since passed away. Many survivors of the Bataan Death March have passed away, but those who remain are honored for their courage and perseverance during World War II.
