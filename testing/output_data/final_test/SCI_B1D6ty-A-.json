    "content": "DANTE is a new method for training neural networks, specifically autoencoders, using alternating minimization instead of traditional backpropagation. It treats autoencoder training as a bi-quasi-convex optimization problem, working effectively with different activation functions. DANTE can handle multiple hidden layers and various network configurations, showing promising results in terms of training speed and performance on standard datasets. The recent success of backpropagation-based methods in deep learning has led to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, with a focus on training speed and performance. However, there is a need to explore options beyond backpropagation for neural network training. The recent success of backpropagation-based methods in deep learning has led to significant advancements in artificial intelligence. Despite advancements in novel architectures, the reliance on backpropagation remains. Reinforcement learning methods are gaining popularity but are limited in scope. Recent efforts have studied limitations of SGD-based backpropagation, including vanishing gradients and convergence issues. In recent years, progress has been made in non-convex optimization methods like iterated hard thresholding and alternating minimization for solving large-scale tasks. A new method called DANTE (Deep AlterNations for Training autoEncoders) uses quasi-convex optimization to train neural networks, specifically autoencoders, through alternating minimization. The single hidden-layer autoencoder is treated as a bi-quasiconvex optimization problem, allowing for an alternating optimization strategy using efficient solvers like normalized gradient descent and stochastic normalized gradient descent. The key contributions include viewing each layer of a neural network as applying generalized linear transformations and using the DANTE alternating minimization strategy to train the network efficiently. The text discusses the use of Stochastic Normalized Gradient Descent (SNGD) for quasi-convex optimization in DANTE for networks with sigmoidal activation functions. A limitation of SNGD is its inability to handle non-differentiable link functions like ReLU, which is overcome by introducing the generalized ReLU. This allows DANTE to train autoencoders with both differentiable and non-differentiable activation functions, showing faster convergence with the generalized ReLU function compared to sigmoidal activation. The text discusses the use of Stochastic Normalized Gradient Descent (SNGD) for quasi-convex optimization in DANTE for networks with sigmoidal activation functions. DANTE can be extended to train deep AEs with multiple hidden layers and provides competitive test errors, reconstructions, and classification performance. Backpropagation-based techniques are commonly used for training various neural networks. Recent years have seen the development of methods based on least-squares approaches to train neural networks, such as the Method of Auxiliary Constraints (MAC) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. These methods utilize quadratic penalties and least-squared parameter updates. However, there are no publicly available implementations or published training results for comparison. In contrast to least-squares methods like MAC and EM, Taylor et al. introduced a new approach using ADMM and Bregman iterations for distributed neural network training. Jaderberg proposed 'synthetic gradients' for more efficient parameter updates. This work focuses on training autoencoders with alternating optimization, quasi-convexity, and SNGD, showing promising results on various datasets. This is the first effort to use alternating principles to train neural networks. The text introduces the DANTE method for training neural networks with alternating principles and performance guarantees. It focuses on networks with a single hidden layer, introduces the SNGD algorithm, and discusses theoretical insights leading to the generalized ReLU activation function. It also explains how DANTE can be extended to deep networks with multiple hidden layers. A multi-layer neural network uses input activations to compute its own activations through nested layers. The network is trained by tuning weights to minimize a loss function, with a modified loss function for autoencoders. The methodology is first described for a single-layer autoencoder. The methodology for training autoencoders involves using a squared loss function and leveraging Generalized Linear Models with activation functions. This approach is extended to deep multi-layer autoencoders in later sections. The authors introduce the concept of Strict Locally Quasi-Convexity (SLQC) to solve Generalized Linear Model (GLM) problems effectively using techniques like SNGD. They show that GLMs with non-differentiable activation functions, such as a generalized Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), can also satisfy the SLQC property, allowing for the extension of the proposed alternating strategy, DANTE, to ReLU-based autoencoders. This approach is advantageous for efficiently solving sub-problems in the alternating setup. Stochastic Normalized Gradient Descent (SNGD) is a method used in the proposed alternating strategy, DANTE, which is not descent-based but an alternating-minimization strategy. SNGD is a stochastic version of Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD), where updates are based on gradients direction while ignoring magnitudes. SNGD is a stochastic version of NGD, where weight updates are based on individual training samples. Mini-batch SNGD applies updates at the end of each mini-batch, similar to mini-batch SGD. Algorithm 1 describes SNGD for a generic GLM problem, while Algorithm 2 outlines the proposed method, DANTE, for solving GLM problems using SNGD steps. The motivation for the alternating strategy in DANTE is based on solving problems using mini-batch SNGD. The approach involves defining locally quasi-convex functions and introducing a new activation function, the generalized ReLU, to ensure convergence to the optimum solution for GLMs. The text discusses the convergence of locally quasi-convex functions to the optimum solution for GLMs, introducing a new activation function and generalizing the concept to functions on matrices. It defines idealized and noisy GLMs based on global minimizers of error functions. The text introduces a new generalized ReLU activation function to study the convergence of locally quasi-convex functions in GLMs. This function is defined as differentiable at every point except 0, encompassing variants like leaky ReLU. The function g provides a valid subgradient for the generalized ReLU in GLMs, allowing the use of SNGD as an optimizer for training autoencoders with different activation functions. Theorem 3.4 states conditions for convergence in GLMs with generalized ReLU activation. The generalized ReLU function is b-Lipschitz, and the minimum value of the quasigradient of g is a key factor. The bounds on variables x i, w, w * are used in the problem setup. Theorem 3.5 discusses the convergence in the noisy GLM with generalized ReLU activation. The proof for Theorem 3.5 is included in Appendix A.1. The connection to a result from BID6 shows that SNGD converges to the optimum for SLQC functions and empirical objective functions induced by noisy GLM instances. The results show that SNGD provides provable convergence for noisy GLM problems with sigmoid and ReLU activation functions. Each node in the output layer presents a GLM problem w.r.t. corresponding weights. The entire layer is SLQC w.r.t. the weights by generalizing the definition to matrices. The generalized definition of SLQC to matrices allows for effective alternating minimization using SNGD in each step, converging to suboptimal solutions with high probability. The convergence rate depends on the \u03ba parameter, with an exponential improvement for the ReLU setting compared to sigmoid activation. This improvement impacts the number of iterations needed for convergence. The number of iterations in Theorem 3.6 for SNGD depends on \u03ba 2, showing accelerated convergence with generalized ReLU GLMs compared to sigmoid GLMs. A single hidden-layer autoencoder can be solved as SLQC problems using the DANTE method, which can be extended to deep autoencoders through a greedy layer-wise training approach. Each pair of layers in a deep stacked autoencoder can be trained as SLQC problem pairs using DANTE, resulting in a series of SLQC problem pairs for training the deep autoencoder. The proposed approach uses DANTE for deep autoencoders, with the possibility of using other schemes like a round-robin scheme. DANTE was validated by training autoencoders on various datasets, including an expanded MNIST dataset. Experiments were also conducted with multi-layer autoencoders and varying numbers of hidden neurons. The training process involves treating outer pairs of weights as single-layer autoencoders followed by inner single-layer autoencoders. The proposed approach utilizes DANTE for deep autoencoders, with a finetuning process similar to standard deep autoencoder training. Experiments on MNIST dataset were conducted using Torch 7, training single-layer autoencoders with sigmoid activation using DANTE and standard backprop-SGD. The experiments compared the performance of DANTE and backprop-SGD on training autoencoders with different activation functions. DANTE took slightly longer to converge but achieved better results than SGD. The experiments compared the performance of DANTE and backprop-SGD on training autoencoders with different activation functions. Trained using DANTE and backprop-SGD with Mean-Squared Error loss function, the results showed DANTE slightly outperforming backprop-SGD. Reconstructions by both models for autoencoder with Generalized ReLU activation were comparable. Feature representations learned using DANTE and SGD were studied, showing similar effectiveness. After training autoencoders with different activation functions, DANTE slightly outperformed backprop-SGD. The hidden layer representations extracted by DANTE were used to train a linear SVM, showing competitive performance. DANTE also demonstrated competitive performance on other standard datasets, showcasing its viability as an alternative to backprop-SGD. The effect of varying hyperparameters on the proposed solution was also studied. The study analyzed the impact of varying hyperparameters on autoencoders, specifically the number of hidden neurons in a single-layer autoencoder. Results showed that DANTE performed better with more hidden neurons, while SGD found a slightly better solution with fewer neurons. The experiments also included multi-layer autoencoders with leaky ReLU activations. The study analyzed the impact of hyperparameters on autoencoders, focusing on the number of hidden neurons.

Therefore, considering the noisy GLM, let v be a point close to the minima with specific conditions, and the subgradients of the activation function and the model are defined. The proof utilizes arguments similar to the idealized GLM, and the model is characterized by a linear operator and a non-linear activation function.

Future work will focus on studying the method for deeper autoencoders and analyzing performance bounds for the alternating minimization strategy. The text proves that a multi-output single-layer neural network is SLQC in W, followed by showing that a two-layer single-output neural network is SLQC in the first layer W1. Theorem A.3 introduces an idealized single-layer multi-output neural network characterized by a linear operator W and a generalized ReLU activation function \u03c6. The proof then continues from there. The proof for a two-layer neural network with linear operators and ReLU activation functions proceeds similarly to Theorem A.4, assuming certain conditions are met."
