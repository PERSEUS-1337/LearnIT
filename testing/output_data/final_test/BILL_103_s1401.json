The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States is authorized to receive and determine the validity and amounts of claims referred by the Secretary of State related to lump-sum payments from the UNCC or claims against Iraq outside UNCC jurisdiction. The Commission applies relevant UN Security Council and UNCC decisions, substantive law, and principles of justice and equity in deciding claims. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States decides non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, applying principles of justice and equity. The Commission follows the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 for claims, deducting any amounts received by the claimant from other sources for the same loss. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish funds for payment of claims under section 2(a) and 2(b). The funds shall receive transfers from the Secretary of State and allocations from assets of the Government of Iraq. These funds shall be invested in public debt. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate assets of the Government of Iraq in the United States to satisfy claims under section 2(b) and claims of the United States Government. Funds shall be allocated between the Iraq Claims Fund and other appropriate accounts for payment of claims. The Secretary of State will allocate funds from the UNCC to the UNCC Claims Funds and funds under section 2668a of title 22 of the United States Code. The program administration self-sufficiency is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary of the Treasury deducts 1\\1/2\\ per centum from funds under section 3 to reimburse government agencies for administering the Iraq claims program and this Act. The distribution of reimbursement is determined in consultation with relevant officials. Amounts received by government agencies for administering the Iraq claims program and this Act will be credited to the appropriate account and remain available for expenditure without fiscal year limitation. SEC. 5. PAYMENTS. The Commission certifies awards to the Treasury Secretary for payment in order of priority. Payments are made in increments of $10,000 or the award's principal amount, with additional payments of $90,000 when funds are available. Remaining balances are paid in proportion to the total amount owed. After certifying awards, payments are made in increments of $10,000 or the principal amount, with additional payments of $90,000 when funds allow. Remaining balances are paid proportionally to the total amount owed. Any funds left in a claims fund are transferred to another fund, except those received from the UNCC. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims. The payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. SEC. 6. RECORDS. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury can provide records to the Commission as needed. Records related to claims before the Commission and the UNCC cannot be disclosed to the public, except for certain decisions and filings. The UNCC procedures dictate that certain records from the Department of State, Department of Treasury, and the Commission can be made available on a case-by-case basis if deemed necessary for the interests of justice. Records from other Executive Branch agencies require approval before release. When releasing records from other Executive Branch agencies, the Commission must obtain approval from the originating agency. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 8. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNPAID CERTIFIED CLAIMS. After nine years of the last funds deposit into the UNCC Claims Fund(s) or Iraq Claims Fund, a notice will be published in the Federal Register listing unpaid certified claims. Any demand for payment on certified awards must be made within one year of the notice. Two years after the notice, any remaining unpaid claims and fund balances will be transferred to the Treasury's miscellaneous receipts."
