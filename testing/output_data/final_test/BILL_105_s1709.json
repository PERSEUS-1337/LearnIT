Congress recognizes the success of training programs with a pre-vocational component, the need for skills training for welfare recipients to transition to unsubsidized employment, the lack of federal laws addressing barriers to employment, and the need for federal support in developing pre-vocational training programs. The development of pre-vocational training programs focuses on improving job readiness, preparing individuals for employment, teaching appropriate skills, and placing them in permanent unsubsidized employment or skill training centers. Community-based organizations have successfully provided such programs to disadvantaged populations. Community-based organizations have demonstrated success in providing training programs to disadvantaged populations. They should receive additional Federal assistance to enhance their ability to reach communities with large populations of welfare recipients and expand their services to more welfare recipients.

A \"welfare recipient\" is an individual receiving assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. A \"welfare transition program\" is a vocational training program conducted by or at the direction of a State as part of a State program described in paragraph (2). The Secretary may grant funds to States for pre-vocational training programs for eligible individuals. Grants are for 1 year and States must submit a plan outlining the training programs. The State will ensure a community-based organization carries out pre-vocational training for incarcerated persons. Grants will consider needs of economically distressed urban and rural areas. SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. State grants under section 4 must be used to provide financial assistance to community-based organizations for pre-vocational training programs. The assistance period is one year. Community-based organizations receiving funds must use them for pre-vocational training programs for eligible individuals. The Act defines eligible individuals as welfare recipients enrolled in a transition program or eligible but not yet participated, and individuals incarcerated who will be released soon. Pre-vocational training programs for welfare recipients must be implemented by selected organizations. Pre-vocational training provided through job training centers aims to prepare individuals for employment by overcoming educational and cultural barriers, improving job readiness, and fostering a positive attitude towards work. Pre-vocational training aims to develop various skills such as learning, communication, computational, job seeking, literacy, and professionalism to prepare individuals for employment. Upon completion, individuals are placed in permanent unsubsidized employment or skill training centers. Pre-vocational training programs aim to provide skill training for quickly obtainable positions, leading to permanent unsubsidized employment. Selected organizations implement training programs in prisons for eligible individuals, offering placement services upon completion. The organization must provide 2 weeks to 3 months of pre-vocational training and not exceed $1200 in services for eligible individuals. No fees can be charged to citizens or resident aliens. Community-based organizations must coordinate placement services with local businesses to create job opportunities. Eligible organizations must submit an application to the State for financial assistance. To apply for financial assistance, eligible organizations must submit an application to the State as required by the Secretary. The Secretary will monitor program effectiveness by tracking participant employment outcomes and economic impact. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to implement the Act."
