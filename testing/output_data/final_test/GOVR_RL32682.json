The child poverty rate was 17.6%, higher than the historic low of 13.8% in 1969. Family circumstances and economic conditions play a role in child poverty, with single-parent households and minority children at higher risk. Having an adult breadwinner is crucial to prevent poverty among children. The economic well-being of children is closely tied to their parents' success in the labor market. Even with full-time work, some children still experience poverty, known as the working poor. Poverty negatively impacts children's life chances, leading to poor physical health, delayed cognitive development, and academic struggles. Poor adolescent girls are more likely to become teenage mothers, perpetuating a cycle of poverty across generations. While income poverty is a factor, it does not fully account for the challenges faced by poor children. Income poverty is not the sole reason for poor child outcomes. Other factors, such as chronic family problems, also play a significant role. While income support policies can help alleviate economic distress, additional social supports and fundamental changes in family circumstances are needed to improve children's prospects. Various programs in the U.S. aid children in low-income families, forming the nation's income/social safety net. Social Security and Unemployment Insurance provide payments for children of parents who paid payroll taxes but are now out of work. Social Security benefits are for children of deceased, disabled, or retired parents. Unemployment insurance benefits are temporary for workers who lost their job. Refundable tax credits supplement low earnings for parents. Cash welfare programs like TANF and SSI provide payments for needy children and parents, with TANF aiming to move parents into the labor market. TANF aims to move parents into the labor market through an income and assets test. Noncash welfare programs provide in-kind benefits and are means-tested. The government faces the challenge of promoting parents' work while preventing children from falling into poverty. In 2007, 12.8 million children lived in families below the poverty threshold, resulting in a child poverty rate of 17.6%. In 2007, children had a poverty rate of 17.6%, higher than the aged and nonaged adults. Child poverty correlates with family structure, size, race/ethnicity, and the educational attainment and age of the family head and spouse. This section provides a profile of child poverty in 2007, showing child poverty rates by various characteristics. The composition of child poverty by family structure has shifted since the 1960s, with a decrease in children living with two parents and an increase in children living with a single mother. The percentage of children living with neither parent also saw a slight increase. The share of children living with neither parent increased from 3% in the 1970s and 1980s to 4% in the 1990s. In 2007, child poverty rates varied by family type, with children in married-couple families having a lower poverty rate (8.5%) compared to those in single parent families. Female-headed families accounted for the majority of poor children (58.9%), followed by husband-wife families (34.0%) and male-headed families (7.1%). Policy discussions on child poverty often focus on children in female-headed families due to their higher poverty rates. In 2007, child poverty rates varied by family type, with children in single parent families, particularly female-headed families, having higher poverty rates. Children with mothers who never married are twice as likely to be poor compared to those whose mothers divorced. Children in families with never-married mothers account for a large share of poor children in female-headed families. Children in racial and ethnic minorities tend to have higher poverty rates than white children. In 2007, minorities had higher poverty rates than white children. African-American children had a poverty rate of 34.2%, 3.5 times higher than white children at 9.7%. Hispanic children had lower poverty rates than African-American children but higher rates than white children. Despite the differences, the populations of poor white, African-American, and Hispanic children were similar in size. Minority children in female-headed families also had higher poverty rates compared to white children. Minority children, particularly African-American and Hispanic children, have higher poverty rates compared to white children. African-American children make up the largest group of poor children in female-headed families, while Hispanic children are more likely to be in married-couple families. Hispanic children in married-couple families have a poverty rate higher than that of white or African-American children. Overall, Hispanic children account for the largest share of poor children in married-couple families. African-American children in female-headed families have higher poverty rates compared to those in married-couple families. Hispanic children in married-couple families also have higher poverty rates than white or African-American children. Children in families without earnings are almost certain to be poor, with a poverty rate of 70.0% in 2007. Even with a full-time working parent, about seven out of 100 children were still poor in 2007, totaling 4.2 million children. Children in families with a full-time, full-year worker account for a large share of all poor children, despite having a low poverty rate. The incidence of poverty is higher among children in families with a parent who works part-time. In female-headed families, children with a full-time working head have a lower poverty rate compared to those without an earner. In single, female-headed families without an earner, 76.2% of children were poor. The pie chart shows that 20.5% of poor children in these families had a mother who was a full-time worker, while 42.9% had a mother who did not work. Despite an increase in lone mothers working, 24.2% of children in female-headed families had a non-working mother. Comparatively, only 2.6% of children in married-couple families had neither adult working. The percentage of adults with a high school diploma or more has more than doubled from 1960 to 2007. The share of individuals with 4 or more years of college education tripled from 7.7% to 28.7%. The returns to education have increased over time, with job applicants needing postsecondary credentials. Child poverty rates are linked to the educational level of the family head. In 2007, almost half of children in families where the head had not completed high school were poor. In 2007, child poverty rates were linked to the educational level of the family head. Children in families where the female head had an associates degree had a poverty rate of 24.6%, compared to 35.5% for those with some post-secondary education but no degree. Poverty rates were lowest at 13.9% for children with female heads who had a bachelors or advanced degree. Child poverty rates are highest in young families with children, with a 20.8% poverty rate for preschool children and a 16.0% poverty rate for older children in 2007. Younger parents with less job experience tend to earn less, contributing to this trend. Child poverty rates tend to mirror the \"life-cycle\" pattern of earnings of adults, with earnings peaking in middle age and declining as adults approach retirement age. Children in families with a never-married female head or a young head/spouse under age 25 have the highest poverty rates, almost 50%. Child poverty rates drop below the average rate for all children for age groupings with the head/spouse over 35, but are about the same as the overall rate for children in families with a head/spouse age 65 and older. The relationship between child poverty and age of the family's adults tends to hold for children in female-headed families as well. In female-headed families, children with younger parents have the highest poverty rates. Poverty rates for children in these families are higher than for all related children across all age categories of the family head. Approximately one out of every four poor children has a parent born outside the United States, with a higher poverty rate of 26.8% compared to 15.7% for children with native-born family heads. Children born in the U.S. are citizens regardless of their parents' citizenship status. Children have consistently had higher poverty rates than any other age group since 1974. The poverty rate among related children in families has varied from 13.8% to 26.9% since 1959. Child poverty rates have fluctuated from a peak of 26.9% in 1959 to a low of 13.8% in 1969, with a rate of 17.6% in 2007. Poverty rates for children in female-headed families have been consistently higher than those in male-present families. The poverty rate for the aged decreased from 35.2% in 1959 to 9.7% in 2007. Child poverty rates in female-headed families have shown cyclical variations since the 1982-1983 recession, likely due to increased labor force participation of women. Rates also exhibit secular patterns, with higher rates during the 1980s economic expansion. The 1996 welfare reform law led to a more pronounced drop in poverty rates for children in families headed by lone mothers. The child poverty rate was higher in families headed by lone mothers compared to those with a male present. The number of poor children fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of 15 million in 1993 and decreasing to 12.5 million in 2004. The number of related children under 18 also varied, dropping from 70 million in 1968 to 62 million in 1978 before rising again in 1988. The number of poor children fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of 15 million in 1993 and decreasing to 12.5 million in 2004. By 2007, the number of poor children had risen to 72.8 million, with a shift towards more children living in female-headed families since 1972. This change in family composition has contributed to higher overall child poverty rates. The adjusted child poverty rates in 2007 show that if family composition had remained the same as in 1960, the overall poverty rate would have been 12.6% instead of 17.6%. This adjustment would have resulted in an estimated 9.2 million poor children instead of the observed 12.8 million. In 2000, employment rates for single mothers with infants or toddlers increased significantly, surpassing those of married mothers. Similarly, single mothers with preschool age children also saw notable employment gains throughout the 1990s. Employment rates among single mothers have not fully recovered since the 2001 recession. Factors encouraging work include a strong economy in the 1990s, welfare program changes, EITC and minimum wage increases. TANF promotes work and personal responsibility by rewarding work and imposing sanctions for non-compliance. Increases in EITC and child care subsidies have incentivized single mothers to work, leading to an increase in job attachment and annual hours worked. Sanctions for non-compliance with work requirements have also been implemented in most states. For more details on trends in welfare and work for single mothers, refer to CRS Report RL30797. The employment rate among poor lone mothers has increased, with a corresponding rise in hours worked. In 1995, half of them did not work, but by 2000, half were working nearly 480 hours per year or more. The top 10% worked more hours, with a decline in hours worked from 2000 to 2005 for most, likely due to the 2001 recession. Hours worked have increased somewhat since 2005. The recession has impacted poor mothers' work attachment, with annual hours worked increasing somewhat since 2005 but still below the 2000 peak. Census Bureau data shows an increase in \"full-time work poverty\" among families with related children from 1987 to 2007. The rate of parents working full-time, full-year increased from 71.8% in 1987 to 79.8% in 2000, then declined to 77.4% in 2007. The percentage of poor children in families with one full-time, year-round worker rose from 19.6% in 1987 to 35.4% in 2000, before decreasing to 30% in 2003 and standing at 32.4% in 2007. The share of children in families with lone mothers who worked full-time year-round increased from 8.3% in 1987 to 21.6% in 2000, then fell to 16.6% in 2003, before rising again to 20.4% in 2007. The federal cash income support policy framework is based on the Social Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code, with a two-tier safety net established in the 1935 Act to provide social insurance benefits and means-tested payments to needy individuals. The Social Security Act established a two-tier safety net in 1935, providing social insurance benefits and means-tested payments to needy individuals. Categories of needy persons not expected to work include the aged, children with one able-bodied parent, and the blind. Over time, additional programs were added such as Survivors' Insurance, Disability Insurance, Medicare, SSI, Medicaid, and SCHIP. The welfare programs evolved over time to include work requirements and support for working poor parents through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC provides payments to parents whose credit exceeds their income tax liability, with 22.8 million tax filers claiming it in 2005. In tax year 2005, the EITC was claimed by 22.8 million tax filers, totaling $42.4 billion in credits. Child care subsidies have been expanded for families receiving cash welfare through various acts, with FY2008 appropriations totaling $5 billion. The federal child support enforcement program has shifted its role to facilitate income transfers to families with children, especially important for female-headed families. In FY2006, child support enforcement offices collected $24 billion, with funds allocated for TANF cash welfare families, former TANF cash welfare families, families receiving Medicaid, and families that never received TANF cash welfare. Social security provides comprehensive insurance for families with a worker who paid social security payroll taxes, offering cash benefits to dependents and survivors of retired or disabled workers. The goal is for work-related social insurance to reduce the need for cash relief to families in the future. Social insurance aims to reduce the need for cash relief to families by providing benefits to children and adult social security beneficiaries. In September 2008, 3.1 million children received social security payments, totaling nearly $1.5 billion per month. The federal-state unemployment insurance program also offers temporary benefits to eligible workers who are unemployed through no fault of their own. Unemployment benefits may be available for former welfare recipients who lose a job, but eligibility rules can present barriers. Studies show that most former cash recipients who find work eventually qualify for UI, but other conditions must be met, such as job loss through no fault of their own. In some states, up to 60% of those with monetary eligibility may be disqualified for other reasons. Before the Social Security Act in 1935, some states provided \"mothers' pensions\" for needy mothers to stay home and raise their children, mainly for paternal orphans. The Act later introduced federal funds to assist needy groups, including children with a deceased, incapacitated, or absent second parent through Aid to Dependent Children (ADC). Since the early 1960s, Congress has aimed to promote work and self-support of welfare families through work requirements, financial incentives, and services. The first work rule in 1961 applied to unemployed fathers on AFDC, conditioning benefits on acceptance of work. In 1967, Congress established the Work Incentive Program (WIN) for AFDC families, requiring states to assign able-bodied custodial parents to education and training programs. The law also provided financial rewards for AFDC parents who went to work by disregarding some earnings when calculating benefits. Congress later specified that states must assign all able-bodied custodial parents to WIN, except those with a preschool child under age six. In 1988, the Family Support Act lowered the age threshold for work exemption to three years old, requiring states to assign custodial parents to a new Jobs and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program, except those with a child under age three. In 1996, Congress replaced AFDC with the TANF block grant, requiring states to engage adult recipients in specified work activities. Single parents caring for a child under age one are exempt from work participation, and states can exclude them in their work participation rate calculations. States decide individual participation rules, and in June 2008, 3.0 million children were in families receiving cash benefits from TANF programs. In FY2006, federal and state spending on cash welfare benefits totaled $9.9 billion, down from a historic peak in 1994. Despite various government \"safety net\" programs, earnings remain the primary source of income for families with children. Child poverty rates in 2007 would have been 21.8% for all related children and 52.4% for children in female-headed families without cash income other than earnings. Official money income poverty rates were 17.6% for all related children and 43.0% for children raised by single mothers. The poverty-reducing contributions of cash from family effort and government transfers are shown in Figures 19 and 20. Official poverty rates are lower than market income poverty rates. Work and government income supports play a role in affecting child poverty rates, with work being the primary means of support for families with children. Factors such as parent(s)' education, work experience, and amount of work done during the year are correlated with child poverty rates. The poverty-reducing contributions of family effort and government transfers are significant. Factors like parents' education, work experience, and family type impact child poverty rates. Job advancement and higher wages are crucial for escaping poverty. Steady work, access to social insurance, and childcare arrangements are essential for moving families out of poverty. The social insurance tier of the safety net provides benefits based on earned rights, reducing poverty among families with children. However, it has not been updated to reflect changes in the economy and family structure. In contrast, programs targeted to low-income families have undergone significant transformation in the past 20 years. Cash welfare for low-income families has evolved over the past 20 years, with recipients now expected to work or engage in activities. Welfare reforms in the mid-1990s led to a decrease in cash assistance, shifting towards noncash benefits like Medicaid and food stamps. However, these programs provide uneven support and reduce benefits as recipients earn more, sometimes creating challenges. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) helps offset financial disincentives for poor families to work. It can supplement up to 40 cents on every dollar earned by low-income families. EITC payments are not included in official poverty statistics. Recent changes to taxes and benefits for low-income families aim to increase rewards for work. However, working parents, especially single parents, face financial risks due to job loss or illness, impacting their ability to support their children. Some families have no attachment to the labor force, posing policy dilemmas on balancing economic risk protection with rewarding work and supporting children. Recent changes to taxes and benefits for low-income families aim to increase rewards for work, while also addressing the financial risks faced by working parents, especially single parents. This poses policy dilemmas on balancing economic risk protection with supporting children in families without a worker."
