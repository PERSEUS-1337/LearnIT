    "content": "The Navy's desire to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (CVN) at Mayport, FL has faced funding challenges. The proposed budgets for FY2013 and FY2014 did not allocate funds for Military Construction (MilCon) projects required for this purpose. Despite the deferral of the plan in the FY2013 budget, the Navy remains committed to strategically dispersing CVNs on each coast. The Navy's desire to homeport a CVN at Mayport is currently deferred due to fiscal constraints. Transferring a CVN from Norfolk to Mayport would shift local economic activity worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The Navy has 10 operational CVNs, with plans to return to 11 by late 2015 with the entry into service of the new CVN Gerald R. Ford. The Navy has six Pacific Fleet CVNs homeported at Everett, WA, Bremerton, WA, San Diego, CA, and Yokosuka, Japan, while the four Atlantic fleet CVNs are all homeported at Norfolk, VA. The Navy replaced older conventionally powered carriers with new CVNs since the 1960s, achieving an all-CVN carrier force in 2009. The last operational CV in the Pacific Fleet was the Kitty Hawk, homeported in Yokosuka, and in the Atlantic Fleet was the John F. Kennedy, decommissioned in 2007. The USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) was decommissioned on August 1, 2007, after being homeported at Mayport. Norfolk is the Navy's largest Atlantic Fleet home port with about 65 ships of various types stationed there. Little Creek, VA, serves as a home port for six amphibious ships. Mayport, located in northeast Florida, is roughly 469 nautical miles south-southwest of Norfolk. Mayport, near Jacksonville, is the Navy's second-largest Atlantic Fleet home port with about 16 CGs, DDGs, and FFGs homeported there. It is envisioned as the primary homeport for the Navy's new Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs). Mayport has also served as a CV home port and was the home port for the USS John F. Kennedy until its decommissioning in 2007. Mayport, a Navy home port near Jacksonville, has previously housed two CVs and is now home to about 16 CGs, DDGs, and FFGs. The Navy plans to upgrade Mayport to accommodate a CVN, including dredging and building nuclear propulsion plant maintenance facilities, as part of establishing a second Atlantic Fleet CVN home port. The Navy plans to establish a second Atlantic Fleet CVN home port at Mayport, Florida, to mitigate risks and enhance security. The decision was endorsed in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, with plans to upgrade the port to accommodate a CVN. Admiral Jonathan Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations, discussed homeporting a CVN at Mayport with Members of Congress from Florida and Virginia. He emphasized the strategic dispersal of the CVN Fleet and the rationale behind the decision, as outlined in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The Secretary of Defense-led 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review necessitates a comprehensive strategic review due to fiscal adjustments. Admiral Greenert discussed homeporting a CVN in Mayport with Members of Congress, emphasizing strategic dispersal and fiscal challenges. The rationale for dispersing the East Coast Carrier Fleet remains sound, supported by the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. Fiscal adjustments require a comprehensive strategic review, including funding for homeporting a CVN in Mayport. Plans to transfer a CVN to Mayport were delayed due to funding constraints. The Navy's rationale for homeporting a CVN at Mayport in FY2010 was to disperse the East Coast Carrier Fleet to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads Area affecting carrier operations. This decision aligns with the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review's direction to make Naval Station Mayport a nuclear carrier-capable homeport. The Navy decided to upgrade Naval Station Mayport to homeport a CVN to maintain aircraft carriers in case of disasters in the Hampton Roads area. This decision aligns with the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review's direction for strategic dispersal on the East Coast. The national security benefits outweigh the costs, as stated in the January 2009 ROD document. The decision to upgrade Naval Station Mayport to homeport a CVN was based on the Navy's expertise and the need to hedge against catastrophic events. The consolidation of CVN capabilities in the Hampton Roads area poses unique risks, as all five Atlantic Fleet CVNs are homeported there with maintenance infrastructure. This contrasts with the Pacific Fleet CVNs, which are spread among three homeports, providing strategic options in case of a disaster. The Navy's decision to transfer a CVN to Mayport was based on strategic analysis and cost considerations. The Hampton Roads area is the only location in the U.S. capable of CVN construction and refueling, housing all Atlantic Fleet CVNs and trained crews. There are no alternative strategic options for Atlantic Fleet CVNs outside of Hampton Roads in case of a catastrophic event. The Navy's desire to transfer a CVN to Mayport was informed by a strategic laydown analysis, an FEIS on homeporting surface ships at Mayport, and an analysis of costs associated with homeporting ships. The Navy's strategic analysis projected a future fleet of 313 ships, with 11 CVNs. 181 ships, including 6 CVNs, were assigned to the Pacific Fleet, and 132 ships, including 5 CVNs, were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Homeporting capacity was measured in terms of pier space and cruiser equivalents. The Navy's analysis determined a need for 13 CGEs of surface ship homeporting capacity on the Atlantic Coast, excluding Norfolk and Little Creek. A Final Environmental Impact Statement in 2008 explored 12 alternatives for homeporting additional surface ships at Mayport, including options for accommodating a CVN. The Final Environmental Impact Statement in 2008 explored 12 alternatives for homeporting additional surface ships at Mayport, including options for accommodating a CVN. The Navy's preferred alternative was to transfer a CVN to Mayport as a hedge against potential damage to CVN homeporting facilities in Virginia. The Department of the Navy has chosen Alternative 4 as its Preferred Alternative for homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport in Virginia. This decision was influenced by impact analysis, cost estimates, and strategic dispersal considerations to reduce risks to fleet resources in various scenarios. The United States Navy's aircraft carriers are crucial assets for national interests, providing deterrence and combat support. Five of the 11 carriers are assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, with homeporting at NAVSTA Mayport dispersing assets to enhance operational readiness. The Navy estimated costs for homeporting additional ships at Mayport, with the initial cost of transferring a carrier estimated at $565 million in 2008. The Navy updated the estimated cost of homeporting a CVN at Mayport to $589.7 million in February 2010. This estimate includes additional recurring costs of $25.5 million annually in CY10 dollars, mainly for Base Operating Support, Operations, and travel expenses. The estimated cost of homeporting a CVN at Mayport includes Base Operating Support, Operations, travel expenses, and maintenance costs. The Navy announced the transfer of an amphibious ready group from Norfolk to Mayport in 2013 and 2014. Basic Allowance for Housing is expected to show annual savings of $1.6M. The Navy announced the accelerated arrival of the Mayport ARG, including the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima, by 2015 to maintain the Jacksonville fleet concentration area and surge capability. Secretary of the Navy Mabus emphasized the importance of Mayport for national defense. At a press briefing with Admiral Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations, plans for ship movements were discussed. Admiral Greenert discussed the recent movement of ships to Mayport, including the dredging of the harbor to make it carrier capable. Upgrades to the pier will enable carrier visits and maintenance, paving the way for future ship arrivals. The budget constraints prevent a carrier move to Mayport currently, but strategic dispersal is still crucial. Homeporting a CVN can boost the local economy through crew spending, Navy purchases, and maintenance expenditures. Homeporting a CVN at Mayport would bring significant economic benefits, including 2,900 more jobs, $220 million in direct payroll, $208 million in disposable income, and $10 million in local tax contributions. Reports indicate that losing an aircraft carrier in Norfolk resulted in a $450 million loss in payroll and 8,200 jobs. Additionally, a carrier in Norfolk creates 11,000 jobs and $650 million in economic activity annually. In Jacksonville, a new carrier would generate 3,190 military jobs and inject $500 million into the local economy each year. Homeporting a CVN at Mayport would bring significant economic benefits, including 2,900 more jobs, $220 million in direct payroll, $208 million in disposable income, and $10 million in local tax contributions. The Navy estimated that the initial $426 million in military construction work at Mayport would generate a total of $671 million in initial economic activity. The FY2010 budget provided $46.3 million in MilCon funding for channel dredging at Mayport to support the ability of a CVN to enter Mayport on a temporary basis. The conferees authorize funding for dredging at Naval Station Mayport to allow an aircraft carrier to enter temporarily, regardless of the final decision on homeporting. This funding is not a sign of support for establishing an additional homeport for nuclear aircraft carriers on the east coast. The conferees authorize funding for dredging at Naval Station Mayport to allow an aircraft carrier to enter temporarily. The funding is solely for transient port use, and any potential designation of Mayport as a nuclear carrier homeport will require future authorizations. The Navy requested $2 million for a CVN home port project in FY2011, with a total appropriation of $119.81 million for MilCon planning and design activities. The Navy's FY2012 budget included $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements project, part of the plan for establishing a CVN home port at Mayport. The Navy requested $2 million for a CVN home port project at Mayport in FY2011. The FY2012 funding approved $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project and $84.36 million for planning and design activities. The Navy's proposed FY2013 budget deferred the plan to homeport a CVN at Mayport due to fiscal constraints, despite the merit of the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project for Naval Station Mayport, Florida. The FY2013-FY2017 Future Years Defense Plan contained no funding for the homeporting project. The Navy remains committed to strategically dispersing CVNs on each coast. The Navy's proposed FY2014 budget does not include funding for homeporting a CVN at Mayport due to fiscal constraints. Members of Congress from Florida and Virginia have differing views on the benefits and costs associated with the proposal. The Navy's proposed FY2014 budget does not include funding for homeporting a CVN at Mayport due to fiscal constraints. Members of Congress from Florida and Virginia have differing views on the benefits and costs associated with the proposal. Implementing the proposal could achieve greater benefits if spent on other Navy priorities. Key questions for Congress include the risk of a catastrophic event damaging Atlantic Coast CVN homeporting facilities and the operational impact on the Navy. In considering the Navy's desire to transfer a CVN to Mayport, Congress may need to assess specific issues such as basing decision process, strategic laydown analysis, costs for homeporting, transit times, vulnerability to catastrophes, and alternative uses of funding. The Navy's basing decision process is a key issue for Congress to consider. A GAO report highlighted that the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force have comprehensive basing decision processes, but the Navy requires additional guidance for its process to be complete. The Navy's basing decision process lacks detailed information and clear guidance on specific actions and responsibilities for completing analyses. The Navy's Strategic Dispersal Flow Chart outlines considerations for basing decisions but does not specify how or by whom these analyses will be conducted. Additionally, there is a lack of explanation on how the Navy's five guidance documents are linked together in implementing the overall basing process. Comprehensive and clear guidance is needed for all aspects of the Navy's basing decisions. The Navy lacks comprehensive guidance for basing decisions, leading to potential issues with management control and stakeholder scrutiny. The Secretary of Defense has not established clear policies for managing basing decisions, hindering department-wide initiatives. The Office of the Secretary of Defense aims to promote joint sharing of DOD facilities but has not fully encouraged service consideration of this and other initiatives. The Secretary of Defense lacks comprehensive policy and oversight for domestic service basing processes, hindering department-wide initiatives. Congress may also consider the Navy's strategic laydown analysis projecting a future fleet distribution between the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets. The Navy is considering options for maintaining a fleet with fewer than 300 ships, including a 250-ship fleet with 10 aircraft carriers or a 240-ship fleet with 8 aircraft carriers. Supporters of homeporting all Atlantic Fleet CVNs at Norfolk argue that with fewer than 313 ships or 11 CVNs, there is less need to shift a CVN to Mayport. On the other hand, supporters of homeporting a CVN at Mayport believe that with a reduced fleet size, each ship or CVN represents a larger percentage of the Navy's overall capability, necessitating a hedge against a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads area.

On the other hand, supporters of homeporting a CVN at Mayport believe that with a reduced fleet size, each ship or CVN represents a larger percentage of the Navy's overall capability, necessitating a hedge against a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads area. Congress may consider factors such as the Navy's fleet apportionment between the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts, potential for \"breasting,\" and costs of increasing homeporting capacity at Norfolk through construction. Additionally, Congress may assess the accuracy of the Navy's estimated costs for homeporting a CVN at Mayport, which could impact the argument for homeporting a CVN at that location. The 2011 GAO report on the Navy's estimate of homeporting a CVN at Mayport stated that the total one-time cost is expected to be between $258.7 million and $356.0 million, while the Navy's estimate is $537.6 million. The largest difference is the cost of constructing new facilities at Mayport, with GAO estimating $70.5 million for the controlled industrial facility. The Navy did not conduct a risk analysis on its costs. The Navy estimates the construction costs for the controlled industrial facility at $70.5 million and for the ship maintenance support facilities at $45.6 million. The difference in estimates with GAO is due to increased costs for protecting buildings from potential storm surges. GAO used adjusted actual costs from similar projects, while the Navy used a detailed engineering estimate. Recurring costs are estimated to be between $9.0 million and $17.6 million per year, with the Navy's estimate falling within this range at $15.3 million per year. The Navy's estimate of $15.3 million per year for homeporting a nuclear aircraft carrier at Mayport is within GAO's range but lacks comprehensive, accurate, and well-documented details. The estimate did not fully describe cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions, lacked a risk and uncertainty analysis, and had minimal step-by-step description of how it was developed. The Navy's estimate for homeporting a nuclear aircraft carrier at Mayport lacks comprehensive details, including a sensitivity analysis and comparison to an independent cost estimate. This hampers the Navy's ability to present a convincing argument of the estimate's affordability and answer questions from decision makers and oversight groups. The Navy's estimated range for one-time costs is provided in a table, with a low value of $258.7 million (10% chance) and a high value of $356.0 million (90% chance). The report also compares the Navy's estimate to a 65% confidence level estimate in base year 2010 dollars. The report compares estimated recurring costs between the GAO and Navy, showing a range at an 80% confidence interval. The estimated range is $9.0 million to $17.6 million, with the Navy's estimate falling within this range. The report compared estimated recurring costs between the GAO and Navy, showing a range at an 80% confidence interval of $9.0 million to $17.6 million. The Navy's ability to produce a comprehensive, accurate, well-documented, and credible cost estimate for homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport will continue to be hampered until certain fundamental changes are made to the process used to develop, document, and update the overall estimate of Mayport homeporting costs. The Navy's cost estimate for homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Mayport lacks detailed documentation, sensitivity analysis, and risk assessment. Without these elements, the Navy cannot justify the estimate's affordability, identify major cost drivers, or quantify risk and uncertainty. This hinders Congress's ability to make informed decisions about the projected costs of the homeporting project. The Navy's cost estimate for homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Mayport lacks detailed documentation, sensitivity analysis, and risk assessment. Recommendations for improving the Navy's cost estimate include incorporating best practices for developing a high-quality cost estimate, such as including all potential recurring costs and clearly describing ground rules and assumptions. The Navy should thoroughly document the life-cycle costs associated with homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport to improve quality and transparency. They should assign a single office to assemble a comprehensive and well-documented cost estimate, including sensitivity and risk analysis to identify major cost drivers and potential cost variations. The GAO report highlighted the major cost drivers and the level of confidence in the estimate. Congress may also consider the Navy's assessment of transit times to key overseas operating areas. The Navy's assessment of transit times to key overseas operating areas, including the Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf, Cape of Good Hope, and Puerto Rico, at different speeds. Congress may also consider the Navy's evaluation of vulnerability-related factors at Norfolk and Mayport. The Navy's assessment of port vulnerability factors includes the concentration or dispersion of Navy ships, with Pacific Fleet CVNs in three separate locations and Atlantic Fleet CVNs in Norfolk. Hurricanes were the main natural disaster analyzed by the Navy. The Navy analyzed hurricanes as the main natural disaster in comparing the risk at Hampton Roads and Mayport. They assessed that the hurricane risk to Norfolk is similar to Jacksonville and Mayport. Potential man-made disasters include shipping accidents, military attacks, and terrorist attacks. During the Cold War, the Navy was concerned about conventional military attacks on U.S. home ports by Soviet forces, such as covert mining or cruise missile strikes. The Navy's strategic homeporting program in the 1980s dispersed ships away from major home ports due to concerns of conventional military attacks by Soviet forces. The end of the Cold War led to a reconsideration of the program. China's military modernization raises potential concerns for Pacific Fleet home ports. The terrorist attack on the USS Cole in 2000 highlighted the vulnerability of Navy ships in foreign ports. The Navy conducted vulnerability assessments for U.S. port areas following the USS Cole attack in 2000 and 9/11. Assessments for Norfolk and Mayport between 2006-2008 are classified. Statistics on shipping volumes at Norfolk and Jacksonville were used to measure the relative risk of man-made disasters. In 2006, Norfolk saw 2.05 million cargo containers and 16.6 million tons of cargo, while Jacksonville had 768,200 cargo containers and 8.31 million tons. The port of Jacksonville handled 8.31 million tons of cargo. The Navy uses risk management principles for decision-making on the placement of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers on the East Coast. No unique risk assessment is conducted for carriers at naval installations. The Navy does not conduct unique risk assessments for its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at naval installations. Instead, these carriers are considered high-value assets included in the Navy's overall risk management process. Risks such as emerging threats from hostile nation-states are analyzed at the strategic level by the Office of the Secretary of the Navy and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations headquarters staff. The Navy has been using a strategic laydown and dispersal methodology since 2004 to divide its force structure and assets between the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Adjustments to this split may be made based on direction from the President and DOD's defense strategic guidance to rebalance defense assets in the Pacific. The Navy's risk management includes threat assessments for naval installations and high-value assets like nuclear-powered aircraft carriers since the 2000 and 2001 terrorist attacks. The Coast Guard has provided escorts for these assets, and communication of threat information occurs among stakeholders in the Hampton Roads Regional Threat Working Group. The Navy has improved threat information sharing among stakeholders in the Hampton Roads Regional Threat Working Group in Virginia. Actions have been taken to mitigate risks associated with homeporting nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at East Coast naval installations. Vulnerabilities at naval installations, including the risk of terrorist attacks, are assessed through annual antiterrorism vulnerability assessments. Compliance with DOD's antiterrorism standards is evaluated during these assessments. During site visits at Naval Stations Mayport, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia, 32 antiterrorism standards were implemented, including vulnerability assessments conducted annually. Mitigation action plans were developed to reduce risks and protect assets, such as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The installation commander selects the most effective course of action to mitigate vulnerabilities. Naval Stations Mayport and Norfolk conduct four integrated training events each year to enhance emergency management and fire protection skills. The training exercises focus on enhancing emergency management, fire protection, and force protection skills. Congress may consider factors like private ship repair firms' ability to support maintenance, cost impacts of aircraft carrier homeporting at Mayport, and the interaction of base facilities with other military facilities. Mayport has a diverse vendor base for maintenance services. Mayport's diverse vendor base provides maintenance services for fleet units and installations. Private-sector shipyards in Mayport have the capabilities for non-nuclear maintenance and modernization on various ship classes, including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. No additional specialized capabilities are needed from the private sector in northeast Florida for nuclear-powered aircraft carrier maintenance. The private-sector in Mayport has experience supporting large aircraft carrier availabilities and is capable of meeting the maintenance requirements of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Northeast Florida has three master ship repair firms certified by the Navy for this purpose. Private ship repair firms in northeast Florida have the capability to support the maintenance requirements of U.S. Navy surface ships, including aircraft carriers. These firms have demonstrated their ability to support carrier maintenance, with the largest aircraft carrier availability outside of a public shipyard completed on the USS John F. Kennedy in Mayport in 2003. The Navy revised its estimate of annualized workforce-related costs for these firms in 2010. The Navy revised its estimate of annualized workforce-related costs from $18 million to $8.2 million after discussions and identifying more accurate assumptions. An independent cost estimate put the recurring costs at $10.6 million with a 65% confidence interval, ranging from $5.5 million to $14.1 million due to a risk analysis. The Navy's cost-estimating procedures met best practices to various degrees, including comprehensive inclusion of workforce-related costs. However, they lacked risk and sensitivity analyses and an independent cost estimate. The Navy has not identified potential effects on readiness or workforce-related mitigation strategies for a proposed move years away, but officials mentioned strategies outlined in the U.S. Navy Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan. The Navy's plan outlines strategies to address risks to readiness, including workforce management for aircraft carrier maintenance. They will implement these strategies 4 to 5 years before moving the carrier to Mayport. Officials believe they can meet travel requirements for workers and find skilled staff for maintenance work at Mayport without challenges. The traveling workforce's performance in remote maintenance exceeds that of non-traveling workers. Congress may need to address this issue. The Navy's plan addresses risks to readiness, including workforce management for aircraft carrier maintenance. Congress may consider the adequacy of the FEIS prepared by the Navy for locating a nuclear carrier at Mayport, questioning if all impacts were thoroughly assessed. Potential options for homeporting additional ships at Mayport beyond the 12 alternatives studied in the FEIS may also be considered. The Navy's plan addresses risks to readiness, including workforce management for aircraft carrier maintenance. Congress may consider the adequacy of the FEIS prepared by the Navy for locating a nuclear carrier at Mayport, questioning if all impacts were thoroughly assessed. Potential options for homeporting additional ships at Mayport beyond the 12 alternatives studied in the FEIS may also be considered, such as homeporting Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) or two CVNs at Mayport. The Navy's proposed budgets for FY2013 and FY2014 did not include funding for MilCon projects required to homeport a CVN at Mayport. The Navy deferred its plan to homeport a CVN at Mayport in FY2013, and the FYDP for FY2013-FY2017 also had no funding for MilCon projects for this purpose. The Navy remains committed to strategically homeporting a CVN at Mayport, despite the lack of specific funding in recent budgets. The Department of the Navy is committed to strategically dispersing CVNs on each coast, but there is a deferral due to fiscal constraints. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees recommended no funding for MilCon projects required to homeport a CVN at Mayport in the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act recommended no funding for MilCon projects specifically for homeporting a CVN at Mayport. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees also recommended no funding for such projects in Florida. The FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended no funding for MilCon projects specifically for homeporting a CVN at Mayport. The final FY2014 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act also provided no funding for these projects in Florida. The Navy's FY2012 budget requests $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements project as part of establishing a CVN home port at Mayport. The House Armed Services Committee recommends rejecting this funding and reducing the Navy's overall request for planning and design activities by $15 million. The Navy's FY2012 budget requests $84.36 million for planning and design activities, including $2 million for a CVN home port at Mayport. The House Armed Services Committee recommends reducing funding by $15 million, specifically targeting projects like the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements and construction activities at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. The committee recommends reducing funding for road improvements at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and planning efforts for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier homeport. They question the Navy's need for strategic homeporting, citing past decisions to close such locations. The construction costs for the Navy's recommendation exceed $500 million. The committee recommends reducing funding for road improvements at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and planning efforts for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier homeport. The costs to implement the Department of the Navy's recommendation exceed $500 million, including relocating nuclear capable shipyard workers. The committee believes building a redundant carrier homeport is not in the Government's best interest and recommends no funds for this project. Senate (S. 1867) recommends approving $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project. The Senate adopted S.Amdt. 1210 as part of its consideration of S. 1867, requiring a Navy analysis of stationing additional DDG-51 class destroyers at Mayport and a subsequent GAO assessment. The Secretary of the Navy must analyze the costs and benefits of stationing more DDG-51 class destroyers at Naval Station Mayport, Florida within a year. This includes considering the impact on the ship repair industrial base due to retiring FFG-7 class frigates and delays in Littoral Combat Ship deliveries. The report assesses the impact of stationing more DDG-51 class destroyers at Naval Station Mayport, Florida on the ship repair industrial base, considering the retirement of FFG-7 class frigates and delays in Littoral Combat Ship deliveries. The Comptroller General of the United States will provide an assessment to Congress within 120 days to determine compliance with best practices. The Navy's FY2012 request includes $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project and $84.36 million for planning and design activities. The committee directs the Comptroller General to analyze the Navy's plan for a second east coast homeport for an aircraft carrier, assessing strategic, fiscal, and operational risks. The report is due to the congressional defense committees by February 1, 2012. The conference report on H.R. 1540 recommends approving $14.998 million for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project and reducing $15 million for planning and design activities. The project is deemed important for Naval Station Mayport, Florida, regardless of a nuclear powered aircraft carrier being home ported there. The report requires the Secretary of the Navy to assess the costs and benefits of stationing additional DDG-51 class destroyers at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, considering the impact on the ship repair industrial base due to the retirement of FFG-7 class frigates and procurement delays of the Littoral Combat Ship. The report requires the Secretary of the Navy to assess the costs and benefits of stationing additional DDG-51 class destroyers at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, considering the impact on the ship repair industrial base due to the retirement of FFG-7 class frigates and procurement delays of the Littoral Combat Ship. This includes a decrease in workload, updated consideration of life extensions of FFG-7 class frigates, and the possibility of bringing additional surface warships to Naval Station Mayport for maintenance to spread the ship repair workload amongst various public and private shipyards. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the report's compliance with best practices. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommend approving the Navy's FY2012 requests for MilCon funding for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project and planning/design activities. H.R. 2055 became a consolidated appropriations act incorporating nine bills, including Military Construction and Veterans Affairs for FY2012. The conference report on H.R. 2055 / P.L. 112-74 approves the Navy's FY2012 requests for MilCon funding for the Massey Avenue Corridor Improvements Project and planning/design activities. The Navy requested $14.998 million for the project and $84.36 million for planning and design activities. In FY2011, the Navy requested $120.05 million for MilCon planning and design activities, including $2 million for a CVN home port at Mayport. The Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 1473) of the 112th Congress provides $3,303.611 million for Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps, which is $575.493 million less than the requested amount. The FY2011 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5822/S. 3615) recommends $123.75 million for MilCon planning and design activities in the House report and $124.148 million in the Senate report. The Committee recommends a $4.098 million increase to the Navy's FY2011 request for MilCon planning and design activities. The report does not discuss homeporting a CVN at Mayport. H.R. 5136 prohibits funds for establishing a homeport for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. The committee is concerned about underestimating the costs of homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Mayport, Florida, which could lead to budgetary risks. The GAO is required to submit a report on the total costs by February 15, 2011. The Secretary of the Navy is also directed to report on homeporting alternatives at Naval Station Mayport. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to report to congressional defense committees by December 15, 2010, on the implementation and costs of homeporting alternatives at Naval Station Mayport, including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, Littoral Combat Ships, non-nuclear options, and other appropriate options. The report will assess operation and maintenance requirements, military construction needs, and benefits to the northeast Florida ship maintenance industrial base. The committee is concerned about the rising costs of homeporting a nuclear aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport, which could reach $1 billion. They suggest considering non-nuclear surface combatants as a more cost-effective option and believe it could enhance the ship maintenance industrial base in northeast Florida. Naval Station Mayport already has the infrastructure to support non-nuclear ships. The committee suggests considering non-nuclear surface combatants as a cost-effective option for homeporting at Naval Station Mayport, which already has the necessary infrastructure. The maintenance requirements for non-nuclear ships align better with the local ship repair industrial base expertise. A nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Mayport would only undergo two out of four types of scheduled maintenance, with the remaining maintenance requiring a temporary shift in homeport to Norfolk. The committee suggests considering non-nuclear surface combatants for homeporting at Naval Station Mayport to avoid additional requirements on carrier crews and their families. The report raises concerns about the impact of depot-level workload at Mayport on the nuclear propulsion depot maintenance workforce. The committee is concerned about the impact of homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport on the ship maintenance industrial base and readiness of the U.S. nuclear power-plant depot maintenance workforce. The Navy's recommendation could result in relocating a critical warfighting asset to a region that may lack the necessary facilities for specialized repair and maintenance. The Navy's plan to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport raises concerns about the lack of trained workforce and facilities for maintenance. This could lead to additional costs and jeopardize existing private ship maintenance capabilities in the region. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to provide a report on the private ship maintenance industrial base in northeast Florida's ability to support nuclear-powered aircraft carrier maintenance, potential costs, and workforce impacts. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit a report on the ability of the northeast Florida industrial base to support nuclear-powered aircraft carrier maintenance. The Comptroller General will assess the report's thoroughness, the industrial base's capabilities, and the impact of constructing maintenance facilities at NAVSTA Mayport. Additionally, the assessment will evaluate the potential costs of homeporting a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at NAVSTA Mayport. The FY2011 defense authorization bill does not address homeporting a CVN at Mayport. The joint explanatory statement on H.R. 6523 authorizes appropriations for military construction projects for the Navy and Marine Corps. The FY2011 defense authorization bill authorizes military construction and family housing projects for the Navy and Marine Corps, with an overall cost limitation. The agreement includes a provision from the House bill, with an amendment removing restrictions on architectural and engineering services and design funds. The lack of restrictions on these funds for establishing a homeport for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport, Florida does not imply a position for or against homeporting. The Navy's proposed FY2010 budget requested $46.303 million in MilCon funding for channel dredging at Mayport to support the ability of a CVN to enter Mayport. Additionally, $29.682 million was requested for repairing a wharf at Mayport, unrelated to supporting a CVN. In total, $75.985 million was requested for these projects. The House Armed Services Committee recommended rejecting the Administration's FY2010 request for $46.3 million in MilCon funding for channel dredging at Mayport, citing concerns about impacting a decision on basing an East Coast Nuclear Aircraft Carrier. The committee recommended a reduction of $46.3 million for this project. The committee directs the Comptroller General to report on the military basing decision process, specifically regarding the establishment of a second homeport for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier on the East Coast. Concerns are raised about the lack of strategic depth in the Navy's decision-making, particularly regarding the potential homeporting of additional surface ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. The cost implications and environmental impact of homeporting a nuclear aircraft carrier at NAVSTA Mayport are highlighted. The Navy's decision to dredge and dispose of 5.2 million cubic yards of material without a comprehensive process for assessing the need and impacts has raised concerns about increased costs and strategic implications. The committee has directed the Comptroller General to study how military services consider factors like force structure, strategic imperative, cost, and environmental impacts in basing decisions. The military services assess force structure and strategic imperatives when rebasing assets, considering risk assessments and strategic shifts in force posture. The Navy's decision on nuclear aircraft carrier homeporting weighed risks against meeting maintenance needs or fleet size requirements. The military services consider force structure and strategic imperatives when rebasing assets, weighing risks against maintenance needs or fleet size requirements. Senate Section 2201 of the FY2010 defense authorization bill recommended approving the Administration's request for a total budget. The Senate recommended approving the Administration's FY2010 request for MilCon projects at Mayport, including a channel dredging project. Section 114 of S. 1390 requires a report on a potential service life extension program for FFG-7 class frigates homeported at Mayport. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a report to Congress 90 days after the enactment of the Act, detailing a service life extension program for Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, a plan for achieving a 313-ship fleet, and the strategic plan for the Littoral Combat Ship to replace decommissioned frigates. The Navy is required to submit a report to Congress detailing plans for homeporting Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) to replace decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates. The report should also include how the Navy has supported the United States Southern Command through military engagements, exercises, and operations in the past five years. The Navy must submit a report to Congress outlining plans for homeporting Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) to replace Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates. The report should detail the strategic plan for homeporting LCSs on the East and West Coasts, including requirements, how they will be met, and the impact on potential ports. The conference report authorized $46.3 million for channel dredging at Naval Station Mayport, Florida to accommodate Littoral Combat Ships. This funding is part of the Administration's FY2010 request for infrastructure upgrades at homeports for the Navy's 313-ship program. The conference report authorized $46.3 million for channel dredging at Naval Station Mayport, Florida to accommodate Littoral Combat Ships. The Navy requested the project to allow a nuclear aircraft carrier to enter the station temporarily with an embarked air wing and full stores under any tidal conditions. Funding was authorized based on operational needs, not as an indication of support for establishing an additional homeport for nuclear aircraft carriers on the east coast. The funding for channel dredging at Naval Station Mayport, Florida was authorized to accommodate Littoral Combat Ships and allow a nuclear aircraft carrier to temporarily dock with full stores. Future authorization would be needed to designate Mayport as a nuclear carrier homeport. The Navy was required to submit a report on a potential service life extension program for the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates homeported at Mayport. The Secretary of the Navy must report on a service life extension program for Perry class frigates, including cost, schedule, and shipyards. The Navy's strategic plan for replacing these frigates with Littoral Combat Ships and procurement rates for the ships will also be analyzed. The Navy is required to report on the service life extension program for Perry class frigates and the procurement rates of Littoral Combat Ships to address capability gaps. The report also includes details on Navy deployments for military engagements, UNITAS exercises, and counterdrug operations in support of the United States Southern Command. The Navy is required to report on the strategic plan for homeporting the Littoral Combat Ship on the east and west coasts of the United States, including analysis of how it supports combatant command requirements and the effect on ports. The Navy must assess the impact of homeporting different types of Littoral Combat Ships on port infrastructure, including pier space availability, logistical and maintenance support services, and required investments in naval station infrastructure. Additionally, a graphical depiction of the planned ships berthing in pier areas at chosen naval facilities for homeporting Littoral Combat Ships in fiscal year 2020 must be provided. The report submitted to Congress in February 2010 outlined the berthing plan for Littoral Combat Ships at chosen naval facilities, including funding for channel dredging at Mayport. The FY2009 defense authorization bill required a report on the impacts of homeporting additional surface ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida before a decision could be made. The Administration's FY2010 request included $46.3 million for channel dredging at Mayport. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress analyzing the socio-economic impacts and economic justification for each location where a vessel is proposed to be removed for homeporting at Naval Station Mayport under the preferred alternative in the final environmental impact statement. If no preferred alternative is identified or if an alternative other than the preferred one is chosen, additional reports must be submitted. The FY2009 defense authorization bill did not include a provision for homeporting a vessel at Naval Station Mayport. The compromise version of the bill, signed into law as P.L. 110-417, also did not contain this provision. The House Armed Services Committee noted the Navy's unused capacity at Mayport and ongoing environmental impact studies for stationing additional surface ships. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to assess the costs of constructing nuclear infrastructure and port improvements at Naval Station Mayport to support a nuclear carrier before recommending its stationing there. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Navy to assess the costs of constructing nuclear infrastructure and port improvements at Naval Station Mayport to support a nuclear carrier. The Navy is drafting an environmental impact statement to make Naval Station Mayport the second nuclear carrier-capable homeport on the east coast. The Navy is directed to provide a report on military construction requirements and timetable for making Mayport a nuclear carrier-capable homeport. Legislation related to military construction and appropriations acts are mentioned. The Senate report expresses concern about the declining size of the naval force and the reduction in aircraft carriers. The committee agrees that maintaining 12 operational aircraft carriers is not feasible but believes that at least 11 carriers are vital for national security. Extraordinary actions have been taken to support the construction of the first 3 CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. The committee supports the construction of the first 3 CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and reaffirms the need for at least 11 operational aircraft carriers for national security. The Atlantic Fleet should continue to be dispersed in two homeports, as stated by Admiral Clark. Senator Bill Nelson also provided additional views on the homeporting of aircraft carriers on the Atlantic Coast. The Senate committee supports the importance of Naval Station Mayport and Jacksonville for Navy readiness, backing the CNO's commitment to maintain infrastructure for the Atlantic Fleet. Additional background information from a May 2010 GAO report and excerpts from a January 2009 Navy Record of Decision document announcing the decision to homeport a CVN at Mayport are included. The decision to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport initiates a multiyear process for developing facilities to support the CVN. Projects include dredging, construction of maintenance facilities, wharf and transportation improvements, and a new parking structure. The capacity for CVN homeporting could be ready by 2014, with no change until facility projects are completed. The specific CVN to be homeported at Mayport has not been selected yet. The decision to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport involves a two and a half year process including environmental analysis, cost identification, and strategic assessments. The selection of the specific CVN for homeporting will be based on operational needs, strategic considerations, and maintenance cycles. Extensive studies were conducted on impacts related to dredging, facility construction, and homeport operations. Regulatory agencies were consulted during the environmental analysis. The decision to homeport a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at Naval Station Mayport involved consultations with regulatory agencies like USFWS, NMFS, USACE, and EPA regarding impacts on endangered species and dredging operations. Public participation was a key part of the Environmental Impact Statement process, allowing for input from various stakeholders. The decision made by the DON was based on thorough analysis and public feedback. The decision to consolidate CVN capabilities in the Hampton Roads area on the East Coast was based on the need to develop a hedge against catastrophic events. This decision was made considering the unique risks presented by having all five CVNs assigned to the Atlantic Fleet homeported in NAVSTA Norfolk, the only location on the East Coast with CVN maintenance and repair infrastructure. The Hampton Roads area is the only location in the U.S. capable of CVN construction and refueling, housing all Atlantic Fleet CVN trained crews and support infrastructure. There are no strategic options outside this area for Atlantic Fleet CVNs in case of a catastrophic event. The Draft and Final EIS assessed 12 action alternatives for homeporting additional surface ships at NAVSTA Mayport, with no consideration for other geographic locations. The Final EIS identified Alternative 4 as the Preferred Alternative for homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport. This option includes dredging, infrastructure improvements, and construction of maintenance facilities. Factors influencing this choice included impact analyses, cost estimates, and strategic considerations. The Final EIS identified Alternative 4 as the Preferred Alternative for homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport, involving dredging, infrastructure improvements, and construction. The environmentally preferred alternative, Alternative 2, homeporting two LHDs at NAVSTA Mayport, would have less environmental impact but does not address strategic concerns or reduce risks to critical Atlantic Fleet assets and infrastructure. The EIS analyzed environmental impacts and potential magnitude relative to various categories. Only impacts to NAVSTA Mayport and the project area were evaluated, with no impacts outside this area. Analysis included radiological aspects of CVN homeporting and compared impacts of each alternative against a 2006 baseline. The Department of the Navy (DON) elected to implement Alternative 4, the Preferred Alternative, which involves homeporting one CVN at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Mayport. This decision initiates a multiyear process for developing facilities to support the homeporting of one CVN, without immediately relocating a specific CVN to NAVSTA Mayport. The Department of the Navy has chosen to homeport one CVN at NAVSTA Mayport, leading to a multiyear process of developing facilities to support this decision. Projects include dredging, construction of maintenance facilities, wharf and transportation improvements, and a new parking structure. The selection of the specific CVN for homeporting will be based on operational needs, strategic considerations, and maintenance requirements. The Department of the Navy's decision-making process for homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport was based on operational needs, strategic considerations, and maintenance cycles. Key factors included environmental impacts, costs, and strategic dispersal considerations to hedge against catastrophic events. Consolidating CVN capabilities in the Hampton Roads area on the East Coast poses unique risks compared to the West Coast's spread among three homeports, providing strategic options in case of a catastrophic event. NAVSTA Norfolk is the only East Coast location with CVN maintenance, repair, construction, and refueling capabilities. It houses all Atlantic Fleet CVN crews and support infrastructure. Environmental impacts were assessed through studies and data collection, leading to discussions with regulators during the EIS process. The Department of the Navy (DON) consulted with federal/state regulators during the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process to identify and address mitigation measures for environmental impacts associated with homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport. Mitigation measures have been committed to by the DON based on consultations with regulators and subject matter experts. There are no environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated, including impacts on endangered species. The DON's analysis considered short-term and long-term local economic impacts in the Mayport area, along with recurring and one-time costs associated with changes to surface ship homeporting. The EIS considered recurring and one-time costs for changes to surface ship homeporting, with the preferred alternative costing less than 10% of a single CVN and less than 1% of the DON's CVN assets. The investment in homeport capacity at NAVSTA Mayport enhances security for CVN assets and provides dispersal capability at a fraction of the cost of an aircraft carrier. Recurring costs include SRM, BOS, training, air wing transportation, nuclear maintenance labor, and BAH for Sailors and their families. The sustainment costs cover activities to maintain facilities, while restoration and modernization costs are life-cycle investments for improved facilities. BOS costs include Facilities Operations expenses like Utilities and Fire Services. Onetime costs encompass MILCON projects, maintenance for Industrial Plant Equipment, and PCS for crew relocation to NAVSTA Mayport. Strategic dispersal of surface ships, including CVNs, was assessed for potential vulnerabilities such as transit times, shipping traffic volumes, port force protection, and homeporting options in response to operational requirements. The analysis compared the strategic value of NAVSTA Norfolk and NAVSTA Mayport as CVN homeports, concluding that both have equal value. Establishing CVN homeport capacity at NAVSTA Mayport offers added strategic value without adverse impacts on operations, providing a second CVN homeport on the East Coast. The development of an additional East Coast CVN homeport provides a strategic advantage as a hedge against catastrophic events that may impact NAVSTA Norfolk. Planning and preparation efforts must address maintenance, repair infrastructure, and operational considerations to ensure readiness for such events. The difficulty in quantifying the likelihood of a catastrophic event underscores the importance of not underestimating the long-term effects, as seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans has shown the long-lasting effects of a catastrophic event on industrial infrastructure and community support functions. The importance of planning and preparing for similar events in the Hampton Roads area, where the Atlantic Fleet's aircraft carriers are based, is crucial to national security. The need for a CVN maintenance and repair infrastructure in the region highlights its strategic significance in times of crisis. The only location in the U.S. capable of CVN construction and refueling is in the Hampton Roads area, which also houses all Atlantic Fleet CVN trained crews and support infrastructure. Homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport would provide strategic options in case of a catastrophic event, enhance distribution of CVN assets, and reduce risks to aircraft carriers and associated maintenance infrastructure. This decision represents the best military judgment regarding strategic considerations. The Department of the Navy (DON) made a decision to homeport a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport on the East Coast to support Atlantic Fleet operational needs. This decision was based on strategic considerations, environmental impacts analyzed in the EIS, mitigation measures, and costs. There will be no significant adverse environmental impacts associated with the CVN homeporting. The cost of developing the homeport was balanced against the strategic need to create a hedge against a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads area. The decision to homeport a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport on the East Coast was driven by the strategic need to create a hedge against a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads area. Developing a second CVN homeport provides added security and operational effectiveness by allowing the Navy to operate out of two homeports, reducing potential risks to CVN assets and ensuring access to maintenance and repair infrastructure in case of a catastrophic event. The Navy has accepted reduced operational availability on the West Coast for dispersal purposes. By homeporting CVNs in the Northwestern U.S., there is increased transit time to reach operational and training areas. Establishing a second CVN homeport on the East Coast would provide dispersal advantage without the added transit time. West Coast homeports are not viable options for Atlantic Fleet CVN assets in case of a catastrophic event in the Hampton Roads area. The large size of nuclear powered aircraft carriers prevents them from transiting the Panama Canal, requiring a long voyage around South America to reach the closest West Coast homeport in San Diego. The Navy recognized the need to plan and prepare for continuity of operations after the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. Homeporting a CVN at NAVSTA Mayport in San Diego serves the interests of the DON and the nation, with minimal environmental impacts. The Navy provided data on hurricane risk in Appendix D. The Navy provided data on hurricane risk in Appendix D, including information on the risk of hurricanes at Norfolk and Mayport. This included historical data on hurricanes in the Hampton Roads area and Mayport, as well as the impact on Navy facilities and ship operations. The Navy responded to questions about collateral damage from hurricanes that did not make a direct hit between 1851-2006, noting that since 1995, Mayport had experienced 8 named storms, one of which was a hurricane. Since 1995, Mayport had 8 named storms, one of which was a hurricane, with collateral damage totaling $6.1M. Norfolk had 15 named storms, 4 hurricanes, with collateral damage of $11.8M. Ships in port during hurricanes since 2004 had no resulting damage. Historical hurricane damage costs for NAVSTA Norfolk and NAVSTA Mayport include: Mayport: FY04: $1.2M, FY05: $4.1M, FY08: $0.8M. Norfolk: FY99: $1.0M, FY03: $10.8M. Ships at Mayport have sortied 6 times and ships at Norfolk have sortied 5 times since 1995. Data prior to 1992 is incomplete for tracking hurricane sorties. No records exist of Navy ships being unable to sortie during hurricane evacuation orders. Shipyards are considered safe havens, so aircraft carriers in shipyards are not required to sortie. Examples of non-aircraft carriers remaining in port during hurricanes include ships at Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with some sustaining minor to extensive damage. Repair costs are classified as \"Business Sensitive.\" During hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008, ships at NGSB Avondale and NGSB Ingalls also remained pierside. Hurricanes can affect aircraft carrier operations during all phases of the carrier schedule. CVNs inport will sortie when directed by the Fleet Commander and conduct hurricane avoidance. Ships in Mayport require approximately 1 hour to reach the open sea after receiving the sortie order, while ships in Norfolk require between 4 to 4.5 hours. No records exist of Navy ships being unable to sortie during hurricane evacuation orders. The Navy's ability to sortie ships during hurricanes is discussed, with ships in maintenance at certain shipyards considered safe havens. No records indicate any aircraft carriers not in safe havens were unable to sortie. Members' views on homeporting a CVN at Mayport are also presented. The letter to President Obama emphasizes the importance of having two East Coast aircraft carrier homeports, specifically mentioning Naval Station Mayport in Florida. It calls on President Obama to reaffirm his commitment to strategic dispersal of critical assets like aircraft carriers. The letter highlights Florida's military strategic strengths, including Eglin Air Force Base and Naval Station Mayport. The Department of the Navy conducted a study earlier in the year on upgrading Naval Station Mayport to homeport a nuclear carrier. The Navy emphasizes the need for strategic dispersal of aircraft carriers on the East Coast, with upgrades necessary to homeport a nuclear carrier at Naval Station Mayport in Florida. This is to reduce risk to the Atlantic Fleet carrier force and restore balance to the Navy's operations. Secretary Gates highlighted the importance of having multiple homeports for carriers on the East Coast in a letter to Senator Jim Webb. The Norfolk area is the only east coast port for nuclear aircraft carriers. If Norfolk became inaccessible, the Navy would have to travel to San Diego for maintenance. Aircraft carriers are crucial for national security, and as access to overseas bases decreases, their importance grows. The Navy lacks alternate homeporting options for aircraft carriers on the East Coast. Permanently homeporting a carrier at Mayport is cost-effective. Upgrading Mayport to homeport a nuclear carrier is a sound national security expense, providing flexibility and protection to valuable assets. Members from Virginia support the idea of homeporting a CVN at Mayport, citing the need for strategic dispersal. The cost of a nuclear carrier at Mayport is minimal compared to the overall fleet cost. The Hampton Roads Military Affairs Commission, consisting of experts and leaders from Virginia's Hampton Roads area, supports the Navy's goal to homeport a CVN at Mayport. They acknowledge the challenges of balancing priorities in the current fiscal environment. The Hampton Roads Military Affairs Commission supports the Navy's goal to homeport a CVN at Mayport. They request a business-case analysis to address financial and operational tradeoffs, as well as a threat assessment for the proposal. The estimated cost for creating a CVN homeport at NAVSTA Mayport is between $600 million and $1 billion. The Navy has numerous unfunded priorities in the current economic climate. A strategic-risk assessment is needed for the proposed carrier homeport at NAVSTA Mayport, which could cost $600 million to $1 billion. The Navy lacks a rigorous risk-based analysis to justify this project. The Navy is considering creating an additional East Coast homeport for a CVN, citing the concept of \"strategic dispersal.\" However, concerns have been raised about the potential costs and implications of this dispersal strategy for high-value assets like carriers and submarines. Under Secretary Michelle Flournoy has highlighted the need for specific guidance on strategic dispersal and whether it would apply to other critical infrastructure. The Navy is considering creating an additional East Coast homeport for a CVN, citing the concept of \"strategic dispersal.\" Concerns have been raised about the potential costs and implications of this strategy for high-value assets like carriers and submarines. Questions have been raised about security improvements needed at Mayport, potential harbor blockage risks, personnel increases required, and overall manning plans for the CVN move. The overall manning plan for the CVN move to be homeported at Mayport is being questioned, including details on station manning, temporary additional duty sailors, recurring costs, and impact on remaining CVN activities at Norfolk. Concerns are raised about the decommissioning of carrier-support infrastructure at Mayport when the USS Kennedy left in 2007, and the need to rebuild it if a new CVN homeport is established. Specific capabilities that must be re-established and associated costs are also being questioned. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the CVN move to NAVSTA Mayport raises questions about the maintenance facilities, economic impacts, and socio-economic evaluations. Concerns include the need for nuclear propulsion repair facilities, conventional maintenance, and the impact on Norfolk's local housing market, schools, and jobs. The FEIS for the CVN move to NAVSTA Mayport raised concerns about the impact on Norfolk's local housing market, schools, jobs, and small businesses.
