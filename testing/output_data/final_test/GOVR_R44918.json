    "content": "Federal financial regulation is complex, with diverse markets, participants, and regulators. The regulatory structure has evolved over time, with major changes made in response to financial crises. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 was a significant reform in response to the 2007 financial turmoil. Congress is currently debating proposals to modify parts of the regulatory system established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 proposes changes to the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, including modifications to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Insurance Office, as well as changes to the relationship between the Financial Stability Oversight Council and regulators. It also aims to eliminate the Office of Financial Research and make adjustments to how financial regulators create rules and receive funding. This report outlines the basic frameworks and principles of U.S. financial regulation, providing historical context and discussing various modes of financial regulation and federal regulators. The report discusses federal financial regulatory agencies, interagency bodies, state regulators, and international standards. It explains how the financial system matches funds with borrowers and the role of financial firms as intermediaries or agents in managing funds for savers. Financial regulators play a custodial role, investing savers' funds in segregated accounts. They oversee various products, instruments, and markets in banking, insurance, securities, derivatives, and financial market infrastructure. The system of regulators is complex and organized to ensure the safety and efficiency of financial activities. The financial system includes various components such as commodities, financial indicators, and financial instruments, as well as the Financial Market Infrastructure which supports transactions. There is a distinction between formal and functional definitions of activities, leading to a fragmented regulatory system with gaps, overlaps, and duplications in authority. \"Shadow banking\" involves economically similar activities like lending and deposit taking. Financial regulation has evolved over time, with new authority added in response to failures in financial markets. Powers, goals, tools, and approaches vary across markets, but there are common themes. This section provides an overview of what financial regulators do, answering four key questions. Regulators implement policy using their powers, which vary by agency and can be grouped into categories like Licensing, Chartering, or Registration. Most activities require proper credentials from state or federal regulators to be undertaken. For example, a firm needs to be chartered as a bank to accept federally insured deposits, and an individual must be licensed as a broker-dealer to buy and sell securities. Regulators issue rules through the rulemaking process to implement statutory mandates, ensuring market participants comply with guidelines to avoid penalties or criminal charges. Regulators oversee market participants' behavior through supervision, which can involve active monitoring or investigating complaints. They enforce compliance through fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, legal actions, and license revocation. Enforcement powers are used to modify firms' behavior and ensure regulatory compliance. Financial regulators oversee market participants' behavior through supervision and enforcement powers, including legal actions and license revocation. They ensure market efficiency, integrity, and resolution of failing firms through conservatorship or receivership. Regulatory compliance is enforced through fines, penalties, and cease and desist orders. Regulators ensure market integrity by enforcing transparency, contract enforcement, and setting and enforcing rules. They also address market failures like principal-agent problems, asymmetric information, and moral hazard to enhance market efficiency. Regulators protect consumers and investors from fraud, discrimination, manipulation, and theft, aiming to prevent exploitative practices and enable understanding of risks in contracts. Regulators aim to protect consumers and investors by ensuring market integrity, preventing fraud and discrimination, and enabling understanding of risks in contracts. They also work to provide access to credit and capital for firms and consumers, prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing, and safeguard taxpayers. Regulators aim to protect consumers and investors by ensuring market integrity, preventing fraud and discrimination, and enabling understanding of risks in contracts. They also work to provide access to credit and capital for firms and consumers, prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing, and safeguard taxpayers from financial losses or failures in markets. Only certain types of financial activity are explicitly backed by the federal government or by regulator-run insurance schemes, such as the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In the case of a financial crisis, the government may provide funds in ways not previously contemplated to restore stability, as seen in the \"bailouts\" of large failing firms in 2008. Financial regulation aims to maintain stability in the financial system through preventative and palliative measures to mitigate systemic risk. Financial instability can be localized or more general, leading to market freezes, panic, and firm failures. The 2007-2009 financial crisis highlighted the potential for systemic risk beyond banking. Bailouts of failing firms in 2008 exemplify government intervention to restore stability in times of crisis. The recent crisis shows the potential for systemic risk in the financial system. Regulatory goals can conflict, balancing consumer protections with market efficiency. Regulations aim for a middle ground to minimize burden and maximize benefits. Regulators consider tradeoffs between goals when taking action. Various types of regulations are applied to market participants. Prudential regulation focuses on risk management and safety of institutions, with examples like capital requirements for banks. It aims to protect taxpayers, consumers, and financial stability. Disclosure and reporting requirements ensure accurate financial information is available to the public and regulators for informed decision-making and monitoring. Regulators prescribe standards for products, markets, and professional conduct to achieve policy goals such as market integrity, taxpayer protection, consumer protection, and suitability. They ensure firms do not have undue monopoly power through competition regulation. Regulators ensure competition by preventing monopoly power, collusion, and price fixing. They also regulate prices and rates, with examples like the Durbin Amendment and state usury laws. The curr_chunk discusses the justification for price and rate regulations in the financial sector, contrasting prudential regulation in banking with disclosure regulation in securities. It highlights the differences in regulatory goals, with financial stability and taxpayer protection being central to banking regulation due to taxpayer exposure and contagion risks. Securities markets, on the other hand, do not prioritize these goals as the federal government has made fewer promises to intervene in case of losses or failures. Financial regulation relies on confidential information gathered by supervisors to ensure proper disclosure and inform investors about risks. Regulators have varying scopes, regulating specific types of institutions based on business charters. Federal securities regulation aims to inform investors rather than prevent failures. Regulatory approaches differ due to market characteristics and historical evolution. The Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) regulates only three government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs): Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, giving regulators oversight over all aspects of the firm's behavior. Different types of institutions offering functionally similar activities are often regulated differently. In some markets, all activities within that market are subject to regulation. Regulators may issue codes of conduct and rules for markets, where specific activities are restricted to regulated markets. Different authorities may regulate primary and secondary markets. Another approach is to regulate specific financial activities regardless of where they occur or which entities are involved. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to ensure consumer financial protections apply uniformly to all transactions. Risks can come from firms, markets, or products, and regulation must align to effectively mitigate them. Market innovation can lead to financial instruments falling between industry divisions, requiring clarity on regulatory jurisdiction. Congress and courts often decide which agency oversees specific financial activities. Regulatory structure is categorized into banking, markets, and products. Regulators in the financial industry are categorized into banking, securities, and insurance sectors, with specific regulators for consumer protection and market activities. Financial firms may be overseen by multiple regulators due to engaging in various financial activities. The complexity of regulatory oversight is illustrated in Figure 1. Financial firms may have holding companies with separate legal subsidiaries to engage in more activities. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 allowed different legal subsidiaries within the same financial holding company to engage in a broad array of financially related activities. Banking subsidiaries are limited to permissible activities related to the \"business of banking.\" The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999 allowed financial holding companies to have separate legal subsidiaries engaging in various financially related activities. Each subsidiary is assigned a primary regulator, with multiple subsidiaries possibly having multiple institution regulators. A financial holding company, regulated by the Fed, may have its national bank regulated by the OCC, securities subsidiary by the SEC, and loan company by the CFPB. Other market or activity regulators may also be involved. The regulation of depository institutions in the United States involves multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions. Each institution is subject to regulation by its chartering authority, whether state or federal. Regardless of charter type, all depository institutions are federally insured and subject to at least one federal primary regulator responsible for safety, soundness, and compliance with banking laws. Institutions have three charter types: commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions, each with a primary regulator based on charter type. The primary federal regulators for different types of depository institutions in the United States are the OCC for national banks and thrifts, the Federal Reserve for state-chartered banks in the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC for state-chartered thrifts and banks not in the Federal Reserve System, and the Fed or OCC for foreign banks. Credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration. Additionally, all national banks, state-chartered banks, and thrifts are subject to FDIC regulatory authority due to deposit insurance coverage. Regulatory responsibilities are illustrated in Figure 3. Banks are regulated under a separate framework from credit unions, with safety and soundness regulations in place to evaluate loans, balance sheets, and overall risks. This prudential regulation aims to ensure stability in the financial system and economy. The stability of financial institutions is influenced by their assets, liabilities, and relationships with other banks and financial markets. Banks must maintain capital reserves and liquidity to mitigate risks. Federal regulators assess banks' balance sheets for risk-based capital requirements, asset quality, and internal controls. If a bank is deemed to be taking excessive risks, regulators have tools to reduce risk, such as requiring changes in lending practices or asset disposal. The OCC, established in 1863, supervises federally chartered banks and regulates various financial functions. Banks are also subject to CFPB regulation for consumer protection and SEC and CFTC regulation for securities and derivatives activities. Regulatory agencies have tools to enforce compliance, including withdrawing deposit insurance or seizing the bank. The OCC, Comptroller of the Currency, is a member of the FDIC board and has examination powers to ensure the safety of nationally chartered banks. It can issue cease and desist orders and revoke bank charters. The FDIC, created in 1933, insures deposits up to $250,000, examines financial institutions, and manages failed bank assets. The FDIC is the primary federal regulator of state banks and thrift institutions, overseeing nearly all banks and thrifts with FDIC insurance. It manages the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) through risk-based assessments and uses its powers to examine institutions, enforce regulations, and resolve troubled banks. The FDIC aims to safeguard the DIF by implementing \"prompt corrective action\" and \"least cost resolution\" principles, preventing failing banks from entering bankruptcy. The Dodd-Frank Act has expanded the FDIC's authority in this regard. The Federal Reserve System, established in 1913, serves as the nation's central bank to provide stability in the banking sector. It consists of the Board of Governors and 12 regional reserve banks. The Fed has regulatory authority over various lending institutions, including bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the system. Membership in the Fed is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks, with members required to purchase stock. The Fed regulates the largest financial firms in the US. The Federal Reserve (Fed) regulates the largest financial firms in the US, including financial holding companies and nonbank financial firms designated as systemically significant. It is also the primary regulator for bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets, savings and loan holding companies, and securities holding companies. The Fed conducts monetary policy by targeting short-term interest rates and acts as a lender of last resort. The Federal Reserve regulates financial firms in the US and conducts monetary policy by targeting short-term interest rates. It also acts as a lender of last resort and sets prudential standards for designated payment systems. The NCUA is an independent agency that regulates federal credit unions, administers a Central Liquidity Facility, and insures credit union deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to enhance consumer protection and align regulation of financial institutions. The bureau has authority over various consumer financial products and services. The CFPB administers rules to protect consumers in financial services, with regulatory authority varying based on institution size and type. It supervises institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and can issue rules for all depository institutions. Regulatory authority differs for depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets and nondepositories. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities and consumer financial activities from the CFPB's supervisory and enforcement authority, including merchants extending credit for nonfinancial goods, automobile dealers, real estate brokers, SEC or CFTC registered financial intermediaries, and insurance companies. In areas outside CFPB jurisdiction, the FTC and state regulators retain consumer protection authority. Securities markets can be categorized into derivatives for regulatory purposes. The SEC and CFTC regulate securities markets, with derivatives falling under the jurisdiction of either agency. Standard-setting bodies and SROs are overseen by the SEC or CFTC. Banking regulators oversee securities activities of banks, major participants in some markets. The SEC was created in 1934 to enforce federal securities laws, building upon existing market institutions. The SEC has jurisdiction over participants in securities markets, issuers, asset managers, intermediaries, experts, securities markets, market utilities, and securities products. Its main focus is on protecting investors, maintaining fair markets, and facilitating capital formation. The SEC requires firms selling securities to register with detailed information about the firm, management, fund usage, and risks to investors. Registration includes periodic financial statements to keep disclosures current. The SEC focuses on investor protection, fair markets, and capital formation. The SEC does not have direct regulatory control over publicly traded firms but requires registration for securities market participants to disclose risks to investors. Registration with the SEC does not guarantee a security is a safe investment. Securities market participants like stock exchanges, securities brokerages, mutual funds, auditors, and investment advisers must comply with rules to maintain their registered status. The SEC requires registration for securities market participants to disclose risks to investors. Compliance with rules is necessary to maintain registered status and protect public investors. Accredited investors with high net worth can invest in riskier hedge funds and private equity funds. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates registration for private advisers with over $150 million in assets under management. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation safeguards brokerage customers from losses due to firm failure. Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is a private nonprofit overseen by the SEC, providing insurance for customer accounts up to $500,000 in case of brokerage failure or fraud. Unlike the FDIC, SIPC does not protect against market losses or regulate broker-dealers. The foreign exchange market, with trillions of dollars in daily turnover, lacks U.S. regulatory oversight. The foreign exchange market operates without U.S. regulatory oversight, involving global banks, central banks, hedge funds, currency speculators, and retail brokers. There is no centralized marketplace, with trading conducted on electronic platforms. Treasury securities were exempt from SEC regulation until the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 required brokers and dealers to register as government securities dealers. The Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 extended antifraud provisions to government securities brokers and dealers, giving the U.S. Treasury authority to regulate transactions. The government securities market is less regulated than corporate securities markets, with fragmented regulatory jurisdiction. Municipal securities were initially exempt from SEC regulation but firms now need to register with the SEC. Dodd-Frank Act required municipal advisors to register with the SEC, but issuers of municipal securities remain exempt. Private securities are not subject to SEC oversight like public securities, but they are still subject to antifraud provisions. Private placements can only be offered to accredited investors and have restrictions on resale. The private placement market value can exceed the public market value at times. Venture capitalists and private investors are active in this market. In recent decades, venture capitalists and private equity firms have become significant players in corporate finance. The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates commodities futures and options markets, expanding beyond agricultural commodities to financial variables. Off-exchange derivatives contracts like swaps have made enforcing exclusive jurisdiction challenging. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed exemptions for certain over-the-counter derivatives, expanding the CFTC's jurisdiction. Swap dealers, major swap participants, and others must register with the CFTC, adhere to reporting requirements, and conduct standards. Swaps are now required to be cleared through a central clearinghouse and traded on exchanges. The CFTC's mission is to prevent excessive speculation, manipulation of commodity prices, and fraud by overseeing futures exchanges and industry firms. SROs, including futures commission merchants, floor traders, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisers, are required to register with the CFTC. The CFTC does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, except for specific rules for futures commission merchants and capital standards for swap dealers and major swap participants. National securities exchanges and clearing and settlement systems may register as SROs with the SEC or CFTC for oversight. The SEC and CFTC have regulatory authority over clearing and settlement systems designated as systemically important. SROs must create rules for disciplining members and ensuring market integrity. Standard-setting bodies like FINRA enforce rules for brokers in securities and futures markets. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) enforces rules for brokers and dealers, while the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) establishes rules for municipal advisors and dealers in the municipal securities market. The National Futures Association (NFA) develops and enforces rules in futures markets, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) sets financial accounting standards for companies and nonprofits. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) oversees private auditors of publicly held companies. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversees private auditors of publicly held companies and broker-dealers, funded through member fees. GSEs are privately owned institutions with limited missions overseen by dedicated regulators like the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was established to regulate housing finance-related GSEs like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. It took over from OFHEO and FHFB, transferring authority for setting goals from HUD. The creation of FHFA was driven by concerns about the risks posed by Fannie and Freddie's large investment portfolios. The FHFA was given enhanced safety and soundness powers to regulate GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It placed both Fannie and Freddie in conservatorship to prevent their failure and continues to oversee their operations with direct involvement in decision-making. The Treasury provided capital to the GSEs to ensure their solvency. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) was created in 1933 during a farming crisis to oversee the Farm Credit System, which includes cooperatively owned Farm Credit Banks, Agricultural Credit Banks, the Funding Corporation, and Farmer Mac. The FCA has increased rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement powers and operates in both primary and secondary agricultural credit markets. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) oversees the Farm Credit System in primary and secondary agricultural credit markets. Regulatory failure played a part in the financial crisis, leading to the formation of interagency task forces for coordination and data sharing among regulators. Key organizations include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council, and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. In February 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner highlighted the financial system's lack of oversight and risk constraints, leading to vulnerabilities and the 2008 economic crisis. Systemic risk arises when individual firms manage risk independently, creating instability collectively. Regulators may overlook systemic risk due to unforeseen correlations and interactions within the global financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to detect systemic stress before a crisis, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and including heads of various regulatory agencies as voting members. The FSOC aims to identify firms whose failure could trigger system-wide consequences. The FSOC, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, consists of the Secretary of the Treasury, the head of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), state banking supervisor, state insurance commissioner, and state securities commissioner. It identifies financial risks, proposes regulatory changes, promotes market discipline, and coordinates with regulators to address systemic risks and gaps in regulation. The FSOC, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, focuses on identifying financial risks, proposing regulatory changes, promoting market discipline, and coordinating with regulators to address systemic risks and gaps in regulation. It reviews accounting standards, resolves jurisdictional disputes, and provides annual reports to Congress. While it cannot impose resolutions on disagreeing members, it can make regulatory recommendations to member agencies or Congress. The FSOC does not have direct supervisory authority over financial institutions but plays a crucial role in regulation. The FSOC, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, focuses on identifying financial risks, proposing regulatory changes, promoting market discipline, and coordinating with regulators to address systemic risks and gaps in regulation. It designates firms and financial market utilities as systemically important, subjecting them to a consolidated supervisory regime administered by the Fed. The FFIEC, created in 1979, coordinates federal regulation of lending institutions and issues a single set of reporting forms for covered institutions. The FFIEC, comprised of various federal agencies, enforces safety and soundness regulations for lending institutions through examiners who evaluate risks. Safety and soundness concerns are outlined in handbooks used by examiners, covering areas like capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, and market risk sensitivity. Unlike banks and securities firms regulated at the federal level, insurance companies have been solely regulated by states for 150 years without federal oversight. Federal regulators of insurance, like the SEC or the OCC for securities or banks, have a limited federal role due to Supreme Court decisions and congressional actions. The 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act preserves states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Each state has a department regulating insurance companies, products, and solvency. States regulate the solvency and content of insurance products, as well as market conduct. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) sets national standards through model laws, but states must enact them for legal effect. Guaranty funds protect policyholders in case of insolvency. The federal government's role in insurance regulation has increased over time, with Congress expanding its role in certain acts. The federal government's role in insurance regulation has expanded through acts like GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act, giving regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve over bank holding companies with insurance operations. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the FIO to monitor the insurance industry. Various federal laws have exempted certain aspects of state insurance regulation, while state regulators oversee banking and securities markets. State regulation in nonbank consumer financial protection has diminished as the federal role has expanded. Banking is a dual system with institutions choosing state or federal charter. Most community banks are state-chartered, with more state-chartered commercial banks than nationally chartered ones, but with fewer assets. Nationally chartered thrifts have 65% of thrift assets. State-chartered banks have state regulators as primary regulators, but federal regulators also play a role, especially in ensuring FDIC deposit insurance compliance. In securities markets, state banks are supervised by the FDIC or the Federal Reserve if they are members. Blue sky laws protect investors from fraud, and states oversee investment advisers exempt from SEC registration. Broker-dealers are regulated by federal authorities. SEC registration based on size is overseen by state regulators, while broker-dealers are subject to both state and federal regulation. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 invalidated state securities laws in various areas to reduce overlap between state and federal regulation. States also enforce regulations against financial institutions, with a significant role in states like New York. Federal regulation determines the scope of state regulation through preemption and \"wild card\" laws. Financial regulation must consider the global nature of financial markets, with U.S. regulators and foreign regulators needing to coordinate on oversight of firms operating across borders. Consensus and consistency are important to prevent firms from migrating to jurisdictions with weaker regulations, undermining the effectiveness of regulation in stricter jurisdictions. U.S. regulators and the Treasury Department participate in international fora to ensure regulatory standards are aligned. U.S. regulators and the Treasury Department play a significant role in setting international regulatory standards for the financial system. These standards, although not legally binding, are generally implemented through rulemaking or legislation. Various international standard-setting bodies oversee banking, securities, derivatives, and insurance regulation. The G-20 also plays a role in international financial regulation. The G-20, an international body, led regulatory reform efforts after the financial crisis by creating the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to coordinate with finance ministers and regulators from G-20 countries. The FSB's agenda overlaps with the Dodd-Frank Act, and the act established new federal entities for financial regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act established new federal entities for financial regulation, including the Oversight Council (FSOC), Office of Financial Research (OFR), Federal Insurance Office (FIO), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB was granted new authority and transferred existing authority from other regulators. The Act also eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and transferred its authority to banking regulators. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and replaced the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). HERA granted FHFA new authority and transferred limited authority from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)."
