    "content": "Medicaid, established in 1965, is a means-tested entitlement program that finances medical services for nearly 60 million people at a cost of $333 billion in FY2006. Each state administers its own program under federal guidelines, with Medicaid being the second largest spending item for states after education. Program spending increased by over 49% between 2000 and 2005, exceeding growth in inflation rates for Medicare and Social Security. Medicaid spending has grown due to rising medical costs, expanded federal laws, and state financing mechanisms. In the 1980s and 1990s, increasing costs were attributed to the fee-for-service delivery system. States began turning to managed care to control Medicaid budgets and ensure value for money. Medicaid managed care was adopted by many states to control costs and provide better care for beneficiaries. However, it has not fully achieved its goals yet. While about two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are in managed care, most expenditures still occur in fee-for-service settings, mainly due to the lack of long-term care services. Quality of care in Medicaid managed care has shown some improvements, but commercial and Medicare managed care plans continue to outperform. Medicaid managed care, commercial and Medicare plans perform better on some effectiveness measures. Medicaid eligibility is based on income and resources, with over 50 distinct population groups potentially eligible. Different rules apply to different groups within a state, and categorical restrictions apply. Medicaid eligibility is based on specific categories of people, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, families with dependent children, pregnant women, and children. Medicaid benefits include a wide range of medical services, with some being mandatory for most groups. Medicaid benefits cover hospital, laboratory, physician, and nursing facility services for individuals aged 21 and over. Optional benefits in some states include dental care, clinic services, therapies, and transportation for medical care. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to offer new benefit packages to certain Medicaid beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to offer new benefit packages to certain Medicaid beneficiaries, including benchmark and benchmark-equivalent coverage similar to SCHIP plans. Benchmark coverage includes various health plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield and commercial HMOs, while benchmark-equivalent coverage must have specific services and actuarial value.

Benchmark coverage includes various health plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield and commercial HMOs, while benchmark-equivalent coverage must have specific services and actuarial value. Medicaid has two major service delivery systems: fee-for-service and managed care, which differ in provider choice, management of care, oversight responsibilities, and payment methods. Certain groups are exempt from mandatory enrollment in the new benefit option, while others may be required to enroll. The Medicaid program has two major service delivery systems: fee-for-service and managed care. These systems are not entirely independent and some states have hybrid models that combine features of both. Beneficiaries may receive different services under each system simultaneously. Fee-for-service was the predominant system until recently. The fee-for-service (FFS) delivery system was the main method of care in Medicaid until the mid-1990s. Beneficiaries had provider choice and were responsible for managing their own care. Payment rates were set by the state, and providers were reimbursed for each service rendered. States had to obtain waivers for changes until the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, states needed waivers to implement managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries, allowing for regional implementation and restricting provider choice. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act provided flexibility for benefit package and service delivery innovations. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 further supported managed care demonstrations. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA-97; P.L. 105-33) eliminated the need for waivers that many states found complex and time-consuming for Medicaid managed care. It also established standards for quality and solvency, and provided additional protections for beneficiaries. Under Medicaid managed care, beneficiaries choose a primary plan as a \"medical home\" for care coordination and management. State Medicaid agencies must contract with at least two plans, offering a range of services through comprehensive plans like HMOs or primary care case management plans. Primary care physicians in case management plans act as gatekeepers to specialty care services like mental health and dental care. Specialty care can be provided by prepaid health plans (PHPs) or FFS delivery systems. Beneficiaries must seek care from a specified list of plan providers. States increased the use of comprehensive managed care contractors with public enrollment between 1990 and 2002. As of June 2004, nationwide trends showed that commercial MCOs outnumbered Medicaid-only MCOs, with more Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in commercial plans. Medicaid managed care arrangements involve paying a fee on a \"per member per month\" basis for specified services, different from the FFS delivery system. Premium or capitation rates reflect the average FFS cost of care for specific beneficiary groups. Managed care arrangements involve paying a fee on a \"per member per month\" basis for specified services, reflecting the average FFS cost of care for specific beneficiary groups. Premiums are paid monthly regardless of the care rendered, making expenditures more predictable. Plans must actively manage care to control financial risk and may face losses if care exceeds agreed-upon rates. The economic incentive in managed care plans is to deliver less costly care without compromising beneficiary health. This incentive may be passed on to medical providers through sub-capitation or financial rewards/penalties for performance. In contrast, the PCCM model combines fee-for-service and traditional managed care, with the majority of expenditures being FFS payments. Case managers are paid a small monthly fee to coordinate and refer services for enrolled beneficiaries. The PCCM model of managed care involves coordination and referral for services, with case managers paid on a fee-for-service basis. It serves as a first step towards traditional managed care models like HMOs and is used in rural areas where traditional plans are lacking. Oversight responsibilities are shared among the State Medicaid Agency, managed care plans, and providers. The managed care plans establish payment rates and benefits for contracted entities, oversee plan providers, set medical care policies, and determine payment methods. State Medicaid Agencies oversee PCCM programs directly or through administrative service organizations. Under the FFS delivery system, State Medicaid Agencies work directly with providers to set payment rates and policies for medical care. Federal statutes require assurances for access to and quality of care in both FFS and managed care systems, with specific requirements for nursing facilities. Services must be administered simply and in the best interest of recipients. Under the FFS delivery system, State Medicaid Agencies work directly with providers to set payment rates and policies for medical care. Federal statutes require assurances for access to and quality of care in both FFS and managed care systems, with specific requirements for nursing facilities. Payments must be efficient, economical, and of high quality, ensuring enough providers are available. Medical evaluations and written care plans are necessary for certain individuals and services. States must also survey and certify nursing facilities to ensure standards are met for staffing, service delivery, and resident rights protection. Additional safeguards were implemented under BBA-97 to address concerns about potential harm to beneficiaries under managed care. The federal statute includes provisions for Medicaid managed care, such as coverage of emergency services, grievance resolution, capacity and services demonstration, and quality assurance standards. Nationwide, enrollment in Medicaid managed care has significantly increased over time, with 60.7% of 44.4 million Medicaid eligibles enrolled in managed care in June 2004. Counting the number of beneficiaries enrolled in managed care is challenging due to multiple enrollment arrangements within one year. In FY2003, 64% of roughly 52 million Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide had managed care expenditures, with various enrollment arrangements including PCCM, HMO, and specialty services from PHPs. In FY2003, 64% of Medicaid beneficiaries had managed care expenditures, with different enrollment arrangements including HMOs, PHPs, and PCCMs. Among the elderly, about one-third had managed care experience, mostly through PHPs only. Individuals with disabilities had managed care experience, mainly through PHPs only or both HMOs and PHPs. Children had the highest percentage of managed care experience, with nearly 80% enrolled in various managed care plans. In FY2003, 64% of Medicaid beneficiaries had managed care expenditures, with enrollment in HMOs, PHPs, and PCCMs. Among children, nearly 80% had managed care experience, mostly with HMOs or both HMOs and PHPs. Adults also had managed care experience, primarily with HMOs or both HMOs and PHPs. State-by-state data shows high percentages of beneficiaries with managed care experience, mostly in HMOs and PHPs. Additional detail on types of PHPs is available in Tables 3 and 4. In June 2004, data analyzed showed that there were 119 Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs) in 18 states, with most plans offering mental health services only or a combination of mental health and substance abuse services. Additionally, there were 34 Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plans (PAHPs) in 13 states, with the majority of beneficiaries enrolled in plans providing transportation services. Data limitations hinder accurate accounting of managed care versus fee-for-service spending patterns under Medicaid. Monthly fees paid to case managers for care management are counted as managed care expenditures, while medical services and specialty care are paid on a fee-for-service basis. Despite two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries having experience with managed care, expenditures for managed care services are overshadowed by FFS benefit expenditures. In FY2003, total federal and state spending on Medicaid services reached $233.2 billion, with nearly 84% for care provided under the FFS delivery system. Long-term care accounted for over one-third of total benefit expenditures, while prescription drugs made up nearly 15%. Managed care only represented 16% of total Medicaid service expenditures in FY2003, with Arizona being an exception where nearly 85% of all Medicaid benefit spending was for managed care. In Arizona, 85% of Medicaid benefit spending was for managed care, with a statewide waiver since 1982. Other states had less than half of total service expenditures for managed care, with variation across states. HMO plans dominated Medicaid managed care expenditures, while PHPs exceeded 20% in twelve states. Seven states had all Medicaid managed care spending for PCCM programs. National Medicaid benefit expenditures varied by delivery system and beneficiary type. Expenditures under the FFS delivery system dominate Medicaid benefit spending for the elderly and individuals with disabilities in FY2003, with most of the spending allocated to long-term care services. For adults and children, about two-thirds of total benefit expenditures occurred under the FFS delivery system, mainly for acute and primary care services. Medicaid managed care expenditures were primarily for HMO plans. Total benefit expenditures by type of managed care and beneficiary for FY2003 are shown in Table 8. In FY2003, Medicaid managed care expenditures were mainly for HMO plans, with nearly 30% spent on services for individuals with disabilities. State variation in managed care participation and expenditures is common, influenced by political, geographic, and market factors. States are redesigning Medicaid programs and experimenting with managed care, including new benefit packages under DRA. Recent examples of new Medicaid programs in Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, and West Virginia offer tailored benefits for different groups of beneficiaries based on their healthcare needs. These programs, whether through waivers or the DRA option, target healthy individuals, the elderly, those with disabilities, and those needing institutional care. Beneficiaries may have the option to opt out and enroll in employer-sponsored or private health insurance with capped payments. Most programs will initially launch in select counties. In Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, and West Virginia, new Medicaid programs offer tailored benefits based on healthcare needs. Beneficiaries can opt for employer-sponsored or private health insurance with capped payments or remain in traditional Medicaid. Incentives like access to additional benefits or credits for healthy behaviors are provided. Managed care delivery systems will be used in these programs, with enhanced benefits subject to conditions like signing a member agreement for compliance with medical treatment and wellness behaviors. Challenges remain for serving the elderly and individuals with disabilities under traditional managed care models. Long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities poses challenges under traditional managed care models due to the intensive services required and changing needs over time. Setting adequate payment rates is difficult, making it hard to attract managed care plans to this market. Mainstream managed care plans lack experience in delivering long-term care services to these special needs populations. Medicaid managed care has shown some evidence of cost savings, but the success in reducing program costs and providing better, coordinated care varies. Medicaid managed care has shown evidence of cost savings, particularly in prepaid models compared to fee-for-service. Savings are seen in programs serving individuals with disabilities, mainly from decreased inpatient utilization and moving prescribed drugs to managed care. While not as effective as employer-based or Medicare plans, improvements have been noted in recent years. The National Committee for Quality Assurance regularly reports on commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid managed care plans. The National Committee for Quality Assurance reports on commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid managed care plans, with higher effectiveness of care and member satisfaction ratings for commercial and Medicare plans compared to Medicaid plans. All three types of plans struggled with antidepressant medication management. The National Committee for Quality Assurance reports on higher member satisfaction for Medicaid plans compared to commercial and Medicare plans. Congress could expand Medicaid managed care to improve long-term care and integrate primary, acute, and long-term care for special needs populations. Monitoring access and quality of Medicaid managed care programs, as well as assessing costs and savings, are also suggested. The curr_chunk discusses the costs and savings of managed care programs for different Medicaid beneficiaries. It includes reports on integrating Medicare and Medicaid services, trends in long-term care spending, consumer-directed services under Medicaid, and the role of Medicaid in providing services to dual eligibles."
