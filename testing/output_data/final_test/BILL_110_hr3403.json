    "content": "The Act titled \"New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008\" or \"NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008\" amends the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 to include a duty for IP-enabled voice service providers to provide 911 and enhanced 911 services. IP-enabled voice service providers must offer 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 services to subscribers as required by the FCC. They have the right to access necessary capabilities for providing these services at the same rates and conditions as commercial mobile providers. The FCC requires IP-enabled voice service providers to offer 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 services to subscribers under regulations issued by the Commission. Providers have the right to access necessary capabilities for these services at the same rates and conditions as commercial mobile providers. The FCC mandates IP-enabled voice service providers to offer 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 services to subscribers. Providers must have access to necessary capabilities at the same rates and conditions as commercial mobile providers. Additionally, providers must register with the Commission and establish a point of contact for public safety and government officials. Regulations may be modified as needed due to market or technological changes. The FCC may delegate enforcement of regulations to State commissions for IP-enabled voice service providers to comply with obligations and exercise rights. Implementation limitations prevent the Commission from issuing regulations requiring certain actions. The FCC can enforce regulations through State commissions for IP-enabled voice services. State authorities have the power to impose fees on commercial mobile and IP-enabled voice services. The State, political subdivision, Indian tribe, or village can impose fees on 9-1-1 services for IP-enabled voice services, with accountability reports required for transparency. The Commission must report annually on the collection and distribution of fees for 9-1-1 services, ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, they may compile a list of public safety answering point contact information. The Commission may compile a list of public safety answering point contact information, providers of selective routers, testing procedures, and types of services supported by public safety answering points to assist IP-enabled voice service providers in compliance. They may also develop standards in cooperation with public safety organizations and industry participants to promote consistency in procedures. Practices to promote consistency in procedures for IP-enabled 9-1-1 calls include defining coverage areas, network diversity requirements, call-handling during outages, certification/testing for answering points, location validation procedures, and address information delivery formats. The New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 does not limit the Commission's ability to enforce Federal actions related to IP technologies. The New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 does not limit the Commission's ability to enforce Federal actions related to IP technologies, including defining IP-enabled voice service and its obligations for providing 9-1-1 services. SEC. 102. Migration to IP-enabled emergency network. Section 158 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to require a national plan for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network within 270 days of the enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to require a national plan for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network within 270 days of the enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008. The plan should outline benefits, identify barriers and funding mechanisms, ensure network availability, include location technology, propose a timetable and costs, suggest legislative language, and recommend any necessary legislative changes. The curr_chunk provides recommendations for legislative changes to facilitate a national IP-enabled emergency network, assesses experiences of public safety authorities with trial deployments, identifies solutions for providing 9-1-1 access to those with disabilities, and analyzes efforts to provide automatic location for enhanced 9-1-1 services. The curr_chunk discusses the consultation process required for developing a plan to achieve automatic location for enhanced 9-1-1 services, involving various stakeholders such as public safety community, technology providers, and emergency communications providers. TITLE II--PARITY OF PROTECTION\n\nSEC. 201. LIABILITY. Amendments to the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 include changes to provide service provider parity of protection, expand the definition of emergency communications providers, and update requirements for using wireless 9-1-1 service.
