    "content": "During the Obama and Trump administrations, there was a focus on increasing U.S. natural gas production and exports, including to the Caribbean. The Caribbean Energy Security Initiative was created in 2014 to promote clean energy, such as natural gas. The U.S. Department of Energy proposed a rule in 2017 to expedite small-scale LNG exports to the Caribbean, which is a relatively small natural gas market. The Caribbean consumed 792 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2016, with interest in U.S. LNG exports for economic, geopolitical, and environmental reasons. U.S. companies target Caribbean countries for small-scale LNG export projects, aiming to displace Venezuelan fuel oil and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the region. The DOE's proposed rule supports greater natural gas use in the Caribbean to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Small-scale LNG export facilities meeting specific criteria could qualify for expedited approval, deemed to be in the public interest under the Natural Gas Act. Senator Bill Cassidy introduced S. 1981 to amend the NGA for an expedited approval process for such projects. The proposed legislation and rule by DOE would expedite approval for small-scale LNG export facilities in the public interest. Eagle LNG Partners Jacksonville LLC is awaiting approval but does not qualify for expedited process under the proposed rule. U.S. natural gas prices were rising in the early 21st century, leading to the construction of LNG import terminals. During the early 21st century, rising U.S. natural gas prices led to the construction of LNG import terminals in preparation for increased demand. Domestic producers also innovated, bringing shale gas to market with improved technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. This made shale gas economically competitive, leading to large-scale U.S. LNG exports. Despite a 24% growth in U.S. natural gas consumption, production outpaced consumption, prompting companies to turn to exports via pipeline to Mexico and as LNG to other parts of the world. The United States increased natural gas production, leading to exports via pipeline to Mexico and as LNG to other countries. In 2016, LNG shipments from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal marked the beginning of large-scale exports. There is a debate on whether the U.S. should prioritize using natural gas domestically for power generation and transportation, or continue exporting it. The U.S. increased natural gas production, leading to exports via pipeline to Mexico and as LNG to other countries. LNG shipments from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal began large-scale exports in 2016. The U.S. is debating whether to prioritize domestic use of natural gas for power generation and transportation or continue exporting it. Prices are not expected to reach the 2008 peak until 2042, leading to modifications and expansions of existing LNG terminals for increased export capacity. The DOE approved 20.56 bcf per day of export capacity to non-FTA countries in September 2017. Small-scale projects within capacity limits were also approved, along with additional capacity to FTA countries. Companies have applied to export LNG primarily to destinations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, with most applications approved. In total, approximately 66 applications have been received to export LNG from the United States. Approximately 66 applications have been received to export LNG from the United States. Most of these involve shipments from small-scale LNG liquefaction plants using ISO certified tank containers, allowing for transportation via rail, truck, and conventional container ship. Some proposed projects include constructing new LNG liquefaction plants or custom-built tankers for delivery. The United States has received 66 applications to export LNG, with small-scale exporters targeting customers in the Caribbean basin for industrial and power use. Exporting LNG and building terminals require federal authorization under the NGA, with parties needing to file for export authorization with the DOE. The NGA requires federal authorization for LNG exports, with FTA countries automatically deemed in the public interest. Non-FTA exports require a public interest determination by DOE. FERC must approve LNG terminal projects. There is no specified threshold for public interest evaluation, and all projects undergo the same process. Compliance with additional state, tribal, or requirements may be necessary. The approvals required by DOE and FERC for LNG exports and terminal projects are separate federal actions subject to environmental review under NEPA. Federal agencies must consider environmental impacts before making a final decision. Project information gathered during the NEPA process informs the agency's decision. DOE considers the impacts of natural gas exports under NEPA and determines if it is in the public interest. FERC conducts a separate NEPA analysis for terminal projects. The NEPA process involves a detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) if significant impacts are expected, or an environmental assessment (EA) to determine the need for an EIS. Categorical exclusions (CEs) apply to projects with no significant impacts, and DOE and FERC have specific regulations for project approvals and review levels. DOE is authorized to approve actions that require different levels of NEPA review, such as projects needing an EIS for major new pipelines, EA for minor construction, and CEs for minor operational changes. If a project requires FERC approval, FERC leads the NEPA review process with DOE as a cooperating agency. The NEPA review process involves FERC as the lead agency and DOE as the cooperating agency. DOE typically adopts FERC's NEPA document for terminal projects. FERC's decision on the level of NEPA review may impact DOE's expedited approval process for export approvals. If FERC determines a terminal project cannot be approved with a CE, DOE may also reject the export approval. The US would lead global LNG export capacity if all approved projects were operational. Global LNG market competition is increasing with a projected 43% rise in liquefaction capacity by 2025. Non-US projects are more advanced than US projects. Trinidad and Tobago's decline since 2008 is mainly due to the decrease in U.S. LNG imports. Most LNG is sold under long-term contracts tied to oil prices, which are necessary to finance liquefaction facilities. U.S. natural gas prices being market-based give U.S. LNG export projects an advantage over oil-indexed prices. This could prompt other countries to delink their natural gas exports from oil prices. Japanese companies are interested in a natural gas-based pricing mechanism to reduce costs and oil price exposure. Recent declines in global oil prices have narrowed the oil-indexed versus gas-indexed price differential, impacting U.S. LNG export projects targeting Asian demand centers. The Panama Canal expansion has boosted U.S. competitiveness in Asia, where higher gas prices are paid. Europe, reliant on Russian pipeline gas, may face pressure to decouple gas prices from oil due to U.S. LNG exports. This could offer alternative supply options for countries heavily dependent on a single supplier. Most companies seeking permits to export LNG have applied to export to countries without an FTA. Exports to FTA countries are considered \"in the public interest\" under the NGA. About 40% of non-FTA applications have received final approval. South Korea is the only major importer of LNG among FTA countries. LNG export projects need the ability to export to non-FTA countries for financial viability. The Dominican Republic is the only Caribbean country with an FTA with the U.S. and an LNG import terminal. The United States negotiated trade agreements for LNG exports with Asian and European countries during the Obama Administration. However, the Trump Administration withdrew from the TPP and the future of T-TIP is uncertain. Concerns have been raised about potential restrictions on LNG exports, especially for NATO members. Legislation has been proposed in previous Congresses to prioritize certain countries for U.S. LNG exports. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Article XI prohibits restrictions on imports and exports, with exceptions for natural resource conservation and human health protection. Restricting LNG exports may put the United States in a contradictory position. The United States may face contradictions in its stance on free trade if it restricts LNG exports, especially considering its successful case against China for limiting rare earth elements exports. LNG exports from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction project have increased significantly, with exports going to 26 countries, including non-FTA countries. In 2016, continental U.S. exports were 184 bcf, rising to 410 bcf in 2017. Caribbean countries like Barbados, Dominican Republic, and Jamaica imported LNG, with Puerto Rico being the largest importer in the region. Most Caribbean LNG imports come from Trinidad and Tobago. Puerto Rico faces challenges in importing LNG due to the Jones Act, which restricts the use of LNG tankers. As a result, Puerto Rico has been importing LNG in cryogenic containers from the continental United States since 2014, receiving approximately 0.50 bcf of natural gas."
