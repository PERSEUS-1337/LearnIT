    "content": "Transfer reinforcement learning (RL) aims to improve learning efficiency by utilizing knowledge from other source agents trained on relevant tasks. The challenge lies in transferring knowledge between different environmental dynamics without access to the source environments. The proposed approach, MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR), addresses this by aggregating actions from source policies to maximize target task performance and learning an auxiliary network to predict residuals for improved expressiveness. MULTIPOLAR demonstrated effectiveness in various environments, envisioning a future where robotic systems share policies for quick task learning. Robots with different dynamics could provide policies to a new robot, even without access to their specific dynamics factors. In scenarios where individual robot experiences are unavailable, transferring knowledge from a group of robots to a new one quickly by leveraging their policies is crucial. This approach in transfer learning for reinforcement learning domains presents a challenge, especially when dealing with multiple instances of an environment with varying dynamics. In transfer learning for reinforcement learning, the challenge lies in efficiently learning the policy of a target agent using only the collection of source policies. The target agent does not have access to information about source environmental dynamics and the source policies are not optimized for the target environment. Existing work on transfer reinforcement learning between different environmental dynamics is not applicable due to the lack of access to source environment instances or their dynamics for training a target policy. Meta-learning approaches that train an agent on a diverse set of tasks cannot be used here. Techniques utilizing a collection of source policies are also not a promising solution as they assume source policies have the same conditions. The proposed solution, MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR), aims to address the limitations of existing transfer reinforcement learning methods by adaptively aggregating actions from multiple source policies to maximize expected return in a target environment. Additionally, an auxiliary network predicts a residual to enhance the expressiveness of the target policy. MULTIPOLAR offers advantages for adapting to unseen environmental dynamics and can be applied to various scenarios. The proposed solution, MULTIPOLAR, can be used for both continuous and discrete action spaces with few modifications. It assumes identical environment structure between the source and target environments, while dynamics/kinematics parameters are different. MULTIPOLAR is evaluated in various environments, showing significant results. The proposed approach, MULTIPOLAR, leverages multiple source policies to train a target policy in different environmental dynamics, showing significant improvement in sample efficiency compared to baselines. The approach works well even when some source policies perform poorly in their original environment. In the proposed approach MULTIPOLAR, multiple source policies are used to train a target policy in various environmental dynamics, leading to improved sample efficiency compared to baselines. The method remains effective even when some source policies underperform in their original environment. The goal is to train a new target agent's policy efficiently using multiple source policies, without prior knowledge about the source policies, in different environmental dynamics. The Multi-Source Policy Aggregation (MULTIPOLAR) method formulates a target policy \u03c0 target by adaptively aggregating deterministic actions from source policies and predicting residuals. This approach aims to maximize the expected return in an RL loop for both continuous and discrete action spaces. The MULTIPOLAR method formulates a target policy by adaptively aggregating actions from source policies and predicting residuals. It aims to maximize the expected return in an RL loop for continuous and discrete action spaces. The adaptive aggregation function produces a baseline action based on the current state, emphasizing informative actions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Additionally, an auxiliary network is used to predict residuals around the aggregated actions. The MULTIPOLAR method utilizes an auxiliary network, F aux, to predict residuals around the aggregated actions from source policies. F aux improves target policy training by correcting useful actions for higher expected returns and learning the target task while leveraging F agg as a prior for guided exploration. The function is formulated with trainable parameters \u03b8 aux for F aux, adapting actions from multiple source policies for flexibility. The MULTIPOLAR method utilizes an auxiliary network to predict residuals around aggregated actions from source policies, improving target policy training for higher expected returns. The output of the network can be viewed as un-normalized action scores, from which a discrete action can be sampled. The study aims to demonstrate the sample efficiency of the MULTIPOLAR policy and investigates factors affecting its performance. The number of source policies is set to 4 for experiments, following guidelines for fair comparisons and reproducibility. The study compares the MULTI-POLAR policy with standard MLP and RPL methods for RL. Transfer RL or meta RL approaches are not suitable as baselines due to their training requirements. The study evaluated the effectiveness of the MULTIPOLAR policy on six OpenAI Gym environments, including Roboschool Hopper, Ant, InvertedPendulumSwingUp, Acrobot, CartPole, and LunarLander. The environments were chosen based on their flexible parameterization, action space, and categories in OpenAI Gym. For each of the six environments, 100 environment instances were created by randomly sampling dynamics and kinematics parameters. An MLP policy was trained for each instance, with three MULTIPOLAR and three RPL policies trained for each environment. The process was repeated three times with different random seeds to reduce variance in results. The aim of conducting a large number of experiments in six environments was to gain insights into performance distribution. Detailed analysis of MULTIPOLAR components was focused on Hopper due to its crucial role in agent performance. Experiments were conducted using Stable Baselines implementation with default hyperparameters and MLP network architecture. Based on the performance of learning algorithms, policies were trained with Soft Actor-Critic in LunarLander and with Proximal Policy Optimization in other environments. The only difference between MLP and MULTIPOLAR was the aggregation part, allowing evaluation of transfer learning based on adaptive aggregation. Random seed optimization was avoided to prevent altering policies' performance. Sampling efficiency of training policies was measured to evaluate how quickly training progresses. The evaluation method used the sample bootstrap method to estimate statistically relevant 95% confidence bounds of the results. MULTIPOLAR outperformed baseline policies in terms of sample efficiency and episodic reward in various environments. For example, in Hopper, MULTI-POLAR with K = 4 achieved a mean of average episodic reward about three times higher than MLP. MULTIPOLAR with K = 4 showed significantly higher episodic rewards compared to MLP and RPL. Ablation study demonstrated the importance of adaptive weights and state-dependent MLP in improving performance. The full version of MULTIPOLAR outperformed degraded versions, highlighting the importance of adaptive aggregation and predicting residuals. Source policies in the Hopper environment varied in performance, affecting MULTIPOLAR's sample efficiency. Two pools of source policies, one high-performing and one low-performing, were compared in terms of episodic rewards. The study compares different pools of source policies to the original MULTIPOLAR in terms of performance. It shows that high-quality policies are not always available, and MULTIPOLAR can learn to suppress low-performing policies. The number of source policies affects MULTIPOLAR's sample efficiency, with performance improving as the number increases up to 16, but at the cost of longer training and inference times. In practice, balancing speed and performance trade-off by using multiple source policies before reaching the inference time limit is suggested. The work falls under transfer RL, training a policy for a target task using information from source tasks. Limited research exists on transferring knowledge between agents in different environmental dynamics, with some methods using training samples from source tasks to measure environment similarity. The proposed MULTI-POLAR method allows knowledge transfer through policies acquired from source environments, beneficial when environments cannot exchange information. Leveraging multiple policies from the literature of policy reuse frameworks aims to provide nearly-optimal solutions. The MULTI-POLAR method enables knowledge transfer by reusing policies from different environments to achieve nearly-optimal solutions. However, in cases where environmental dynamics vary, simply reusing a single policy without adaptation is not effective, as shown in experiments. Hierarchical RL, including option frameworks, utilizes a hierarchy of policies for temporal abstraction. Hierarchical RL approaches, such as option frameworks, use a hierarchy of policies for temporal abstraction. Recent works have explored meta-learning hierarchies of sub-policies and adopting residual learning to improve hand-engineered policies' performance. These approaches focus on robotic tasks in continuous action spaces, while our approach can handle both continuous and discrete action spaces with various source policies. Our approach can handle both continuous and discrete action spaces with various source policies, but may not scale well with a large number of source policies. Future directions include pre-screening source policies and exploring other environmental differences like dissimilar rewards and state/action spaces. The proposed transfer RL approach, MULTIPOLAR, efficiently trains policies using diverse source policies without access to varied environmental dynamics. It shows high sample efficiency across different environments. Experimental details for six environments are provided without hyperparameter tuning, using default parameters. Roboschool implementations of Hopper, Ant, and InvertedPendulumSwingup were used for reproducibility. Future work aims to adapt the approach to more challenging domains like real-world robotics tasks. The experiments were conducted using an open-source engine and GNU Parallel tool for parallel processing. Hyperparameters were detailed in Tables 5 and 6, with normalization of rewards and input observations for successful training. Sampling ranges were defined to ensure stability for training MLP policies. The mean of average episodic rewards was calculated in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. The mean of average episodic rewards in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 was calculated by averaging rewards over episodes for a specific number of training samples denoted as T. The average rewards were computed for each experiment, and then the average episodic rewards of all experiments were collected. The mean and 95% confidence bounds were estimated using the sample bootstrap method. The study utilized the Facebook Bootstrapped implementation to analyze episodic rewards. Environment instances were generated by sampling parameters, and histograms of final rewards were illustrated. An example in the Hopper environment showed the learning of aggregation parameters for policies. MULTIPOLAR successfully suppressed low-performing policies during training. In the Hopper environment, MULTIPOLAR (K=4) was evaluated with randomly initialized source policies and low-performing source policies. The study found that the sample efficiency of MULTIPOLAR with low-performing source policies is comparable to that with randomly initialized source policies."
