    "content": "Science and technology (S&T) are crucial for economic growth and national priorities like public health, environmental protection, and defense. Federal policies impact S&T advancement through funding R&D, establishing regulatory frameworks, and influencing private sector activities. This report provides an overview of key science and technology policy issues. The report introduces science and technology policy issues for the 116th Congress, covering background information and selected policy issues. It includes sections on federal funding of research, disruptive technologies, and the America COMPETES Act. The report also discusses the roles of each branch of the federal government in S&T policymaking. The federal S&T policymaking enterprise involves various stakeholders in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. It addresses issues related to disruptive technologies, the America COMPETES Act, academic research oversight, technology transfer, workforce adequacy, STEM education, and innovation-related tax policy. Federal responsibilities in S&T policymaking are decentralized, with Congress enacting laws to establish, refine, and eliminate programs and policies. The federal S&T policymaking enterprise involves various stakeholders in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Congressional authorities related to S&T policymaking are diffuse, with many House and Senate committees having jurisdiction. The President formulates annual budgets, policies, and programs for consideration by Congress, while the Office of Science and Technology Policy advises on S&T issues. Executive agency responsibilities for S&T policymaking are also decentralized. The federal government supports scientific and technological advancement through various agencies with broad or specific S&T responsibilities. Federal court decisions impact S&T policy, industries, and evidence admissibility. Federal R&D funding has historically supported scientific and technological development across various national interests. Between FY2008 and FY2013, federal R&D funding decreased by $9.3 billion, sparking concerns about its long-term impact on U.S. technological innovation. Federal R&D funding has been a topic of debate for over half a century, with concerns about its impact on U.S. technological leadership, innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and job creation. Funding reached a high of $155.0 billion in FY2017 but was still below the 2010 peak in constant dollars. Concerns have been raised about reductions in federal R&D funding, especially in comparison to other nations like China. Members of Congress are also worried about the level of federal funding given the current fiscal condition. The 116th Congress faces challenges in prioritizing federal R&D funding amidst pressure to limit discretionary spending. Low or negative growth may require reallocating resources across disciplines, programs, or agencies. Congress plays a key role in defining the nation's R&D priorities and funding distribution. The rapid pace of technology innovation is impacting the global economy and human behavior. Disruptive technologies, like smartphones, combine different technologies to create new, convergent technologies with broad economic and social impacts. The widespread use of smartphones and other disruptive technologies like social media, cloud computing, and AI has had significant economic and social impacts globally. These technologies have reshaped industries and human behavior, presenting both opportunities and challenges for policymakers to address. The rapid advancement of disruptive technologies like social media, cloud computing, and AI presents complex policy issues for Congress to address. Questions arise on how Congress can support the growth of these technologies, prioritize investments, incentivize research and development, and respond to international economic competition. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 was enacted in response to concerns about U.S. competitiveness, authorizing federal activities in research, education, and innovation. Congress faces challenges in balancing investments in disruptive technologies with potential negative impacts on societal goals, privacy, security, workforce, and economic opportunity. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 authorized federal research, education, and innovation activities. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 extended and modified provisions, but appropriations have been below authorized levels. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act reauthorized and modified certain provisions. The 116th Congress may consider additional provisions from the COMPETES acts. The COMPETES acts, authorized for NSF and NIST, aim to maintain US leadership in scientific and technological innovation. Concerns about slipping leadership led to increased funding for research and STEM education activities. The COMPETES acts authorized federal STEM education activities, ARPA-E, and prize competitions. Critics question the need for programs to increase STEM workers, prefer alternative approaches to improve U.S. competitiveness, and object to the financial costs associated with the acts. The federal government allocates one-third of its research and development spending to federal laboratories each year. The technology and expertise from these labs may have broader applications beyond their original research goals. Congress has established mechanisms to support this, primarily through the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and subsequent legislation aim to facilitate technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector for further development and commercialization. This transfer is crucial for meeting social needs, promoting economic growth, and enhancing national welfare and security. Technology transfer can take various forms, including partnerships, joint research activities, and licensing government-owned patents to private firms. Despite past efforts to improve effectiveness, challenges remain in enhancing technology transfer from federal laboratories. The transfer of federal technologies from laboratories to the private sector remains restrained despite past efforts. Critics argue that working with federal laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, while proponents believe that federal laboratories are open to partnerships. The need for additional legislative initiatives and incentives to encourage technology transfer is debated. In December 2018, the National Institute of Standards and Technology proposed strategies to improve technology transfer to the private sector. The curr_chunk discusses strategies to accelerate technology transfer to the private sector, including building an entrepreneurial R&D workforce and engaging with technology development experts. Congressional approval may be needed for some actions. The adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce has been a long-standing concern for Congress. Congress has enacted programs to support scientists and engineers, improve STEM skills, and increase foreign S&E workers. The debate on the U.S. S&E workforce focuses on computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. The analytical focus on the U.S. S&E workforce includes various occupations such as engineers, physical scientists, life scientists, S&E managers, technicians, and social scientists. Different stakeholders have differing views on the adequacy of the workforce, including debates on shortages, skills mismatches, and the role of government intervention versus market forces. Labor economists use key indicators to assess occupational labor shortages. The term \"STEM education\" refers to teaching and learning in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Policymakers have a strong interest in STEM education, with popular opinion suggesting that U.S. students struggle in these subjects compared to students in other countries. Data shows mixed results, with some improvements over time but potential gaps in certain areas. Various assessments of federal STEM education efforts have yielded different perspectives. The federal STEM education effort includes between 105 and 254 programs across 13 to 15 agencies with annual appropriations of $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion. The national conversation on STEM education often revolves around concerns about the science and engineering workforce, with debates on the shortage of STEM workers and the benefits of increasing STEM abilities in the workforce. Some scholars oppose using education policy to boost the supply of STEM workers. Opinions vary on federal STEM education policies, with some questioning the focus on economic outcomes over other values. There are differing views on the scope and emphasis of policies, with some advocating for broad initiatives to improve STEM achievement for all students, while others prefer targeted efforts such as scholarships for high achievers or workforce training in high-demand areas. The 116th Congress may consider new federal policies to promote technological innovation in STEM fields, aiming to address concerns about inadequate growth in high-paying jobs. Potential pathways include faster entrepreneurial business formation, increased domestic R&D investment, greater production of research-derived products and services, and higher employer spending on training. For further information, refer to reports by Boris Granovskiy on STEM education and cybersecurity challenges. Congress can influence high-wage job creation by adopting tax incentives for investment in R&D, worker training, and higher education. Current federal tax law includes provisions for research expenditures and capital gains from qualified small business sales. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) reduced income tax rates for businesses and modified various tax provisions. Some believe the tax cuts alone will create more high-paying jobs, while others doubt that companies will use the savings to invest in domestic production and worker benefits. The 2017 tax revision reduced income tax rates for businesses. Corporations may use tax savings to buy back stock, raise dividends, or acquire firms. The 116th Congress may consider a tax incentive called a patent or innovation box to increase high-paying domestic jobs. This incentive lowers taxes on income from qualified intellectual property use. A patent box could encourage investment in U.S. R&D and production but may have drawbacks like budgetary costs and favoring patented innovations over profitable new technologies. A tax incentive for employers to invest in worker training and education was proposed in the 115th Congress to promote high-paying job growth. Potential drawbacks include rewarding employers for actions they would already take and a lack of evidence of systematic underinvestment in worker training. The 116th Congress will address funding for agricultural research, potential relocation of USDA agencies, and issues related to advances in agricultural biotechnology, including cell-cultured meat development. USDA's Research, Education, and Economics mission area focuses on advancing scientific knowledge in agriculture through research and federal funding to states and local partners. The USDA's research program is funded with nearly $2.9 billion per year of discretionary funding and about $120 million of mandatory funding. The most recent farm bill governs agricultural research programs through FY2023, reauthorizing existing research provisions and authorizing new ones, including the Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) pilot program. AGARDA, under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, will address long-term research challenges in agriculture and food sectors. The Secretary of Agriculture announced a reorganization in August 2018, including relocating NIFA and ERS outside the National Capital Region. The relocation of two science and agricultural economic analysis agencies outside the National Capital Region in 2019 has sparked significant discussion in Congress and scientific organizations. Nearly 135 cities are vying to host the agencies, but an ongoing USDA Inspector General study is evaluating the department's authority and budget for the move. Congress may oversee the process to ensure compliance with federal laws. The 116th Congress may also address issues related to bioengineered foods labeling and regulatory changes for genetically engineered plants and animals. For more information, contact Tadlock Cowan, Analyst in Natural Resources and Rural Development. The 114th Congress passed a bill in July 2016 to establish a national bioengineered food disclosure standard, allowing food manufacturers to use text, symbols, or digital links to identify bioengineered foods. The law covers foods made through conventional genetic engineering and newer techniques. The USDA was required to conduct a study on technological factors affecting consumer access to bioengineered food disclosure through digital methods like codes on food products read by smartphones. The congressionally required study completed in July 2017 addresses the availability of wireless or cellular networks, landline telephones in stores, and factors affecting small retailers, rural retailers, and consumers regarding the disclosure of bioengineered foods. The final rule for implementation by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service has been published, and the 116th Congress may address public issues arising from the new disclosure rule. The development of new technologies for genetically engineering plants, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has raised regulatory issues. The development of new gene-editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 has raised regulatory issues for USDA regarding genetically engineered plants. USDA may not have regulatory jurisdiction over plants created using these new technologies, as they may fall outside the current regulatory framework. This decision poses questions about the regulation of genetically engineered plants developed through traditional breeding techniques. The introduction of new gene-editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 has raised regulatory questions for USDA regarding genetically engineered plants. As these plants become more common, there is a need to revisit the current regulatory framework governing biotechnology in the US. Congress may need to address the regulation of genetically engineered plants created through newer techniques that are not currently regulated under the PPA. Cell-cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat, is produced in laboratories from animal cell-cultures. Technological advancements have made it more cost-effective, with companies scaling up production. There is a debate over regulatory jurisdiction between the FDA and FSIS. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has regulatory jurisdiction over cell-cultured meat, with a debate over labeling requirements for meat products derived from animals raised and slaughtered. The U.S. Cattlemen's Association petitioned for FSIS to establish labeling requirements excluding cell-cultured products, while Congress discussed the issue in April 2018, with USDA Secretary Perdue stating that lab-grown meat would fall under USDA's purview. In May 2018, the House-reported agricultural appropriations bill included a provision for USDA to regulate cell-cultured products made from livestock and poultry cells. In June 2018, FDA claimed jurisdiction over substances used in cell-cultured products and final products for food. In November 2018, USDA and FDA announced joint oversight of cell-cultured food products from livestock and poultry. FDA will manage cell collection and growth, while USDA will oversee production and labeling. This marks the beginning of regulatory framework development for cell-culture meat and poultry, with more details yet to be revealed. The FDA and USDA announced joint oversight of cell-cultured food products in November 2018. The regulatory framework for cell-cultured meat is still evolving, with unresolved issues such as premarket approval, inspection of facilities, and labeling terminology. Further clarification may come through a potential MOU between FDA and USDA. The 116th Congress may face issues related to budget and oversight of the National Institutes of Health, the FDA's role in approving new medicines and laboratory tests, and stem cell-based medicine and genomic editing. NIH received $39 billion in funding for FY2019 for biomedical research, representing a significant portion of federal research and development spending. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) receives a significant portion of federal research funding, with 27 institutes and centers managing research programs. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, the Office of the Director, and a buildings and facilities account. The 21st Century Cures Act authorized four major Innovation Projects at NIH, some in partnership with other federal agencies like the FDA and DOD. The federal agencies, including the FDA and DOD, are involved in various initiatives such as the Precision Medicine Initiative, the BRAIN Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine. The 116th Congress may oversee the implementation of the Innovation Projects authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act. For more information, refer to CRS reports R41705, R43341, and R44720. The FDA regulates the safety of various products and has made regulatory modifications through legislation and administrative actions. The 21st Century Cures Act modified FDA drug and device regulatory pathways to support innovation. FDA has also issued gene therapy draft guidance documents. The FDA issued draft guidance documents for gene therapy clinical trials, as NIH steps down oversight. The agency is addressing challenges in developing nonaddictive medical products for pain and addiction treatment through regulatory mechanisms established in the 21st Century Cures Act. Additionally, an Innovation Challenge was launched to incentivize the development of medical devices for addiction and pain detection, treatment, and prevention, with a focus on cybersecurity risks. The FDA lacks explicit statutory authority for medical device cybersecurity, but manufacturers must comply with Quality Systems Regulations (QSRs) that address risk analysis, including cybersecurity. In October 2018, FDA and the Department of Homeland Security entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to enhance coordination and information sharing on medical device cybersecurity threats. In vitro diagnostics (IVD) are devices used in laboratory analysis of human samples to make healthcare decisions, including genetic tests that analyze genetic material. Most genetic tests are laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has exercised enforcement discretion over the regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) and genetic tests, which have not undergone FDA premarket review or approval for marketing. In October 2014, the FDA published draft guidance on LDT regulation, and in January 2017, it discussed a possible approach to LDT oversight in a discussion paper. Recently, legislative approaches for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests have been under discussion, including the \"Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (DAIA)\" draft bill in 2017 and the FDA's regulatory approach in August 2018. A new draft bill called the \"Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge, IVCT Development (VALID) Act\" was released in December 2018, incorporating FDA feedback. Stem cells, including pluripotent and multipotent types, have the potential to regenerate damaged organs and tissues. Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into over 200 cell types, while multipotent stem cells can become specific types within an organ system. Congress has taken action to boost research and development of clinical applications for stem cells, including pluripotent and multipotent types. The 21st Century Cures Act authorized funding for regenerative medicine research and expedited review for certain therapies. Clinical trials are ongoing for stem cell therapies to treat various diseases, but safety concerns, including potential cancer risks, have been raised. Safety concerns, including potential cancer risks, have been raised regarding stem cell therapies. The FDA and FTC have taken actions against clinics offering unapproved treatments. The 116th Congress may consider boosting research and development of stem cell therapies while ensuring their safety. Policymakers may also address the rising use of unapproved treatments. Scientists have developed a gene editing tool known as CRISPR, which offers easier use, more precision, and lower costs compared to previous technologies. Many believe CRISPR could lead to significant advances in medicine, public health, agriculture, and the environment. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) projects a rapid increase in biotechnology products enabled by CRISPR in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, and the environment. CRISPR has accelerated the development of genetically modified crops and is being used in human clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, ethical concerns have been raised, particularly after a Chinese scientist claimed to have used CRISPR to modify human embryos, sparking a debate on genetic engineering ethics and regulations. The use of CRISPR technology in genetic engineering has raised ethical concerns and prompted discussions on regulations in the United States. Federal funds are currently restricted from being used for research involving human embryos, and the FDA is prohibited from using funds to review clinical research on gene editing in embryos. Some researchers are exploring CRISPR to control mosquito populations and reduce malaria transmission. The potential benefits and consequences of CRISPR technology need further examination by policymakers in the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, policymakers may examine the benefits and risks of CRISPR gene editing, including ethical and social implications, regulation, research, and economic competitiveness. Congress may also consider harmonizing CRISPR-related policies with other countries. In the 116th Congress, policymakers may consider federal government actions on climate change and water resources. Science and technology topics include federal expenditures, climate change science, GHG technology, infrastructure investment, climate change impacts, and carbon sequestration. Federal funding for climate-related S&T was nearly $17 billion in FY2016, spread across 16 agencies. In the 116th Congress, federal funding for climate-related science and technology totaled approximately $6.7 billion, with 42% allocated to tax incentives for technology deployment and 45% for clean energy technology. Climate change-related science received 15% of the funding, primarily supporting satellites and computing infrastructure. Congress has not reduced appropriations for these programs as proposed by the President's budgets for FY2018 and FY2019. The 116th Congress will revisit appropriations for climate change-related programs and incentives. Congress may scrutinize recent scientific assessments on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change effects, including the Climate Science Special Report. The US Global Change Research Program's report concluded that human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are the main cause of unprecedented climate changes. The Fourth National Climate Assessment highlighted the impact of human-induced climate change on US communities through extreme weather events and rising temperatures. The NCA4 projects increasing disruption to infrastructure, economic, and social systems, with impacts unevenly distributed across the US and globally. Climate change is projected to affect the US economy, trade, and other essential interests. Stakeholders differ on the manageability of climate change impacts. Decades of federal investment in global change science have informed these assessments. The 116th Congress may prioritize understanding scientific foundations for recent U.S. and international climate assessments, including attribution of changes to human-related GHG emissions. Deliberations may focus on appropriations for federal climate-related science programs and balancing observations, analysis, and public accessibility to information. Contact Jane A. Leggett for more information. A large majority of federal climate change-related expenditures is focused on advancing clean energy. Human-related greenhouse gas emissions mainly come from fossil fuel production, distribution, and combustion, primarily as carbon dioxide and methane. Scientists agree that reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to near zero is necessary to halt climate change, with the total impact depending on cumulative emissions. Analysts suggest a decades-long path involving efficiency improvements, decarbonization, and electrification of economies to stabilize climate change. The potential options for efficiency improvements, decarbonization, and electrification in various sectors could offer security and health benefits. Costs may vary depending on investments in research and development. Some view carbon capture technologies as crucial for reducing CO2 emissions while maintaining the use of fossil fuels. Others suggest exploring CO2 removal or geoengineering technologies and international governance regimes to address rapid climate change. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to near zero at affordable costs while sustaining economic growth. To achieve near-zero GHG emissions affordably, the 116th Congress may consider federal support for new technologies, including whether to be neutral or favor certain technologies, efficient federal intervention in RDD&D, and effective policies to push supply or incentivize demand for low- or no-GHG technologies. Uneven RDD&D funding has focused on advancing fossil fuel combustion and renewable energy. The research aims to advance various technology types related to energy, including fossil fuel combustion, renewable energy, efficiency, storage, vehicles, nuclear energy, and the electricity grid. Different incentives are used to promote these technologies, with a focus on both supply-push and demand-pull approaches. Cleaner energy technologies offer public health and climate benefits, but transitions in the energy economy can present challenges to workers and communities. Congress may need to address federal expenditures, program performance, and policy priorities for climate change technologies. Contact Jane A. Leggett for more information. Leaders in Congress and President Trump are interested in federal investment in infrastructure. Evaluating options for infrastructure should consider linkages with climate change. Infrastructure decisions should consider the impact on long-term GHG emissions and potential climate change effects on infrastructure-related costs and public health. This includes modernizing the electric grid to account for future policies and extreme weather events. Infrastructure choices can influence future U.S. GHG emissions and costs for decades, either locking in certain technologies or allowing flexibility. Infrastructure choices can impact future U.S. GHG emissions and costs by supporting flexibility for technological options. For example, pipeline infrastructure is crucial for CCUS technology deployment in industries. Transportation decisions, energy types, and land use patterns influenced by infrastructure can have long-term effects on fossil fuel consumption. Infrastructure plays a crucial role in reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing resilience to climate change, especially in the face of more frequent and severe extreme weather events. Future infrastructure investments need to consider projected climate changes to ensure adequacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness in the long term. Congressional decisions may need to focus on implementing technical specifications or incentives to strengthen infrastructure against climate-related damages. The federal government may consider implementing technical specifications or incentives to enhance the resiliency of long-lived infrastructure. Policy choices could increase upfront costs but lead to benefits like avoiding future losses and damages from climate change. For more information, refer to various CRS reports on energy and environmental policy. In light of recent scientific assessments and federal outlays for relief and recovery following extreme weather events, Congress may review federal programs for S&T to support adaptation or resilience to projected climate change. Some issues related to infrastructure technology are discussed above, and there are additional considerations for addressing climate change impacts. Technological R&D needs for adaptation and resilience to climate change include new crop seed varieties, floodwater management, advanced air conditioning technologies, wildfire management techniques, and climate forecasting advancements. Improved understanding of human behavior can also aid in adaptation. Congress may address the federal role in supporting S&T for effective decision-making on climate change adaptation and resilience. This could involve providing access to scientific research, climate projections, impact assessments, and adaptation decision tools. The federal government's role in supporting climate change adaptation and resilience includes providing access to scientific research, climate projections, impact assessments, and adaptation decision tools. Congress may review efforts to incorporate climate change projections into federal agency management. Effective agency decisions depend on the use of scientific information and available technologies. The curr_chunk discusses various reports on risk reduction and climate change, including topics such as drought, energy-water nexus, sea-level rise, and highway reconstruction. It also mentions carbon capture and sequestration as a method to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is gaining interest in Congress for converting CO2 into products like chemicals, fuels, cements, and plastics. Direct air capture (DAC) removes CO2 from the atmosphere. CCS involves capturing, transporting, and injecting CO2 underground, with capturing being the most costly step. Emerging technologies for carbon utilization and DAC are energizing CCS advocates, but challenges remain in market size and effectiveness in mitigating climate change. The challenge for Direct Air Capture (DAC) is to reduce the cost per ton of CO2 removed. Congress has allocated over $5 billion for CCS activities at DOE since FY2010. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget proposed shifting away from CCS R&D. Globally, two power plants capture CO2 in large quantities for enhanced oil recovery. The 115th Congress enacted a tax provision to increase the tax incentives for CCS projects. The 116th Congress may explore the impact of the amendment to Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which increases the tax credit for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) projects in the United States. Stakeholders believe these changes could significantly boost CCS development. Further legislative changes may be considered to accelerate the deployment of CCS technology. For more information, contact Peter Folger, Specialist in Energy and Natural Resources Policy. Federal research activities and facilities cover a wide range of water-related topics, including developing, using, and protecting water supplies and aquatic ecosystems. The government funds water research through grants to universities and researchers, and agencies have sponsored prize competitions for water data and technologies. Interest in innovative technologies and practices has increased due to drinking water contamination and recent natural disasters. The 116th Congress may consider water research and technology topics, focusing on water and aquatic ecosystem information, water infrastructure and use, and water quality. The 116th Congress may consider water monitoring infrastructure, science programs, weather and climate science, and water conditions in rivers and along coasts. Water infrastructure research includes improving existing coastal and inland water infrastructure and developing next-generation technologies. Research topics involve water augmentation technologies like stormwater capture, water reuse, desalination, and groundwater recharge. Technologies for monitoring and rehabilitating aging infrastructure, water efficiency, and enhancing infrastructure resilience to natural hazards are important for public health and environmental protection. Research focuses on preventing contamination and treating emerging contaminants like cyanotoxins and PFASs in drinking water, surface water, and groundwater. Innovative technologies and practices are being developed to protect water quality, prevent contamination, and manage emerging contaminants like harmful algal blooms and PFASs in drinking water systems. This includes real-time monitoring, treatment to minimize disinfection byproducts, lead pipe corrosion control, and methods to increase resilience against natural disasters. For further information, contact specialists in natural resources and environmental policy. The Department of Defense relies on science and technology for national defense, with a focus on research and development for new military systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a robust research and development effort to develop new military systems and improve existing systems, spending over $90 billion annually on RDT&E. Roughly 80%-85% is allocated to designing, developing, and testing specific military systems like aircraft carriers and fighter jets, while the remaining 15%-20% is dedicated to the DOD's Science and Technology Program, which includes activities from basic science to new technology demonstrations. The Department of Defense's RDT&E program aims to maintain U.S. military superiority through technological advancements. Congress oversees the program's budget, making adjustments based on justification and larger budgetary needs. Priorities and focus remain consistent, with attention on funding for basic research and technology transition. The Department of Defense is focused on maintaining U.S. military superiority through technological advancements, with a priority on funding for basic research and technology transition. Concerns have been raised about the impact of budget constraints on RDT&E, as well as the need for increased investment to maintain dominance in military capabilities. There is also a growing concern about the declining share of federal defense-related R&D funding globally, which may affect the ability of the DOD to direct the development of leading technologies. Commercial companies in the U.S. and around the world are leading the development of groundbreaking technologies. The United States and other countries are at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics. The Department of Defense is establishing mechanisms and a culture to access innovative technologies from nontraditional defense contractors to maintain a technological edge for U.S. forces. This reliance on external sources of innovation may be crucial for the development of weapons and other systems. For more information, refer to CRS Report R45403 and CRS Report R44711 by John F. Sargent Jr., Marcy E. Gallo, and Moshe Schwartz. Energy-related science and technology issues before the 116th Congress include reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, advances in nuclear energy technology, biofuels, ocean energy technology, and international fusion research. The debate on nuclear policy revolves around whether spent fuel should be reprocessed to extract plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel or directly disposed of without reprocessing. The debate on nuclear policy revolves around reprocessing spent fuel to extract plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel or disposing of it without reprocessing. Proponents argue that reprocessing could recover substantial energy and reduce long-term radioactive waste hazards, while critics are concerned about the potential for plutonium use in nuclear weapons and the commercial viability of reprocessing. President Carter halted commercial reprocessing efforts in 1977 due to weapons proliferation concerns and slower-than-projected nuclear power growth. During the Reagan Administration, Congress funded a breeder demonstration project but stopped funding in 1983. Clinton largely halted research on nuclear energy reprocessing, while George W. Bush renewed federal support for reprocessing. Obama halted plans for a pilot plant and redirected DOE's research towards various nuclear fuel cycle approaches. The Trump Administration proposed deep reductions in Fuel Cycle R&D in FY2018 and FY2019, but funding was increased to $264 million in FY2019. The level of funding for nuclear fuel cycle and waste disposal R&D may be a continuing issue in the 116th Congress. Another DOE project related to reprocessing policy is the uncompleted Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Department's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina was intended to produce fuel for commercial nuclear reactors using surplus nuclear weapons plutonium. Critics argue that the project would undermine U.S. nonproliferation efforts. Due to escalating costs, both the Obama and Trump administrations proposed halting the project and pursuing alternative plutonium disposition options. Energy Secretary Rick Perry certified in May 2018 that terminating MFFF would result in cost savings. The cost-saving requirement for terminating the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) was met in May 2018. $220 million was appropriated in FY2019 to begin shutting down the project. Termination of MFFF could lead to a shift in plutonium disposition policy towards other options like dilution and disposal in a deep repository. R&D funding for these alternatives may be an issue for the 116th Congress. The United States primarily uses light water reactor (LWR) technology in nuclear power plants, but research is ongoing for advanced nuclear technologies with potential safety, waste management, and cost advantages. Private-sector firms are also working on commercializing advanced nuclear energy technologies such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, liquid metal-cooled reactors, and molten salt reactors. DOE's Advanced Reactor Technologies program focuses on research for advanced reactor coolants, materials, controls, and safety. The DOE's Advanced Reactor Technologies program received $111.5 million for FY2019, with $20 million allocated for research on microreactors. Private-sector nuclear technology companies are pushing for a new licensing and regulatory framework for advanced reactors to overcome obstacles in commercialization. NRC and DOE are working on implementing a Joint Advanced Non-Light Water Reactors Licensing process. The NRC and DOE are implementing the Joint Advanced Non-Light Water Reactors Licensing Initiative to adapt design criteria for advanced reactors. NRC issued guidance for this on April 9, 2018. Legislation to promote advanced nuclear power technologies was signed into law on September 28, 2018, allowing DOE national laboratories to host reactor demonstration projects and providing grants for NRC licensing of advanced reactor designs. The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (P.L. 115-439) was signed into law on January 14, 2019, authorizing grants for NRC licensing of advanced reactor designs. Congress appropriated $65 million in FY2019 for early-stage development of a versatile advanced test reactor. The 116th Congress may consider additional legislation for funding R&D, licensing, and demonstration of advanced reactors. Biofuels, derived from biomass feedstock, are seen as an alternative to conventional fuels. There is debate over their feasibility due to concerns about environmental impact, land use, and production costs. Policymakers must consider various factors when evaluating the potential of biofuels. The debate over biofuels is complex, with Congress showing interest in first-generation biofuels like cornstarch ethanol. Farm bills have influenced biofuel research, with funding debates between USDA and DOE for biofuel initiatives. While first-generation biofuels are established, commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol is still in its early stages. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires a minimum volume of biofuel in U.S. transportation fuel, with a focus on advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. However, there are concerns about RFS compliance and the EPA's ability to issue waivers, leading to uncertainty and challenges in meeting advanced biofuel targets. The existing motor fuel distribution infrastructure and limited fleet of vehicles built to run on biofuels may hinder the production and use of biofuels as required by the statute. The 116th Congress may consider modifying biofuel promotional efforts or maintaining the status quo. Technological innovations drive U.S. ocean energy development, enabling exploration of new resources and cost efficiencies. For more information, contact Kelsi Bracmort, a specialist in Natural Resources and Energy Policy. Technological innovations drive U.S. ocean energy development, enabling exploration of new resources, cost efficiencies, and advancements in emerging sectors like offshore wind. Private industry, universities, and government collaborate on ocean energy R&D, with federal support from the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior. Safety improvements in deepwater oil and gas operations focus on efficiency, cost reduction, drilling technologies, automated monitoring, and maintenance to prevent catastrophic oil spills. The Department of the Interior (DOI) proposed revisions to offshore drilling regulations in 2018 to reduce industry costs and streamline technological requirements. Stakeholders debate compliance costs and the effectiveness of safety measures. Congress may address technology challenges in Arctic drilling, including the development of ice-capable drilling units. DOI finalized safety regulations for Arctic exploratory drilling in 2016. President Trump's Executive Order 13795 ordered the Department of the Interior (DOI) to review safety regulations for Arctic exploratory drilling. Some argue that the regulations are costly for industry and do not give enough weight to available safety technologies. Wind energy is the only renewable ocean energy source poised for commercial use in U.S. waters, with a focus on increasing offshore turbine efficiency and reducing costs. The first U.S. offshore wind farm off Rhode Island began operations in December 2016. Research is also exploring floating turbines for deep waters to maximize resources and minimize user conflicts. Research is being conducted to improve electrical infrastructure for offshore wind development and other ocean renewables. Congress may need to consider how to support or incentivize these projects. ITER, an international fusion energy research facility, is under construction in France and will be the world's largest when completed. For more information, contact Laura Comay, a Specialist in Natural Resources Policy. ITER is under construction in Cadarache, France to become the world's largest fusion reactor, capable of producing more energy than it consumes. It is an international collaboration involving the United States, the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. The U.S. initially withdrew from the project in 1998 due to cost and scope concerns but rejoined in 2003. The European Union is responsible for 45% of the construction cost, while the U.S. and other countries contribute 9% each. The United States contributes 9% to the construction of ITER, with most of its share being in-kind contributions. The facility is expected to be completed in 2027 and have a lifespan of 15-25 years. U.S. funding for ITER has faced challenges due to management issues, schedule delays, and cost growth, leading to proposals in Congress to terminate participation. The U.S. cost share during operation and decommissioning is 13%, with concerns that funding for domestic fusion energy research may be affected. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that the United States should remain an ITER partner for gaining experience with burning plasma. They also suggested starting a national program for research leading to a compact fusion pilot plant. The DOE Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee is working on a strategic plan for ITER and domestic research, with a report expected in late 2020. The 116th Congress may oversee ITER's progress, cost, and schedule. The 116th Congress may oversee ITER's scientific progress, cost, and schedule, and consider issues related to homeland security research and development, including developing new medical countermeasures and ensuring laboratory safety. The Department of Homeland Security has identified five core missions. The Department of Homeland Security oversees research and development activities to safeguard cyberspace, ensure resilience to disasters, and address nuclear and radiological threats. Coordination of DHS R&D is a congressional interest, with challenges in department-wide oversight highlighted by the Government Accountability Office. In 2014, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization. In 2014, DHS was directed to implement new policies for R&D prioritization. GAO reported in 2014 that DHS had updated its guidance for R&D but lacked policy guidance for department-wide R&D oversight. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 highlighted DHS's lack of coordination in R&D activities. DHS introduced a new budget structure in 2016 to include Research and Development accounts for each component. DHS has reorganized its R&D activities multiple times, including establishing the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office in 2017. The 2018 Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act authorized this office's activities. The 116th Congress may review the implementation of this act. The anthrax attacks in 2001 emphasized the nation's vulnerability to biological terrorism, prompting increased federal efforts in response. The federal government responded to increased threats of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) terrorism by creating programs to develop medical countermeasures. Despite efforts, there are still gaps in countermeasures for CBRN threats like Ebola. BARDA and Project BioShield support the development and procurement of new CBRN medical countermeasures. Project BioShield funds the advanced development of countermeasures through contracts with private sector developers, providing a procurement mechanism to remove market uncertainty. Congress has made modifications to improve performance, efficiency, and transparency of these programs. Key unresolved issues include appropriations, interagency coordination, countermeasure prioritization, and implementation of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy. Congress may need to consider the balance of funding throughout the research and development pipeline and whether planning and transparency requirements have enhanced coordination effectively. The coordination of the multiagency countermeasure development enterprise has been enhanced by planning and transparency requirements. Congress may need to consider the balance between addressing traditional threats like anthrax and smallpox and emerging infectious diseases like Ebola. Additionally, Congress should assess the progress of implementing the National Biodefense Strategy and its impact on medical countermeasure research and development. The federal government also addresses the safety of laboratory personnel working with infectious microorganisms through guidance such as Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. The Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) oversees the possession of certain biological pathogens and toxins with the potential to cause harm. Biosecurity requirements were first mandated by Congress in 1996 to protect against intentional and unintentional releases of pathogens. Compliance with Biosafety Levels set by the Department of Health and Human Services is required for work with high-risk pathogens. Facilities handling select agents must register with the Federal Select Agent Program and follow best practices. Access to select agents requires FBI background checks. Incidents of mishandling select agents have occurred, including smallpox virus found in an FDA lab and lapses in protocol at CDC labs with anthrax, avian influenza, and Ebola. Recommendations include improving safety culture and standardizing handling practices. Improvements in laboratory safety culture, standardized microbial handling practices, and better incident reporting have been recommended by various entities. The Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) ensures secure handling of designated pathogens for research purposes. The 2018 Farm Bill amended regulations for animal and plant pathogens, considering the impact on disease research. The 116th Congress may continue oversight of the FSAP program. The 116th Congress may choose to continue oversight of the FSAP program, as reports show ongoing occupational exposures in regulated facilities. Congressional policymakers face issues related to cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, broadband deployment, public safety networks, and quantum information science. The federal policy framework for cybersecurity is complex, with over 50 statutes and presidential directives. The 116th Congress may face significant cybersecurity issues related to critical infrastructure, cybercrime prevention, national security in cyberspace, and federal investments in information systems. Long-term challenges include addressing design issues in information protection. The 116th Congress may face cybersecurity challenges related to critical infrastructure, cybercrime prevention, national security, and federal investments in information systems. Long-term challenges include designing information systems with built-in security, correcting economic incentives for cybersecurity, finding consensus on effective cybersecurity models, and navigating the rapidly evolving cyberspace environment. The curr_chunk discusses the evolution towards greater security, focusing on disruptive technologies and the rapid development of artificial intelligence. It provides further information on cybersecurity resources and reports available from various specialists. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has garnered interest from policymakers in the 115th Congress.

AI encompasses various methodologies and applications like machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, with uses in sectors such as transportation, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance. Activity related to AI is expected to continue in the 116th Congress. AI technologies are currently categorized as \"narrow AI,\" tailored to specific tasks. The development of \"general AI\" that can adapt across cognitive tasks may take decades. Policy considerations for AI cover workforce impacts, funding balance, international competition, standards, and testing. The development of standards and testing for AI systems, federal coordination efforts in AI, and considerations for AI in the defense space, including human and automated decision-making in military operations and engagement with the private sector. For further information, contact Laurie A. Harris, Analyst in Science and Technology Policy. The deployment of broadband infrastructure in the U.S. has been viewed by Congress as a way to improve regional economic development and create jobs, especially in rural areas where the lack of adequate broadband availability is most pressing. This lack of availability is due to the high costs of serving large geographical areas with low population densities, which reduces economic incentives for telecommunications providers to invest in and maintain broadband infrastructure and service. Broadband adoption challenges persist, especially among low-income, senior, minority, less-educated, nonfamily, and nonemployed populations. The 116th Congress may address issues like transitioning the Universal Service Fund to broadband, funding for Rural Utilities Service programs, infrastructure legislation for broadband buildout, data accuracy, wireless spectrum policies, and internet regulation. The 116th Congress may consider revising the regulatory framework for telecommunications and broadband infrastructure to enhance deployment and adoption while minimizing government intervention. This could involve revising the 1996 Telecommunications Act and the Communications Act of 1934 to create incentives for investment and subscribership. The debate over broadband access revolves around ensuring an open internet and unfettered access to content, services, and applications for consumers. Discussions also focus on potential restrictions on network owners to maintain competition and private sector investment. \"Net neutrality refers to restrictions on internet network owners to ensure equal access and nondiscriminatory treatment. Some argue for specific regulations to prevent abuses, while others believe existing laws are sufficient and additional regulations could hinder internet expansion.\" The FCC's regulations on broadband internet access providers have shifted from the 2015 Order to the 2017 Order, which reduces oversight and reclassifies services. This change has sparked debate on net neutrality and its impact on internet expansion. The FCC's shift from the 2015 Order to the 2017 Order has reignited the debate on the appropriate framework for an open internet. Congress is divided on whether to support a less regulatory approach or a more stringent regulatory framework to protect net neutrality principles. Some argue for stimulating broadband investment, while others advocate for stricter regulations to safeguard content providers and consumers. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 authorized the FCC to allocate spectrum for public safety use and created the First Responder Network Authority. Congress is debating whether to amend existing laws to address anticompetitive practices in telecommunications services. Angele A. Gilroy's reports provide further information on access to broadband networks and the net neutrality debate. The First Responder Network Authority, known as FirstNet, was established to improve communication for first responders after the challenges faced during 9/11. AT&T was selected as the partner to deploy the network, but concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in the deployment process. Policymakers are worried about the proprietary nature of the contract and state plans, which could make it difficult for Congress to ensure compliance with the law. Given the federal investment in the First Responder Network project and the importance of the network to first responders and citizens, Congress may need to continue oversight. Local officials issue emergency alerts using commercial or federal alerting systems like IPAWS. The false alert of an incoming ballistic missile to Hawaii in January 2018 raised questions about alerting roles and responsibilities, particularly regarding the use of commercial alerting systems in California wildfires. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of cell phone alerts issued through IPAWS and the potential for over-alerting and mass evacuation. The Federal Communications Commission adopted rules in January 2018 to improve geo-targeting of wireless emergency alerts (WEA) to cell phones. The 116th Congress may examine alerting procedures, invest in local alerting capabilities, and consider back-up alerting systems in case of communication failures. For more information, contact Jill Gallagher, Analyst in Telecommunications Policy. The newest fifth-generation (5G) technologies offer improved speeds and greater bandwidth to meet the rising demand for mobile data. These technologies enable providers to expand services to consumers and support new systems for industrial users. When fully deployed, 5G is expected to power the Internet of Things and support emerging technologies. 5G is driving the development of new technologies and creating new markets and jobs. Countries are supporting the deployment of 5G technologies, with the US government allocating spectrum and streamlining regulations. The 116th Congress may monitor US competitiveness in the global 5G market and consider policies to expedite deployment. The 116th Congress may consider concerns related to 5G deployment, including local authority over cell sites, deployment to rural areas, and data privacy. The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a focal point of debates, involving networks of objects with unique identifiers and internet connectivity for automated control of processes. The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting various sectors such as agriculture, health, and transportation by connecting systems to the internet. The development of 5G wireless technologies is expected to expand opportunities for growth in IoT devices, potentially contributing trillions of dollars to economic growth over the next decade. The IoT is expected to drive growth in various sectors like agriculture, energy, government, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. The federal government may play a crucial role in enabling IoT development through R&D, standards, regulation, and support for testbeds and projects. Multiple agencies have responsibilities related to IoT, including the Departments of Commerce, Health, Energy, Transportation, and Defense, as well as the National Science Foundation, FCC, and FTC. Congressional activities may focus on a range of issues related to IoT. The range of issues for congressional activity related to IoT includes security, privacy, standards, IPv6 transition, software updates, energy management, and federal government involvement in development and regulation. The Internet of Things (IoT) growth will require coordination among government departments and agencies. The rise of e-commerce and digital economy has led to the emergence of new business models. Some jurisdictions, primarily in Europe, have implemented digital services taxes (DSTs) on certain activities and markets. Spain and the United Kingdom are implementing digital services taxes (DSTs) on revenues from online activities targeting large global digital economy companies. The EU is also considering a digital tax. This issue may interest Congress as it primarily targets U.S. corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, raising concerns about unilateral foreign taxation efforts and potential issues for U.S. foreign tax credit. Some Members of Congress may support digital services taxes (DSTs) to address perceived unfairness in tax payments by digital economy firms. Alternative remedies like the GILTI tax on foreign-source income have also been proposed. For more information, contact Sean Lowry, Analyst. Changing technology presents opportunities and challenges for U.S. law enforcement, with some advances providing valuable information while others create hurdles. Law enforcement faces obstacles such as strong encryption, data retention limits, and companies' technological constraints. The tension between law enforcement capabilities and technological change has been a longstanding issue. This includes challenges such as data retention limits, companies' constraints in providing specific data to law enforcement, tools for online anonymity, and a complex network landscape. Congressional attention has been drawn to this issue for decades, with past conflicts like the \"crypto wars\" in the 1990s. Congress has also considered proposals to build vulnerabilities into encrypted devices and restrict the export of strong encryption code. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA; P.L. 103-414) in 1994 to help law enforcement maintain their ability to execute authorized electronic surveillance as telecommunications providers turned to digital and wireless technology. There are ongoing debates about amending CALEA to apply to a broader range of entities providing communications services. The \"going dark\" debate has evolved from focusing on real-time communications to accessing stored content, impacting law enforcement's ability to intercept data. Some officials urge the technology community to assist law enforcement in accessing certain data, while law enforcement entities are enhancing their technology capabilities. Law enforcement entities are enhancing their technology capabilities, while policymakers are considering legislation in response to concerns about access to communications and data. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program is the primary source of federally-funded IT research in the United States. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program, established with the HPCC Program Act of 1991, coordinates multi-agency R&D efforts with a $5 billion annual investment. Federal support for IT R&D has led to positive outcomes, long-term research, and open standards, contrasting with industry's focus on proprietary products. The NITRD Program, funded through appropriations to its individual agencies, may influence industry research directions, leading to concerns about government intervention in technological development. Critics argue that the government should not be picking \"winners and losers\" in the market. The program's outcomes benefit government, industry, academia, and the public by fostering a synergistic environment for research. Quantum information science (QIS) has the potential to provide capabilities beyond current technologies, with applications in sensing, communications, computing, and simulation. Government interest in QIS dates back to the mid-1990s, with workshops held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the DOD. The government's interest in Quantum Information Science (QIS) dates back to the mid-1990s when workshops were held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the DOD. QIS has been a component of the National Strategic Computing Initiative since 2015, with policy opportunities including a science-first approach, workforce development, industry engagement, infrastructure support, national security, economic growth, and international cooperation. The United States is not alone in its increasing investment in QIS R&D. The United States is not alone in its increasing investment in Quantum Information Science (QIS) research, with major research centers worldwide also pursuing QIS. China and the European Union have the largest foreign QIS programs, while countries like Russia, Germany, and Austria are also making strides in QIS R&D. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) highlighted the need for a collaborative effort in five policy areas for effective U.S. QIS R&D policy. These areas include institutional boundaries, education and workforce training, technology and knowledge transfer, materials and fabrication, and the level and stability of funding. These policy considerations remain relevant in 2019 and may inform legislation in the 116th Congress. For further information, contact Patricia Moloney Figliola, Specialist in Internet and Telecommunications Policy. The 116th Congress may address policy issues in physical and material sciences, including funding and oversight of the National Science Foundation and nanotechnology research. The NSF supports basic research, education in nonmedical sciences, and engineering, with a budget of $7.77 billion in FY2018. Congress has a long-standing interest in NSF funding levels and direction. Some policymakers advocate for large funding increases for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to ensure U.S. competitiveness, while others argue for steady, reliable funding over longer periods. Some policymakers oppose additional funding due to the federal deficit, while some prefer directing funds to more applied research. The 116th Congress may address policy issues related to NSF funding, including prioritizing physical sciences and engineering, supporting multidisciplinary funding, managing large-scale projects, increasing mid-scale research infrastructure, ensuring research reproducibility, and evaluating NSF's use of nonfederal personnel. Other federal policy issues for NSF focus on scientific independence, accountability, and geographic distribution. The National Science Foundation (NSF) faces policy issues related to funding, including prioritizing physical sciences and engineering, supporting multidisciplinary funding, managing large-scale projects, increasing research infrastructure, ensuring reproducibility, and evaluating the use of nonfederal personnel.

It plays a crucial role in semiconductors, improving chip speed, size, and energy use. Nanotechnology has also increased storage density in flash memory and computer hard drives. Nanotechnology has the potential for revolutionary advances in various fields such as healthcare, energy, and water filtration. Public investments in nanotechnology R&D have led to the development of new materials and products. President Clinton initiated the National Nanotechnology Initiative in 2001, with over $24.0 billion appropriated for nanotechnology R&D by Congress through FY2018. Congress appropriated $24.0 billion for nanotechnology R&D through FY2018. President Trump requested $1.4 billion for FY2019. Legislation was enacted in 2003 to establish programs and agency responsibilities. The 116th Congress may focus on R&D funding, U.S. competitiveness, and environmental concerns related to nanotechnology. The 116th Congress may address space policy issues including funding and oversight of NASA, commercialization of space, and Earth-observing satellites. Congressional interest in spaceflight dates back to NASA's establishment in 1958, with key issues being NASA's human spaceflight program, budget constraints on other missions, and the future of NASA's Earth Science program. NASA's Earth Science program is a key focus for the 116th Congress, which may address space policy issues through NASA reauthorization legislation. Since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spacecraft for crew transport to the International Space Station. NASA is pursuing a two-track strategy for human spaceflight, supporting commercial development for transport to low Earth orbit and developing capabilities for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. Commercial crew transportation services are expected to become operational in late 2019 or 2020. NASA is developing a new crew capsule called Orion and a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS) for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The first crewed test flight is scheduled for 2023. Plans for a Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) in lunar orbit have been announced, accessed via Orion and the SLS. Commercial space developments, like SpaceX's plans for lunar and Mars flights, may impact NASA's human spaceflight plans. NASA's human spaceflight plans may be influenced by new commercial capabilities in space, leading to potential public-private partnerships. Funding for the International Space Station is set to end by 2025, with a shift towards public-private partnerships and commercial contracts. The 116th Congress may need to reevaluate NASA's budget expectations and make corresponding program changes. Concerns arise that the cost of human spaceflight activities could impact funding for other NASA missions, such as unmanned science satellites and space technology development. Congressional interest is particularly focused on NASA's Earth Science program, which includes climate research. NASA's Earth Science program, with a focus on climate research, is a major congressional interest. Some argue for higher priority for other NASA activities or transferring Earth Science responsibilities to other agencies. Supporters emphasize the importance of space-based Earth observations in NASA's science mission. U.S. companies have a long history as contractors for government space agencies, but there is a growing trend towards commercial space activities, with a majority of U.S. satellites now commercially owned. Space is increasingly commercial, with a majority of U.S. satellites now owned and launched by commercial entities. Congressional and public interest in space is shifting towards commercial activities, including reusable rockets, Earth-imaging satellites, and private spaceflight. \"New space\" companies are focused on various markets such as national security satellites, commercial satellite launches, Earth imaging, satellite communications, and space tourism. Multiple federal agencies regulate these activities. The commercial space industry is regulated by multiple federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Federal Communications Commission. The 115th Congress considered legislation to simplify regulations, and the Administration called for changes in Space Policy Directive-2. The 116th Congress may continue to focus on regulatory reforms. The 116th Congress may focus on regulatory reforms for commercial space use, with agencies evolving to contract with commercial providers for services like cargo delivery and satellite communications. New opportunities include acquiring weather and science data from commercial sources, and expanding commercial use of the ISS. Congressional oversight and budget decisions may address these developments. For more information, contact Daniel Morgan, Specialist in Science and Technology Policy. The U.S. government's Earth-observing satellites collect data on various activities such as polar ice sheet mass changes, ocean wind speeds, land cover changes, and atmospheric parameters for weather forecasts. This data is valuable for agriculture, wildfire detection, and El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a predictions. Congress is interested in the performance of NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey in building and operating Earth-observing satellites. They are concerned about meeting budgets and time schedules to avoid delays and cost overruns. The successful launch of the JPSS-1 satellite has alleviated concerns about a \"data gap\" in polar-orbiting weather satellite coverage. The GOES-R weather satellite, now renamed GOES-16, was launched on November 19, 2016, with advanced sensors to improve hurricane tracking, severe weather prediction, and flood warnings. It also carries the first operational lightning mapper in geostationary orbit and monitors space weather. Its successor, GOES-S, launched on March 1, 2017, and is undergoing calibration before becoming operational in January 2019 as GOES-17. GOES-17, formerly known as GOES-S, experienced issues with its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) after launch, affecting its functionality. Despite this problem, NASA expects GOES-17 to provide improved data compared to current satellites. The satellite is part of a series of four Earth-orbiting weather satellites planned by NOAA through 2036. The 116th Congress may review budget and schedules for weather satellites and explore private sector involvement in Earth-observing satellite data.
