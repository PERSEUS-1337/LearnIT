    "content": "The six capital punishment decisions during the 2005-2006 Term involved issues such as challenges to lethal injection protocol, constitutionality of death penalty statutes, new evidence of innocence, witness testimony, and State laws. During the 2005-2006 Term, the Supreme Court addressed various issues related to capital punishment, including challenges to lethal injection protocol, constitutionality of death penalty statutes, and the admissibility of third-party guilt evidence. The Court affirmed death penalty sentences in three cases and kept alive appeals in three others. Additionally, the Court unanimously held that the use of lethal injection in Florida raised concerns under the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court addressed challenges to lethal injection protocol under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, distinguishing between habeas corpus petitions and civil rights violations. The Court reversed lower court decisions, noting that challenges to the circumstances, not the lawfulness of confinement, can be brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court ruled that Florida could still execute Hill by lethal injection using a different method, as he only challenged the specific three-drug sequence. The Court rejected the idea of requiring inmates to suggest alternative execution methods in their complaints. This decision aimed to prevent death-row inmates from blocking their executions by challenging individual aspects of the process. The Supreme Court rejected the idea of inmates suggesting alternative execution methods in their complaints, aiming to prevent delays in executions. The Court noted that filing a section 1983 action does not guarantee a stay of execution, potentially delaying executions as challenges to lethal injection methods are addressed. The Supreme Court, with Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg in the majority, addressed the issue of newly discovered evidence in capital punishment cases. Paul House sought release from death row based on DNA evidence showing innocence. The Court considered the strength of his innocence claim for federal habeas review. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of newly discovered evidence in capital punishment cases. Paul House sought release from death row based on DNA evidence showing innocence. The Court considered the strength of his innocence claim for federal habeas review, suggesting the possibility of executing an innocent person is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court considered newly discovered DNA evidence in capital punishment cases, emphasizing the importance of assessing the impact of evidence on reasonable jurors. Justice Kennedy highlighted the need to consider all evidence, incriminating and exculpatory, when evaluating claims of innocence. The Court found that House's revelation about DNA and blood stains was sufficient to challenge his conviction, but did not address the question of whether executing an \"actually innocent\" defendant is constitutional. The Supreme Court considered newly discovered DNA evidence in capital punishment cases, emphasizing the importance of assessing the impact of evidence on reasonable jurors. Justice Kennedy highlighted the need to consider all evidence, incriminating and exculpatory, when evaluating claims of innocence. Chief Justice Roberts dissented, arguing that despite evidence, the case against House remained substantially unaltered from what was presented to the jury. The judgment upholding the denial of habeas corpus relief was reversed, and the case was remanded for consideration of House's procedurally barred claims. The Supreme Court ruled that South Carolina deprived Bobbie Lee Holmes of a fair trial by not allowing him to present evidence of another possible suspect. The prosecution relied on forensic evidence, but Holmes tried to rebut it with expert testimony suggesting contamination and police framing. The petitioner sought to introduce evidence of another possible suspect, Jimmy McCaw White, who may have committed the crimes or acknowledged the petitioner's innocence. The trial court excluded this third-party guilt evidence based on legal precedents, citing the need for strong forensic evidence of the appellant's guilt. The U.S. Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant's federal constitutional rights are violated by an evidence rule that prohibits the introduction of third-party guilt evidence when forensic evidence strongly supports a guilty verdict. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that evidence rules cannot infringe on a defendant's right to present a complete defense, even if it means excluding evidence with probative value outweighed by other factors. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that trial judges can exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by factors like unfair prejudice or confusion. In a specific case, the South Carolina Supreme Court changed a rule regarding the admission of evidence to show someone else committed the crime, especially when strong forensic evidence points to the defendant's guilt. The critical inquiry in admitting defense evidence of third-party guilt is the strength of the prosecution's case. The rule applied below did not consider the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses or the reliability of its evidence, leading to an arbitrary decision. The rule in South Carolina prohibiting a defendant from raising an alternative theory of a third-party's guilt violates the right to present a complete defense. Justice Alito used Supreme Court decisions as precedent to establish a balancing test for this issue. The Court found that the rule was arbitrary and irrational, as it hindered the defendant's ability to present a complete defense when strong forensic evidence of guilt was presented by the State. On June 26, 2006, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the death penalty in Kansas in a 5-4 decision, ruling that the Kansas' death penalty statute does not violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. Marsh was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death after the jury found three aggravating circumstances. The Kansas Supreme Court found the death penalty statute unconstitutional due to the requirement of a death sentence when aggravating and mitigating circumstances balanced out. This decision came during Marsh's appeal, where he argued for evidence linking the victim's husband to the crime. The Kansas Supreme Court found the death penalty statute unconstitutional because it required a death sentence only when aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances. The court ruled that this process did not align with the Eighth Amendment's respect for humanity. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, reversed this ruling, stating that states have discretion in imposing the death penalty and that the law did not violate the Eighth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Kansas death penalty statute, stating that the state has discretion in imposing the death penalty. The Court ruled that the statute may direct imposition of the death penalty when mitigating circumstances do not outweigh aggravating circumstances, even if they are of equal weight. The Court cited previous cases to support its decision. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Kansas death penalty statute, allowing for individualized sentencing and consideration of mitigating evidence. Justice Souter dissented, arguing that the statute could lead to death sentences in doubtful cases, violating the Eighth Amendment. Justice Souter is concerned about the Kansas death penalty statute, which could result in death sentences in doubtful cases. He worries that mandatory death as a tiebreaker does not consider details of the crime or defendant, especially with the rise of DNA test exonerations. Justice Scalia disputes Justice Souter's claims, stating that many inmates listed as innocent were released for legal reasons, not exoneration. The Supreme Court ruled that Oregon courts are not required to allow new alibi evidence at the sentencing phase of a trial. Oregon tried Guzek for capital murder, where he and associates burglarized a home, resulting in two deaths. Guzek was portrayed as the ring leader by his associates who confessed and testified against him. During the trial, Guzek's associates confessed and testified against him, portraying him as the leader. Despite presenting alibi witnesses, Guzek was sentenced to death by the jury. The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but ordered multiple re-sentencing proceedings due to faulty procedures. The court also ruled against allowing new alibi evidence during sentencing. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments give Guzek the right to present alibi evidence at his upcoming sentencing. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review this issue. Different courts have debated whether the evidence was mitigating or alibi in nature. The Supreme Court decided that Oregon courts are not obligated to allow new alibi evidence during sentencing. The Oregon courts are not required to allow the defendant to introduce new alibi evidence at the sentencing phase, as the issue of innocence had already been litigated. Justices Scalia and Thomas agreed with the decision but expressed disappointment in not addressing the mistaken notion that the Eighth Amendment requires presenting evidence at a capital defendant's sentencing hearing. At his sentencing hearing, Sanders was given the opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning residual doubts about his guilt. The Court affirmed Sanders' death sentence in a 5-4 decision, establishing a new rule regarding invalidated sentencing factors. Sanders was convicted of multiple crimes, including first-degree murder, and found eligible for the death penalty based on special circumstances. The jury sentenced the defendant to death based on special circumstances including murder during a robbery, burglary, witness prevention, and heinous manner. The California Supreme Court set aside two special circumstances but affirmed the death sentence. The Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence despite finding two special circumstances invalid. The Ninth Circuit reversed, stating that California misapplied the law and must either prove the jury's error was harmless or reweigh the factors. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision, ruling that no new trial was constitutionally required despite invalid sentencing factors. The Court established a rule that a jury's finding of an invalid factor taints a death verdict unless valid factors are also found. Sanders' death sentence was deemed not \"skewed\" as existing valid aggravating factors were sufficient. Justices Scalia, Roberts, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas delivered the opinion, while Justices Stevens and Souter dissented. Justices Breyer and Ginsberg dissented, feeling that the majority's new standard complicated the law. They believed that emphasizing invalid findings to the jury could taint the process, even if valid findings were also present."
