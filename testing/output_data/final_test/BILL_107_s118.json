    "content": "The text outlines various Acts related to agriculture, including the Plant Quarantine Act and the Federal Noxious Weed Act. It also defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Agriculture. Penalties for violation are discussed in Section 3. Criminal penalties for violating plant quarantine laws include imprisonment up to 5 years, a fine of up to $25,000, or both, for offenses involving plant pests, large quantities of plants or plant products, or possession with intent to distribute. On subsequent convictions of violating plant quarantine laws, a person may face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $50,000. This includes offenses such as forging certificates or permits under plant quarantine laws. In violation of plant quarantine laws, a person knowingly moving prohibited items into or within the United States with intent to harm agriculture may face 10-20 years in prison, a fine of up to $500,000, or both. For misdemeanors, the penalty is imprisonment for up to 1 year, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Violation of plant quarantine laws can result in imprisonment for up to 3 years, a fine of up to $10,000, or both for multiple offenses. Additionally, criminal forfeiture may be imposed on top of other penalties. The court can order the forfeiture of property used in or derived from a violation, following specific procedures outlined in the law. Proceeds from the sale of forfeited property under specific procedures outlined in the law are used to reimburse various departments and agencies for costs incurred in the forfeiture proceedings. Enforcement efforts lead to property forfeiture proceeds used to reimburse departments and agencies for costs. Violations of plant quarantine laws may result in civil penalties up to $50,000 for individuals. The civil penalties for violations of plant quarantine laws can reach up to $50,000 for individuals, or up to $500,000 for other persons, with factors considered in determining the amount. The Secretary may consider various factors in determining civil penalties for violations, including the nature and gravity of the violation, ability to pay, history of prior violations, and culpability of the violator. The Secretary has the authority to settle civil penalties and any order assessing a civil penalty is final and reviewable under the law. The Secretary may establish guidelines for civil penalties in coordination with the Attorney General to determine when to issue a penalty or warning instead of prosecution for violating plant quarantine laws. Civil penalties accrue interest if not paid in full and are not subject to review when collected. Civil forfeiture is also a possible consequence for violations. Civil forfeiture may apply to property used in or derived from violating quarantine laws, with procedures outlined in title 18 of the United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury delegates duties for seizures and forfeitures under chapter 46 of title 18, US Code to officers designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. Liability for acts of an agent under plant quarantine law is attributed to the person they represent."
