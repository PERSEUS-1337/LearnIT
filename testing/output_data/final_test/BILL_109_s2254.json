    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque is a unique riparian forest in New Mexico, the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, one of the oldest inhabited areas in the US, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. The area adjacent to the bosque provides water to many in New Mexico. It should be maintained to protect endangered species, the river flow, and be more accessible to the public. The Corps of Engineers should prioritize environmental restoration in the Middle Rio Grande bosque to ensure healthy growth of native vegetation and reestablish hydrologic connections. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Middle Rio Grande: portion of Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam to headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico.\n(2) Restoration project: project under this Act for immediate ecosystem restoration, preservation, recreation, and protection benefits.\n(3) Secretary: Secretary of the Army.\n\nSEC. 3. MIDDLE RIO GRANDE RESTORATION. The Secretary will conduct restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande based on feasibility studies and existing plans. Local participation from specified groups is required, and cost-sharing agreements must be established before project implementation. Before carrying out any restoration project under this Act, the Secretary must enter into a cost-sharing agreement with non-Federal interests. The agreement requires non-Federal interests to pay 25% of total project costs through in-kind services or cash contributions, cover 100% of operation and maintenance costs post-enactment, and hold the United States harmless for any liabilities. The Federal Government or a contractor must be held harmless for any claim or damage arising from negligence. Non-federal interests can include nonprofit entities in restoration projects. Recreational features in projects should not exceed 30% of total costs, with non-federal funding required for any excess costs. Non-Federal interests must pay for project costs exceeding the specified amount. They can receive credit towards their share for design or construction work integral to the project. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2007 through 2015."
