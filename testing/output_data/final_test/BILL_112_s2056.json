    "content": "The \"Scofield Land Transfer Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The \"Scofield Land Transfer Act\" defines key terms such as claimant, Federal land, and flood surcharge elevation related to the transfer of land for the construction of Scofield Dam and Reservoir. The \"Scofield Land Transfer Act\" defines terms like Fund, life estate, normal water surface elevation, and property boundary elevation related to the Scofield Dam and Reservoir. The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 corresponds to 1.4 vertical feet below the crest of Scofield Dam. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF SCOFIELD PROJECT LAND. The Secretary will conduct a survey of the Scofield Reservoir Basin and notify claimants of trespass or encroachment on Federal land. The Secretary may convey fee interest in the claimed portion of the land to resolve trespass issues. The Secretary may convey fee interest in the claimed portion of Federal land above the water surface elevation, subject to conveyance requirements. This includes the claimant paying fair market value, the US retaining a flood easement, and deed restrictions. Deed restrictions for structures on conveyed Federal land require securing during floods, rebuilding with original footprint, or repair. Activities must comply with the International Building Code. Life estate granted under deed restrictions on Federal land must comply with the International Building Code or any similar widely used and nationally recognized building code. The claimant must pay fair market value for the life estate and agree to hold the United States harmless for any claims. Before conveying Federal land or granting a life estate, the Secretary must comply with environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The claimant must secure structures on the land to prevent displacement during a flood event. The Act requires compliance with environmental laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Claimants must notify the Secretary within 5 years of their choice to receive a fee interest in the claimed Federal land. Failure to notify the Secretary within 5 years will result in the extinguishment of any future claim on the Federal land. The Secretary will then take action to quiet title to the land, removing any encumbrances. The \"Scofield Reservoir Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to provide enhanced recreation opportunities at Scofield Reservoir. Amounts received for conveyance or granting of a life estate will be deposited into the Fund. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 3 years of this Act's enactment. The report will detail authorized activities, obstacles to transfers of title or life estates, expected completion dates for transfers, and efforts to resolve title disputes on Federal land."
