Current defense approaches have limitations, prompting the investigation of the distinguishability of adversarial examples in this paper. The paper introduces a defensive distinction approach for protecting against adversarial examples in multi-label classification. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show strong distinguishability of adversarial examples, suggesting this approach as a valuable addition to existing defense strategies. Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, are easily fooled by adversarial examples with small perturbations, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms. Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can be misclassified as different targets. This poses a critical challenge to machine learning security and hinders its wide application in domains like computer vision and malware detection. New adversarial example generation methods continue to emerge, allowing attackers to easily deceive machine learning models. Defense approaches like adversarial training and defensive distillation have limitations in countering these attacks. In this paper, the authors propose to investigate the distinguishability of adversarial examples from natural examples and from each other. If adversarial examples can be distinguished, defenders can discard them to protect machine learning models. The authors aim to investigate the distinguishability of adversarial examples to protect machine learning models. By determining if adversarial examples generated by different methods belong to different classes, defenders can enhance model robustness. This classification problem is approached as a multi-label classification task, where identifying adversarial vs. natural examples is crucial. The authors investigate the distinguishability of adversarial examples using a defensive distinction approach. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show high accuracy in distinguishing adversarial vs. natural examples and those generated by different methods. The authors propose a unique defense approach called defensive distinction to distinguish adversarial examples with high accuracy. They recommend considering this approach alongside other defense methods and highlight four main contributions in their research. The authors propose a defense approach called defensive distinction to identify adversarial examples accurately. Various methods like L-BFGS and FGSM are used to generate adversarial examples, leading to the development of more powerful methods like BIM, PGD, and MIM. Other methods like C&W and EAD were also inspired by L-BFGS. On the defense side, adversarial training and defensive distillation are representative approaches to improve the generalization and robustness of machine learning models for the original classification task. Adversarial training uses both adversarial and natural examples for better regularization, while defensive distillation reduces sensitivity to input perturbations by training a distilled network based on probability vectors from the original network. These methods aim to enhance the models' robustness in the face of adversarial attacks. The current models for the original classification task have limitations against various adversarial attacks. Existing defense approaches are not perfect, and attackers often prevail over defenders. Our work aims to address this issue by proposing a defensive distinction protection approach. In adversarial environments, the classification problem is typically viewed as a single-label problem where a model assigns each input a single label from a set of possible classes. State-of-the-art defense approaches do not change this formulation, but our proposed investigation aims to address the distinguishability of adversarial examples from natural examples and from each other, leading to a multi-label classification problem. In adversarial environments, the classification problem is transformed into a multi-label classification problem where each input example is assigned a pair of labels, indicating if it is natural or adversarial. The new problem formulation aims to distinguish between different types of adversarial examples and natural examples, helping defenders identify and handle them effectively. In adversarial environments, multi-label classification helps defenders analyze attackers' behavior by exploring correlations between labels. This analysis can reveal attackers' intentions, such as targeting specific classes or using different generation methods. Such insights are valuable for better protecting machine learning models. The defensive distinction protection approach involves training a model for multi-label classification in adversarial environments to identify and protect against adversarial examples. The training set includes natural and generated adversarial examples with corresponding ground truth values. Various multi-label learning algorithms have different strategies for handling correlations. In this paper, the authors experiment with a first-order strategy for multi-label classification, training three models independently: DDP-Model for distinguishing natural or adversarial examples, Original-Model for classifying objects, and DDS-Model for known adversarial examples. This simple approach serves as a baseline solution for defensive distinction in adversarial environments. The defensive distinction approach is simple in model formulation, computation, and evaluation. Existing defense approaches focus on improving the generalization and robustness of machine learning models against white-box and black-box attacks. The defensive distinction approach involves creating a \"substitute model\" to generate adversarial examples. Factors such as defenders' knowledge about the machine learning model, adversarial example generation methods, and source examples used by attackers complicate the threat model. Scenarios 1 and 2 represent different attacker scenarios. In this study, eight scenario-case combinations are considered to evaluate the defensive distinction approach for generating adversarial examples. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed through three sets of experiments. The effectiveness of the defensive distinction approach is evaluated through three sets of experiments using the MNIST dataset and two different CNNs, LeNet-5 and Basic-CNN. Training is done for different classification tasks with specific parameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. In adversarial example generation experiments using the MNIST dataset, LeNet-5 and Basic-CNN achieve high accuracy. Adversarial examples are created using six different methods, targeting specific digit classes for more damaging attacks. Five adversarial example datasets are generated based on different parameters and source examples. The datasets adv tr, adv C1, adv C2, adv C3, and adv C4 contain adversarial examples generated using different parameters and source examples. Each dataset has approximately 16,200 adversarial examples. These examples will be used to train defensive distinction models based on LeNet-5 and Basic-CNN. Our defensive distinction models, DDP-Model and DDS-Model, are trained based on LeNet-5 and Basic-CNN. The models distinguish between natural and adversarial examples, with testing done using adversarial examples from adv C1 to adv C4. The experiments evaluate the approach for all eight scenario-case combinations from S1C1 to S2C4 in TAB0. The DDP-Model is a binary classifier trained on a mixture of natural and adversarial examples, evaluated for each attack method. The classifier is evaluated on a mixture of natural and adversarial examples from test datasets adv C1 to adv C4. Model accuracy results for different scenarios are given in FIG1, showing high classification accuracy for all methods. The models struggled the most in distinguishing JSMA examples from natural examples but still achieved high accuracy. The models achieved high accuracy for most methods, with some struggling to distinguish JSMA examples. Models for L-BFGS, FGSM, and BIM maintained high accuracy even with unknown parameters. However, MIM, PGD, and JSMA examples had lower accuracy, around 50%. The results in FIG1 show around 50% accuracy for MIM, PGD, and JSMA examples in test cases S1C4 and S2C4, slightly better than random guessing for S1C3 and S2C3. Knowing parameters of adversarial example generation methods is crucial for defenders. Training a DDP-Model with various parameters is beneficial. Model architecture and natural examples used by attackers do not affect defenders' accuracy. The analysis focused on DDP-Model accuracy without considering successful adversarial example misclassification. The DDP-Model significantly reduces the danger rate of successful adversarial examples by over 50% for all test cases and methods. This model acts as a binary classifier to distinguish natural examples from adversarial ones. In experiments, a method is left out to consider AdvGenMethods factor. Training is on adversarial examples from five attack methods with one method excluded, while testing is on examples from all six methods. Left-out classifiers are compared with baseline classifiers. In experiments, a baseline classifier is trained on a mixture of natural and adversarial examples from different attack methods. The accuracy results show high classification accuracy above 90% in most test cases, with some cases still above 80%. In the remaining test cases S1C4 and S2C4, classification accuracy is lower but still above 80% across all methods. Disparities exist between L-BFGS and JSMA examples compared to other methods in evading classification. Models can reduce the danger rate of successful adversarial examples by over 90% for all test cases and methods. Overall, a DDP-Model trained on adversarial examples from multiple methods shows high effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in all test cases. The DDS-Model can distinguish known adversarial examples generated by specific methods, helping defenders understand attacker techniques and exploit weaknesses. The classifier trained on 6,000 adversarial examples from six methods showed high accuracy in known test cases, except for MIM and PGD methods. In unknown test cases, PGD and MIM evaded the classifier, while FGSM had low accuracy. Other methods were classified accurately. The classifier showed high accuracy in known test cases, except for MIM and PGD methods. In unknown test cases, PGD and MIM evaded the classifier, while FGSM had low accuracy. Other methods were classified accurately. The confusion matrices for different cases help explain why PGD and MIM are the most difficult methods for correct classification. In adversarial example generation, it is beneficial for defenders to train a DDS-Model using a variety of parameters. The model architecture and natural examples used by attackers do not significantly impact the accuracy of defenders' models. Two research questions were proposed regarding the distinguishability of adversarial examples, leading to a defensive distinction protection approach. Experiments using the MNIST dataset showed strong distinguishability of adversarial examples. Our work suggests future possibilities such as exploring high-order multi-label learning strategies to understand label correlations, investigating adversarial examples on large tasks like ImageNet, and integrating defensive distinction with other defense approaches. A potential extension to the problem formulation includes adding more labels to represent concepts or semantic meanings in multi-label classification. The training set includes natural and adversarial examples, with the latter having known labels. A more complex formulation correlating to source example labels is not explored in the paper."
