    "content": "The globalization of markets in agriculture has brought both opportunity and uncertainty to U.S. farmers, rural communities, and businesses. Farm support programs were initially developed to support farm income and commodity prices, with less focus on export competitiveness. U.S. agriculture now produces more than needed for domestic demand, leading to increased reliance on foreign markets. Foreign markets are crucial for agriculture's prosperity, with strong demand from developing countries driving export prospects. Competition from nations like Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, the EU, and China poses challenges for U.S. agriculture, even in favorable global economic conditions. Foreign markets are crucial for agriculture's prosperity, with strong demand from developing countries driving export prospects. The EU, China, Russia, Japan, and Korea impose trade barriers that hinder access to their markets for U.S. farm products. These countries are leading customers for U.S. agricultural products, influencing policymakers in developing countries. Farm groups and agribusinesses are aware of the global factors affecting U.S. agriculture. Farm groups and agribusinesses rely on lawmakers and Administration officials to develop U.S. trade policies that reduce foreign-imposed barriers to agricultural exports, hold countries accountable for trade agreements, resolve disputes, and utilize USDA export programs. Some countries have not fully honored trade agreements, leading to concerns and dampening enthusiasm for new agreements. The United States faces challenges in enforcing trade agreements, even when winning disputes at the World Trade Organization. Despite favorable resolutions, some farmers feel international trading rules do not always benefit them. Certain U.S. producer groups advocate for protection of their commodities and stricter restrictions on foreign farm and food imports. The United States imposes lower tariffs on agricultural imports compared to the global average, but restricts certain \"import-sensitive\" products to protect domestic producers. Tariff-rate quotas allow limited duty access for specific foreign goods, with high tariffs on imports exceeding the quota. Safeguards like temporary higher tariffs help domestic producers adjust to increased import competition. The United States has imposed safeguards on imports of lamb meat and wheat gluten to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. However, foreign trading partners argue that free trade should flow in all directions, including into the United States. Other countries have used trade negotiations and dispute settlement procedures in the WTO to enhance their access to the U.S. market for agricultural products. For example, Brazil initiated a case at the WTO against certain aspects of U.S. cotton. Brazil initiated a case at the WTO against certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program in September 2002. Developing countries are concerned about limited access to the U.S. market for import-sensitive commodities and high domestic farm supports in richer countries like the United States and EU member states. Agricultural trade issues are likely to be addressed in legislation and trade negotiations during the 108th Congress. The Bush Administration concluded bilateral FTAs with Chile and Singapore in 2002, with provisions affecting agricultural trade. Agriculture is expected to be a contentious issue in negotiating other FTAs, including with Australia. Some agricultural groups welcome market openings, while producers of import-sensitive commodities will monitor and shape provisions. The Administration prioritizes removing trade barriers within the Western region. The Bush Administration prioritizes negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) to remove trade barriers within the Western Hemisphere, aiming to encompass all trade and services among the region's countries (except Cuba). Crafting rules for agricultural trade liberalization and negotiating details among 34 countries by 2005 will be challenging. The United States is also engaged in multilateral trade negotiations to further liberalize global agricultural trade. The objectives for agriculture in global trade negotiations include improving market access, reducing export subsidies, and cutting trade-distorting domestic support. U.S. agricultural interest groups generally support including agriculture in trade talks for better market prospects. However, some groups, like import-sensitive crop producers, are cautious due to past trade agreements. The negotiations also impact farm bill programs, income support, and export aid. Differences in negotiating positions exist among WTO member countries, particularly between the U.S. and the European Union. The differences in negotiating positions among WTO member countries, especially between the United States and the European Union, and between those two WTO members and developing countries, have led to conflicts over genetically engineered crops and food products. Corn and soybean exports are at risk, with consumer attitudes and regulatory systems differing between the U.S. and its trading partners. Concern is growing over China's slow implementation of agricultural trade agreements. China has been slow to implement agricultural trade commitments, which is critical for U.S.-China agricultural trade development. Progress in resolving these differences has been slow. The 2002 farm bill will soon require country-of-origin labeling on various food items, with proponents arguing for consumer rights and critics questioning the effectiveness of the law. Critics argue that country-of-origin labeling on food does not increase public health protection as all food imports must meet U.S. safety standards. They believe safety should be determined by scientific principles, not geography. Some critics urge Congress to revisit the costly law, while proponents believe the benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers outweigh the costs. Agricultural exports to Cuba are exempt from U.S. sanctions, sparking ongoing debate. Debate continues among policymakers on agricultural sales to Cuba and bilateral trade disputes, including a WTO case by Brazil against certain aspects of the U.S. cotton program. Resolution of the dispute could impact future application of WTO farm subsidy rules and other trade issues important to U.S. agriculture. Resolution of the WTO case in Brazil's favor could lead to recommendations on U.S. cotton program implementation, potentially resulting in compensation or trade sanctions. A U.S. complaint against Canada's wheat trading practices may enhance competitiveness for U.S. wheat in international markets. Import barriers by Russia, Mexico, the EU, and Japan affect U.S. meat and poultry exports. The United States faces barriers from Russia, Mexico, the EU, and Japan impacting meat and poultry exports. Trade tensions have been heightened due to these barriers. Discussions between the US and Mexico on sugar trade issues have stalled. Congress is considering appropriations for Agricultural Export and Food Aid Programs for FY2004. Congress is currently considering FY2004 appropriations for USDA's international activities, focusing on funding levels for agricultural export subsidies, export market development programs, export credit guarantees, and foreign food aid. Agricultural exports are crucial for both the farm and non-farm economy, with significant percentages of U.S. production volume being exported for various crops. Export income plays a vital role in supporting farm income, with each dollar received from agricultural exports stimulating $1.47 in supporting non-farm activities. In 2001, agricultural exports generated $1.47 in supporting non-farm activities for every dollar received. These exports created 740,000 full-time civilian jobs, with 444,000 in the non-farm sector. They account for 7.36% of U.S. merchandise exports, ranking third after electrical machinery and vehicles. U.S. agricultural trade has a positive balance, with leading exporting states being California, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Washington, Indiana, and North Carolina, totaling nearly 60% of exports. Agricultural exports peaked at $43.8 billion in FY1981, then declined to $26.3 billion by FY1986. Exports of U.S. agricultural products reached a peak of $43.8 billion in FY1981, dropped to $26.3 billion by FY1986, and then recovered to nearly $60 billion in FY1996. However, they declined again to $49 billion by FY1999 due to financial turmoil in Asian markets and increased competition. Since then, exports have gradually increased, reaching $52.7 billion in FY2001 and an estimated $53.5 billion in FY2002. The USDA forecasts a value of $57 billion for FY2003. The composition of agricultural exports has shifted towards higher value products since FY1991. Value exports, including intermediate and consumer-ready products, accounted for 65% of total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2001. Various factors influence the level of exports, such as income, population growth, tastes in foreign markets, production, commodity prices, and exchange rates. U.S. agricultural export programs, domestic farm policies, and trade agreements also play a role. The United States is a major importer of agricultural commodities, classified as non-competitive or competitive imports. Non-competitive imports consist mainly of tropical products not produced domestically. Imports of agricultural products in the United States have increased by 83% over the last decade, reaching $41 billion in FY2001. Factors contributing to this growth include the extended U.S. economic expansion, low commodity prices, a strong U.S. dollar, and the effects of trade agreements. Competitive imports accounted for $33 billion (83% of the total), while non-competitive imports made up $6.6 billion (17% of all agricultural imports). A large share of agricultural imports, about 80% on average, compete against U.S. products, generating economic activity in the U.S. economy. These imports provide additional income and employment in food processing, transportation, and related services. Consumers benefit from lower prices, wider product choices, and off-season availability of foods. Free trade agreements like NAFTA aim to liberalize trade by reducing tariffs, quotas, and nontariff barriers between partners. Agricultural trade provisions in bilateral FTAs with Chile and Singapore are contentious. Some groups welcome market openings, while others monitor provisions affecting import-sensitive commodities. Concerns include transition periods, rules of origin, safeguards against import surges, and SPS rules. In 2002, U.S. agricultural exports to FTA candidate countries totaled $5.0 billion. In 2002, U.S. agricultural exports to the 14 FTA candidate countries totaled $5.0 billion, with half going to Central American countries. Agricultural imports from these countries amounted to $5.2 billion, with Chile and Australia being major suppliers. Negotiating agricultural provisions, especially market access and SPS rules, was a contentious issue in the Chile FTA. Trade officials from the United States and Chile agreed to phase out tariffs on agricultural products by 2007, with a 12-year transition period. The agreement eliminates export subsidies and includes an agricultural safeguard provision. Both countries committed to resolving SPS issues. The United States and Chile agreed to phase out tariffs on agricultural products by 2007, with a 12-year transition period. The agreement includes duty-free status for over 75% of U.S. agricultural exports to Chile within 4 years, including pork, beef, soybeans, wheat, feed grains, potatoes, and processed food products. Chile will phase out tariffs on other products within 12 years and eliminate its price-band system for wheat, vegetable oils, and sugar. Chile also agreed to recognize the U.S. meat grading system for beef and pork products. Chile sought improved market access for its agricultural products in the U.S. through the FTA, with immediate tariff reductions on horticultural products. U.S. producers of certain horticultural products requested exclusions or longer transition periods. The agreement grants 95% of Chile's exports duty-free status in the U.S. market within four years. Chile and the U.S. negotiated tariff reductions on wine imports and agreed to eliminate tariffs on wine altogether. Difficulties arose in finalizing access terms for sensitive agricultural products like dairy, sugar, and horticultural items. Resolving details for tariff-rate quotas took time, including quota size, tariff phase-out pace, growth rates, and tariff levels. Sugar access hinges on Chile becoming a net exporter. SPS barriers negotiations ran parallel to market access talks but remain unresolved in the FTA agreement. The FTA agreement between Chile and the U.S. did not resolve SPS issues related to beef and pork exports. The final text did not include language for Chile to accept the U.S. meat inspection system as equivalent to its own. U.S. trade officials will not submit the FTA to Congress until Chile accepts this position. The APAC reported that the FTA will improve U.S. exports of agricultural products by opening the Chilean market. The FTA with Chile aims to boost U.S. agricultural exports by opening the Chilean market and gradually eliminating tariffs. Some commodity advisory committees raised concerns about not having access to the agreement text. In contrast, Singapore, being urban, imports most of its food with zero tariffs on agricultural products. U.S. agricultural and food exports to Singapore were $240 million in 2002. The FTA with Singapore resulted in $240 million in U.S. agricultural and food exports in 2002. Some U.S. commodity groups pushed for rules of origin in the FTA to prevent duty-free treatment of transhipped food products. The APAC reported that these rules would protect U.S. producers from ineligible imports. However, concerns were raised about potential barriers to the U.S. market for sugar-containing products. The FTA with Singapore opens the market for U.S. agricultural products, achieving U.S. negotiating objectives. The Bush Administration is also negotiating FTAs with other countries and regional blocs. Some U.S. agricultural interests are concerned about competitive pressures from free trade agreements. The U.S. is negotiating FTAs with various countries and regional blocs, with some agricultural industries expressing concerns about competitive pressures. The President intends to sign FTAs with Singapore and Chile, with opportunities seen by U.S. food manufacturers in agreements with Central America, Morocco, and South Africa. The U.S. sugar industry advocates for a focus on multilateral trade liberalization in the WTO's negotiations, while the beef and dairy industries oppose an FTA with Australia due to market concerns. The U.S. is negotiating FTAs with various countries and regional blocs, with concerns about competitive pressures in agricultural industries. Committees are assessing the impact of free trade on U.S. import-sensitive agricultural products. Once agreements are signed, implementing legislation will be developed and handled by Congress on an expedited basis. The U.S. is prioritizing negotiating the FTAA to remove trade barriers in the Western Hemisphere, including all trade and services among countries. Crafting rules for agricultural trade and negotiating details among 34 countries by 2005 will be challenging. U.S. agricultural exports to potential FTAA markets were $4.457 billion in 2002, while imports were $6.814 billion. At the third Summit of the Americas in April 2001, hemispheric leaders ratified dates for concluding the FTAA negotiations (January 2005) and making the agreement effective (December 2005). Trade officials agreed on modalities for tariff reductions in August 2002, allowing countries to start cuts from current applied rates. CARICOM members have different rules for tariff reductions. The FTAA negotiations are in their final stages, with Brazil and the United States co-chairing. All countries met the deadline for initial tariff reduction offers, with the U.S. offering duty-free access on 56% of agricultural products from non-NAFTA countries. The process involves market access requests and revised offers. The United States proposes to eliminate tariffs on politically-sensitive farm products with specific timetables under the FTAA agreement. Transition periods could vary from 5 to 10 years depending on the country's size and economic development. All agricultural products are up for negotiation with no exclusions, aiming for hemispheric free trade in agriculture by 2020. Brazil and other Latin American countries are seeking increased access to the U.S. market for competitive products like beef, citrus, and sugar. The U.S. is focused on eliminating tariffs and barriers to agricultural trade, while also addressing domestic agricultural support issues. Negotiations may involve linking tariff reductions to concessions on domestic support. The United States is engaged in FTAA negotiations with a focus on agricultural trade liberalization. Congress will consider any resulting agreement under fast track procedures. The domestic support issue is being debated, with the U.S. suggesting it be addressed in WTO negotiations. The United States is involved in FTAA negotiations with a focus on liberalizing global agricultural trade. The objectives include improving market access, reducing export subsidies, and decreasing trade-distorting domestic support. U.S. agricultural interest groups generally support including agriculture in broader trade rounds, believing it would benefit agricultural exports. However, some producers of import-sensitive crops are less enthusiastic due to concerns about previous trade agreements and potential new agreements. The agricultural negotiations also have implications for farm bill programs and export and food aid programs. At the World Trade Organization (WTO) Fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar in November 2001, trade ministers agreed on a declaration to start a new round of multilateral trade negotiations (MTNs), including negotiations on agriculture. This new round, known as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), aims to integrate developing countries into the world trading system. The DDA incorporates previous negotiations on agriculture and initiates a second phase of negotiations in this sector. The Doha Ministerial Declaration at the WTO Fourth Ministerial Conference in 2001 focused on agriculture, aiming for substantial improvements in market access, phasing out export subsidies, and reducing trade-distorting domestic support. Special treatment for developing countries was emphasized, along with consideration of non-trade concerns in negotiations. Discussions in 2002 covered market access, export competition, and domestic support among WTO member countries. Negotiations on modalities for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) have faced challenges, with different member countries having varying preferences on tariff reductions and subsidy timelines. The deadline for reaching an agreement was missed in 2003, and negotiations are expected to continue until the WTO Ministerial Conference in September 2003 in Cancun, Mexico. The U.S. proposal for the Doha Development Agenda includes the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, tariff reductions, increased tariff-rate quotas on agricultural imports, disciplines on state trading enterprises, and reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. These changes would be phased in over 5 years with the ultimate goal of eliminating tariffs and domestic support. The U.S. proposal for the Doha Development Agenda aims to eliminate tariffs, domestic support, and agricultural export subsidies. The Cairns Group supports this proposal, calling for deep cuts in tariffs and subsidies. The EU, in contrast, suggests using Uruguay Round formulas for tariff and subsidy reductions, with conditions on export subsidy reduction. Japan and Korea focus on non-trade concerns in their negotiating proposals. The U.S., Japan, and Korea propose exemptions from WTO reduction commitments for subsidies promoting non-trade concerns. U.S. negotiators fear disguised trade-distorting measures. The success of agriculture negotiations depends on EU and U.S. policy reform pace. France and Germany's agreement to maintain EU farm support levels may hinder agricultural trade reforms. EU faces opposition in reforming its Common Agricultural Policy. In the EU, efforts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy face opposition from member states. Reforms aim to decouple income support from production and reduce price supports to facilitate acceptance of cuts in trade-distorting domestic support. In the US, the President signed a farm bill that critics fear could exceed WTO commitments on domestic support. The bill mandates adjustments to ensure compliance with WTO rules. US trade officials maintain commitment to WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Developing countries in the WTO are pushing for the rapid dismantling of developed countries' trade barriers and the elimination of production-linked domestic subsidies. They seek exemptions for essential domestic support for economic development. Many developing countries, especially exporters of agricultural products, are targeting U.S. and EU subsidies for elimination in negotiations. Developing countries are seeking substantial reductions in agricultural tariffs of developed countries but are resistant to reciprocal tariff reductions. They prefer special and differential treatment, maintaining tariffs or phasing them down over lengthy periods. The chairman of the Agriculture Negotiating Group issued a draft paper with proposals for modalities to facilitate agreement. The report aimed to balance the U.S. and EU positions while giving special treatment to developing countries, focusing on market access, export competition, and domestic support. Harbinson's modalities report proposes significant reductions in agricultural tariffs, elimination of export subsidies over ten years, and new rules for export credit and food aid programs. Developing countries would have longer repayment periods for export credits and only grant food aid would be allowed. The Harbinson recommendations propose reductions in agricultural tariffs, elimination of export subsidies over ten years, and changes to export credit and food aid programs. Food aid for development projects could be provided through UN agencies or NGOs. The modalities report calls for a 60% reduction in trade-distorting domestic support and suggests capping and reducing blue box support by 50% over five years. U.S. trade negotiators view the report as a reference point but are critical of specific proposals. At the WTO trade ministers meeting in Tokyo, the U.S. and Cairns Group criticized the draft report for not meeting their earlier proposals. The U.S. raised concerns about market access provisions and the lengthy phase-out schedule for export subsidies. They also noted disparities in amber box support between the U.S. and EU. The Harbinson proposal for agriculture trade negotiations faced negative reactions from the U.S. and EU. Concerns included disparities in permitted subsidies between the two regions, with the EU's support exceeding the U.S.'s. Congressional scrutiny was expected for the proposal's impact on export credit guarantee programs. The EU criticized the unbalanced Harbinson proposals, arguing they placed too much burden on the EU and ignored non-trade concerns. They disagreed with the call to eliminate export subsidies without addressing export credit programs. The deadline for agreeing on modalities was missed, indicating stalled negotiations with no compromise in sight, potentially jeopardizing the Doha Round. The inability to agree on agriculture imperils the Doha Round, but U.S. and EU negotiators aim to reach an agreement by the Cancun Ministerial. Congress will consider any resulting agreements under fast track procedures. Meeting the 2005 deadline for negotiations is crucial. Meeting the 2005 deadline for completing negotiations in the new trade round is critical, along with consultations with Congress required by the Administration under the 2002 Trade Act. Congressional fast track procedures will expire by June 1, 2005, but could be extended if the President satisfies the consultation requirements in P.L. 107-210 and if progress is being made in meeting the negotiating objectives set forth in the Trade Act of 2002. Differences between the United States and its trading partners over genetically engineered (GE) crops and food products pose challenges. Genetically engineered crops and food products are causing disruptions in U.S. agricultural trade, particularly with corn and soybean exports. The conflicts stem from differences in consumer attitudes and regulations regarding GE products. U.S. farmers heavily rely on GE crops, with 66% of global GE crop acreage planted in the U.S. in 2002. Consumer acceptance of GE crops is crucial for U.S. producers, processors, and exporters. Supporters of GE crops argue that they reduce environmentally damaging chemical inputs. In the U.S., consumers generally accept the safety of GE foods, while in the EU, Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, concerns exist about the unknown long-term effects on health and the environment. The EU advocates for precaution in approving and regulating GE foods, while China's new regulations on GE products could pose trade barriers according to U.S. officials. The EU has had a de facto moratorium on approving GE crops since 1998. The EU's de facto moratorium on approving GE crops since 1998 has led to a loss of $300 million in U.S. corn exports annually. While China's regulations on GE crops may threaten soybean exports, supporters believe biotechnology can enhance agricultural productivity and nutrition in developing countries, despite obstacles to overcome. The potential contribution of biotechnology to food security in developing countries is hindered by concerns about health, environmental, and commercial risks associated with GE crops. Some countries in southern Africa have rejected GE corn in food aid shipments, while others require it to be milled, increasing relief costs. Developing countries also lack international standards for managing risks associated with GE crops, impacting production and export. U.S. regulations consider GE foods \"substantially equivalent\" to non-GE foods, facilitating their introduction into agriculture and food processing. The EU, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, and New Zealand have mandatory labeling requirements for products containing or derived from GE ingredients. The EU has approved further legislation for approving and regulating GE products, tracing GE crops, and labeling products with GE ingredients. This may lead to the lifting of the moratorium on GE products. The EU is considering lifting the moratorium on GE products, with new regulations expected by mid-2003. Some EU member states may still object to approvals. US officials are contemplating challenging the EU's moratorium in WTO dispute settlement. US agricultural groups and lawmakers are pushing for WTO involvement, arguing there is no legal basis for the moratorium. The US food and agriculture sector is facing challenges in meeting consumer demand for GE or non-GE products, and agribusinesses are working to influence EU regulations on tracing and labeling GE foods. The EU is considering lifting the moratorium on GE products, with new regulations expected by mid-2003. US officials are contemplating challenging the EU's moratorium in WTO dispute settlement. US lawmakers are urging the Administration to challenge the EU policy before the WTO. The 108th Congress may introduce legislation to support US exports of GE products. The 107th Congress passed measures in the 2002 farm bill to support U.S. exports of GE products, including a biotechnology and agricultural trade program, grants for biotechnology research, and public education on biotechnology. Legislation also gave the President trade promotion authority to negotiate rules eliminating restrictions on biotechnology products. Some bills introduced in the 2nd session of the 107th Congress aimed at supporting U.S. exports of GE products. Some bills introduced in the 2nd session of the 107th Congress addressed various aspects of biotechnology, such as mandatory labeling of GE foods, legal issues related to cross-pollination with GE plants, safety of GE foods, and liability for injury caused by GE organisms. There is concern about China's slow implementation of agricultural trade commitments. China's slow implementation of agricultural trade commitments is a concern for the U.S. Despite efforts to resolve differences, progress has been slow. U.S. agricultural exports to China averaged $3 billion per year, making it the fifth-largest market for U.S. farm products. Maintaining access to this market is crucial for U.S. agriculture. The United States negotiated the U.S.-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement in 1999, granting China permanent normal trade relations status in 2000. This led to China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO in 2001, with specific market access commitments on tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and import quotas. China also agreed to comply with WTO rules on SPS measures and eliminate export subsidies. China's progress in implementing its trade commitments, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical regulations, is hindered by challenges in transitioning from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. Issues with coordinating local and national interests also slow progress. The U.S. Government and WTO monitor China's compliance with its WTO commitments, particularly in agriculture, where several issues remain unresolved, such as delays in announcing TRQ regulations. China's TRQ commitments under WTO membership have not provided the expected market access for the United States and other exporting countries. Issues include unclear distribution of quota shares to private enterprises, delays in import permits, requirements for re-exporting processed products, and unexpected eligibility prerequisites. U.S. exporters face challenges in identifying TRQ recipients and quantities in China. China's TRQ commitments under WTO membership have not provided expected market access for the United States and other exporting countries. Issues include unclear distribution of quota shares to private enterprises, delays in import permits, requirements for re-exporting processed products, and unexpected eligibility prerequisites. China agreed to gradually reduce tariffs for agricultural products from 22% to 17% by 2004, but actual tariffs have exceeded scheduled rates in some cases. VAT treatment for domestically produced agricultural products in China appears inconsistent with WTO commitments. China applies higher VAT to imports than domestic production. Temporary import regime for GMO farm products in China causing concerns for U.S. producers, especially in the soybean industry. China is the second-largest destination for U.S. soybean exports, averaging nearly $900 million annually. U.S. soybean exports to China have not been disrupted so far. Export Subsidies in China have been replaced by other policies, leading to continued corn exports at low prices. South Korea is the main destination for China's corn exports. U.S. exporters face hurdles with handling requirements for wheat, access denial for various farm products, and new restrictions on fertilizers. China has implemented new restrictions on fertilizers and faced criticism for irregularities in trade practices related to peaches, pears, and certain apple varieties. The US and WTO are monitoring China's compliance with trade commitments through a Transitional Review Mechanism. China's explanations for trade irregularities, such as limiting smuggling and protecting commercial confidentiality, are disputed by US authorities. The United States utilized the TRM to question China's trade practices and is considering using the WTO dispute settlement mechanism if necessary. Agriculture Secretary Veneman and USDA Senior Trade Counsel Hegwood have been involved in discussions with China to address implementation issues. Administration officials are engaging in bilateral discussions to resolve problems with China. During his February 2003 visit to China, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick expressed concern over China's non-compliance with WTO trade commitments but also optimism about their willingness to engage in discussions. Congress will closely monitor China's implementation of WTO obligations, as outlined in the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. The USTR is required to report annually to Congress on China's compliance with WTO commitments. Congressional oversight and consultation will be key in monitoring developments. Various reports and studies on U.S.-China trade issues and China's WTO accession are available. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is also relevant in this context. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 will soon mandate country-of-origin labeling on certain food items. Proponents argue that consumers have a right to know where their food comes from, especially with increasing food imports. Critics, however, claim that such labeling does not necessarily enhance public health protection. The 108th Congress is urged to revisit the new labeling law, citing concerns about costly implementation and hindering U.S. producers' competitive advantage. Proponents argue that the benefits to U.S. farmers, ranchers, and consumers will outweigh the costs. Food imports must meet U.S. food safety standards, with outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to contaminants in perishable agricultural commodities produced in the United States. Geographical origin should not determine food safety. The 2002 farm law extends new COOL requirements to various food products, mandating labels indicating their country of origin at the final point of sale. The law exempts processed foods and food service establishments. USDA's AMS issued guidelines for implementation. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service issued guidelines for the voluntary phase of COOL in 2002, reigniting debate over the competitive advantage for U.S.-raised products and compliance costs for industry. The mandatory phase of COOL is scheduled to begin in April 2003, raising questions about detailed record-keeping and tracking of products back to the farm or ranch. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service issued guidelines for the voluntary phase of COOL in 2002, reigniting debate over the competitive advantage for U.S.-raised products and compliance costs for industry. The mandatory phase of COOL is scheduled to begin in April 2003, raising questions about detailed record-keeping and tracking of products back to the farm or ranch. Will record-keeping be less burdensome due to modern production methods, or is the estimated $2 billion cost in the first year a significant burden? Supporters believe the new COOL law is necessary, while critics argue it may increase costs for importers and violate trade obligations. Some industry groups are questioning the new COOL requirements for imported consumer products, calling for a re-examination of its impacts on industry costs and competitiveness. There are suggestions to change or repeal the law, but as of early March 2003, no legislation had been introduced. Congress may be asked to hold hearings on the matter, while supporters of the law defend its necessity and efficacy. U.S. policy exempts commercial sales of agricultural and medical products from unilateral sanctions imposed on foreign countries. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 lifted U.S. sanctions on food, agricultural commodities, and medical products to certain countries, including Cuba. Restrictions on sales to Cuba are more stringent and permanent compared to other countries. Including Cuba in this exemption sparked controversy, with proponents arguing that limited trade could benefit the U.S. agricultural sector. In a compromise, opponents succeeded in inserting permanent restrictive provisions uniquely for Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Despite initial reluctance, Cuba made $170 million in cash purchases of U.S. farm commodities and food products from late 2001 through 2002, aiming to use this issue to remove the longstanding U.S. embargo. The President reiterated his opposition to repealing the prohibition on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba, stating it would benefit the current regime. The Administration, along with allies in Congress, successfully prevented provisions in the 2002 farm bill and FY2003 spending bills that would have relaxed the embargo. Proposals in the 108th Congress may include streamlining U.S. export licensing requirements and other bureaucratic restrictions. The U.S. is looking to ease export regulations to sell food, medicine, and medical products to Cuba, including agricultural equipment. Bills in the 108th Congress reflect these proposals. Brazil initiated a WTO case against the U.S. cotton program, with disputes ongoing. Resolution of the WTO dispute over the U.S. cotton program could lead to recommendations for implementation and possible sanctions. Brazil claims the U.S. exceeds WTO subsidy limits, leading to overproduction and increased exports. This case is crucial for interpreting farm subsidy rules under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. The U.S. cotton program has led to overproduction and increased exports, causing harm to Brazilian cotton exporters. Brazil argues that U.S. subsidies exceed WTO limits and are no longer exempt from dispute proceedings. The key issue is whether U.S. subsidies comply with WTO rules, with Brazil claiming they were $2 billion in 1992. Brazil argues that U.S. cotton subsidies in 1992 were around $2 billion, compared to over $4 billion in 2001. They claim that U.S. export credit programs and Step-2 provisions function as export subsidies, which are inconsistent with U.S. WTO obligations. U.S. trade officials argue that these programs are compliant with WTO rules and that the peace clause immunity is crucial. Brazil claims injury to its economy due to low cotton prices exceeding $600 million in 2001. The WTO dispute settlement process must adhere to a one-year time frame for a final decision. Consultations between Brazil and the United States over U.S. cotton subsidies were unsuccessful. Brazil requested the establishment of a dispute panel to rule on the U.S. cotton subsidies issue. The panel would be formed within 45 days and has 6 months to hold hearings before issuing a final report. If the panel finds a violation of WTO rules, it recommends corrective measures. Appeals can be made based on points of law. The losing party in a dispute can appeal a panel's ruling based on points of law. They must bring their policy in line with the ruling or recommendations. If compliance is impractical, negotiations for compensation may be necessary. If no agreement is reached, limited trade sanctions may be imposed. Congress will closely monitor the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute under fast track legislation. Under fast track legislation, Congress will consult with the Administration on trade negotiations, including the Free Trade Agreement for the Americas and WTO agriculture talks. This will allow Members to monitor disputes and negotiating issues. U.S. trade officials are concerned about Canadian wheat trading practices. Canadian wheat trading practices, especially those of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), are disputed by U.S. officials for allegedly violating WTO obligations and harming U.S. wheat exporters. Canada maintains that its import and export practices comply with international trade rules. The U.S. has imposed preliminary punitive duties on Canadian wheat imports and initiated a WTO dispute settlement against Canada and the CWB. The U.S. has initiated a WTO dispute against Canada and the CWB over wheat trading practices. The dispute could lead to increased competitiveness for U.S. wheat in international markets and better access to the Canadian market. Critics argue that the CWB's monopoly power gives them significant market influence. The U.S. wheat industry and officials criticize the CWB's monopoly control over Canada's wheat trade, alleging discriminatory pricing in international markets. The lack of transparency in individual sales terms makes it difficult to prove these claims. U.S. trade officials also point out discriminatory rules against imported grains at grain elevators and within Canada's rail transportation system. These allegations have prompted investigations by U.S. agriculture and trade authorities. In October 2000, U.S. Trade Representative initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 concerning the acts of the CWB. The investigation was in response to a petition filed by the North Dakota Wheat Commission alleging unfair trading practices by the Government of Canada and the CWB. In April 2001, the ITC also initiated an investigation which identified unfair market advantages of the CWB as a State monopoly. Members of Congress followed up on the ITC report with a letter to the USTR in January 2002. In January 2002, a letter was sent to the USTR regarding the ITC report findings on alleged unfair trade practices by the CWB. In response, the ITC initiated an investigation on wheat imports from Canada, leading to a preliminary finding of illegal CWB subsidies in March 2003. The U.S. imposed a 3.94% punitive duty on Canadian wheat imports, with a final determination due in July. In December 2002, U.S. trade officials requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with Canada over alleged unfair trade practices. Canada refused to modify its wheat trading practices during consultations in January 2003. The USTR announced the intention to form a WTO dispute settlement panel to examine Canada's wheat trading practices.

The United States is a leader in meat and poultry trade, facing barriers in some countries that disrupt exports and heighten trade tensions. The US is the top producer, consumer, and importer of beef, and the third leading producer, consumer, importer, and exporter of pork. The United States is a major player in the global meat and poultry trade, holding significant market shares in pork and poultry. Despite facing challenges such as economic conditions and animal disease concerns, exports of red and poultry meat have shown strong growth before a decline in 2002. However, USDA reports anticipate a resurgence in exports in 2003. The United States faces challenges in the global meat and poultry trade, including economic conditions and animal disease concerns. In 2002, exports to Russia declined due to import bans, with concerns about product safety cited as the reason. Negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials led to an agreement to address these issues. Negotiations between U.S. and Russian officials resulted in an agreement for Russian veterinarians to re-inspect and certify U.S. exporting plants by June 1, 2003. However, the process stalled after Russian officials failed many U.S. plants. Russia's new import quota for poultry is expected to be 1.64 billion pounds annually, with the United States receiving 1.22 billion pounds. In 2001, the U.S. exported a record 2.3 billion pounds of broiler products to Russia. Industry officials are concerned that new tariff-rate quotas on pork and beef could hinder future U.S. growth in Russia. U.S. agricultural organizations have called for a Section 301 investigation to address trade issues. The end of import duties under NAFTA led to trade retaliation from Mexico, jeopardizing U.S. pork and poultry exports. An agreement on poultry established a safeguard tariff-rate quota, while Mexico launched an anti-dumping investigation on U.S. pork imports. Preliminary findings could result in high duties and depress U.S. exports to Mexico. An anti-dumping case for beef is ongoing, with a potential safeguard investigation on beef cattle and breeding stock imports. The EU has a longstanding ban on U.S. beef produced with hormones since 1989, leading to a WTO ruling in favor of the U.S. for compensation. Japan, along with other countries, is also involved in trade disputes with the U.S. Japan, along with other countries, is expected to increase tariffs on frozen and chilled beef imports to 50% from the current 38.5% in 2003. The higher tariffs could be in effect until March 31, 2004, under WTO rules. Congress oversees the Administration's trade policy, with concerns raised about the Russian meat and poultry issue. The Trade and Development Act of 2000 allows the U.S. Trade Representative to periodically revise the list of products subject to trade retaliation, creating more pressure for compliance. The \"carousel\" provision was enacted due to frustration over disputes like the EU beef hormone issue. The USTR has not yet used this provision, possibly due to concerns about EU retaliation in other trade disputes. The Administration seeks congressional support for granting permanent \"normal trade relations\" status to Russia to fully benefit from potential WTO membership. NAFTA sugar provisions are acknowledged to be ineffective, prompting intensified efforts to resolve sweetener trade disputes between the U.S. and Mexico. Talks are stalled on market access issues for Mexican sugar in the U.S. market. The United States imports sugar to cover about 12% of its needs, affecting domestic supply and sugar prices. Mexico disputed NAFTA provisions for sugar market access and imposed anti-dumping duties on U.S.-produced high-fructose corn syrup to protect its sugar industry. Negotiations on Mexico's sugar access under NAFTA and WTO trade dispute mechanisms were contentious. Disagreements arose over the amount of sugar Mexico could ship duty-free to the U.S., with U.S. negotiators citing a sugar side letter from 1993 and Mexican negotiators referring to the original NAFTA agreement from 1992. Mexico imposed anti-dumping duties on HFCS, leading to disputes with the NAFTA and WTO panels. In response, Mexico replaced the duties with a quota on HFCS imports equal to the U.S. sugar quota. Legislation imposed a tax on corn syrup in soft drinks, reducing the market for U.S. HFCS imports and impacting U.S. companies in Mexico. U.S. sectors viewed this as a setback in resolving the dispute and urged Mexican authorities to remove the tax. Negotiators agreed to set aside this issue for further discussions. In July-September 2002, negotiators from the U.S. and Mexico exchanged details of a prospective sweetener agreement. Differences remain on the length of the agreement and handling Mexican sugar exports to the U.S. market. The U.S. sugar industry seeks provisions beyond 2008 to restrain Mexican over-quota shipments, which could impact future U.S. HFCS sales to Mexico. Mexico's interest in reaching an agreement has diminished due to limited sugar available for export this year. The interest in reaching a sweetener agreement between the U.S. and Mexico has diminished due to limited Mexican sugar exports and political dynamics related to upcoming elections. The Mexican Congress did not drop the tax on corn syrup sweetened soft drinks, hindering a comprehensive agreement. Members of Congress are monitoring the negotiations and urging for progress to avoid economic fallout in the corn and corn refining sectors. Congress is currently considering FY2004 appropriations for USDA's international activities, including funding levels for agricultural export subsidies, export market development programs, export credit guarantees, and foreign food aid. WTO agriculture negotiations may impact these programs, subject to congressional scrutiny under fast-track procedures for considering trade agreements. The 2002 farm bill authorizes USDA to operate programs promoting U.S. agricultural exports and foreign food aid, with legislative authority extending to 2007. Export subsidies are subject to reduction commitments under the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. U.S. agricultural export subsidies include the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program. Market promotion programs include the Market Access Program. The FSRIA authorizes export credit guarantees by USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of $5.5 billion worth of farm exports annually, plus guarantees of an additional $1 billion for emerging markets through 2007. P.L. 480 Food for Peace programs and Food for Progress are also authorized through FY2007, providing commodities to developing countries and emerging markets. Section 416(b) is a food aid program permanently authorized in the Agricultural Act of 1949, providing surplus food. The Agricultural Act of 1949 authorizes the Section 416(b) program for donating surplus commodities overseas. The 2002 farm bill introduced the McGovern-Dole International School Feeding and Child Nutrition Program. Funding for USDA export and food aid programs in FY2004 is being considered by Congress, with an estimated program value of $6.2 billion. In FY2004, USDA export and food aid programs would have a program value of $6.2 billion. Approximately $1.4 billion would require authorization of budget authority, with the rest funded by CCC borrowing. The President's budget requests $1.185 billion for P.L. 480 Title II, less than FY2003 appropriations. The McGovern-Dole school feeding program will now be funded by appropriations, with $50 million requested in FY2004. $151 million of CCC funding is envisioned for FFP to meet the 2002 farm bill requirements. The President's budget for FY2004 includes $28 million for EEP, which is capped at $478 million under the farm bill. DEIP is expected to receive $57 million, an increase from the previous year. The budget also includes $4.2 billion in commercial financing for U.S. agricultural exports and funding for MAP, FMDP, and FFP as authorized by the farm bill. Following House and Senate Appropriations Committee deliberations, spending measures will be brought to the floor of each chamber for the authorized level of $34.5 million for FMDP in FY2004. Congressional oversight is expected on USDA's international activities and the implementation of export and food aid programs. USDA's export credit guarantee program may be impacted by WTO agriculture negotiations, with proposals to tighten restrictions on U.S. export credit programs. Congress is closely monitoring these negotiations and the potential effects on around $3 billion annually of U.S. agricultural exports. The Trade Act of 2002 (P.L.107-210) requires consultation between Congress and the Administration on agricultural export negotiations. Congressional oversight is focused on USDA's international activities and export credit programs impacted by WTO negotiations. Congress is monitoring the potential effects on $3 billion annually of U.S. agricultural exports."
