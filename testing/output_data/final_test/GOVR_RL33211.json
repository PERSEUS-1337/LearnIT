    "content": "The issue before Congress is whether to continue federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients and providers under the Controlled Substances Act, or to relax federal prohibition for medicinal use in states with medical marijuana programs. Two bills in the 111th Congress propose allowing medical marijuana use with a doctor's recommendation and moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II. The Truth in Trials Act (H.R. 3939) aims to allow medical marijuana users and providers to disclose their activities in federal court if they are in compliance with state laws. The historical use of Cannabis sativa for medicinal purposes dates back over 2,000 years in various cultures. Marijuana was legal in the US until the 1840s when its therapeutic potential began to be recognized. In the 1840s, marijuana's medicinal potential was recognized by U.S. physicians. From 1850 to 1941, cannabis was included in the United States Pharmacopoeia. By 1936, all 48 states had laws regulating marijuana due to concerns about its harmful effects and alleged connection to crime. The decline of marijuana in medicine was accelerated by the development of aspirin, morphine, and other opium-derived drugs. The federal government's three branches play a role in formulating policy on medical marijuana. In response to ineffective state and local efforts to control marijuana use, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was enacted by Congress. Promoted by Harry Anslinger, the act imposed registration, reporting requirements, and a tax on marijuana growers, sellers, and buyers. Although not an outright prohibition, the act effectively regulated marijuana, marking the federal government's first attempt to do so. Dr. William C. Woodward of the American Medical Association opposed the measure, advocating for the medical profession to have the freedom to explore the drug's potential benefits. Dr. William C. Woodward of the American Medical Association opposed the Marihuana Tax Act, arguing against the restrictions on medicinal use of cannabis and its derivatives. Despite the AMA's opposition, the act was approved, impacting the potential benefits of the drug. In 1941, the Marihuana Tax Act was approved, leading to marijuana's removal from medicinal products and official listings. In 1970, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was signed into law, placing marijuana in Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) placed marijuana and other drugs in Schedule I, the most restrictive category, due to their high potential for abuse and lack of accepted medical use in the US. Despite this classification, marijuana use increased, with growing belief in its therapeutic value among healthcare professionals and patients. The CSA does not differentiate between medical and recreational use of marijuana. Under federal law, possession of marijuana for personal use can result in up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for a first offense. Growing marijuana is considered a felony, with potential penalties of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. State medical marijuana laws do not override federal law, allowing for prosecution of individuals even in states with medical marijuana programs. In September 1998, the House passed a resolution supporting the federal drug approval process for determining the safety and effectiveness of drugs like marijuana. The resolution opposed legalizing marijuana for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and FDA approval. This language was included in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act under \"Not Legalizing Marijuana for Medicinal Use.\" Congress also prevented the District of Columbia from implementing a voter-approved initiative allowing medical marijuana use for serious diseases. The amendment allowing medical use of marijuana for serious diseases was challenged and overturned in District Court. Despite court challenges, Congress prohibited implementation until the Barr Amendment was dropped in the FY2010 D.C. appropriations act. In response to DEA raids on medical cannabis users, a bipartisan amendment was offered in the FY2004 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill to prevent the Justice Department from using funds for such actions. The amendment to prevent the Justice Department from interfering with medical cannabis laws in certain states was debated and defeated multiple times in Congress between 2003 and 2005. The amendment to prevent the Justice Department from interfering with medical cannabis laws was debated and defeated in Congress multiple times between 2003 and 2005, with supporters citing personal experiences and opponents concerned about the message it sends to young people. Despite lobbying efforts, the amendment only gained a few more votes each year, falling short of passage each time. The Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill for FY2008, which aimed to protect states' rights regarding medical marijuana, was debated and rejected in Congress. Supporters argued for respecting states' rights and the patient-doctor relationship, while opponents raised concerns about the safety of smoked marijuana and its impact on young people. During the 110th Congress, a Senate Committee adopted an amendment to subject state-legalized medical marijuana to FDA regulations, despite debates on protecting states' rights and concerns about the safety of smoked marijuana. The Coburn Amendment, which aimed to subject state-legalized medical marijuana to FDA regulations, was not included in the FDA amendments act approved by Congress in 2007. DEA's regulation of medicine was discussed in a hearing by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. A DEA official testified about enforcing laws against marijuana use, while a California medicinal cannabis patient advocated for freedom from federal interference. The House debated using federal resources against medical marijuana users, ultimately rejecting an amendment to protect them. In the second session of the 110th Congress, Representative Frank introduced H.R. 5842, the Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act, to allow for medical use of marijuana in states with medical marijuana programs. The bill aimed to reschedule marijuana from schedule I to schedule II of the CSA, permitting physicians to prescribe it, patients to use it, and authorized individuals to distribute it. The Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act, introduced by Representative Frank in the 110th Congress, aimed to allow medical use of marijuana in states with medical programs. The bill sought to reschedule marijuana to schedule II of the CSA, enabling physicians to prescribe it without federal prosecution. It did not impact laws on smoking in public spaces. The bill had the same intent as the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act and was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce but did not progress further. The Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act (H.R. 2835) aims to relax federal prohibition on medical cannabis use in states that permit it with a doctor's recommendation. It would move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA, protecting authorized patients and providers from federal prosecution. Introduced in the 111th Congress by Representative Barney Frank, the bill has similarities to previous legislation but with updated provisions. H.R. 2835, introduced in the 110th Congress, aims to relax federal prohibition on medical cannabis in states allowing it with a doctor's recommendation. It was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for further action. The Truth in Trials Act (H.R. 3939) introduced by Representative Sam Farr allows medical marijuana users in federal court to disclose their activities were medically related and legal under state law. H.R. 3939 would amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide an affirmative defense for those using marijuana for medical purposes in accordance with state laws. It would also limit federal agents' authority to seize medical marijuana and allow for the return of seized plants. The bill was introduced with nine co-sponsors and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Additionally, a rider blocking the implementation of a medical marijuana program in D.C. was not attached to the appropriations act for FY2010, clearing the way for its creation. In 2009, P.L. 111-117 allowed for the creation of a medical marijuana program in Washington, DC, following a case where a resident used marijuana for glaucoma treatment. The FDA's Investigational New Drug Compassionate Access Program was established in 1978, providing marijuana to patients with specific medical conditions. In 1992, the program saw an increase in AIDS patients seeking medical cannabis for appetite stimulation and wasting disease reversal. The George H.W. Bush Administration closed the medical cannabis program for new applicants, but previously approved patients still receive government-grown medical marijuana. Marinol, a synthetic form of THC, was approved in 1985 for nausea and vomiting in cancer patients and in 1992 for anorexia in AIDS patients. It was rescheduled from Schedule II to Schedule III in 1999 for wider patient access. Marinol, a synthetic form of THC, was rescheduled administratively by DEA to Schedule III in 1999 for wider patient access. This decision was made after little evidence of illicit abuse was found, reducing regulatory controls and criminal sanctions. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 placed marijuana in Schedule I, causing controversy and hindering research on its therapeutic potential. In 1988, after a long legal process, the chief administrative law judge of the DEA ruled that marijuana is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man and can relieve the distress of many ill people. The DEA has been urged to recognize marijuana's medicinal value and allow doctors to prescribe it, as it can safely relieve the distress of many ill people. Despite recommendations to reschedule marijuana, the DEA has rejected them, keeping it classified as a Schedule I substance. The Institute of Medicine analyzed scientific information on medical uses of marijuana, recommending more research into its potential benefits for conditions like pain, neurological disorders, chemotherapy-induced nausea, AIDS-related weight loss, and glaucoma. This review was commissioned by the federal drug czar in response to medical marijuana initiatives in California and Arizona. The Institute of Medicine's report, released in March 1999, reviewed scientific evidence on the health benefits and risks of marijuana and cannabinoids. The report acknowledged the lack of alternative options for chronic conditions that could be relieved by smoking marijuana but also stated that smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe medication for any chronic medical condition. The Institute of Medicine's report in March 1999 stated that smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe medication for any chronic medical condition. The report found more potential promise in synthetic cannabinoid drugs for pain relief, antiemesis, and appetite stimulation in patients with severe pain, nausea, and appetite loss. The need for scientific research into the therapeutic effects of marijuana and its components was emphasized. The report recommended clinical trials for safe delivery systems of marijuana and its components. DEA denied a petition to reschedule marijuana due to high abuse potential and lack of accepted medical use. FDA reiterated that smoked marijuana is harmful. The FDA restated its position that smoked marijuana is harmful and not approved for any medical use, based on a past evaluation. Media criticized the FDA's stance as politically motivated and ignoring scientific evidence. Representative Hinchey and 24 House Members requested the FDA to provide scientific evidence supporting their evaluation of medical marijuana efficacy. Since 1968, the federal government tightly controls the only source of marijuana available for scientific research in the United States. Grown at the University of Mississippi under a contract with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, researchers find it difficult to obtain due to its inferior quality and lack of multiple strains. Other Schedule I substances can be legally provided, but marijuana remains largely inaccessible for research purposes. Dr. Lyle Craker applied for a DEA license in 2001 to cultivate research-grade marijuana in response to the government's monopoly on its supply for research purposes. The goal was to create conditions for a $5 million, 5-year drug development effort to turn marijuana into an FDA-approved prescription medicine. The DEA rejected the Craker/MAPS application in December 2004, citing it as not consistent with the public interest. After hearings in 2005, DEA's Administrative Law Judge found an inadequate supply of marijuana for research. However, the ruling was rejected by agency heads in January 2009. In January 2009, the DEA denied Dr. Craker's application for a DEA certificate to manufacture marijuana. Patients in states with medical marijuana laws are usually not prosecuted by state and local police, but federal agents have targeted medical cannabis growers and distributors. During the George W. Bush Administration, DEA agents targeted medical marijuana dispensaries in California, where providers can receive \"reasonable compensation\" on a nonprofit basis. The DEA does not differentiate between criminal and legal dispensaries, considering all felony criminal operations under federal law. They focused on larger, for-profit providers engaged in drug dealing and prosecuted high-profile medical marijuana patients. In July 2007, DEA's Los Angeles Field Division Office targeted medical marijuana dispensaries by threatening property owners with up to 20 years in federal prison for violating the \"crack house statute.\" The letters also warned of property seizure under asset forfeiture provisions. L.A. City Council members urged the DEA to reconsider this enforcement tactic. Council members urged the DEA to abandon threats to property owners of medical marijuana dispensaries and allow them to regulate without federal interference. They also endorsed the Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment to prohibit DEA actions. The DEA's enforcement expanded to other parts of California, including the Bay Area, leading to legal challenges that could impact the future of medical marijuana in California and beyond. The DEA's actions against medical marijuana operations in California have led to lawsuits, including one filed by the city and county of Santa Cruz and seven patients. A preliminary injunction allowed the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana to resume production for its members. This lawsuit is the first challenge by a local government against the federal war on drugs. The Obama Administration initially conducted raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, causing confusion about its policies. However, Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., announced in mid-March that such raids would cease. A Justice Department memorandum dated October 19, 2009, directed U.S. Attorneys not to focus on individuals complying with state laws on medical marijuana. The memo does not exempt medical marijuana providers from federal scrutiny, especially when state law is used as a pretext for unauthorized production or distribution. Prosecution of commercial enterprises selling marijuana for profit remains a priority. The new directive may lead to fewer federal operations against medical marijuana providers compared to the previous administration. Judicial branch involvement in permitting botanical marijuana for medicinal use has resulted in mixed outcomes, with ongoing court challenges. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil suit in January 1998 to close medical marijuana distribution centers in northern California. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that medical necessity is a valid defense against federal marijuana trafficking charges. The Supreme Court ruled that a medical necessity exception for marijuana is not allowed under the Controlled Substances Act. This decision did not affect state medical marijuana laws, which continued to protect patients and caregivers. In response to California's medical marijuana initiative, the Clinton Administration threatened to investigate and revoke licenses of doctors recommending medical marijuana. In April 1997, a preliminary injunction allowed doctors to discuss medical marijuana with patients without fear of punishment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed this decision, stating the government cannot investigate physicians based solely on marijuana recommendations in a doctor-patient relationship. The Bush Administration appealed, but the Supreme Court did not allow a medical necessity exception for marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. The Bush Administration appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court refused to take the case. Two patients and two caregivers in California sued DEA agents for destroying their medical marijuana plants, arguing that the Controlled Substances Act exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that states can have medical marijuana laws as long as it's not sold, transported across state lines, or used for nonmedical purposes. The case was sent to the Supreme Court to determine if the Controlled Substances Act applied to intrastate medical marijuana. The Supreme Court's decision in Raich (June 2005) ruled that Congress's power to regulate commerce extends to local activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce, allowing DEA enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on medical marijuana patients and caregivers, even in states with medical marijuana programs. The case did not address the efficacy of medical marijuana or its Schedule I listing. The Supreme Court's decision in Raich upheld DEA enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act on medical marijuana users, despite state programs. The Court suggests that Congress has the power to reschedule marijuana, acknowledging its medical use in the US. However, it is unlikely to do so, leaving the issue to state and local governments. The federal Data Quality Act of 2001 requires federal agencies to ensure the quality of information disseminated, allowing affected persons to seek correction. Americans for Safe Access petitioned HHS to correct erroneous statements about medical marijuana. The petition by Americans for Safe Access requested corrections to erroneous statements about medical marijuana, including replacing claims about lack of consensus on its medical applications with recognition of its efficacy in treating nausea, loss of appetite, pain, and spasticity. It also called for acknowledging that marijuana is accepted as medicine by qualified experts and that its chemistry is known and reproducible. Additionally, the petition sought to change the statement that marijuana has no currently accepted medical use in the United States to reflect its accepted use in treatment. The petition by Americans for Safe Access aimed to correct erroneous statements by HHS regarding medical marijuana's efficacy in treating various conditions. HHS denied the petition in 2005, leading ASA to file a lawsuit in 2007 to force HHS to change the statements they believe are not science-based. The case is still pending. Advocates of medical marijuana have successfully pushed for state laws allowing patients to use botanical marijuana therapeutically, despite federal illegality. Fourteen states have enacted such laws, removing state-level penalties for medical marijuana use recommended by doctors. These states have programs to regulate approved patients' use, with immunity for physicians discussing or recommending medical cannabis. Nine of the 14 states that have legalized medical marijuana are in the West: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. Michigan plus four other states in the Northeast\u2014Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont\u2014have also adopted medical cannabis statutes. Hawaii, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont have programs created by acts of their state legislatures, while the other states' programs were approved by voters in referenda or ballot initiatives starting in 1996 with California. Voters have approved medical marijuana initiatives in most states except South Dakota. Bills for medical marijuana programs have been introduced in several states but not enacted yet. State laws do not violate federal laws on marijuana prescriptions. Doctors recommend marijuana, and patients grow their own cannabis products. Medical marijuana patients, caregivers, and providers can face arrest and prosecution by federal law enforcement despite state approval. Limited data suggests a growing number of patients using medical marijuana with state recommendations. Studies estimate thousands of patients in California and other states have physician recommendations for cannabis use. In August 2005, an estimated 115,000 people had obtained marijuana recommendations from doctors in states with programs. A July 2005 survey revealed 14,758 registered medical marijuana users in eight states. By early 2010, an estimate found a total of 369,634 users in 13 states with established programs, with California alone accounting for 69% of the total. In March 2010, there were fewer than 33,000 registered medical marijuana patients in California, which accounted for 69% of the total patient population. Proposition 215, approved in November, removed criminal penalties for medical marijuana use with a physician's recommendation for patients whose health would benefit from it. The Compassionate Use Act legalized cannabis for medical purposes in California, allowing possession for personal use. Senate bill 420 permitted compensation for caregivers and nonprofit distribution. Voters removed criminal penalties for patients using marijuana for medical reasons. The law does not provide for distribution but allows patients to grow up to 24 plants. In 1999, Oregon created a mandatory state registry for medical cannabis users, limiting possession to 1 ounce and six plants. A ballot measure in November 2004 to expand the program was rejected by 58% of voters. Another measure in November  approved removing state-level criminal penalties for patients with debilitating medical conditions, with 58% voter approval. Maine and Hawaii have laws allowing medical cannabis use. Maine patients with qualifying conditions can possess 1\u00bc ounces and six plants with physician authentication. Hawaii allows up to seven plants for patients with debilitating conditions certified by a physician. Hawaii's law was enacted by the legislature, while Maine's was passed by a ballot initiative. Nevada passed a state law allowing medical cannabis use through a ballot initiative amending the state constitution. Patients must be diagnosed with a debilitating condition by a physician and may possess 2 ounces and six plants. A second amendment was approved by 65% of voters to exempt medical cannabis users from prosecution. Patients with written documentation from their physicians can register with the state Department of Agriculture to receive an identification card. In May, Vermont legalized medical cannabis through legislative action, allowing patients to grow up to three plants and possess 2 ounces of marijuana under supervision. The law was enacted without the governor's signature, despite pressure from Washington. A 2007 legislative act expanded eligibility for the program, allowing participants to grow up to nine plants. In November, 62% of state voters passed Initiative 148, permitting qualifying patients to use marijuana for medical conditions like cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, seizures, and wasting syndrome. Patients in Vermont can legally use medical marijuana to treat conditions like cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, seizures, and chronic pain. They can grow up to six plants and possess 1 ounce of dried marijuana. The state legislature overrode the governor's veto to allow patients to possess up to 12 plants or 2\u00bd ounces for medical use. The law was made permanent in 2007, and the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act went into effect. The Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act, effective July 1, 2007, requires the state's Department of Health to regulate medical cannabis distribution to authorized patients. Proposal 1 in Michigan, approved by 63% of voters in 2008, allows physicians to approve marijuana use for patients with certain medical conditions. Patients can cultivate up to 12 plants in a locked facility, and regulated distribution is permitted by state-licensed facilities. Arizona's law, approved by 65% of voters, allows for regulated distribution of marijuana through state-monitored dispensaries. Patients can receive up to 2 ounces monthly for specific diseases. However, there is no active program due to federal restrictions on prescribing marijuana. Maryland's General Assembly also passed legislation to protect medical cannabis. Maryland's General Assembly approved a bill protecting medical cannabis patients from jail, allowing a $100 fine for using marijuana to treat illnesses like cancer and AIDS. The law doesn't legalize medical marijuana but offers a defense for those using it for medical reasons. Patients in Maryland can avoid jail time and fines by proving their medical need in court. 36 states have enacted laws favorable to medical marijuana, but most don't protect users from state prosecution. Several states have laws that recognize the medical value of marijuana, but federal opposition hinders their implementation. State legislatures are considering medical marijuana bills, with some in favor of patient use and others not. In Michigan, a medical marijuana initiative will be on the November 2008 ballot, while in the nation's capital, a majority of voters approved a medical cannabis initiative allowing patients access to marijuana for treatment. In Washington D.C., a medical marijuana initiative was approved by voters, allowing patients access to marijuana for treatment. Congress blocked the initiative for over 11 years until the ban was lifted in 2009. City officials could now draft legislation for a medical marijuana program, subject to congressional approval. Other localities in the country, like San Diego and Alameda County in California, have also adopted medical cannabis measures. In addition to other localities, Alameda County in California approved an ordinance to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries, becoming the 17th locality in the state to do so. Voters in Columbia, MO, and Ann Arbor, MI, also approved medical cannabis measures in November 2004. Majorities of voters in nine states have approved medical marijuana initiatives, and national public opinion polls consistently support access to medical marijuana for seriously ill patients. National public opinion polls from 1995 to the present show strong support for medical marijuana, with percentages ranging from 60% to 85%. A 2010 poll found that 81% of Americans supported making marijuana legal for medical use. Most respondents favored allowing doctors to prescribe it for any patient they believe it could help. Support for medical marijuana cuts across political and ideological lines, with 68% of conservatives and 72% of Republicans in favor. Public opinion polls show strong support for medical marijuana, with 60% to 85% of Americans in favor. Support cuts across political and ideological lines, with 68% of conservatives and 72% of Republicans supporting it. The majority believe seriously ill patients should have access to medical marijuana if prescribed by their physicians. The majority of Americans support seriously ill patients using medical marijuana if recommended by doctors. Fourteen states have medical marijuana programs, but many state and federal governments oppose it. Arguments for and against cannabis as medicine are frequently debated, with no official position taken by CRS. The debate focuses on the potential role of herbal cannabis in treating diseases and the societal consequences of expanding its medical use. The debate on the use of medical marijuana continues, with the majority of Americans supporting its use for seriously ill patients. While 14 states have medical marijuana programs, there is opposition from many state and federal governments. The International Association for Cannabis as Medicine and ProCon.org offer research findings on medical marijuana. The Drug Free America Foundation argues that suitable medicines are available for treating symptoms that medical marijuana is alleged to treat. The Drug Free America Foundation opposes the use of botanical marijuana for medical purposes, arguing that it is a dangerous drug with no legitimate medical value. They believe that approved medications like Marinol containing THC are sufficient and that crude marijuana is not a safe or effective medicine. The federal government argues that crude marijuana lacks medical value as it does not meet the five-part test required by the Controlled Substances Act. Marijuana's chemistry is not fully known or reproducible, safety studies are inadequate, and there is a lack of well-controlled scientific studies proving its efficacy for medical conditions. The DEA Final Order outlines that marijuana lacks accepted medical use due to a lack of scientific evidence proving its safety and efficacy for medical conditions. Individual case reports, clinical data, and studies conducted by unqualified individuals are considered irrelevant by the DEA in establishing medical use. The DEA and federal drug control agencies disregard medical literature and opinions supporting the therapeutic value of marijuana, citing a lack of scientific evidence. The official view on medical marijuana is complicated by the wider War on Drugs, as the Supreme Court ruled that exempting medical marijuana would undermine drug enforcement efforts. The federal government maintains that marijuana, classified as a Schedule I substance, is harmful. The federal government maintains that marijuana, classified as a Schedule I substance, is harmful and should continue to be prohibited for any use, including medicinal purposes. Despite public tolerance towards medical marijuana, its therapeutic benefits remain officially unacknowledged at the federal level. Proponents argue for its effectiveness in providing relief for individuals with chronic, degenerative, and terminal conditions. Marijuana has various medical benefits such as relieving nausea, increasing appetite, reducing muscle spasms, chronic pain, and anxiety. It has been used successfully to treat symptoms of cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, glaucoma, and other serious illnesses. Some patients find relief with medical cannabis when FDA-approved drugs do not work for them. Medical cannabis proponents argue that synthetic drugs like Marinol are inferior to the whole marijuana plant, which contains over 400 chemical compounds, including 60 active cannabinoids. They believe that the therapeutic effects of these compounds, either alone or in combination, are not fully understood. Many patients prefer the whole plant over synthetic alternatives, citing cost and accessibility as key factors. Health professionals have shown support for medical cannabis due to its perceived benefits. The American Public Health Association, American Nurses Association, and California Pharmacists Association support medical cannabis. The New England Journal of Medicine favors patient access to marijuana, while the American Medical Association calls for more research. Cannabinoid receptors in the human body explain marijuana's effectiveness in relieving symptoms. The presence of cannabinoid receptors in various parts of the human brain controls various functions like vomiting reflex, appetite, emotional responses, motor skills, and memory formation. These receptors also play a role in pain control. The therapeutic value of marijuana is based on the natural cannabinoids in the human nervous and immune systems. The federal government's Compassionate Access Program provides evidence of marijuana's medicinal value and safe use. The federal government provides eight patients with medical marijuana cigarettes every month, while others can be fined and jailed for the same. General Barry McCaffrey questions the use of smoking as a delivery method for medicine, highlighting the obstacles to wider acceptance of medical marijuana. DEA Administrator Karen Tandy also raises concerns about smoking as a drug delivery system. DEA Administrator Karen Tandy states that smoked marijuana is considered a health danger with no medical evidence supporting its benefits. The FDA does not approve smoked medications due to the inefficiency of smoking as a delivery method. Opponents argue that chronic marijuana smoking can harm the lungs, cardiovascular system, and possibly the immune and reproductive systems, but these claims lack concrete evidence. The therapeutic value of smoked marijuana is supported by research and experience, with benefits outweighing potential harms for terminally ill patients. Anecdotal, survey, and clinical data show smoked marijuana and oral THC provide relief for symptoms like nausea, emesis, and spasticity associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis. The IOM Report expressed concerns about smoked marijuana but recommended it under limited circumstances, such as for patients with debilitating emesis when standard antiemetic therapy is ineffective. The IOM Report recommends smoked marijuana for terminal cancer patients suffering from debilitating pain or nausea when standard medications have failed, as smoking can provide rapid relief and better dosage control. Inhalation of medical marijuana offers patients more control over dosage and advantages over edible or pill forms. Advocates suggest ways to reduce smoking risks, such as using higher potency marijuana or cooking it for consumption. Vaporizers provide rapid action and dose titration without inhaling smoke. Vaporizers heat marijuana to release cannabinoids as vapor, allowing patients to inhale them without the harmful by-products of combustion. A DEA judge recommended transferring marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II, emphasizing the need for a calm review of evidence and application of the law. Proponents of medical marijuana believe its placement in Schedule I of the CSA was an error from the beginning. Rescheduling can be done administratively by the federal Department of Health and Human Services or by an act of Congress. Despite THC being moved to Schedule III in 1999, botanical marijuana is unlikely to be rescheduled soon. Congressional action to reschedule marijuana is also unlikely. The Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act (H.R. 2835/Frank) aims to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Some believe marijuana should be classified as a Schedule III substance, like THC and Marinol. Marinol is a Schedule III substance with less abuse potential than Schedule I and II drugs. Public opinion supports rescheduling marijuana for medical use, with polls showing strong favor for legalizing it for medical purposes. Despite public support, few Members of Congress openly endorse rescheduling marijuana. The Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act (H.R. 2835) aims to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Despite public support, few Members of Congress openly endorse this option. The federal government opposes the use of medical marijuana, citing concerns about its impact on youth and the perception of drug harm. Opponents of medical marijuana argue that the perception of harm associated with marijuana has been decreasing since the 1990s when legalization advocates gained more funding. They point to a 1999 survey showing that states with medical marijuana laws have higher rates of marijuana use, other drug use, and addiction. The analysis suggests that states with higher marijuana usage rates may be more likely to approve medical marijuana programs. California, despite having a long-running program, ranked lower in marijuana use among 12-17 year olds compared to other states with active programs. Between 1999 and 2002-2003, some states with medical marijuana programs saw an increase in youth marijuana use, while others saw a decrease. Between 1999 and 2002-2003, 12- to 17-year-olds in five states (CA, CO, NV, OR, WA) showed varying trends in marijuana use. Alaska's ranking rose from 7th to 4th, with 11.08% reporting past-month use in 2002-2003. State-level data did not show clear patterns, indicating other factors influence recreational marijuana prevalence. The IOM Report found no evidence that medical marijuana programs lead to increased drug use, addressing concerns about general population usage. The IOM Report states that the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance should not affect its evaluation for medical use. Laws regulating therapeutic drugs focus on safety and efficacy, not public perceptions. Medical use of opiates or cocaine has not increased their illicit use perception. The perception that medical use of drugs like cocaine, morphine, and amphetamine is safe or acceptable does not weaken the War on Drugs. The \"Gateway Theory\" suggests that medical marijuana could lead to increased illicit drug use, but evidence shows that marijuana is not the most common gateway drug. Studies in four states with medical marijuana programs found no increase in recreational marijuana use among emergency room patients and arrestees. Adolescent marijuana use decreased in states with medical marijuana laws, with some age groups showing declines exceeding 50%. These findings are consistent with a 2002 report that concluded medical marijuana laws do not encourage drug use among the wider population, debunking concerns about sending the wrong message to vulnerable groups like adolescents. The DEA and law enforcement argue that state medical marijuana laws hinder drug abuse efforts by allowing large-scale traffickers to evade prosecution through bogus medical claims. This undermines law enforcement by diverting medical marijuana into the illegal drug market and creating confusion in California. The DEA and law enforcement believe that state medical marijuana laws contribute to drug abuse issues by enabling traffickers to avoid prosecution through false medical claims. This diversion of medical marijuana into the illegal market complicates law enforcement efforts and creates confusion in California. The impact of state medical marijuana laws on law enforcement efforts is disputed. Federal officials did not report routine abuse of these laws, but some diversion is inevitable. The debate centers on balancing the benefits of medical marijuana for patients against potential risks, such as youth exposure to marijuana. Legal analyst Stuart Taylor Jr. highlighted the complexity of this issue. Legal analyst Stuart Taylor Jr. advocates for the legalization of medical marijuana with strict regulations, citing the benefits for suffering patients. Federal officials expressed concerns about the impact of state medical marijuana laws on federal drug enforcement efforts, emphasizing the difficulty of federalizing crime. State medical marijuana laws contribute to the deprioritization movement in law enforcement, urging a lower focus on marijuana enforcement. This movement has gained traction in various cities and college towns, causing concerns for federal officials. Federal officials are concerned that jurisdictions opting out of marijuana enforcement may attract drug traffickers. Police in medical marijuana states struggle to differentiate between legitimate patients and recreational users. The DEA states that law enforcement struggles to distinguish between legal and illegal marijuana grows. This could undermine enforcement efforts by creating difficulties in establishing violators' intent. Patients and caregivers in medical marijuana states have faced challenges with law enforcement seizing their lawful marijuana under state statutes. The inconsistency between federal and state laws has been a significant problem, particularly in California, where state and local police officers have failed to observe state medical marijuana laws. The California Highway Patrol has faced issues enforcing medical marijuana laws, leading to arrests and confiscations during routine traffic stops. A lawsuit against the CHP resulted in a new policy where officers will no longer seize marijuana from patients with up to 8 ounces and proper documentation. This change may influence other law enforcement agencies in California. The 1997 report \"Marijuana Should be Medically Available\" argues that the government should differentiate between medical and recreational marijuana, citing the suppression of a valuable medicine for the war on drugs. Advocates believe seriously ill individuals should not be punished for seeking pain relief with medical marijuana. Patients should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes without fear of legal repercussions, as supported by public opinion and the Institute of Medicine. The current federal penalties for possession and cultivation of marijuana, even for medical use, are severe. The federal penalties for growing cannabis can include up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Despite the risks, patients are willing to use medical marijuana for its therapeutic benefits. The DEA continues to investigate and shut down medical marijuana distribution operations in states where it is legal, citing federal law that does not distinguish between medical and recreational marijuana crimes. The DEA does not differentiate between crimes involving marijuana for medical purposes and other purposes when enforcing the CSA. They focus on large-scale trafficking organizations and criminal enterprises. State and local law enforcement handle most arrests and prosecutions for marijuana possession, even in medical marijuana states. Enforcement officers, patients, and caregivers in medical marijuana states can possess medical marijuana without fear of arrest. DEA actions against dispensaries can hinder patient access. The illegality of marijuana causes anxiety and expense for patients, forcing them to deal with illicit dealers. Doctors, not the federal government, should decide on treatments for patients. The federal government has no place in deciding treatments for patients, according to Attorney Randy Barnett. Three states supported the right of states to have medical marijuana programs, but the Supreme Court upheld the federal position against the states in the Raich case, framing it as a battle for states' rights. Three southern states - Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi - filed a brief supporting California's medical marijuana users based on states' rights. They argued that California has the authority to make tough policy choices that affect its citizens, emphasizing the importance of states' rights in defining criminal law and enforcing laws for the welfare of their citizens. Justice O'Connor emphasized the importance of states' rights in setting policies regarding health and safety, particularly in the case of medical marijuana. She argued that states should have the freedom to experiment with such policies without federal interference, even if she personally disagreed with them. This stance was supported by the Drug Free America Foundation, who expressed concerns about the impact of state initiatives on the FDA's regulatory process for proving safety and efficacy. The federal government regulates medical products, including controlled substances, through the FDA. All drugs must be approved by the FDA for safety and effectiveness before entering the market. Clinical evaluation is required for all medicines, regardless of their origin. Critics of medical marijuana argue against bypassing the FDA's approval process. The federal government regulates medical products through the FDA, requiring approval for safety and effectiveness. Critics argue that state medical marijuana initiatives undermine this regulatory system, creating chaos in the scientific and medical communities. The Court of Appeals ruling allows for informal State systems that could jeopardize national food and drug legislation. The FDA emphasizes its role in approving safe and effective drug products through clinical trials. Bypassing FDA approval may risk public health by exposing patients to unsafe drugs. Smoked marijuana is not FDA-approved for any condition. The Drug Free America Raich brief criticizes state laws for creating a perception of medicine through popular initiatives. The ballot initiative-led laws for medical marijuana undermine the rigorous scientific drug approval process established by the FDA. Proponents argue they had to bypass the FDA due to federal government obstacles. Medical marijuana supporters argue that federal government resistance to research requests and rescheduling petitions has forced them to bypass the FDA and go to the states. Critics claim that politics should not influence drug approval processes, but supporters point out that marijuana's Schedule I classification was a political decision. Both sides agree that more research is needed, but some researchers accuse the government of hindering clinical trials for political reasons. The IOM Report emphasizes the need for further research to determine the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana. The FDA's IND Compassionate Access Program allows limited patients to use government-grown medical marijuana for serious medical conditions. Some believe opposition to medical marijuana is to protect pharmaceutical profits. Research focuses on synthetic cannabinoids like Marinol due to the inability to patent the whole marijuana plant. Despite potential new cannabinoid drugs, some argue against criminalizing doctors and patients for using natural marijuana. The New England Journal of Medicine criticizes federal policy prohibiting physicians from prescribing marijuana for seriously ill patients. The opposition to prescribing marijuana for seriously ill patients is criticized as misguided, heavy-handed, and inhumane. It is argued that the potential long-term adverse effects and addiction risks are not relevant in such cases. The comparison is made with the use of morphine and meperidine for symptom relief, highlighting the narrow margin between relief and hastening death with these drugs. The demand for evidence of therapeutic efficacy is deemed hypocritical, as the focus should be on whether the patient feels relief from the intervention. Advocates continue to push for medical marijuana legalization, emphasizing the need for federal government to change its restrictive laws. The focus should be on providing relief to seriously ill patients rather than proving efficacy through controlled trials. Medical marijuana opponents view the movement as a cynical attempt to subvert laws and legalize recreational use. They highlight NORML's efforts to decriminalize marijuana and push for medical marijuana initiatives in various states since 1996. Barry McCaffrey warned of a \"Perilous Path\" with the push for medical marijuana initiatives in several states, questioning the true intentions behind the efforts. NORML and other drug reform organizations strategically pursue both marijuana decriminalization and rescheduling for the seriously ill, using tactics similar to other political activists seeking incremental progress towards larger goals. The medical cannabis movement is seen as a stepping stone to full marriage equality, causing alarm among opponents. While many supporters of medical marijuana also advocate for broader drug law reform, not all health professionals who support medical access to marijuana endorse other changes in U.S. drug control policy. Ideology and emotion often dominate hot-button issues like marijuana legalization, with some demonizing marijuana users. The ideology of \"Drug Warriors\" impacts the medical marijuana debate, with opponents exaggerating its dangers to prevent its use as medicine. The IOM Report acknowledges that larger ideological beliefs can influence views on patient access to medical marijuana. In the medical marijuana debate, there are arguments for and against its legalization based on beliefs about its impact on individuals and society. Both sides advocate for a science-based approach, with calls for scientific research on medical marijuana. Rescheduling marijuana for medical use does not necessarily mean it will be legalized for recreational use. Medical marijuana proponents argue that it should be considered differently from other Schedule II substances like cocaine and methamphetamine due to its lower harm and addiction potential. Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance suggests that the regulation of medical marijuana could pave the way for its broader legalization. Critics view this as hypocritical, while others see it as a strategic move."
