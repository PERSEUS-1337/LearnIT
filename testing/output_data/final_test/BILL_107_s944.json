    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that bilateral agreements have enhanced economic growth in the US, trade should promote sustainable development and higher living standards, and countries that open their markets empower citizens to alleviate poverty and maintain values. The Republic of Korea actively participates in World Trade Organization programs promoting open trade and reaffirmed its commitment to core labor standards in 1996. The United States policy on trade is outlined in Section 3. The United States seeks to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries. These agreements should address national treatment, rules of origin, customs procedures, standards, and safeguard provisions for industries. The United States aims to address various aspects in bilateral free trade agreements with like-minded countries, including safeguard provisions for industries, government procurement procedures, national treatment for foreign investors, protection of intellectual property, transparency of legal regimes, measures for electronic commerce, trade-related environmental measures, adherence to core labor standards, and more. The President is authorized to negotiate a free trade agreement with South Korea, subject to certain conditions. Fast track consideration of the implementing bill is also outlined. The bill to implement a trade agreement must be introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate, contain necessary provisions, trade-related labor and environmental standards, but cannot include certain amendments. Fast track procedures apply to the implementation process.
