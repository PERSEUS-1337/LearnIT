    "content": "The Driver's License Security and Modernization Act includes sections on short title, definitions, minimum document requirements, linking of databases, trafficking in authentication features, grants to states, and authority. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefinitions in the Act include driver's license, identification card, Secretary, and State. Minimum document requirements and issuance standards for federal recognition are outlined in Section 3. Beginning 3 years after the enactment of this Act, Federal agencies cannot accept driver's licenses or identification cards from States unless they meet the specified requirements. The Secretary will determine State compliance based on certifications provided by the State. States must include specific information and features on each driver's license and identification card to meet the requirements. The State must include specific information and features on each driver's license and identification card, such as the person's full legal name, date of birth, gender, driver license or identification card number, digital photograph, address of principal residence, signature, physical security features, and machine-readable technology. The State must verify specific information before issuing a driver's license or identification card, including a photo identity document with full legal name and date of birth, documentation of date of birth, proof of social security number or eligibility, and documentation of name and address of principal residence. States must comply with minimum standards for special requirements. Before issuing a driver's license or identification card, a State must require valid documentary evidence of legal status, including citizenship, lawful permanent or temporary residence, conditional permanent resident status, valid nonimmigrant visa, or pending/approved asylum application. To obtain a driver's license or identification card in the United States, individuals must show valid documentation of legal status, such as citizenship, lawful permanent or temporary residence, conditional permanent resident status, valid nonimmigrant visa, pending or approved asylum application, refugee status, temporary protected status, approved deferred action status, or pending adjustment of status application for permanent residence. If a person presents evidence under certain clauses, the State may issue a temporary driver's license or identification card valid for the authorized stay in the United States or up to one year. The temporary driver's license or identification card issued must clearly indicate its temporary status and expiration date. Renewal can only occur with valid evidence of extended status by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Applications for renewal, duplication, or reissuance are required. For renewal, duplication, or reissuance of a driver's license or identification card, a State shall presume validity if the document has not expired, been canceled, suspended, or revoked at the time of application. This presumption does not apply if notified by a government agency that the applicant is not a citizen. To meet the requirements for issuing driver's licenses or identification cards, a State must verify the validity of required documents and not accept foreign documents except for official passports. Additionally, a memorandum of understanding must be established by September 11, 2005. To verify legal presence status for non-US citizens applying for driver's licenses or ID cards, states must use the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. States must also adopt technology to capture digital images of identity documents for electronic storage. To comply with driver's license regulations, states must retain paper copies or images of source documents for 7-10 years, capture facial images of applicants, verify renewing applicant information, and confirm social security numbers with the SSA to prevent identity fraud. To enhance driver's license security, states should refuse to issue licenses without confirmation of termination from another state, secure production locations, implement security clearance for staff, and provide fraudulent document recognition training. To be eligible for financial assistance under this Act, states must participate in the Driver License Agreement to share driver license data electronically. State motor vehicle databases must include all data fields on licenses and drivers' histories. Additionally, the Act addresses trafficking in authentication features for false identification documents. Section 1028(a)(8) of title 18, United States Code is amended to include \"false or actual authentication features\". Grants may be provided to States to help them meet the standards of the Act, with appropriations authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY.\n\nThe Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and States, has the authority to issue regulations, certify standards, and issue grants under this Act. The Secretary may grant a State an extension of time to meet requirements if adequate justification is provided.\n\nSEC. 8. REPEAL.\n\nSection 7212 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is repealed."
