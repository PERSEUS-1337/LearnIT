    "content": "Recovering sparse conditional independence graphs from data is a fundamental problem in machine learning with wide applications. A deep learning architecture, GLAD, uses an Alternating Minimization (AM) algorithm as an inductive bias to learn the model parameters via supervised learning, effectively mapping empirical covariance to the sparse precision matrix. GLAD learns a compact model for recovering sparse graphs from data, essential in high dimensional statistics and time series analysis. Sparse graph structures are crucial in various fields like computational biology and finance for understanding relationships between data. The problem is often formulated as log-determinant estimation of the precision matrix with 1 regularization. Many algorithms efficiently solve this, guaranteeing high probability recovery of the graph structure under specific conditions. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in a new paradigm of algorithm design for sparse recovery algorithms, aiming to improve graph structure recovery by allowing regularization parameters to vary across entries in the precision matrix. This approach addresses limitations of traditional convex optimization methods, which require careful tuning of hyperparameters and use a single regularization parameter for all entries. In a new algorithm design paradigm, algorithms are enhanced with learning modules trained directly with data, rather than prescribing every step. This approach aims to solve optimization problems with similar structures but different data by leveraging the distribution of problem instances. For example, in sparse graph recovery, where underlying graphs vary but have similar characteristics, a data-driven algorithm can outperform traditional methods. The AM architecture provides a strong inductive bias, as shown in experiments. The AM architecture shows a strong inductive bias, enabling effective sparse graph recovery with minimal training data. It outperforms traditional methods in recovering sparse graph structures and gene regulatory networks. Previous works have explored CNN-based architectures and parameterized optimization algorithms using recurrent neural networks or reinforcement learning policies. Li & Malik (2016) approached automating algorithm design from a reinforcement learning perspective. Li & Malik (2016) explored automating algorithm design through reinforcement learning, while Khalil et al. (2017) used deep Q-learning for combinatorial optimization. Gregor & LeCun (2010) developed ALISTA based on unfolding iterative algorithms, and Sun et al. (2016) created 'ADMM-Net' for compressive sensing. These approaches, though initially for different applications, hinted at the use of unrolled algorithms as inductive biases. Leveraging this, a suitable unrolled algorithm was identified to solve the sparse graph recovery problem. The sparse graph recovery problem involves estimating the covariance matrix and precision matrix of a multivariate Gaussian random variable. A 1-regularized maximum likelihood estimation approach is used to increase sparsity and create easily interpretable models. This method is applicable even for non-Gaussian variables. Sparse precision matrix estimation involves using a 1-regularizer with regularization parameter \u03c1 to minimize a penalized log-determinant Bregman divergence. Various algorithms like G-ISTA, ADMM, and BCD can be used to solve this convex optimization problem. G-ISTA is a proximal gradient method that iteratively updates the precision matrix, while ADMM transforms the problem into an equivalent constrained form and uses an augmented Lagrangian form with a penalty parameter \u03bb. The ADMM algorithm updates the precision matrix iteratively using lasso problems, efficient for large-scale problems. Statistical analysis by Ravikumar et al. (2011) shows consistency of the estimator \u0398 in terms of Frobenius and spectral norms, with limitations based on sample size, sparsity level, and graph degree. In practice, improving convex optimization algorithms for recovering true graph structure is challenging due to various recovery conditions. Prior to data-driven sparse recovery, the best precision matrix recovery method involves using a surrogate objective function and tuning the unknown parameter \u03c1. Leveraging simulation or real data can help design a learning algorithm that directly optimizes loss. GLAD is a data-driven algorithm for precision matrix estimation that directly optimizes the recovery objective. It aims to improve results for sparse graphs by learning from data. Given a family of precision matrices, GLAD seeks to enhance recovery outcomes by training on m samples associated with n precision matrices from a graph family G. GLAD is a data-driven algorithm for precision matrix estimation that optimizes recovery outcomes for sparse graphs by training on samples associated with precision matrices from a graph family G. The algorithm aims to learn an estimation of \u0398 * (i) in terms of an evaluation metric L, directly optimizing the final evaluation metric related to desired graph properties. Designing a parameterization for GLAD f poses challenges in graph recovery tasks, as traditional deep learning architectures may not be suitable. For graph recovery problems, traditional deep learning architectures like fully connected DNN or recurrent neural networks are not practical due to the large number of parameters needed. Structured models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to reduce parameter size, but the permutation invariance constraint for recovered graphs remains a challenge. The limitations of traditional deep learning architectures for graph recovery include difficulties in learning permutation invariance, lack of interpretability in intermediate results, and challenges in imposing SPD constraints. To address these limitations, desiderata for designing learning models include small model size, minimalist learning, interpretable architecture, progressive improvement, and SPD output. These desiderata motivate the use of unrolled algorithms in designing deep architectures. The GLAD model is designed based on an unrolled algorithm template that incorporates permutation invariance and interpretable intermediate results. It is augmented with learning components and trained using stochastic gradient descent. The model reformulates the optimization problem with a squared penalty term and utilizes an alternating minimization algorithm with a quadratic penalty parameter \u03bb. The GLAD model is based on an unrolled algorithm using the alternating minimization (AM) method with neural network augmentation. The penalty constants are replaced by problem-dependent neural networks, and the model is structured as a recurrent architecture. AM was chosen as the basis due to its consistent performance compared to other algorithms like G-ISTA and ADMM. The GLAD model utilizes the alternating minimization (AM) method with neural network augmentation, outperforming other algorithms like G-ISTA and ADMM. The AM-based architecture maintains a positive definite matrix throughout iterations and demonstrates a linear convergence rate. The model directly optimizes the recovery objective function and produces valid precision matrix estimations at each iteration. Auxiliary losses are added to guide the model towards smooth parameter learning. The GLAD architecture uses Frobenius norm and a discounted cumulative reward objective in training parameters. Stochastic gradient descent is employed with a key step in gradient computation involving propagating gradient through the matrix square root efficiently using properties of SPD matrices. Sylvester's equation is used to obtain the derivative of d(X 1/2) for the objective function. The GLAD architecture uses Sylvester's equation to obtain the derivative of d(X 1/2) for the objective function. The objective function compares the output of GLAD with the ground truth precision matrix to train the deep architecture for various input covariance matrix and ground truth sparse precision matrix pairs. The goal is for the learned architecture to perform well over a family of problem instances. The GLAD architecture utilizes Sylvester's equation to derive d(X 1/2) for the objective function. It aims to train the deep architecture to perform effectively across different input covariance matrix and ground truth sparse precision matrix pairs. The architecture's layers output intermediate predictions of the sparse precision matrix, with the objective function progressively aligning these outputs with the target ground truth. The architecture is more flexible than solely learning regularization parameters, as it adapts entry-wise and is responsive to the input covariance matrix and intermediate outputs. This adaptability allows GLAD to autonomously select a matrix of regularization parameters, a task that would be challenging if done manually through cross-validation. Recent theoretical work by Sun et al. (2018) supports the effectiveness of GLAD's design. The GLAD architecture, supported by recent theoretical work, utilizes Sylvester's equation to derive d(X 1/2) for training. It aims to effectively recover the sparse precision matrix by adapting entry-wise to input covariance matrices. The statistical guarantee of running the AM algorithm for k steps with a fixed penalty parameter \u03bb is analyzed, providing insights into the learned algorithm's implications. Standard assumptions about the true model are crucial for understanding the fundamental limitations of sparse graph recovery. The AM algorithm shows linear convergence for the optimization objective with a penalty parameter \u03bb. By optimizing \u03bb, one can adjust the convergence rate. An adaptive sequence of penalty parameters is more effective than a fixed \u03bb, as C \u03bb is a complex function. The optimal \u03bb k is difficult to manually choose due to the relationship with C \u03bb. The AM algorithm demonstrates linear convergence with penalty parameter \u03bb. Choosing the optimal \u03bb k manually is challenging, and an adaptive sequence of penalty parameters is more effective. The implications include the difficulty in selecting a good \u03c1 value and the dependence of optimal \u03bb k on the error. GLAD can jointly tune the sequence of \u03bb k and \u03c1 parameters using gradient descent. In a recent work by Sun et al. (2018), they improved error margins by iteratively solving adaptive convex programs with a nonconvex penalty. By choosing an adaptive regularization matrix based on the most recent solution, they achieved better results. To further enhance error margins, we propose using a nonconvex penalty parameter \u03c1 as a problem-dependent function. This approach allows for different regularizations for entries of the precision matrix, potentially improving the GLAD model's ability to recover sparse graphs. Experimental results comparing GLAD with traditional and data-driven algorithms validate its effectiveness. The GLAD algorithm is validated through experiments comparing it with traditional and data-driven algorithms. Evaluation metrics include normalized mean square error (NMSE) and probability of success (PS). Notation is used to represent dimension, sample size, and number of graphs. Traditional algorithms optimize the 1-penalized log likelihood, while GLAD pushes the boundary of traditional graph recovery algorithms by utilizing data. Traditional algorithms optimize 1-penalized log likelihood, but the true error differs. ADMM convergence is consistent, but NMSE errors vary with different parameters, highlighting the need for direct NMSE optimization and hyperparameter tuning. Grid search for hyperparameter tuning is laborious, as shown in Table 1's sensitivity of NMSE to \u03c1 and \u03bb in ADMM method. In Table 1, slight changes in parameters like \u03c1 and \u03bb can significantly impact the NMSE in ADMM method, making grid-search for hyperparameter tuning expensive. GLAD's gradient-based training is easier compared to traditional algorithms that require extensive hyperparameter fine-tuning. GLAD algorithm outperforms G-ISTA, ADMM, and BCD in synthetic experiments on multivariate Gaussians. Precision matrix entries are set to zero based on sparsity level, and identity matrix adjustments ensure the smallest eigenvalue is 1. GLAD shows faster convergence and lower NMSE compared to other algorithms, with G-ISTA requiring longer computation time due to line search steps. GLAD outperforms traditional algorithms in experiments on multivariate Gaussians, showing faster convergence and lower NMSE. It directly optimizes recovery objectives based on data, potentially pushing sample complexity limits. Experiments on GRID graphs and randomly constructed graphs demonstrate positive results, with a non-zero probability of success if all edges are recovered correctly. GLAD consistently outperforms traditional methods in terms of sample complexity by recovering true edges with fewer samples. Its architecture is data-efficient compared to other deep learning models like 'DeepGraph'. GLAD learns well with fewer parameters, less training samples, and time compared to the DG-39 model. It significantly outperforms DG-39 in terms of AUC with just 100 training graphs. Fully connected DL models are unable to learn from such small data. GLAD outperforms traditional methods in sample complexity by recovering true edges with fewer samples. It performs well for structure recovery on gene expression data and can handle non-Gaussian data. GLAD trained on a sub-network of true Ecoli bacteria data shows good edge-recovery performance. Despite being trained on graphs with D = 25, it robustly recovers a higher dimensional graph structure of D = 43. Experiments on real E.Coli data using the SynTReN simulator are detailed in the appendix. The GLAD model, trained on real E.Coli data using the SynTReN simulator, presents a novel neural network for sparse graph recovery. It demonstrates linear convergence of the Alternating Minimization algorithm and highlights the potential of using algorithms as inductive biases for deep learning architectures. Further theoretical development is needed to fully realize this new direction. The Alternating Minimization algorithm shows linear convergence rate for optimization objectives with a l1 penalty. The update rules for the algorithm are defined, and assumptions about the true model are made. The proof involves eigen decomposition of a matrix X. The eigen decomposition of matrix X is used to prove linear convergence rate for the Alternating Minimization algorithm with a l1 penalty. The algorithm's update rules and assumptions about the true model are defined. The proof involves orthogonal and diagonal matrices, and the contraction property under a specific metric. The proof involves the use of the triangle inequality and lemma (3) to show that \u039b max (Y \u03bb ) and \u039b max (Y k+1 ) are bounded. The norm of Z \u03bb is also bounded, leading to linear convergence rate for the Alternating Minimization algorithm with a l1 penalty. Experimental details: This section outlines the settings used for the experimental evaluation, including the generation of synthetic data based on a specified procedure. A precision matrix \u0398 was created by sampling off-diagonal entries from a uniform distribution and setting them to zero according to the sparsity pattern of an Erdos-Renyi random graph. The precision matrix \u0398 was generated by sampling off-diagonal entries from a uniform distribution and setting them to zero based on the sparsity pattern of an Erdos-Renyi random graph with probability p. A multiple of the identity matrix was added to ensure the smallest eigenvalue as 1. GLAD algorithm architecture details included neural networks with specific layer and unit settings, using tanh for hidden layers and sigmoid for the final layer. The GLAD algorithm used tanh for hidden layers and sigmoid for the final layer. The initial offset parameter \u0398 0 was set to t = 1 and unrolled for L = 30 iterations. Learning rates were [0.01, 0.1] with a multi-step LR scheduler using 'adam' optimizer. The best nmse model was selected based on validation data performance. Varying the L 1 penalty term \u03c1 showed sensitivity in probability of success and parameter values. The GLAD algorithm used tanh for hidden layers and sigmoid for the final layer with parameter values sensitive to the choice of t. G-ISTA and BCD showed similar trends in sensitivity. Experiment details included two graph types inspired by Ravikumar et al. (2011), with different edge weight settings. The parameter settings for GLAD were consistent with previous descriptions. The GLAD algorithm, with consistent parameter choices, outperformed DeepGraph model in AUC comparisons. GLAD was trained on 10 graphs with 5 sample batches each, with a problem dimension of D = 39. It showed significant AUC improvement across all settings. SynTReN Van den Bulcke et al. (2006) is a synthetic gene expression data generator for structure learning algorithms. The SynTReN simulator generates synthetic gene expression data for structure learning algorithms, closely resembling real transcriptional networks. It models various biological interactions and produces biologically plausible data for network recovery. Performance evaluation includes generating connected ErdosRenyi graphs with specific parameters and incorporating biological noises for sample generation. The figure shows NMSE comparisons for a fixed dimension D = 25 and varying number of samples M = [10, 25, 100]. Results are reported on 100 test graphs with 20/20 training/validation graphs. Only 1 batch of M samples per graph was used. Unrolled model for ADMM with updates described. Neural networks used with tanh and sigmoid non-linearities. GLAD compared with ADMMu on convergence performance. The comparison between GLAD and ADMMu on convergence performance with synthetically generated data showed that GLAD consistently outperformed ADMMu. The authors chose the AM based unrolled algorithm over ADMMu due to its better empirical performance and fewer parameters. They hypothesized that the neural networks in GLAD could capture the relation between U, Z, and \u0398, leading to its superior performance. In our formulation of unrolled ADMMu, the update step of U is not controlled by neural networks to avoid a large number of parameters. Empirical evaluations show that using the penalty term alone can maintain desired properties and learn problem-dependent functions with a small neural network. Various unrolled parameterizations of optimization techniques for solving the graphical lasso problem were attempted, with different levels of success. One approach involved combining ADMM with ALISTA, where the threshold update for Z can be replaced by an ALISTA network. In the unrolled algorithm for optimization, combining ALISTA updates with AM's results in improved performance. The 'GLAD' parameterization consistently outperforms the 'ADMMu' architecture. Parameterizing the line search hyperparameter and maintaining the PSD property of intermediate matrices is a challenge. Mirror Descent Net provides similar update equations for graphical lasso optimization. We update equations for graphical lasso optimization using neural networks to make parameters problem-dependent. Testing our method on real data from the 'DREAM 5 Network Inference challenge', we aim to recover the true E.coli network from gene expression values obtained through microarray experiments. The dataset includes 4511 genes and 805 microarray experiments, with the true network having 2066 discovered edges. In the study, the researchers used the GLAD model to analyze a dataset with 805 microarray experiments and 2066 discovered edges in the true network. They focused on predicting connections between genes, trained the model on a subset of 1081 genes, and evaluated its ability to generalize to different distributions. GLAD's ability to generalize to different distributions and scale to more nodes is evaluated, showing improved AUC scores compared to other methods. The study demonstrates the advantage of using data-driven parameterized algorithms, with experiments showing successful training on a smaller number of nodes and recovering graph structure on larger nodes. The current GPU implementation can handle around 10,000 nodes for inference, with a proposed randomized algorithm for problem sizes exceeding 100,000 nodes. The proposed randomized algorithm techniques from Kannan & Vempala (2017) are being explored for scaling up GLAD to problem sizes with more than 100,000 nodes. Key results include using length-squared sampling for low-rank approximations and obtaining approximate SVD of large matrices. The approach presented is a rough idea with potential loose ends. We are investigating approximate updates for matrix A using property P3 to approximate the right singular vectors of R. We are also exploring efficient distributed algorithms for GLAD, including parallel MPI based algorithms. Leveraging small neural network sizes, we aim to duplicate them across processors for future research."
