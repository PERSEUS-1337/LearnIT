    "content": "PART V of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces nonrecognition of gain on certain sales of telecommunications businesses under SEC. 1071. Under SEC. 1071 of PART V of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, qualified telecommunications sales can be treated as involuntary conversions under section 1033. The gain deferred on such sales cannot exceed $50,000,000. A qualified telecommunications sale refers to the sale of assets of a telecommunications business to a qualified business or the sale of stock in a corporation where the qualified business controls the corporation and owns most of its assets. For purposes of SEC. 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified business in a telecommunications sale includes a person owning 10 or fewer broadcast stations with a fair market value equal to or greater. In telecommunications sales, a qualified entity must have net assets equal to or greater than 50 percent of the total assets. For other telecommunications sales, individuals or entities with net assets under $30,000,000 and average after-tax income below $10,000,000 qualify. An interest in a broadcast station is considered qualified if it represents 50 percent or more of the total. In telecommunications sales, a qualified entity must have net assets equal to or greater than 50 percent of the total assets. A person cannot be a qualified business if they were the purchaser in more than 2 prior sales. Special rules for determining a qualified business include defining net assets as the excess of gross assets over entity indebtedness, and after-tax income as taxable income reduced by net income. The term 'income' refers to taxable income reduced by net income tax for the taxable year. Net income tax is the tax imposed by this chapter minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. Rules similar to section 448(c)(3) apply in determining average after-tax income. All persons treated as a single employer under specific sections shall be treated as one person. The term 'telecommunications business' refers to any business providing communication services by wire. The term 'telecommunications business' refers to any business providing communication services by wire, cable, radio, satellite, or other technology governed by the Communications Act of 1934 or the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Special rules apply to stock of a corporation operating a telecommunications business in a qualified telecommunications sale. The taxpayer can elect to reduce the basis of depreciable property held after a sale to avoid recognizing gain. Regulations will determine the reduction amount. Property acquired in an involuntary conversion sale follows specific basis rules. If a telecommunications business is resold within 5 years, there is a recapture of tax benefits. If a qualified telecommunications sale results in a recapture event within 5 years, the purchaser's tax will increase by 20% of the consideration or dollar limitation. An exception applies if the taxpayer reinvests in another qualified sale within 60 days. The term 'recapture event' in the context of a qualified telecommunications sale refers to any sale or disposition of assets or stock acquired in the initial sale, or any transaction that results in the qualified business losing control. The term 'recapture event' in a qualified telecommunications sale refers to any sale or disposition of assets or stock acquired in the initial sale, excluding sales due to default of taxpayer indebtedness. A clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments in Part V apply to sales of telecommunications businesses in taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a loan guarantee program is established to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications businesses. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration may guarantee loans for qualified businesses purchasing assets or stock related to telecommunications sales. Limitations include requiring security with a first lien position, a maximum guarantee of 95% of the outstanding balance, and fees for loans repayable in more than 1 year. The Administrator may collect a guarantee fee for loans repayable in more than 1 year, and the borrower must forfeit their FCC license if they default on the loan. The Administrator has the authority to enter contracts for services and agreements with other entities. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration can enter agreements with other Federal agencies and issue regulations on default notice, foreclosure procedures, and other relevant matters. Definitions for \"Administrator\" and \"qualified business\" are provided, and appropriations are authorized for the section's purposes."
