Locke believed the executive should have discretion in emergencies for the public good. The Continental Congress used emergency powers between 1775 and 1781 for the prosecution of actions. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, emergency powers were not a major focus, but it can be argued that Congress has implicit authority to grant emergency powers based on its constitutional provisions. Implied powers can be invoked to respond to emergency situations. In the American governmental experience, the exercise of emergency powers has been somewhat dependent upon the Chief Executive's view of the presidential office. Theodore Roosevelt articulated the \"stewardship\" theory of the presidency, emphasizing that executive power is limited by the Constitution or Congress. Theodore Roosevelt believed that the President had the duty to do anything necessary for the nation, even without specific authorization, while his successor, William Howard Taft, viewed the presidential office in more limited terms, requiring powers to be traced back to specific grants. Emergency powers of the President are not solely derived from legal sources but also depend on the personal conception of the office holder. The extent of their use is contingent upon how the President interprets their legal powers, ultimately determining their authority. The President is granted emergency powers by Congress to take special actions in times of crisis, often through temporary laws like the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. These laws, such as the Defense Production Act, provide the President with authority to address emergencies and are continuously available for use. The President is granted emergency powers by Congress through temporary laws like the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and the Defense Production Act. These laws provide the President with authority to address emergencies, with formal procedures established by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. The President may exercise certain powers in the event of a national emergency, relying on constitutional authority or congressional delegations made over the past 230 years. A national emergency is defined as an unforeseen combination of circumstances requiring immediate action. Emergency conditions are characterized by urgency, infrequency, and equivalence to public calamities like fire or flood. Emergency powers granted to the President allow for addressing crises with established procedures under the National Emergencies Act of 1976. An emergency is defined as sudden, unforeseen, and threatening conditions that exceed tolerable limits. It requires immediate action and involves dangers to life and well-being. The perception of an emergency and the response to it are key aspects, with governmental authority playing a role in determining its existence. The dynamics of national emergency powers can be seen in historical examples, such as President Washington's use of militia to suppress the whiskey rebellion in 1794. This marked the beginning of a pattern of policy in response to unforeseen and threatening conditions that require immediate action. The use of emergency powers by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War sparked a dispute over the authority of the Chief Executive to take emergency actions. Congress had legislated special authority for the President to use in times of crisis, leading to various laws enacted over the next 100 years to address military, economic, and labor emergencies. Lincoln's inauguration in 1861 came at a time when seven states had seceded from the Union, leading to the establishment of the Confederate provisional government. In 1861, after seven states seceded from the Union, the Confederate provisional government was established, with Jefferson Davis elected as president. Lincoln issued a blockade on secessionist states' ports, bypassing Congress, and ordered the addition of 19 navy vessels. In response to the secession of seven states, Lincoln declared war and ordered the addition of 19 navy vessels for defense. He also extended the blockade to Virginia and North Carolina ports and increased the army and navy personnel, as well as volunteers, despite facing opposition from Congress. Lincoln justified his actions as necessary for public defense and hoped Congress would approve them. Congress authorized the President's actions regarding increasing armed forces personnel and other emergency actions. Scholars believe Congress and the Supreme Court did not effectively restrain Lincoln's emergency actions, which were either unchallenged or approved by Congress and largely unnoticed by the Supreme Court. The President's quick response to emergencies had some popular approval, despite potential rejection by Congress or the courts. During the Wilson and Roosevelt presidencies, emergency powers were used extensively for world hostilities and the Great Depression. These actions were supported by statutory delegations and had high approval from Congress and the public. A significant procedural development was the use of a proclamation to declare a national emergency and activate standby statutory provisions. President Wilson issued the first national emergency proclamation in 1917 concerning water transportation policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a national emergency proclamation on March 6, 1933, under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, declaring a \"bank holiday\" to halt financial transactions. The Emergency Banking Act was passed on March 9 to support this action. Another proclamation was issued to continue the bank holiday until banks could operate under new policies. President Roosevelt issued proclamations of \"limited\" and \"unlimited\" national emergency in 1939 and 1941, respectively, to address the worsening conflict in Europe and tensions in Asia. These proclamations remained in effect until 1947 when certain activated provisions were rescinded by law. Congress terminated the declaration of war against Germany in 1951, and the Senate ratified a peace treaty the following year. In 1952, President Truman terminated national emergency declarations from 1939 and 1941, except for the one related to hostilities in Korea, which continued until the Vietnam War era. Legislation was passed to maintain emergency provisions after the end of World War II. During the Vietnam War era, multiple national emergency proclamations were issued by President Nixon to address various crises, including a postal strike and balance of payments issues. Concerns were raised in Congress about the prolonged existence of President Truman's 1950 national emergency proclamation after the conditions prompting it had passed. During the Vietnam War era, concerns arose in Congress over President Nixon retaining emergency powers long after the crisis had ended. Senator Mathias and Senator Church proposed a special committee to study the implications of terminating the 1950 national emergency proclamation used for the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, a special committee was proposed to study the implications of terminating emergency powers retained by President Nixon. The committee, initially chartered in 1972, was reapproved in 1973 with a broader mission due to multiple national emergency proclamations. In 1974, the study panel was rechartered to further explore national emergency powers. In 1974, the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers was rechartered with a focus on larger matters than the 1950 emergency proclamation. Senators Church and Mathias co-chaired the panel, which identified 470 provisions of federal law granting extraordinary authority to the executive during national emergencies. The Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers in 1974 found no automatic process to terminate outstanding national emergency proclamations. They developed legislation to regulate future emergency declarations, abolish some provisions, and modify others. The committee recommended establishing a procedure for presidential declaration and congressional regulation of national emergencies, consulting with executive branch agencies in the process. The Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers in 1974 recommended legislation to regulate future emergency declarations, consult with executive branch agencies, and modify existing emergency statutes. Senator Church introduced the legislation as S. 3957, which was passed by the Senate after amendments on October 7. The House version, H.R. 16668, was not considered due to other pressing matters. The National Emergencies Act was not considered during the 93rd Congress due to the impeachment of President Nixon and the nomination of Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President. The bill was reintroduced in the House as H.R. 3884 and in the Senate as S. 977 in 1975. It went through hearings and amendments before being reported to the full committee. The Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill with technical amendments on May 21, and during House debate on September 4, it was agreed that national emergencies would automatically end one year after their declaration. The National Emergencies Act, H.R. 3884, passed in the House with a 388-5 vote and was sent to the Senate. After amendments and hearings, the bill was passed in the Senate and signed by President Gerald Ford on September 14, 1976. The special committee emphasized the need for the National Emergencies Act to address neglected emergency laws and procedures in the United States. The special committee highlighted the importance of passing the National Emergencies Act to address neglected emergency laws and procedures in the United States. Other issues identified by the committee, such as reviewing statutory emergency power provisions, did not see as much progress as expected. The Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 expired in June 1974, and emergency law provisions were refined in May 1976. In May 1976, emergency law was refined to grant the President authority to activate military reserve personnel without a declaration of war or national emergency. In 1977, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act limited the President's power to regulate the nation's finances to times of declared war. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act limited the President's authority to regulate the country's finances to times of declared war. It conferred authority on the Chief Executive to exercise controls over international economic transactions during a declared national emergency, with procedures for consultation with Congress. Other matters included investigation of emergency preparedness, congressional preparations, review of emergency law, and improving accountability of executive decision-making. The National Emergencies Act consisted of five titles, addressing standby statutory delegations of emergency power and future declarations of national emergency. It did not cancel previous national emergency proclamations but rendered them ineffective by returning statutory authorities to dormancy. Title II of the National Emergencies Act established a procedure for declaring national emergencies, with provisions for congressional oversight. Declarations automatically ended after one year unless extended by the President or Congress. Originally, Congress could terminate emergencies with a concurrent resolution, but this was changed to a joint resolution in 1985. The President must specify the activated powers and authorities when declaring a national emergency. Since the 1976 National Emergencies Act, various national emergencies have been declared, with some revoked and others still in effect. The President must specify the powers activated in response to the emergency, with accountability and reporting requirements outlined in Title IV. Table 1 shows the number of active and inactive national emergencies by President, while detailed information can be found in Tables 2 and 3. The development of emergency powers has shifted towards statutory law since the Lincoln Administration, leading to more limited authority for the executive during national crises. Table 3 lists national emergencies that are no longer in effect. The National Emergencies Act has restricted the use of emergency powers, with potential for further improvements. An anomaly occurred in 2005 when President George W. Bush suspended wage requirements without declaring a national emergency. In 2005, President George W. Bush suspended wage requirements without declaring a national emergency, citing the National Emergencies Act as authority. The proclamation was later revoked on November 3, 2005."
