    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Equal Protection School Finance Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that public school finance systems in States result in unequal education quality based on location, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. This is in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, emphasizing the importance of equal educational opportunities for all children. Equality of financial resources is essential for equal protection under the law. The Equalization System is outlined in Section 3. The COV of per pupil expenditures in local educational agencies statewide for elementary and secondary education in a State must be less than 10 percent to be eligible for Federal funds from the Department of Education. The COV is calculated based on intrastate expenditures for current operations, excluding capital expenditures and special purpose funds targeted at specific needs. The Act allows for additional resources to be provided to local educational agencies to address special needs of students, including those who are educationally disadvantaged, handicapped, gifted, or language deficient. The Secretary may grant funding to a State for elementary and secondary education even if they have not complied with the requirements, as long as a compliance plan is submitted and implemented within 5 years. SEC. 4. COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING. To receive Federal education funds, a State must submit an annual report certifying compliance with this Act by January 1 each year. Certifications can be challenged by local educational agencies representing at least 10% of the students in the State within 90 days. Failure to comply will result in loss of eligibility. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Act will lead to the loss of Federal education funds, with eligibility being restored upon compliance. If a State fails to comply for over 5 years, all forms of Federal assistance will be lost until compliance is achieved. Redistributed funds for education not given to non-compliant States will be reallocated by the Secretary to compliant States or those working towards compliance. In this Act, \"coefficient of variation\" is defined as the standard deviation of local educational agency expenditures divided by the mean per student expenditure, excluding agencies with fewer than 250 students. \"Local educational agency\" has the same meaning as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education."
