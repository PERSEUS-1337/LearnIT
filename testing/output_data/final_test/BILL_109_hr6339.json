The poor in New Orleans faced severe challenges during Hurricane Katrina, highlighting the need for better engagement with mainstream institutions. Lack of employment is a key issue for the poor, with job creation seen as the primary solution. The Community Service Agency (CSA) plays a role in addressing these issues. The Community Service Agency (CSA) has structures in place to rapidly implement programs to help the poor, aligning with the Community Services Block Grant's goal of providing meaningful employment to low-income residents in metropolitan areas. The Faith Based Initiative project's structure can also be used to train and place low-income residents in permanent jobs. The slow disaster recovery in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast area shows the need for urgent action by Congress. Emergency action by Congress is needed to launch pilot projects in New Orleans and other at-risk cities with increasing poverty rates. The Homeland Security Community Mobilization Program is established. The Homeland Security Community Mobilization Program is established under the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Pilot projects in 10 metropolitan areas, including New Orleans, will provide emergency response training and job training to low-income individuals for disaster assistance. The Homeland Security Community Mobilization Program aims to provide job training and financial assistance to families with children in school, prioritizing those below the poverty line. Support includes stipends for travel costs and cash incentives for improved student performance. Additionally, community education and school support programs will be established to assist schools in various areas such as safety, student discipline, extracurricular activities, and truancy. Participants will be trained as Informed Parent Program Specialists. The program aims to provide job training and financial assistance to families with children in school, focusing on those below the poverty line. It includes support for truant and delinquent children, juvenile delinquency prevention programs, youth counseling, and entrepreneurial business development training for at-risk youth.
