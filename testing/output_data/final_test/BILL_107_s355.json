Congress finds that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. dedicated his life to securing the Nation's principles of liberty and justice, spearheaded the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, delivered his famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech at the March on Washington in 1963, and championed nonviolence. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. advocated nonviolent resistance to end segregation and racial discrimination in America, winning the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.
