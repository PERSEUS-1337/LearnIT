The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings Act of 2003 establishes a Medicare operated prescription drug plan option under the Social Security Act. Starting in 2006, the Secretary will offer a nationwide Medicare operated prescription drug plan and negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce drug costs for eligible individuals. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings Act of 2003 introduces a Medicare operated prescription drug plan option. The plan aims to reduce drug costs by negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The plan will offer standard prescription drug coverage with access to negotiated prices, and the monthly beneficiary premium will be uniform nationally. The Medicare operated prescription drug plan will have a uniform monthly premium determined by the Secretary based on average costs. Amendments to the Social Security Act will ensure availability of this plan. The Medicare operated prescription drug plan will be offered nationally and in addition to other qualifying plans in PDP regions. It will not be considered a qualifying or fallback plan for meeting requirements. The Secretary may designate the Medicare operated prescription drug plan as the fallback plan for certain service areas. Amendments include adding Medicare operated prescription drug plans to fallback plans and allowing for the use of a Medicare operated prescription drug plan as a fallback option. Amendments are made to Section 1860D-16(b)(1) and Section 1860D-41(a) of the Act regarding Medicare operated prescription drug plans. The effective date for these amendments is specified. The amendments made to Medicare prescription drug plans will take effect as if included in the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003."
