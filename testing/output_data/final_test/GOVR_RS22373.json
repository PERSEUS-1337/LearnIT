    "content": "This report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on the Navy's irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) operations, focusing on how much emphasis to place on IW and CT activities in Navy budgets amidst constraints and desires for high-end combat capabilities. Congress's decisions can impact Navy operations, funding requirements, and the nation's overall IW and CT strategies. The Navy has conducted irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) operations since the aftermath of 9/11, with visible activities in the Middle East and Afghanistan. The Marine Corps has around 1,300 Marines deployed in the U.S. CENTCOM area. The Marine Corps has around 1,300 active duty Marines and roughly 850 Marine Reserve members supporting U.S. CENTCOM operations. Additionally, there are about 1,000 Sailors ashore and roughly 6,500 afloat in the CENTCOM AOR, conducting various activities such as air operations, maritime infrastructure protection, combat engineering, logistics, security, and detainee operations. Navy IW operations post-9/11 have included security force assistance operations. The Navy has conducted various operations including security force assistance, civic assistance, disaster relief, and counter-piracy operations. The Marine Corps executed 170 operations, eight amphibious operations, 115 theater security cooperation events, and participated in 51 exercises and relief operations in the past year. In the past year, the Marine Corps executed 170 operations, 115 theater security cooperation events, and participated in 51 exercises and relief operations for Hurricanes Maria, Florence, and Michael. Amphibious Ready Groups / Marine Expeditionary Units supported Combatant commands and regional partners in various exercises and relief operations worldwide. The Navy also had active and reserve forces deployed in support of contingency operations overseas. The Navy's contributions to Irregular Warfare (IW) operations post-9/11 included Navy individual augmentees (IAs) serving in various roles such as USMC support, maritime security, cargo handling, and detainee operations. Navy IAs provided combat support for Army and Marine Corps personnel in Afghanistan, fulfilling traditional Navy roles and non-traditional roles like civil affairs and custom inspections teams. CT operations since the late 1990s, post-9/11, have included Navy SEALs targeting terrorists, Tomahawk missile attacks on training camps, surveillance of suspected terrorists, and maritime intercept operations to identify threats at sea. The Navy's activities in or near U.S. territorial waters include participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative, protecting Navy ships after the attack on the USS Cole, safeguarding bases, building maritime domain awareness with the Coast Guard, and assisting in port security operations. They also work on Global Maritime Intelligence Integration and Maritime Domain Awareness. The Navy's activities include combating terrorism through Maritime Interdiction Operations authorized by the President and directed by the Secretary of Defense. They conduct small, precise attacks against terrorist cells and missile strikes on extremist sanctuaries to counter violent extremists and uphold commitments to allies. The Navy SEALs conducted a successful operation in East Africa to eliminate Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a suspect in the 1998 embassy attacks. The original plan to use long-range missiles was changed last minute, and instead, a SEALs team helicoptered in to kill Nabhan and collect DNA samples. This operation was part of U.S. efforts to combat terrorism in the region. The U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed Osama bin Laden was reportedly carried out by a team of 23 Navy SEALs from Seal Team 6. Bin Laden's body was flown to a base in Afghanistan and then to the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson in the Northern Arabian Sea, where it was buried at sea. A special unit called Task Force 373, composed of Navy SEALs and Army Delta Force personnel, was involved in deactivating top Taliban and terrorists in Afghanistan. Reports also mention the operation that killed Osama bin Laden and the capture of a suspected militant involved in the Benghazi attacks, who was brought to the U.S. aboard a Navy transport ship for questioning. The Obama administration's interrogation strategy for suspected terrorists captured overseas is under scrutiny in the case of Abu Khattala, who faced questioning aboard the USS New York. His lawyers are challenging the process, leading to a potential court clash over the use of this tactic, which is seen as a vital tool by the government in prosecuting terrorists in U.S. courts. The Obama administration's interrogation strategy for suspected terrorists captured overseas involves questioning in international waters as an alternative to sending suspects to Guantanamo Bay or CIA prisons. The process includes initial intelligence gathering by interrogators, followed by FBI investigators advising detainees of their rights and collecting evidence for trial. Legal experts believe this hybrid technique may withstand legal challenges, but defense lawyers are concerned about potential coercion for confessions. Defense lawyers are worried that prolonged detention on a ship allows for interrogation tactics to extract confessions before suspects are presented before a judge. Abu Khattala, accused in the Benghazi attack, was captured in 2014 and questioned for days by different agencies while on a Navy ship. Abu Khattala's lawyers are concerned about his prolonged detention on a military ship for almost two weeks without constitutional protections, specifically for interrogation purposes. This case raises legal debates on prosecuting terrorist suspects and the admissibility of statements obtained aboard a military vessel. The Navy established the Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) in July 2008 to improve IW and CT capabilities. In January 2013, the Navy directed the establishment of a Navy Warfare Group (NWG) to develop new strategic concepts. NIWO was disbanded, and its responsibilities were transferred to NWG. The Navy established the Navy Irregular Warfare Office (NIWO) in July 2008 to improve IW and CT capabilities. In January 2013, the Navy directed the establishment of a Navy Warfare Group (NWG) to develop new strategic concepts. The Navy published a vision statement in January 2010 for countering irregular challenges, emphasizing Cooperative Security and operating with joint and international partners to enhance regional security and stability. In December 2010, a community of interest (COI) was established to address irregular challenges. The Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) was established in 2005 to confront irregular challenges globally. It manages readiness, resources, and training for an integrated expeditionary force of sailors deployed worldwide. The Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) was established in 2005 to address irregular challenges globally. It integrates Active Component and Reserve Component forces to provide a range of capabilities in the maritime environment. The Navy Reserve plays a significant role in training and equipping sailors for NECC missions, including naval construction, explosive ordnance disposal, maritime security, logistics, civil affairs, and intelligence. Coastal Riverine Group 2 has added armed escort missions for High Value Units, enhancing force protection during port transits. The Global Maritime Partnership aims to strengthen cooperation between the U.S. Navy and foreign maritime forces for global security. The Navy aims for partnerships with nations in Africa and Latin America for a common vision of freedom and stability. The Southern Partnership Station (SPS) and the Africa Partnership Station (APS) were Navy ships deployed to the Caribbean and Africa to support U.S. Navy engagement with countries in those regions, building security partnerships and increasing maritime-security capabilities. The SPS and APS are specific measures for promoting global maritime partnership. The Navy reestablished its riverine force in May 2006 with Riverine Group 1 at Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, VA. The Navy reestablished its riverine force in May 2006 with Riverine Group 1 at Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, VA. Group 1 included three active-duty riverine squadrons of 12 boats each that were established in 2006-2007. Operations of the squadrons from 2006 to 2011 included multiple deployments to Iraq for the purpose of relieving Marines conducting maritime security operations in Iraqi ports and waterways. On June 1, 2012, the Navy merged the riverine force and the Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) to create Coastal Riverine Force (CORIVFOR). CORIVFOR performs core maritime expeditionary security missions in green and brown waters, providing port and harbor security for vital waterways and protection of high value assets and maritime infrastructure. Scheduled to reach initial operating capability (IOC) in October 2012 and full operational capability (FOC) in October 2014. The Coastal Riverine Force was established in 2012, merging Riverine Forces and Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces. It consists of seven squadrons with boats ranging from combat raiding crafts to command boats. A disestablishment ceremony for Riverine Squadron 3 took place in January 2013. The disestablishment of Riverine Squadron 3 at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown on Jan. 17 marked the merger of offensive Riverine forces with defensive Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces to form the Coastal Riverine Force (CORIVFOR) in 2012. CORIVFOR's primary mission is maritime security operations, defending assets and infrastructure, and conducting offensive combat operations when commanded. Portions of the force were moved to San Diego as part of the National Defense Strategy's Pacific rebalance, bringing Riverine capability to the West coast for the first time since 1974. The Riverine forces are adapting to changes by reducing squadrons but maintaining capability. The merge creates three active Coastal Riverine squadrons and four reserve squadrons. Despite the reduction in capacity, the force remains affordable, light, and expeditionary, offering tailor-able and scalable capabilities for combatant commanders. RIVRON 3, commissioned in 2007, completed multiple deployments and missions in Iraq. The Navy has conducted numerous combat missions and water security operations, along with establishing various initiatives to support irregular warfare (IW) and counterterrorism (CT) operations. This includes a reserve civil affairs battalion, a Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) community, a maritime interception operation (MIO) intelligence exploitation pilot program, and an intelligence data-mining capability at the National Maritime Intelligence Center (NMIC). For more information on Navy and Marine Corps special operations forces, refer to prepared statements from a 2018 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. The Navy has established various initiatives to support irregular warfare and counterterrorism operations, including a reserve civil affairs battalion, a Navy Foreign Area Officer community, a maritime interception operation intelligence exploitation pilot program, and an intelligence data-mining capability at the National Maritime Intelligence Center. Additional background information on U.S. maritime irregular warfare operations can be found in a 2012 report from RAND Corporation, which also includes findings and recommendations related to U.S. maritime irregular warfare. The proposed FY2020 budget continues funding to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The FY2020 budget continues funding for counterterrorism operations in various locations, including support for special operations and intelligence capabilities. Special Operations Command's proposed budget includes funding for maritime systems and surface craft procurement. The FY2020 budget includes funding for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM in the Defense-Wide appropriation account. Congress may need to consider the emphasis on Irregular Warfare activities in Navy budgets amidst constraints and focus on developing high-end combat capabilities. The Navy has shown varying levels of emphasis on IW over the years, with recent actions potentially indicating a reduced focus. The Navy's emphasis on Irregular Warfare (IW) has declined in recent years, with reductions in funding and force structure. Responsibilities for IW now belong to OPNAV N515, with a significant decrease in dedicated IW staff. The closure of the Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command in May 2014 has also reduced civil affairs and security force assistance capacity within the Navy. The Navy's emphasis on Irregular Warfare has declined, with reductions in funding and force structure. The closure of the Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command has reduced civil affairs and security force assistance capacity within the Navy. The Navy does not possess dedicated Civil Affairs units or members. Funding was requested to preserve Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85, supporting Naval Special Warfare and other Special Operations Command assets. HSC 84 was disbanded, cutting operational capacity in half. The Navy is incorporating its elite special warfare teams into strategic calculations for every. The TSUs under the Navy's proposed FY2017 budget may meet SOF requirements. The Navy Community of Interest for Countering Irregular Challenges includes Fleet Forces Command, NECC, Navy Undersea Warfare Center, and Navy War College. The larger COI has not had a formal meeting in approximately 3 years. The Navy is integrating its elite special warfare teams into strategic planning for potential major power conflicts, including China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This initiative began under former Naval Special Warfare Command head Rear Adm. Brian Losey and has continued to expand under subsequent commanders. These teams are now included in all exercises, war games, and tabletop discussions to enhance coordination with regular Navy forces. The Navy SEALs are shifting their focus from counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East to threats from China, Russia, and other adversaries. They are looking to triple their training time in the Hawaiian islands and are being included in all aspects of planning for potential major power conflicts. The Navy SEALs are shifting their focus to threats from China, Russia, and other adversaries. They are being included in all aspects of planning for potential major power conflicts, with a specific role to play in all situations. Since 2001, special operations forces have focused on specific skill sets. Special operations forces, including the SEALs, have a range of expertise beyond their traditional skill sets, such as reconnaissance, unconventional operations, and foreign humanitarian assistance, as highlighted in a 2017 report by analysts at CNA. These skills are relevant to both large-scale military conflicts and global competition. The United States recognizes the need for a counteractive approach in global competition. Navy SEALs possess unique talents that can enhance military operations. The SEALs are planning to increase training in Hawaii to better prepare for future campaigns. The Navy SEALs are planning to increase training in Hawaii, including on non-federal land and waterways, to enhance their traditional skill sets and bolster the Navy's lethality. This expansion aims to prepare for future campaigns and reconnect with their roots. Potential oversight questions for Congress include comparing current Navy IW capabilities and capacity with those of 5 or 10 years ago, assessing future Navy IW capabilities under proposed budgets, and determining the balance between funding for IW capabilities and other Navy priorities. Congress may also need to evaluate visibility into U.S. SOF operations, including Navy SEALs, and the role of Seal Team 6 in Navy CT and IW operations. The Navy's SEAL Team 6 has conducted deadly missions in Somalia and Afghanistan, using a variety of weapons and tactics. They have evolved into a global manhunting machine after more than a decade of combat, operating in secret and carrying out missions to kill or capture targets. Bin Laden has evolved into a global manhunting machine through more than a decade of combat, reflecting America's new way of war focused on relentless killing of suspected militants. SEAL Team 6, a secretive Special Operations unit, has blurred the lines between soldier and spy, carrying out clandestine intelligence operations alongside traditional combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. SEAL Team 6, originally a sniper unit, was transformed to conduct covert intelligence operations as part of the Omega Program with the CIA. While credited with weakening militant networks through dangerous raids, concerns have been raised about excessive killing and civilian deaths. Limited outside oversight has allowed JSOC, which oversees Team 6 missions, to conduct internal inquiries without involving Navy investigators, leading to potential issues of accountability. The secrecy surrounding SEAL Team 6's operations, similar to the CIA's drone strikes, raises concerns about accountability and civilian casualties. Limited oversight and lack of public debate make it difficult to assess the unit's actions and their consequences. In FY2020, $72.6 million was allocated for Special Operations Command maritime systems, including $45.2 million for Underwater Systems and $15.6 million for Surface Craft. Additionally, $27.4 million was designated for procurement of underwater systems for SOCOM. Congressional action on the funding requests is summarized in Table 1. Rear Admiral Tim Szymanski and Major General Carl E. Mundy provided testimony on Special Operations Forces in April 2018. The U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command discussed efforts to transform the force for future security challenges during a hearing on April 11, 2018. Rear Admiral Szymanski highlighted the security challenges posed by Violent Extremist Organizations (VEOs) and near-peer competitors. Near-peer competitors and rogue regimes are using aggressive tactics below armed conflict to gain advantages that threaten national security. The Naval Special Warfare Command, with nearly 10,000 personnel, operates globally in over 35 countries with a budget of less than one percent of the Department of the Navy's budget. The Naval Special Warfare Command operates globally in over 35 countries, working with the U.S. Navy, allies, and partners to support national objectives. The Command aligns with the National Defense Strategy to be more agile, lethal, and innovative in maintaining a competitive advantage. The Chief of Naval Operations emphasizes increasing Naval Power through capability, capacity, readiness, and sustainment. The Commander's challenge is to prepare the Force to support the NDS, National Military Strategy, and Navy's Maritime Strategy. The Naval Special Warfare Command aligns with the National Defense Strategy to support national objectives globally. The focus is on reasserting maritime Special Operations capabilities, enhancing partnerships with the Navy, and optimizing resources for battlefield impact. Manpower requirements are being reassessed to meet future threats effectively. The Naval Special Warfare Command is focused on optimizing resources for battlefield impact and increasing combat lethality. They recently collaborated on a maritime experiment in Southern California to explore the use of unmanned systems and advance artificial intelligence in current conflicts. Investments have been made to refine capabilities and increase lethality. The Naval Special Warfare Command has made significant investments to increase lethality and refine capabilities, including enhancing unmanned aerial vehicle lethality, modernizing small arms systems, and improving maritime mobility platforms through partnerships with maritime industries. The Naval Special Warfare Command has strengthened partnerships with maritime industries to introduce new high-performance surface combatant craft, including the Combatant Craft Assault, Combatant Craft Medium, and Combatant Craft Heavy. They are also introducing new undersea submersibles, the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) and the Dry Combat Submersible (DCS), to enhance undersea mobility capabilities. The Naval Special Warfare Command has leveraged industry technology investments to rapidly develop innovative operational capabilities for warfighters, utilizing new DoD contracting authorities and outreach platforms. They have successfully applied new opportunities, such as Artificial Intelligence-Autonomy for ISR Drones, to enhance mission capabilities in a more agile and lethal manner. Our focus on innovation at USSOCOM is driven by our people, who are our primary weapons system. We invest heavily in selecting, training, and maintaining personnel of character, who are highly skilled and trusted to execute sensitive missions. Thank you for your role in this sustainable effort. The 10-year, $1 billion Silver Strand Training Center-South is crucial for the operational readiness of the NSW Force, consolidating training requirements and promoting efficiency. It aims to support operators' well-being, extending their service life and ensuring a high quality post-service life. The USSOCOM Preservation of the Force and Family program, with strong Congressional support, aims to build resilience and provide long-term care for operators and their families. Professional care providers have helped improve negative trends, with an increase in service members and families seeking support from clinical psychologists, social workers, and nurse case managers. Cross referrals among care providers show mutual support and trust. Our athletic trainers, strength coaches, and physical therapists provide tailored programs resulting in injury reduction and faster recovery times, impacting team readiness.

In Coronado, California, Class 330 at BUD/S is training to become part of the Navy's elite special operations force, with rigorous requirements including swimming 48 miles, hiking over 150 miles, and completing 40 dives. At the end of 63 weeks of training, Class 330 at BUD/S will have completed 40 dives and spent a minimum of 60 hours underwater. Naval Special Warfare Command prioritizes the long-term health and well-being of its personnel, focusing on strengthening, equipping, and protecting them for operations around the world. They aim to outpace enemies with new technologies and adapt their structure to remain relevant and lethal. Major General Mundy's statement highlights the role of Marine Raiders within the Marine Corps as part of USSOCOM. MARSOC, through specialized training, aims to produce agile and responsive special operations forces. Task organized for each mission, MARSOC leverages its robust command and control capability. MARSOC, established in 2006, provides full spectrum special operations capabilities to combat transregional threats. They work to minimize pressure on their force and families while preparing for future threats by adapting training methods based on feedback from deployed forces. MARSOC adapts training methods based on feedback from deployed forces to prepare Raiders for future threats. They prioritize access to POTFF resources to support their individuals and families, recognizing them as their most valuable resource. The Commander emphasizes the importance of balancing operational commitments with time spent at home station to safeguard and sustain MARSOC's human capital. The POTFF program is continuously evolving to meet the changing demands and needs of the force. MARSOC, comprised of Marines, Sailors, and civilians, is a well-trained and well-equipped special operations force that has been crucial in various modern battlefields. With a rich history rooted in expeditionary operations against irregular threats, MARSOC continues to evolve and provide Raiders to counter national threats. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) did not provide a service component to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) until 2005, but has a history of conducting and supporting special operations. In 1942, the Marine Corps established Raider battalions for amphibious landings, raiding expeditions, and guerilla-type operations behind enemy lines. Marine Raiders were known for their intellectual dynamism. During the Vietnam War and Cold War era, the Marine Corps lacked a formal specialized unit, but Marines served in specialized Joint and tailored conventional units like force reconnaissance and Marine Expeditionary Units. The end of the Cold War and events like 9/11 led to the need for additional special operations capacity. In response to the need for more special operations capacity, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld called for the Marines to work closely with USSOCOM. This led to the creation of Marine Corps Forces, Special Operations Command (MARSOC) in November 2005. MARSOC comprises a headquarters, Marine Raider Regiment, Marine Raider Support Group, and Marine Raider Training Center, with forces on both the east and west coasts. MARSOC was activated on 24 February 2006 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. MARSOC, based at Camp Pendleton, California, commands 3,000 Marines, Sailors, and Federal Civilians worldwide for special operations missions supporting SOCOM and combatant commands. Priorities include counterterrorism, direct action, reconnaissance, and humanitarian assistance. MARSOC focuses on providing integrated full spectrum SOF, capabilities integration with Marine Air Ground Task Forces, future force development, and preserving the force and families. They maintain three Marine Special Operations Companies in different command areas, with approximately 400 Raiders deployed across 18 countries for special operations tasks. MARSOC maintains multiple Marine Special Operations Companies in different command areas, with a focus on integrated capabilities and high-end recruitment processes to provide a competitive edge against adversaries. Deployed formations bring integrated capabilities across all functional areas for special operations missions. MARSOC's training and selection methods are effective, with a focus on progressive training for individuals in special operations specialties. The RAVEN exercise is conducted six times a year to assess and certify Marine Special Operations Companies for deployment, emphasizing realistic decision-making for commanders. MARSOC incorporates current lessons from deployed units and anticipates enemy actions to support joint contingency planning. Recent RAVEN exercises in Tennessee exposed teams to foreign intelligence threats and degraded communications environments. The training environments evolve based on emerging threats, integrating conventional Marine Corps resources into SOF-centric exercises. Priority 2 focuses on capabilities integration with Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs) to maximize complementary capabilities in the face of near-peer threats. Seamless integration between Special Operations Forces (SOF) and conventional forces is crucial in today's complex operating environment to leverage strengths and offset vulnerabilities. Future Force Development is a priority for MARSOC as they adapt to evolving operating environments and complex threats. Constant innovation and evolution are crucial for success, with a focus on bottom-up driven development processes. Interoperability and capabilities integration with conventional forces are essential, especially in high-intensity combat scenarios. Examples of this occur globally, with efforts to institutionalize cooperation through wargames, exercises, and training. MARSOC's development concept combines bottom-up feedback with top-down processes for equipment research, testing, and procurement. They are closely integrated with SOCOM and the Marine Corps for expedited technology procurement. Steps have been taken for capability development in areas like freeze dried plasma and counter-UAS defense. MARSOC is focusing on enhancing their warfighting capabilities with advanced technology such as organic precision fires, counter-UAS defense, and big data analytics. They are also preparing for operations in degraded communication environments to simulate facing near-peer competitors. MARSOC is committed to developing critical combined arms skills to increase lethality and maintain a tactical advantage over adversaries. They are training in diverse environments to replicate battlefield conditions and are working on a MARSOC-specific futures concept to address regional competition and instability in the future operating environment. The results of futures analysis conducted over the past 18 months have implications for MARSOC's future capabilities to meet challenges in a volatile, complex environment. Four interconnected themes emerged from internal wargame series, providing a strong conceptual basis for a future MARSOC force. The four core pathways of innovation for MARSOC's future capabilities are: MARSOF as a Connector, Combined Arms for the Connected Arena, The Cognitive Operator, and Enterprise Level Agility. These pathways aim to enhance MARSOC's ability to integrate and synchronize U.S. Governmental capabilities with USSOF and partner nation actions. The vision document, MARSOF 2030, delves into these pathways and their interconnectedness. The future capabilities of MARSOC focus on non-military solutions, including cyber and information domains for conflict. The Cognitive Operator pathway emphasizes the need for SOF operators with foresight and influence capabilities. The future Raiders of MARSOC will have expanded capabilities to influence allies, understand complex problems, and excel in both virtual and physical combat. The 'Enterprise Level Agility' innovation pathway leverages MARSOC's small size as an advantage, allowing for rapid adaptation to new challenges. This organizational dexterity provides SOCOM with an agile and adaptable force. Priority 4 focuses on the Preservation of the Force and Families, emphasizing the importance of institutional and operational agility for the SOCOM Commander. Priority 4 for the SOCOM Commander is the Preservation of the Force and Families program, which aims to provide resources for personal resiliency and longevity in service for MARSOC Raiders and their families. Special operators and capability specialists spend more time deployed than at home, with additional time spent training in CONUS. The Command focuses on balancing service members' schedules between training at home station and away, with a high operational tempo. The Preservation of the Force and Families program supports human performance, behavioral health, spiritual fitness, and family-oriented opportunities. Congressional funding is crucial for these programs, and there is a culture of accountability within the Command. The Command emphasizes a culture of accountability, focusing on issues like sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. They have a low number of reported sexual assault cases and attribute this to their messaging campaign and strong SAPR program. The goal is to eradicate misconduct and provide personnel embodying values of accountability and integrity. In conclusion, Marine Raiders are committed to providing full spectrum special operations capability with an 'unconquerable spirit'. Marine Special Operators will always remain faithful and forward. The Navy's prepared statement for a November 3, 2011, hearing on Navy IW activities is included in Appendix B.

The Navy enhances regional security through offshore options for conflict management, including assurance, deterrence, and crisis response. It builds maritime partner capability and operates with joint and international partners to dissuade, deter, and defeat irregular threats. Fleet-SOF Integration extends reach into denied areas for successful counterterrorism missions. The Navy provides combat capabilities, collects mission critical information, and supports counterterrorism operations with shipboard controlled UAV orbits. Efforts to improve integration include pre-deployment training, mission rehearsals, fleet bandwidth allocation, shipboard C4I enhancements, and C2 relationships for prosecuting time sensitive targets. Establishing enduring maritime partnerships is a long-term strategy for securing the maritime commons amidst legal, jurisdictional, and diplomatic complexities. The Navy emphasizes partnership engagements with U.S. and international maritime forces to secure the maritime commons from exploitation by irregular actors. Information sharing initiatives are crucial for rapidly fielding solutions to emerging challenges. Development of Tri-Service Maritime Stability Operations doctrine and Navy Expeditionary Combat Command capabilities are key for addressing irregular threats in the littorals. The Navy continues to provide in-demand capabilities such as Maritime Civil Affairs Teams, Riverine Forces, Maritime Security Forces, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Teams, and Expeditionary Intelligence Teams. They meet global operational commitments, with active and reserve Sailors serving worldwide. Carrier Strike Groups offer close air support in Afghanistan, and Navy and Marine Corps pilots conduct electronic attack missions. The Navy is globally present and engaged, conducting counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. In the past year, the Navy conducted counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea, trained local forces in maritime security globally, supported NATO in operations in Libya, and provided humanitarian assistance in Haiti, Pakistan, and Japan. They also organized the world's largest maritime exercise, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC), involving 14 nations and over 20,000 military personnel to enhance coordination and trust in multi-national operations in the Pacific. Sailors deployed worldwide to project US influence, respond to contingencies, and build international relationships for the safe flow of commerce. The Navy's future vision focuses on meeting global challenges, maintaining a strong presence critical to US national interests. As global trends point to increased maritime demand, seapower allows for global influence without a permanent footprint ashore. The Navy aims to project power globally with a forward-deployed presence to prevent conflict, enhance maritime security, and respond to crises. In a capacity-constrained environment, prioritization of persistent presence in unstable regions is crucial to maintaining readiness and effectiveness. The Navy emphasizes the importance of remaining the finest, best trained, and most ready in the world to confront irregular challenges and capable adversaries. They seek to work with Congress to address future challenges and appreciate support at this critical juncture in U.S. history. Appendices include the Navy's 2010 vision statement for irregular warfare and findings from a 2012 RAND Corporation report on maritime irregular warfare. Maritime irregular warfare (MIW) operations have implications for both MIW and irregular warfare (IW) operations in general. The maritime force is often underutilized in IW, countries with a maritime dimension linked to insurgency could benefit from enhanced civil-military operations (CMOs) in the maritime arena, and maritime operations can help the US scale its ground involvement effectively. Managing strategic expectations based on realistic assessments of partner capabilities is crucial for future MIW engagements involving capacity-building efforts. The United States should provide equipment and technology that partners can maintain easily when building partner capacity in maritime and land-based irregular warfare. Coastal maritime interdiction can help cut supply lines supporting insurgencies. U.S. involvement in maritime irregular warfare may face legitimacy challenges in global public opinion. International cooperation and interoperability with partner navies are crucial for confronting maritime irregular warfare adversaries. The report recommends that U.S. naval forces should provide partners with suitable equipment and increase interoperability. Training partner forces to address future maritime irregular warfare threats is also advised. Operating from a sea base offers advantages, but decisions regarding sea basing need to be carefully made due to costs. Naval Special Warfare Command will likely have ongoing requirements for maritime operations. NSW is likely to have ongoing requirements for maritime interdiction and containment. The United States could benefit from maintaining capabilities to assist partners in surveillance against small submarines and mining threats. NSW should consider increasing its capacity for maritime-based CMOs. U.S. naval forces should consider their role in supporting irregular ground operations from the sea and interdiction campaigns. Conventional U.S. Navy capabilities for IW might involve CMOs and related activities more than direct action. The appendix provides background on the detention of terrorist suspects on U.S. Navy ships. The U.S. military captured a Somali terrorism suspect in the Gulf of Aden and interrogated him aboard a U.S. Navy ship for over two months before flying him to New York. Another individual was also apprehended on the boat. The capture took place on April 19, and the other suspect was released shortly after. The captured Somali terrorism suspect, Warsame, was interrogated daily by military and civilian intelligence interrogators. Options discussed in Washington included releasing him, transferring him, keeping him prisoner aboard the ship, military commission trial, or federal court trial. The unanimous decision was to seek a federal indictment due to concerns about the limitations of military commission jurisdiction for terrorism cases. The captured Somali terrorism suspect, Warsame, was interrogated daily aboard a ship. He was not provided access to an attorney initially, but was later advised of his Miranda rights. Experts criticized the interrogation process as a return to discredited \"black site\" prisons. After a four-day break, the defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and spoke to law enforcement agents. The questioning continued for seven days, with the defendant waiving his rights each day. U.S. Navy Vice Adm. William H. McRaven mentioned the captures in testimony before a Senate committee, highlighting the lack of clear plans and legal approvals for handling terrorism suspects seized outside of Iraq and Afghanistan. Senator Carl Levin raised concerns about the detention of individuals in this context. McRaven discussed the detention of individuals captured by American forces in the Gulf region, including Mr. Warsame who was questioned on a naval vessel for two months. The legality of his detention was justified by the laws of war. The detention of Mr. Warsame was justified by the laws of war. Interrogators used techniques from the Army Field Manual and did not give a Miranda warning initially to gather intelligence. After a break, a separate group of interrogators delivered a Miranda warning, but Mr. Warsame continued to cooperate. Officials said Mr. Warsame continued to cooperate and would likely have his subsequent statements admissible in court. Administration officials unanimously decided to prosecute him in civilian court, where he could face life in prison if convicted. Detainees are sometimes kept on Navy ships until the Justice Department can build a case against them or they are transferred to other countries for detention, although such detentions are rare. No other detainees are currently held on a Navy ship. The Obama administration used a new approach by interrogating a Somali man aboard a Navy ship before transferring him to New York for a civilian trial on terrorism charges. The suspect, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, was accused of aiding Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen and the Somali militant group Shabab. The U.S. Navy ship involved was the amphibious assault ship Boxer (LHD-4). The administration faced both praise and criticism for its decisions regarding Warsame. The Obama administration developed a new targeting list called the \"disposition matrix\" for pursuing terrorists beyond drone strikes. The database maps out plans for suspects and involves multiple agencies in case suspects surface unexpectedly. The Obama administration created a \"disposition matrix\" to target terrorists beyond drone strikes, involving multiple agencies in case suspects are found unexpectedly. The matrix includes plans for suspects in different countries, such as capturing them by ship or having local authorities take action. An example cited was the capture of alleged al-Qaeda operative Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame off the coast of Yemen, who was held on a U.S. ship before being transferred to the Justice Department for prosecution. An accused Al Qaeda operative, Abu Anas al-Libi, captured by US commandos in Libya, is being interrogated on a Navy ship in the Mediterranean. He is expected to be sent to New York for prosecution. Abu Anas is considered a valuable source of intelligence on Al Qaeda, with two decades of information. The decision to question him without a lawyer present follows a successful pattern used by the Obama administration with other terrorist suspects. Abu Anas is being held aboard the U.S.S. San Antonio. Abu Anas al-Libi, a suspected terrorist linked to Al Qaeda, is being held on a U.S. Navy warship for interrogation. He is expected to be transferred to New York for prosecution. The USS San Antonio is being used for this mission, with military and civilian interrogators questioning him for intelligence before his formal arrest and trial in Washington, D.C. The Navy has a history of using ships as floating prisons for captured terrorists, with examples like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame and Abu Anas al-Libi being interrogated at sea before facing criminal charges in the United States. The U.S. government has been using Navy assets as floating prisons for dangerous terrorists like Warsame and al-Libi. Interrogators gather crucial intelligence from high-value sources during the slow journey back to the United States. Warsame cooperated with FBI, CIA, and Defense Department officials while at sea, leading to subsequent counterterrorism operations. Al-Libi, due to a medical condition, was detained at sea for a shorter period but also provided valuable intelligence. The U.S. government uses Navy ships as floating prisons for terrorists like Abu Khattala due to limited detention options. The Obama administration aims to end detention operations at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and has not sent new detainees there since 2008. Other overseas facilities for suspected terrorists raise legal and humanitarian concerns. Despite the opportunity to question Abu Khattala before his arraignment, using foreign facilities is not feasible. The U.S. government uses Navy ships as floating prisons for terrorists like Abu Khattala due to limited detention options. The Navy has taken on the role of high-seas prison warden, raising questions about U.S. rendition efforts and international legal rules.

USSOCOM is pursuing programs to enhance the sub-surface capabilities of US Navy SEALs with SWCS and DCS, providing enclosed vehicles for operators with different insertion distances and depth capabilities. The SWCS is a new combat submersible platform designed to replace legacy SEAL Swimmer Delivery Vehicles, with improved electronic architecture and software. Two SWCS platforms will be procured by the DoD in 2017, capable of transporting six operators at low-level depths with a total payload of 10,000 lb. Operational evaluation will precede full entry into service, with delivery to USSOCOM expected in 2017. Teledyne Brown Engineering, the SWCS contractor, could not provide further details due to operational security. Teledyne Brown Engineering, the contractor for the new combat submersible platform SWCS, could not provide further details to IHS Jane's due to operational security. The SWCS measures approximately 22 ft in length and 5 ft in width, with the nomenclature Mk 9 expected to be granted. General Dynamics Information Technology continues to support legacy Mk 8 Mod 1 SDV systems for the NSWC. A new dry diver lock-in/lock-out solution, the DCS, has been designed. The DCS solution, developed as a dry diver lock-in/lock-out system, can insert and extract personnel and combat equipment in hostile waters. It has a larger payload capacity than the SWCS, carrying up to 40,000 lb at depths as low as 58 m and a maximum operating range of 60 n miles. Lockheed Martin and Submergence Group are jointly designing, developing, and manufacturing the DCS for USSOCOM, with a contract worth USD166 million for three vehicles over five years. The DCS solution, developed as a dry diver lock-in/lock-out system, will involve the delivery of three vehicles over a five-year period, with a gross weight of more than 30 tons each. The DCS will be launched from surface vessels to insert SEAL operators over long distances underwater onto objectives and target areas. The design will feature technology from Lockheed Martin's S302 Manned Combat Submersible, capable of carrying six personnel, a pilot, and navigator in a dry one-atmosphere environment. Lockheed Martin's S302 MCS measures 31 ft in length and can operate 100 m below the surface for over 24 hours. It can travel up to 60 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 5 knots, with a top speed of over 7.5 knots for rapid reaction. USSOCOM integrates Dry Deck Shelter technology on Ohio-class SSBNs and Virginia-class SSNs for special operations support. By the end of 2016, nine submarines will have DDS capabilities for launching and recovering SDVs. Modifications in 2017 will integrate DCS and SWCS, including equipment relocation and upgrades for improved operations. DDS solutions are being extended to support a 'mothership' concept for maritime special forces. The new underwater vehicles, known as dry combat submersibles, will enable SEALs to insert at greater distances from submarines and surface vessels, providing better protection from the elements during missions. The new dry combat submersibles, similar to mini-submarines, will enhance SEALs' readiness and communication capabilities for critical missions. The first submersible is set to arrive in July 2018, with operational readiness expected by the fall and final testing in 2019. SEALs currently have two demonstrator vehicles to test, with one being 39 feet long, 7 to 8 feet in diameter, and weighing 30 tons. These vehicles can reach speeds of up to five knots for 60 nautical miles and are surface-launched for deployment. The new dry combat submersibles, similar to mini-submarines, will enhance SEALs' readiness and communication capabilities for critical missions. The submersible can hold up to eight SEALs, a pilot, and navigator in three compartments. Navy Capt. Kate Dolloff stated that the DCS Program will provide a capability that warfighters have not had in a long time. Lockheed Martin finalized a contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command for the delivery of three submersibles by 2020 at a total cost of $236 million. This program is significantly faster and cheaper than a previous submersible program that was canceled in 2006 due to cost overruns. The new submersibles will be based on off-the-shelf commercial technology developed by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin has developed a new \"missile sub\" called the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle for the US Special Operations Command. The submersibles, based on commercial technology, will have 80 to 90 percent of the same capability as previous vehicles but will be delivered faster and at a lower cost. The program includes a fixed price incentive fee structure to share any cost overruns with the manufacturer. Lockheed Martin has developed new submersible vehicles for the US Special Operations Command, allowing warfighters to travel deeper and farther underwater. The dry submersibles support two operators and up to six swimmers, providing an alternative to traditional wet submersibles. The vehicles have a depth rating of 328 ft, a lock-out depth of 98 ft, and a top speed of 5 knots. The new vehicles boast improved hydrodynamics and propulsion compared to previous models. The U.S. Navy is developing new underwater transports for SEALs, including the Shallow Water Combat Submersible and the Dry Combat Submersible. The former will carry six commandos over short distances near the surface, while the latter will transport six individuals much farther and at greater depths. The Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) prototype, weighing almost 40,000 pounds, can travel up to 60 nautical miles at 190 feet below the waves. Commandos could reach enemy territory or start at a safer distance. SEALs could use the added range to escape pursuers. The DCS is fully enclosed unlike current SDVs, which are open to water. The DCS continues where the Advanced SEAL Delivery System left off, which was canceled in 2006 due to cost overruns. Special Operations Command aims to have the SWCS ready for deployment. Special Operations Command plans to have the Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) ready by 2017, with the goal of getting it in service by the following year. They also aim to have bigger submarines to carry mini-subs closer to their targets. Currently, Ohio- and Virginia-class subs are equipped to carry specialized mini-subs inside Dry-Deck Shelters. The Navy modified these ships, originally carrying nuclear warheads, to accommodate the mini-subs. The Navy spent billions modifying decades-old ships to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles and SEALs. Newer attack submarines like the Virginias were designed for various missions. SOCOM plans to have nine submersible motherships, with a modernization program stretching the DDS units by 50 inches to accommodate mini-subs. Launching undersea vehicles will be made easier with the updated design. The Navy plans to automate the process of getting SDVs out of the metal enclosure for SEAL missions by 2020, eliminating the need for manual opening and closing of hatches underwater. This will make it easier for crews to launch undersea vehicles from submersible motherships."
