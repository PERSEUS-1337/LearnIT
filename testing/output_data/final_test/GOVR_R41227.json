    "content": "The history of energy tax policy can be divided into five eras: oil and gas period (1916-1970), energy crisis period (1970s), free-market era of the Reagan Administration (1980s), post-Reagan era (1990s), and the renewed interest in promoting renewable energy in the 2000s. Federal energy tax policy focused on increasing domestic oil and gas reserves for over half a century, with no incentives for renewable energy or energy efficiency. Two major tax preferences were established for oil and gas, including expensing of intangible drilling costs (IDCs) and dry hole costs in 1916. The tax preferences for oil and gas, such as expensing intangible drilling costs and dry hole costs, were established in 1916. In 1926, the excess of percentage over cost depletion deferral was introduced, allowing a fixed percentage deduction of gross receipts. These provisions remained the largest energy tax provisions until the mid-1980s. However, events in the 1970s led to a shift in federal energy tax policy due to budget deficits and environmental concerns, promoting alternative energy sources and energy efficiency. The oil embargo and energy crises in the 1970s prompted policymakers to enact policies promoting alternative fuels, energy efficiency, and domestic energy production. This included shifting energy policy through the tax code by reducing tax preferences for the oil industry and introducing excise taxes on fossil fuels. In response to the oil embargo and energy crises in the 1970s, policymakers implemented tax incentives to promote energy efficiency, alternative fuels, and domestic energy production. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 and the Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 introduced measures to discourage fossil fuel production and encourage unconventional and renewable fuels. Despite these efforts, revenue losses from energy tax provisions primarily benefited the oil and gas industry until the 1980s. In recent years, there has been a shift towards providing incentives for renewable energy development. The Reagan Administration opposed using tax incentives to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, believing high oil prices would naturally drive investment in these areas. Congress allowed many energy tax provisions from the Energy Tax Act of 1978 to expire in line with a free market approach. The Reagan Administration allowed most energy tax provisions from the Energy Tax Act of 1978 to expire as scheduled. Only the tax credit for energy property was extended. The windfall profit tax was repealed in 1988. Oil and gas tax incentives were scaled back under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In the post-Reagan era, energy tax policy became more interventionist with provisions promoting renewable energy sources, alcohol fuels, and unconventional fuels. Tax incentives for oil and gas industry continued. President George H. W. Bush enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, which increased gasoline tax by 5\u00a2 per gallon. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90; P.L. 101-508) increased the gasoline tax by 5\u00a2 per gallon and doubled the gas-guzzler tax. It also introduced a 10% tax credit for enhanced oil recovery expenditures, expanded the unconventional fuel production credit, and included a tax credit for small ethanol producers. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486) established the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) for electricity generated using wind or closed-loop biomass systems, along with other energy tax provisions. The Tax Relief and Extension Act of 1999 included various tax incentives for clean-fuel vehicles, alcohol fuels, unconventional fuel production, and oil and gas. President Clinton's proposed Btu tax on fossil fuels was replaced with a motor fuel excise tax increase in 1993. The revenues from the tax increase were allocated for deficit reduction. In the late 1990s, low crude oil prices impacted oil producers and discouraged investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Rising oil prices in the early 2000s prompted energy legislation discussions in Congress, with energy tax subsidies extended in the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 included various tax credits and deductions for energy-related initiatives, such as electric vehicles, clean fuel vehicles, alcohol fuels, and biodiesel. EPACT05 addressed concerns about energy security, environmental quality, and economic growth by introducing tax provisions for energy infrastructure, domestic fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and clean motor vehicles and fuels. EPACT05 significantly increased energy tax subsidies, with 38 programs listed in the 2007 budget, up from 11 in the 1990s. The provisions aimed to boost domestic energy production and efficiency, including incentives for electricity generation and restructuring of the electric utility industry. EPACT05 introduced incentives for investment in electricity generation and transmission, including fossil fuel incentives and energy efficiency provisions. It also expanded incentives for alcohol fuels and clean motor vehicles to reduce energy consumption in the transportation sector. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act reduced tax subsidies to oil and gas, while the Tax Relief and Health Care Act extended renewable energy provisions. The 2008 Farm Bill promoted cellulosic ethanol through a blenders credit, and the 2008 and 2009 stimulus bills expanded energy tax incentives for renewables and efficiency. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extended tax breaks to promote renewable energy production. The extended tax breaks in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 were financed by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified incentives for renewable energy production, energy efficiency, and clean motor vehicles. ARRA focused on extending energy tax provisions promoting renewables, efficiency, and alternative technology vehicles. Section 1603 grants for renewables changed federal incentives significantly. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, discussed in the previous paragraph, substantially changed federal incentives for renewable energy by converting tax credits into direct cash payments. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Section 1603 grant program and tax credits for alcohol fuels through 2011, but not the tax credits for advanced energy manufacturing. The tax code intervenes in energy markets to address market failures such as externalities, principal-agent problems, and national security concerns. Negative externalities from energy production and consumption, like air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, can be mitigated by imposing taxes on activities like driving gasoline-powered vehicles. Imposing a tax equal to the environmental and congestion damages reduces driving quantity. The tax aligns the price of driving with social marginal cost, considering both individual and societal costs. Policymakers may also subsidize activities with fewer negative externalities, like public transportation or renewable energy production. Subsidizing renewable energy reduces energy prices, increasing demand and consumption, which hinders energy efficiency initiatives. Government intervention in energy markets is justified due to principal-agent problems, where consumers may not make energy-efficient equipment decisions. This intervention may require raising revenue through distortionary taxes. Tax policies that lower the cost of energy-efficient appliances can boost their installation, but current policies do not target markets with principal-agent issues like rental housing. Information gaps and market barriers also justify government intervention in energy markets, as consumers may not be aware of the benefits of energy-efficient devices. Consumers often require a high rate of return for energy-efficiency investments due to high initial costs. Tax policies can address inefficiencies caused by externalities, but may not be effective when informational barriers exist. Tax subsidies, informational programs, and consumer lending programs can all encourage investments in energy efficiency. National security concerns are also a reason for intervention in energy markets, as much of the U.S.'s petroleum comes from foreign sources. The United States relies on foreign sources for petroleum, which can lead to external costs, especially when imported from unstable regions. This reliance may weaken national defense and increase military vulnerability. Allocating resources to national defense due to high oil imports has opportunity costs for domestic policy initiatives. Failure to consider these costs results in market failure. Imposing a tax on imported oil to correct this externality may violate trade agreements. The economic well-being and security of the nation depend on stable energy sources, with national costs associated with unstable energy supplies. Domestic production subsidies for oil and gas may reduce production costs but are unlikely to impact consumer prices significantly. The United States, as an open economy, will be affected by world oil price fluctuations regardless of domestic energy production levels. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 defines tax expenditures as revenue losses from federal tax laws allowing exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential rates, or deferrals. The Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation provide annual tax expenditure estimates, excluding excise tax provisions. Tax expenditures are not considered excise tax credits or rate reductions. While grants paid by the Treasury are not tax expenditures either, as they involve direct federal outlays. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced revenue by reducing tax rates and eliminating various tax expenditures. Figure 1 shows the trend in tax expenditures from 1977 to 2010, with revenue losses increasing from less than 6% to nearly 10% of GDP. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced revenue losses associated with tax expenditures, but since the late 1980s, these losses have been increasing. This increase is due to rising incomes and the introduction of new tax expenditure provisions. Energy-related tax expenditures have also contributed to the overall trend. The importance of energy tax expenditures decreased significantly from the 1980s to 2009, with revenue losses dropping to less than 1% of total tax expenditures. This shift may indicate a preference for other mechanisms over tax incentives to achieve energy policy goals, such as federal grants and energy-related mandates like the ARRA's Section 1603 grant program. The tax credit program for renewable energy was converted into a grant program, not delivered through the tax code. Estimating revenue losses from tax provisions is complex due to interaction effects and changes in taxpayer behavior. While summing tax expenditure estimates may not be accurate, it provides a useful approximation of energy tax expenditures trends. Energy tax expenditures trends from 1977 to 2010 are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, showing benefits primarily to the oil and gas industry. The accuracy of revenue loss estimates from tax provisions is uncertain, but examining trends remains valuable. Before the ETA78, annual revenue losses from expensing IDCs and percentage depletion provisions in the oil and gas industry exceeded $2 billion ($6 billion in 2010 dollars). Despite the ETA78 and WPT80 promoting efficiency and renewable fuels, most energy tax expenditures still stemmed from these provisions. In 1981, oil and gas tax provisions caused $4.9 billion in revenue losses, while residential energy efficiency credits resulted in $0.5 billion ($10.5 billion and $1.2 billion in 2010 dollars, respectively). The majority of the $1.2 billion in \"other\" energy tax expenditures came from IDCs and depletion provisions for non-gas fuels and the energy credit for renewable energy investment. By 1988, energy tax expenditures were only $0.6 billion ($1 billion in 2010 dollars), with a negative tax expenditure estimate associated with the expensing of IDCs for oil and gas. The reduction in energy tax expenditures in the late 1980s and 1990s was influenced by scaled-back tax incentives for oil and gas under the TRA in 1986 and external market forces like low oil prices. The expensing of IDCs provision could result in a negative tax expenditure estimate, indicating an increase in federal revenues rather than a loss. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, energy tax expenditures decreased due to reduced incentives for oil and gas. The expensing of IDCs provision led to negative tax expenditure estimates, resulting in increased federal revenues. In the 1990s, energy tax expenditures grew due to the unconventional fuel production credit. Oil and gas provisions accounted for $0.4 billion in tax expenditures in 1990, increasing to $2.8 billion by 1999. The unconventional fuel production credit contributed to $1.3 billion in revenue losses by 1999. The unconventional fuel production tax credit was enacted to stimulate the production of synthetic fuels using domestic oil, gas, and coal deposits. Initially part of the WPT80, the credit saw low revenue losses in the early years. Producers of unconventional gases began claiming the credit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The credit was expanded and extended under OBRA in 1990 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Energy tax expenditures remained stable until significant changes emerged in 2005 with provisions enacted under EPACT05. The unconventional fuel production credit, enacted to stimulate synthetic fuel production, saw low revenue losses initially. However, after EPACT05 in 2005, revenue losses increased significantly. The credit, designed to promote coal substitution for oil, raised questions about its effectiveness. Private letter rulings from the IRS in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to more producers claiming the tax credit. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, producers increasingly claimed tax credits for synthetic fuels by demonstrating a \"substantial chemical change\" in coal-based synthetic fuel production. Some firms abused this credit by simply spraying coal with various substances. The Section 29 credit was eliminated from the Internal Revenue Code after evidence of abuse. Revenue losses from tax credits for renewable energy production also grew rapidly after 2005. The renewable energy production tax credit saw negligible revenue losses until 2005, but expanded in 2004 with the American Jobs Creation Act. By 2006, 23% of estimated energy tax expenditures were attributed to this credit. The introduction of Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits under ARRA significantly altered primary tax incentives for renewable energy, with $6.9 billion paid out in grants by March 31, 2011. The Section 1603 grants, introduced under ARRA, have paid out $6.9 billion as of March 31, 2011. These grants will not be available for projects starting construction after December 31, 2011. Residential and commercial energy efficiency tax incentives were reintroduced under EPACT05, with fluctuating support over time. In 2010, estimated revenue losses for residential energy tax provisions reached $1.9 billion, representing 22% of all energy tax expenditures. The recent increase in energy tax expenditures supporting residential energy efficiency can be attributed to the more generous tax credits under ARRA. Specifically, from 2009 to 2010, certain improvements were eligible for a 30% tax credit up to $1,500. However, the credit rate was reduced to 10% and capped at $500 in 2011. The most significant change in energy tax expenditures in the 2000s is the rise in revenue losses from tax credits for alcohol fuels and biodiesel, mainly due to \"black liquor.\" The term \"black liquor\" refers to a process where pulp mills use a mixture of fuel and a byproduct of the pulping process for energy. Prior to 2010, black liquor qualified for an income tax credit under the alternative fuel mixture tax credit. This credit was intended to incentivize companies producing liquid motor fuels from biomass. In 2009, $2.5 billion in tax credits were claimed, with the majority going to producers using black liquor. The alcohol fuel mixture credit expired at the end of 2009. The IRS ruled that black liquor qualifies for the cellulosic biofuel producer credit until 2012. However, the Reconciliation Act of 2010 modified the credit, making fuels with water, sediment, or ash content ineligible. This change reduced estimated tax expenditures by $23.6 billion. Figure 4 compares revenue losses from tax incentives for fossil fuels, renewables, and energy efficiency over time. In the late 1970s, revenue losses from energy tax expenditures favored fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal. Despite some increases in incentives for renewables and efficiency after ETA78 and WPT80, the losses remained small compared to fossil fuels. From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, energy tax provisions had low revenue losses, with renewables and efficiency making up a small portion. In the mid-2000s, revenue losses for renewables increased rapidly. In the mid-2000s, revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions for renewables increased rapidly. By 2006, revenue losses for renewables were estimated at $2.6 billion (in 2010 dollars), while revenue losses for fossil fuels incentives were estimated at $6.2 billion (in 2010 dollars). The majority of revenue losses for renewables were due to the renewable energy PTC. The increase in revenue losses in 2009 was due to \"black liquor\" under the alcohol fuel mixture tax credit. By 2010, the balance of energy tax expenditures had shifted towards renewables. In 2010, energy tax expenditures supporting renewables exceeded those supporting fossil fuels. 39% ($3.4 billion) supported renewables, while 28% ($8.7 billion) supported fossil fuels. Including excise tax credits for alcohol fuels, biodiesel, and Section 1603 grants, federal tax support for renewables increases. Energy tax policy trends over the last 30 years show reduced tax subsidies for oil and gas in the late 1980s. The revenue losses from energy tax provisions have increased to levels similar to those during the late 1970s energy crisis. Despite the goal of promoting renewables and efficiency, recent years have seen most revenue losses linked to credits for unconventional or alcohol fuels. The primary beneficiaries of these tax credits were not the intended recipients, leading to significant tax-related revenue losses. Excise tax credits, like the \"blenders credit\" for alcohol fuel mixtures, are not typically included in energy tax estimates. The biodiesel producer tax credit and Treasury grants for renewable energy are not included in conventional estimates of energy tax expenditures. Over the past 30 years, tax incentives for alcohol fuels have led to significant federal revenue losses, mainly through excise tax exemptions or credits. Tax incentives for alcohol fuel blends have led to federal revenue losses mainly through excise tax exemptions or credits. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 restructured the tax subsidies for alcohol fuels, replacing the blenders excise tax exemption with the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC), increasing the value of this tax provision for alcohol fuel blenders. The excise tax revenue losses increased due to the change from an excise tax exemption to an excise tax credit. In 2004, $1.45 billion in revenue was lost, which increased to $2.57 billion in 2006 and $5.68 billion by 2010. The VEETC is set to expire at the end of 2011. Additionally, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created an excise tax credit for biodiesel, resulting in $0.81 billion in revenue losses in 2009. Including excise tax exemptions for alcohol fuels and biodiesel increases revenue losses for renewables relative to fossil fuels and efficiency. Estimated revenue losses associated with tax provisions benefiting renewables exceed those for fossil fuels in 1988-1989 and 2008, with the most significant shift occurring in the mid-2000s. In 2010, $4.21 billion was awarded in grants under Section 1603 of ARRA to incentivize renewable energy development during the economic slowdown. Construction for projects to be eligible for the grant in lieu of tax credits had to begin before the end of 2011. Between 2010 and 2016, an estimated $18.95 billion will be spent on the Section 1603 Treasury grant program. Tax expenditures for renewables, including the Section 1603 grant program, are estimated at $13.78 billion in 2010, significantly higher than the $2.4 billion for fossil fuels. Energy tax policy aims to reduce oil import dependence and promote domestic energy sources while supporting environmental objectives. Energy tax policy aims to reduce oil import dependence and promote domestic energy sources while supporting environmental objectives. However, the effectiveness of energy tax provisions in achieving these goals has been inconsistent over the years. Despite low levels of tax subsidization in the late 1980s and 1990s, coupled with periods of low oil prices, there was little promotion of domestic energy resources. The level of tax subsidization in the mid-to-late 2000s was similar to early 1980s levels. Revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions were low during the late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s compared to total tax expenditures. Since 2005, revenue losses from the renewable energy production tax credit have been increasing, indicating growth in renewable energy production. By 2010, tax incentives for renewables surpassed those for fossil fuels. Despite increasing incentives for renewables, fossil fuels continue to be subsidized in practice. Tax subsidies for oil and gas have been reduced since the late 1970s, but fossil fuel subsidies persisted through 2007. Energy tax provisions have expanded since the 1970s, offering incentives for a wider range of energy activities. In 2007, energy tax expenditure revenue losses favored fossil fuels, with a significant portion attributed to coal-based synfuel producers. After the expiration of the unconventional fuel credit, energy tax policy shifted towards supporting renewables, particularly ethanol and black liquor. The tax provisions in the 2000s led to high revenue losses, particularly from claims related to \"black liquor,\" raising concerns about using the tax code for energy policy objectives. Designing tax policy consistent with economic goals could address these issues by focusing on taxing activities with negative externalities rather than subsidizing clean-energy alternatives. Taxing activities with negative externalities can enhance energy tax policy efficiency by reducing the activity level and considering internal and external costs. This approach avoids favoritism towards certain sectors through selective subsidies, which may lead to economic inefficiencies if financed by distortionary taxes like income taxes. Taxing energy-related activities with negative externalities can finance subsidies for clean-energy alternatives, creating incentives for increased investment in clean energy without distorting other markets. Limiting selective subsidies would prevent taxpayers from exploiting energy tax incentives. Clean-energy tax subsidies encourage innovative energy resources, but Congress faces challenges in drafting tax policy. Tax policy for clean energy faces challenges in balancing narrow definitions to avoid stifling innovation and broader incentives that may lead to tax loopholes. Data tables provide information on revenue losses associated with specific tax provisions, categorized by fossil fuels and renewables. Additional data is available upon request from the author. Tax provisions benefit fossil fuels, renewables, and efficiency. Fuels excise tax preferences include alcohol fuels, biodiesel, and renewable diesel. Cumulative revenue losses over time are associated with various energy tax preferences, including those for oil and gas, renewable energy, and excise tax credits for alcohol fuels. Oil and gas tax preferences historically included the percentage depletion allowance and expensing intangible drilling costs. Tax incentives for oil and gas, such as percentage depletion allowance and expensing intangible drilling costs, have been in place since before the 1980s. Additional tax preferences introduced in the 1980s and 1990s aimed to encourage domestic production by providing incentives for difficult-to-extract resources. Cumulative revenue losses from these provisions are detailed in tables through the year 2010. Since 1968, tax incentives for oil and gas, such as percentage depletion allowance and expensing intangible drilling costs, have resulted in an estimated $111 billion in federal revenue loss. The ability to expense IDCs has also led to an estimated $78 billion in revenue loss. Cumulative revenue losses for targeted tax incentives in the oil and gas sector from 1968 to 2010 total $193.4 billion. In contrast, tax incentives for renewable energy, such as the investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC), have also incurred significant costs, especially with the introduction of Section 1603 of ARRA allowing for one-time grants from the Treasury. Since the late 1970s, tax incentives for renewable energy have incurred an estimated cumulative cost of $24.6 billion. $5.3 billion is attributed to outlay payments under the Section 1603 grants program, while $12.2 billion is due to the renewable energy ITC and PTC. Estimated revenue losses from excise tax credits for alcohol fuels from 1980 to 2010 are also presented in Table B-6. In 2010, federal revenue losses increased due to the use of alcohol fuels, with the introduction of the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC) replacing the previous excise tax exemption for ethanol. This change resulted in $5.7 billion in lost excise tax receipts and an estimated $1.4 billion decrease in income tax receipts. Between 2005 and 2010, income tax offsets associated with the alcohol fuels excise tax credit totaled $5.7 billion. The alcohol fuels excise tax credit amounted to approximately $5.7 billion, resulting in total federal revenue losses of around $29.3 billion between 2005 and 2010. Excise tax preferences for alcohol fuels have led to revenue losses of $43.8 billion since their introduction. Including income tax offsets, total revenue losses related to excise tax preferences for alcohol fuels from 1980 to 2010 are estimated at $49.7 billion."
