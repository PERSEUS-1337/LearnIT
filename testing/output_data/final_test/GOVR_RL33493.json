    "content": "President Bush announced on June 18, 2008, his plan to open areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development, lifting the executive ban imposed in 1990. Congressional approval of the Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2009 omitted language that provided for the congressional OCS moratoria along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, allowing these areas to be made available for leasing. The OCS moratoria has been lifted for some areas, allowing for preleasing, leasing, and related activities for oil and gas development. However, the moratorium still remains in place for most of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico until 2022. Legislation has been introduced to permanently ban oil and gas leasing in the North Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic. The Administration is planning a new five-year leasing program to be implemented as early as 2010. The Obama Administration proposed a new five-year leasing program in 2009, ahead of schedule, to allow for earlier lease sales in newly opened OCS areas. The comment period was extended to assess energy development potential, including renewable energy. Some in Congress and environmental groups oppose opening offshore areas, arguing for increased production from existing leased areas onshore and offshore. The Obama Administration proposed a new five-year leasing program in 2009 for earlier lease sales in newly opened OCS areas. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to lift prohibitions on leasing and development of oil and gas in the OCS, including House-passed H.R. 6899. Other measures, like H.R. 6251, sought to increase rental fees on non-producing leases. The House defeated a bill (H.R. 6251) to increase rental fees on non-producing oil and gas leases. Oil and gas leasing has been restricted on most of the outer continental shelf since the 1980s, with leasing only allowed in the Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaska. Presidential directives have extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012. President George W. Bush lifted the executive branch moratoria on offshore drilling on July 14, 2008, allowing oil and gas leasing and development in previously restricted areas. The ban was not included in the FY2009 appropriation law, leading to its expiration. The debate over offshore drilling revolves around environmental risks, coastal tourism industries, and the nation's energy security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included a provision for the Department of the Interior to conduct an inventory of OCS oil and natural gas resources, sparking heated opposition. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized an OCS inventory report to Congress, which was completed in February 2006 without the funded 3-D seismic study. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 governs the leasing of OCS lands to protect the environment and generate revenues for the federal government. The leasing program involves a multistep process with environmental impact statements and public comment periods. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers the offshore leasing program for oil and natural gas. Alaska's lease sales were held in various regions, including the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. Two Alaskan lease sales from the previous program will be replaced by sales in the 2007-2012 program. Public hearings have been held for the proposed five-year leasing program. The Secretary of the Interior announced the Proposed Final Program for the 2007-2012 leasing program, including areas along the Atlantic coast, North Aleutian Basin, and central Gulf of Mexico. The new five-year leasing program began in July 2007 with nineteen lease sales scheduled. Seven lease sales have already taken place, with revenues from lease sale 224 to be shared. Lease sale 224 revenues will be shared with coastal states as required by GOMESA. Thirteen tracts bid on in lease sale 207 fall under the revenue sharing agreement. Lease sales are conducted through a competitive bidding process. Annual bonus revenues have ranged from $85 million to $1.4 billion in the past 13 years. Offshore bonus bids totaled $374 million in FY2007. In FY2007, offshore bonus bids totaled $374 million. Record-setting bonus bids of $3.7 billion were accepted at lease sale 206 in March 2008 due to high oil and gas prices in the Central Gulf of Mexico. Royalty rates of 12.5% to 18.75% are imposed on production value, with annual rents ranging from $5 to $11 per acre. Higher royalty rates are expected to continue for future lease sales. In March 2009, Central Gulf of Mexico leases started at $11 per acre for depths over 200 meters, with lease terms of 5-10 years. Bonding requirements range from $50,000 per lease to $3 million for an entire area. The Secretary of the Interior can adjust royalties to boost recovery. Federal offshore revenues were $18.0 billion in FY2008, with $8.3 billion from royalties and $9.5 billion from bonus bids. Oil and gas prices heavily influence revenue fluctuations. In FY2008, federal offshore revenues totaled $18.0 billion, with $8.3 billion from royalties and $9.5 billion from bonus bids. These revenues are split among various government accounts, including coastal states, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. States receive a share of OCS receipts closest to state offshore lands under revenue-sharing provisions. Selected Gulf States can receive 37.5% of revenue from specified federal oil and gas leases off their coasts. In the 110th and 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to open moratoria areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) with revenue sharing provisions for states. The Senate defeated an OCS revenue sharing amendment in the 111th Congress. States generally receive 50% of onshore public domain lease revenues, with Alaska receiving 90%. States with energy development off their shores seek a larger portion of federal revenues generated in those areas. Coastal areas affected by onshore and near-shore activities supporting offshore energy development seek more assistance. Louisiana faces significant wetland loss due to energy-related development. States with offshore oil and gas leases receive indirect revenue, unlike states with onshore federal leases. Proponents argue for fairer revenue sharing, while opponents raise budget concerns. The federal revenue sharing programs aim to mitigate environmental and economic impacts of OCS energy development and sustain nonrenewable energy sources. Two programs, the Coastal Energy Impact Program and the Section \"8(g)\" zone program, addressed coastal impacts. The Land and Water Conservation Fund also provided state funding from OCS revenues, but its distribution was not linked to OCS activities. The CEIP program, although not a true revenue-sharing program, did not base its funding levels on OCS activities. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a revenue-sharing program that disburses $250 million per year during FY2007-FY2010 to producing states and political subdivisions for coastal restoration, natural resource damage mitigation, conservation management plans, and infrastructure projects. Eligible oil- and gas-producing coastal states can submit plans for approval by the Secretary of the Interior. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) allocates funds to eligible oil- and gas-producing coastal states for coastal restoration, natural resource damage mitigation, conservation management plans, and infrastructure projects. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California, and Alaska are eligible states. Allocation amounts were announced for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, with Louisiana receiving the largest share. Offshore leasing moratoria were imposed due to concerns about environmental damage in sensitive areas. Offshore leasing moratoria were expanded to include various regions to prevent economic and environmental damage. Congress has supported annual moratoria on leasing and drilling in the OCS for the past two decades. The most recent law, Continuing Appropriation Act of 2009, omitted language that had kept the annual moratoria in place. President George H.W. Bush responded to pressure from states concerned about protecting sensitive areas. President Clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012, which was lifted by President George W. Bush in 2008. Congressional ban repeal is necessary for oil and gas leasing to occur. Attempts to lift the moratoria through appropriations have been made, with the FY2006 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act continuing the leasing moratoria in various areas. The moratorium on offshore leasing in various areas, including the eastern Gulf of Mexico, was extended through FY2007 and FY2008 by Congress. Amendments to lift the moratoria on offshore natural gas were defeated. Industry interest in opening the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area to oil and gas development is opposed by environmentalists. The North Aleutian Basin Planning Area in Bristol Bay is part of the MMS's leasing program. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 placed a ban on leasing and development in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico until 2022. Congress has banned additional drilling in certain areas, leading to companies seeking compensation for their leased tracts in California. California lease holdings are seeking compensation from the federal government for offshore leases granted between 17-33 years ago. The Clinton Administration extended the leases through suspensions to allow lease holders to prove oil reserves and comply with state coastal zone management plans. This action was taken to prevent objections from states that could halt development of the leases. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California struck down MMS suspensions on oil and gas leases, potentially allowing them to expire due to inconsistency with the state's coastal zone management plan. The Ninth Circuit panel upheld this decision, leading to a breach-of-contract lawsuit by oil companies seeking compensation. The U.S. District Court struck down MMS suspensions on oil and gas leases, leading to a breach-of-contract lawsuit by oil companies seeking compensation. The State Coastal Commission ruled against renewing lease suspensions, prompting additional studies under NEPA for the 36 leases under suspension. The U.S. Federal Court of Claims determined that the federal government breached its contract with lessees for 36 offshore California leases, ordering repayment of $1.1 billion. If a settlement is reached, the leases will be terminated, negating further action on consistency determinations by the Department of the Interior. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reached a final judgment awarding $1.1 billion to the lessees for breach of contract by the federal government. Royalty relief is granted to promote offshore oil and gas production under OCSLA, with categories like Deepwater and End-of-Life already in place before the DWRRA expanded the Secretary's authority. The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (DWRRA) allows the Secretary of the Interior to reduce royalties for leasing federal OCS Gulf of Mexico deepwater to incentivize production. Threshold price levels were set in 1995, with adjustments for inflation annually. Congressional debate continues over royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers. The MMS did not collect royalties on leases from 1998 and 1999 due to missing price thresholds in the agreements. The MMS omitted price thresholds from 576 offshore leases in 1998 and 1999, resulting in an estimated $10 billion in foregone royalties. The FY2009 Interior Appropriations bill includes a provision to deny new Gulf of Mexico leases to lessees without price thresholds. The House passed legislation (H.R. 6) to address relief issues for offshore leases without price thresholds. The bill would deny new Gulf of Mexico leases to lessees without price thresholds and repeal royalty relief provisions. H.R. 3221, a similar bill, was approved by the House on August 4, 2007. The House approved H.R. 3221 on August 4, 2007, by a vote of 241-170. The House later passed the Senate version of energy policy legislation (H.R. 6) on December 6, 2007, without royalty relief provisions. Kerr McGee Oil and Gas Corp. challenged MMS's authority in a lawsuit regarding price thresholds in DWRRA leases, with a recent court ruling against the Secretary of the Interior's authority in imposing price thresholds. The court ruled that the Interior Department cannot set price thresholds for oil and gas leases under the DWRRA. This could result in significant refunds to lessees and potential costs to the federal treasury. The ruling may not impact new fees or lease eligibility criteria. The MMS highlights the potential in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater regions due to the Royalty Relief Act of 1995. Since 1995, deepwater production of oil in the Gulf of Mexico has increased significantly, with major and independent oil and gas companies making investments. Deepwater natural gas production has also risen during the same period. The growth in deepwater production is expected to continue over the next 20 years, but there is a limited number of rigs available for drilling. Some deepwater regions leased since 1995 have seen little exploration and development, with a significant difference in development between shallow and deep regions. Since the 1990s, deepwater production in the Gulf of Mexico has increased significantly, with a large number of leases at different depths. About 40% of active leases have not been explored, with a small fraction in production. As lease terms approach expiration, MMS officials are allowing leases to expire and be relet. This may stimulate increased exploration and development in the coming years. The Department of the Interior conducted an inventory of OCS oil and gas resources, estimating significant reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. There are concerns about barriers hindering the full development of the region's potential, especially in deepwater leases. The high cost and limited availability of rigs in deepwater regions hinder exploration of more than 90% of deepwater leases. Financing oil exploration is complex, involving secondary markets and farming out development for funding. Natural gas-only leases are met with skepticism as most offshore fields likely contain both oil and gas. Industry may be reluctant to bid on such leases. H.R. 1696 (Pallone) Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-Drilling Act, also known as the COAST Anti-Drilling Act, proposes a permanent ban on oil and gas leasing in the MMS's North Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic Planning Areas of the OCS. H.R. 6899 (Rahall) Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act allows states to opt-in to oil and gas development 50-100 miles off their coasts with state legislative approval. Areas beyond 100 miles offshore would be open to oil and gas development. The Eastern Gulf of Mexico remains under moratoria until 2022. National marine sanctuaries, monuments, and Georges Bank are permanently withdrawn from oil and gas leasing. Annual lease sales are mandated in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Lessees in the Gulf of Mexico must meet price thresholds or pay conservation fees to be eligible for future leases. Conservation fees are set at $9.00 per barrel of oil and $1.25 per million Btu of natural gas. An annual fee of $3.75 per acre is established for nonproducing areas. The bill H.R. 6566 (Boehner) American Energy Act proposes amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including repealing GOMESA of 2006 and the funding prohibition on finalizing rules for commercial oil shale leasing on federal land. It also establishes rules for natural gas-only leases in the OCS and sets an annual fee of $3.75 per acre for nonproducing offshore leases. The Secretary of the Interior would determine diligent development criteria and provide resource estimates for oil and natural gas. Royalty payments may be taken in-kind, and measures would be implemented to ensure accurate and timely payments, including ethics training and a gift ban at the Minerals Management Service. The bill H.R. 6566 proposes amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including rules for natural gas-only leases in the OCS and an annual fee for nonproducing offshore leases. Royalty relief incentives are available for lessees who relinquish unproductive leases, and a revenue sharing plan is established for adjacent states. Areas within 50 miles of the state's coastline require a state request for leasing, and the Secretary of the Interior may accept or deny petitions for areas between 50-100 miles. The Secretary of the Interior may accept or deny a petition for oil and gas leasing in areas between 50-100 miles. States can petition to prohibit leasing in their area, with the option to extend the withdrawal for five-year periods. Leases in the Gulf of Mexico OCS east of the military mission line may be offered unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of Defense. Revenue sharing would allocate 62.5% to the National Guard of states within 1,000 miles of the lease. H.R. 6709 aims to lift congressional moratoria on the OCS and repeal the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, allowing leasing within 25 miles of the state's coastline. The proposal aims to prohibit leasing within 25 miles of a state's coastline but allow leasing beyond that distance. States can enact laws disapproving leasing between 25-50 miles off their coastline. The Secretary of the Interior must consult with the Secretary of Defense in areas east of the military mission line. A Renewable Energy Reserve Account would be established. H.R. 6529 would repeal moratoria on oil and gas leasing but continue to prohibit development within 25 miles of a state's coastline unless approved by the state. Revenue from leases beyond 25 miles would be split with 25% going to the general treasury and 75% to producing states. The New ERA Senate Draft Proposal of 2008 aims to establish a National Commission on Energy Independence to address technical and policy obstacles to achieving U.S. energy independence. It also includes provisions for domestic energy production in the Outer Continental Shelf, allowing states to opt-in for leasing programs beyond 50 miles off their coastline and receive 37.5% of the revenues. The New ERA Senate Draft Proposal of 2008 includes provisions for domestic energy production in the Outer Continental Shelf. States can opt-in for leasing programs beyond 50 miles off their coastline and receive a share of the revenues generated. The Eastern Gulf of Mexico would be open for leasing after consultation with the Secretary of Defense. The legislation also funds 3-D seismic testing, requires production to be consumed in the U.S., and establishes a National Commission on Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing. An Alternative Fuel Trust Fund would be created from specified OCS revenues. The Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008 and Energy Resource Development Act of 2008 aim to open new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing. States can petition to lease areas beyond 50 miles off their coast, with revenue sharing provisions allocating 50% to the General Treasury and 50% to the state. The Secretary of the Interior would notify the Governor of proposed lease sales, with the Governor having the option to accept, modify, or reject the proposal. If a counterproposal is presented, it can be accepted, modified, or denied after consultation with the Secretary of Defense. The Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008 and Energy Resource Development Act of 2008 aim to open new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing. States can petition to lease areas beyond 50 miles off their coast, with revenue sharing provisions allocating 50% to the General Treasury and 50% to the state. Upon approval of a proposed lease sale by the new producing state, the Secretary of the Interior shall conduct the lease sale. A revenue sharing provision would provide 50% of the \"qualified\" revenues to a newly established Energy Independence Trust Fund, and 50% in a special account for the state's share. Oil and gas leasing in the outer continental shelf (OCS) was a major energy issue in the 109th Congress. The bill, S. 3711, aims to open new areas in the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing, providing revenue sharing provisions for coastal states. The Senate approved the bill on August 1, 2006, but a conference agreement with a different OCS bill did not take place. The House leadership attached S. 3711 to a tax relief measure, H.R. 6111, which passed in December 2006. An amendment related to royalty relief for deepwater oil and gas lessees was defeated. S. 3711, known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, directs the Secretary of the Interior to offer lease sales within the 181 Area in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The original Lease Sale 181 in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) 1996-2001 5-Year Leasing Program was scaled back by the Secretary of the Interior. The bill covers the 181 Area, which is about 2.5 million acres, and directs the leasing of the 181 South Area, covering 5.8 million acres. These areas contain 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.26 billion barrels of oil. S. 3711 was passed by the Senate and attached to H.R. 6111, which became law. The bill excludes preleasing and leasing activity in certain areas until 2022, including areas east of the Military Mission Line, within 125 miles of Florida in the New Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, and within 100 miles of Florida in the New Central Gulf of Mexico Planning Area. Current lessees in these areas can exchange leases for bonus or royalty credits. Gulf producing states would receive 37.5% of revenues from leases in specified areas starting in FY2007. In FY2017 and beyond, Gulf producing states would receive 37.5% of revenues from leases in the 2002-2007 planning area, with distribution based on distance from coastlines. Minimum state share is 10%, with 20% going to coastal political subdivisions. Land and Water Conservation Fund gets 12.5% for state programs, and the Federal General Treasury receives 50%. Annual spending cap is $500 million on shared revenues. The bill includes a provision for Gulf producing states to receive 50% of revenues from leases, with a spending cap of $500 million. The MMS estimates the state's share to be $3.1 billion through 2022 and $59.6 billion through 2067. Sales in the eastern Gulf of Mexico have been controversial, with Lease Sale 181 sparking debate due to its proximity to environmentally sensitive areas and concerns about impacting tourism in Florida. Opponents of Lease Sale 181 argued that the potential for an oil spill could harm the state's beaches, tourism industry, and marine environment. The original 5.9 million-acre area was reduced to 1.47 million acres, offering 256 blocks with 1.25 tcf of natural gas and 185 million barrels of oil. Senator Pete Domenici introduced legislation to open offshore areas to address the \"natural gas crisis.\" Senator Pete Domenici introduced legislation (S. 2253) to lease a portion of Lease Sale Area 181, containing 6 tcf of natural gas and 930 million barrels of oil. An alternative bill (S. 2239/Martinez) proposed a smaller area of 740,000 acres. The Senate passed a bill (S. 3711) with 8.3 million acres and revenue sharing for Gulf states. The MMS's leasing program includes a 2 million acre Lease Sale 181 area with 3.4 tcf of natural gas. The MMS recommends a 2 million acre area in the eastern Gulf of Mexico with 3.4 tcf of natural gas and 530 mbo. Industry groups argue for more extensive sales due to vast resource potential, while environmental groups and some state officials raise concerns about risks to the environment and local economies."
