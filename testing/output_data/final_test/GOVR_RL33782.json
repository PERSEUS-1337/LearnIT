    "content": "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) established a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries under Part D in 2006. Medicare beneficiaries receive the benefit through private organizations that sponsor prescription drug plans. The law prohibits the Secretary of HHS from interfering with drug price negotiation and emphasizes competition among Medicare drug plans for price discounts. The Medicare drug plans compete for price discounts and aim to efficiently provide drug benefits to beneficiaries. The Democratic party's \"Six for '06\" initiative included negotiating prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The House passed H.R. 4 in 2007, requiring the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices. The Senate Finance Committee has not reported a similar bill. This report discusses federal government negotiation of drug prices, arguments for and against it, and implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries. The federal government could adopt various approaches to affect prescription drug prices and expenditures, including imposing statutory mandates, setting administered prices, soliciting competitive bids, and using a reference pricing approach. These methods are currently employed by federal government programs and other countries, and can involve setting reimbursement levels or prices for drugs. The government can influence drug prices by setting reimbursement levels or requiring discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This can be done through price ceilings, reference pricing systems, and statutory mandates like federal upper limits under Medicaid. Reference pricing ties reimbursement rates to another measure, such as average prices for a group of drugs or alternative treatments. Medicaid's federal upper limit prices and the federal supply schedule use reference pricing. The government can solicit bids through competitive acquisition programs, where pharmaceutical manufacturers submit confidential bids with prices for their products. Competitive bidding programs are used for calculating national average bid amounts for Part D and setting payment amounts for durable medical equipment under Medicare. Competitive bidding harnesses marketplace dynamics to create incentives for suppliers to provide quality items and services efficiently. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) included a provision for a competitive bidding demonstration for Medicare managed care starting in 2010. Bargaining and negotiation processes involve mutual discussions and arrangements, with outcomes depending on the relative strength of each party. Monopolists or monopsonists have more bargaining power. The Secretary is currently restricted from certain activities that could affect prescription drug prices due to the noninterference provision. The Secretary is currently restricted from certain activities that could affect prescription drug prices due to the noninterference provision. These activities include those falling under the scope of explicit and implicit authorities in the Medicare statute, which may face legal challenges for potentially interfering with negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies. The asymmetry in information between buyers and sellers could lead to market inefficiency, but the Secretary may provide more information through research on drug safety and effectiveness. Increased transparency in drug pricing negotiations could potentially lead to collusion among negotiators if too much information is revealed. Without the noninterference clause, the Secretary may influence drug price negotiations through various means, such as mass communications or targeted persuasion. The effectiveness of these efforts would depend on the persuasive power of the Secretary and public pressure, as well as the willingness of organizations to resist or accede to such influence. The federal government actively determines drug prices through programs like the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicaid, obtaining discounts and rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The VA uses negotiated contracts and statutory discounts to obtain prescription drugs at a discount, with the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requiring manufacturers to offer drugs at federal ceiling prices. The VA obtains prescription drugs at discounted prices through various methods, including federal ceiling prices, federal supply schedules, and national standardization contracts. Pharmaceutical manufacturers offer their FDA approved drugs at a minimum 24% discount for federal purchasers. The Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) offers discounted prices on prescription drugs for federal purchasers, including the Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard. Manufacturers provide their products at the lowest prices to be included on the FSS, which is maintained by the VA's National Acquisition Center. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must sign agreements with the VA to participate in Medicaid reimbursement. The Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) requires manufacturers to offer all covered drugs at prices no higher than Federal Ceiling Prices (FCPs). FSS contracts allow the VA to negotiate additional discounts, typically ranging from 5 to 15% off FSS prices. These contracts, initiated by either the VA or manufacturers, can result in discounts of 10 to 60% off FSS for individual drugs on the VA national formulary, especially for generic drugs. The VA successfully negotiates contracts for non-generic drugs using clinical evidence and obtains additional discounts through contracts with drug distributors. As of June 2004, the VA contract with the prime vendor provides for an additional 5% discount. Federal drug price negotiation for Medicare beneficiaries requires practical and legislative steps. Negotiation for Medicare beneficiaries may require repealing the noninterference clause and including a mandate for the Secretary to actively negotiate drug prices. Some suggest that legislative proposals could omit specifics and trust experts to find the best way to negotiate better prices with drug companies. The authority for the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices is uncertain if it will replicate the VA's activities due to differences between Medicare and VA. VA is a direct provider of care with its own facilities and national formulary, while Medicare is an insurer that pays for care at various sites. Medicare and VA have different approaches to providing drug benefits. VA charges veterans a flat copay for medication without annual deductibles, while Medicare Part D plans have multiple tiers and incentives that may influence beneficiary behavior. The Institute of Medicine found no negative health effects from VA's formulary approach, in contrast to Medicare's more complex offerings. The VA has different drug benefit tiers for Medicare beneficiaries, with incentives like step therapy and quantity limits to influence drug choice and control costs. The VA's formulary development includes closed and preferred drug classes, with providers required to prescribe selected drugs in closed classes. Medicare's implications for adopting a similar approach are uncertain. The VA relies heavily on mail-order prescription drug dispensing, with three-quarters of prescriptions processed through seven CMOPs. Medicare may not achieve the same level of consolidation. States have flexibility in setting payment rates for Medicaid-covered drugs. Medicaid prescription drug prices are determined based on the lower of the estimated acquisition cost plus a dispensing fee or the provider's usual charge. Federal reimbursements for multiple-source drugs are subject to a federal upper reimbursement limit (FUL). The methodology for reimbursements changed in 2007, but the concept remains the same. Beginning January 1, 2007, federal reimbursements for multiple-source drugs no longer use the average wholesale price (AWP) for calculating the federal upper reimbursement limit (FUL). The FUL is now based on the estimated acquisition cost (EAC) for most drugs, except for single-source drugs and those with fewer than three generic equivalents. Beginning January 1, 2007, federal reimbursements for multiple-source drugs no longer use the average wholesale price (AWP) for calculating the federal upper reimbursement limit (FUL). The FUL is now based on the average manufacturer price (AMP), which is reported to CMS by manufacturers. This change aims to ensure that Medicaid obtains prescription drugs at the best price available from manufacturers, as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. State Medicaid programs enter agreements with the Secretary of HHS to provide rebates based on the lowest drug prices offered by manufacturers to other purchasers. Rebates are calculated to ensure Medicaid pays the lowest price, and in return, Medicaid must cover drugs from participating manufacturers. Over 550 manufacturers were part of the Medicaid drug rebate program in 2003. In 2004, federal rebates in the Medicaid drug rebate program amounted to 22% of total Medicaid spending on prescription drugs before rebates. The Medicaid program obtains significant discounts through mandatory FUL and rebate programs, with cost savings achieved through statutory authority. The Medicare Part D program does not currently have similar discount structures or price negotiation mechanisms in place. States have the authority to establish \"open\" formularies for Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans. All drugs covered by manufacturers with a rebate agreement must be included, with the option for states to require prior authorization for certain drugs. Some states have implemented prior authorization programs using preferred drug lists. Litigation has arisen over states' use of preferred drug lists, but courts have rejected arguments against them. In upholding the use of preferred drug lists for prior authorization programs, courts have noted that such lists do not place any drugs in a non-covered category, the essence of a \"formulary.\" The Medicaid statute specifically provides that a prior authorization program is not a formulary. If the formulary prohibition is not repealed, the bargaining power of the Secretary would reflect the leverage available. The Secretary's bargaining power is influenced by various factors, including the ability to conduct research on drug prices, review plan bids, and influence drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. Advocates argue that granting the government power to negotiate could lead to lower prices. The potential implications on beneficiaries, drug companies, and the industry as a whole are significant and should be considered. Advocates propose granting the federal government the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries by leveraging the market power of 43.7 million beneficiaries. A Government Accountability Office study found that VA-negotiated prices were significantly lower than non-federal prices. The federal government aims to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, leveraging the market power of 43.7 million beneficiaries. There is uncertainty about the government's effectiveness in obtaining greater discounts than private Medicare Part D plans. The first year of the Medicare prescription drug benefit saw lower program expenditures due to lower drug prices negotiated by drug plans in response to competition. Critics argue that lower expenditures are due to lower enrollment and beneficiary preference for plans with lower premiums and less generous drug coverage. The advantage of federal negotiators over private plans in obtaining discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers is questioned. Large PBMs like Advance PCS, Medco Health Solutions, and Express Scripts have significant market power in negotiating prescription drug discounts for large populations. Critics argue that PBMs with many Medicare Part D enrollees could negotiate discounts and savings comparable to the federal government. Their ability to influence drug consumption behavior and move market share through financial incentives is key to achieving price concessions from manufacturers. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Chief Actuary at CMS examined the impact of removing the \"noninterference\" provision on federal spending. They concluded that allowing the Secretary to negotiate drug prices may not result in additional savings compared to private plans. The discounts obtained by the federal government would depend on various factors and may not surpass those negotiated by private plans. The VA's experience shows that larger discounts are more likely to be achieved. The VA's experience shows that larger discounts are more likely to be achieved for drugs with many alternatives. Single-source drugs may still obtain substantial discounts depending on bargaining power. Market-based proponents believe multiple organizations negotiating prices will offer more choices for Medicare beneficiaries. The VA's formulary may not be more restrictive than private insurers, and older drugs on the formulary do not necessarily indicate lower-quality care for beneficiaries. There is a significant difference in the number of drugs available on private plans' formularies compared to the VA's. The VA's formulary includes 1,294 drug entries on the national formulary, while private plans range from 626 to 2,773 drugs. Older, less expensive drugs can be as effective and safe as newer, more expensive ones. The VA's formulary decisions are based on scientific evidence, not just price. The VA's formulary decisions are based on scientific evidence, not just price. Pharmaceutical manufacturers argue that reduced retail prices could lead to decreased investment in research and development, impacting innovation and the introduction of new drugs. Reduced investment in research and development could lead to declining innovation and fewer new drugs brought to market. Studies show a weak relationship between research and development funds in the pharmaceutical industry and the introduction of new drugs. Government-mandated negotiations may reduce the development of life-saving drugs, resulting in a loss of 5 million life-years annually valued at about $500 billion per year. The relationship between research and development costs and new drugs is not highly sensitive according to some research. The pharmaceutical industry's increased spending on research and development has not led to a corresponding increase in new drug applications. Despite rising expenditures, the development of new molecular entities (NMEs) has stagnated. Government negotiations on drug prices could lead to more consistent pricing for Medicare Part D beneficiaries across different plans. The multitude of Medicare drug plan options has led to calls for simplification by patient advocacy groups. Some suggest that having numerous choices in Medicare Part D plans may not always be beneficial, as research shows that too many options can lead to lower participation rates and decreased satisfaction. Legislators are considering limits on the number of plan choices available. Some legislators propose limiting the number of Medicare Part D plans to help beneficiaries choose from a broad set of plans. Lower drug prices can impact overall healthcare costs and population health, leading to increased prescription drug use and potentially improved outcomes. However, higher out-of-pocket prices for prescription drugs may reduce drug utilization by patients. One study found that higher out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs lead to reduced drug utilization over time, resulting in higher overall healthcare costs. Federal negotiations on drug prices have had noticeable effects on the industry, with potential for even more dramatic effects in the Medicare program. Wholesalers play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the experience of the VA. The VA contract, valued at $3 billion a year, has significant impact on drug distributors. Losing the contract led to a decrease in AmerisourceBergen Corporation's share values. Federal contracts with Medicare could have similar industry impacts due to interconnected drug prices. The potential impact of a discount for Medicare beneficiaries on drug prices may lead to an increase in overall drug prices for other consumers in the long run. Pharmaceutical companies might raise prices for other buyers in response to lower prices negotiated by the federal government for Medicare beneficiaries, affecting prices for the under-65 population, VA, and Medicaid. Critics argue that government involvement in price negotiations could result in the government setting prices rather than negotiating. The House passed H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, which would require the Secretary of HHS to negotiate prescription drug prices. This bill aims to change the current noninterference policy and allow prescription drug plans to obtain discounts below those negotiated by the Secretary. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 would require the Secretary of HHS to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. The bill mandates reporting on negotiations and price discounts achieved, with a negligible effect on federal spending. It would take effect on the date of enactment and apply to plan years starting on January 1, 2008. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 aims to allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. However, the bill lacks the authority to establish a formulary, limiting the Secretary's bargaining leverage. CMS actuaries have determined that the bill would not result in lower drug prices or savings. The Senate Finance Committee passed an amended version of the bill that repeals the noninterference provision but does not mandate price negotiations. Additional provisions include increasing transparency in the Part D program and prioritizing comparative effectiveness research on drugs. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007 allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Congressional support agencies can access aggregate data on negotiated prices, drug claims, reinsurance payments, and payment adjustments. CBO can obtain non-aggregated information on rebates and discounts. Disclosure of trade secrets is prohibited. S. 3 would require the CBO to study the effect of market competition on drug prices under Part D, examining discounts, price concessions, and their impact on drug utilization. The study would compare Medicare Part D discounts with those under Medicaid and assess the Secretary of HHS's efforts on non-Medicare payers. A report on the study would be due a year after enactment. The bill, S. 3, requires the Secretary to make public data on drug prices for Part D and MA-PD plans. It also mandates the development of a prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies on covered drugs and establishes an advisory committee for setting priorities in this area. The bill, S. 3, mandates the development of a prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies on covered drugs and establishes an advisory committee for setting priorities in this area. The committee would include a diverse range of public and private experts, stakeholders, and interests from industry, patients, researchers, and government. Within one year, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress with the prioritized list of studies, plans for their conduct, and factors considered in constructing the list. Pharmacy and therapeutic committees are also instructed to consider these studies. The bill mandates the development of a prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies on covered drugs and establishes an advisory committee for setting priorities. Pharmacy and therapeutic committees are instructed to consider these studies in developing and reviewing formularies for Medicare prescription drug plans. Plans cannot change formularies without CMS approval or drop coverage for current users of a drug, except at the beginning of the calendar year. CBO's evaluation of the bill is similar to its assessment of another bill. The bill aims to establish a prioritized list of comparative clinical effectiveness studies on covered drugs and create an advisory committee for setting priorities. It also requires pharmacy and therapeutic committees to consider these studies when developing formularies for Medicare prescription drug plans. The Secretary may not obtain significant discounts from drug manufacturers without the authority to establish a formulary or other tools to reduce drug prices. The Senate did not invoke cloture on S. 3 on April 18, 2007."
