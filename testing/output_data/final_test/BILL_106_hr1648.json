    "content": "The Act titled \"State Infrastructure Banks for Schools Act of 1999\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings in Section 2. The Congress finds that significant funding is needed for school infrastructure, with $112 billion required for repairs and construction. Approximately 14 million students attend schools in need of extensive building repairs. Research shows a link between school facility conditions and student achievement. Students in poor school conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20% increase in test scores. 52% of schools lack technology elements, affecting 21.3 million students. Local educational agencies struggle to finance school improvements. Collaboration is needed to address challenges in public schools and libraries. The deplorable state of collections in America's public school libraries has increased demands on public libraries, with public libraries often substituting for school libraries. Research shows that 50 percent of a child's intellectual development occurs before age 4, highlighting the critical role of public and school libraries in early childhood development by providing books and educational resources. Public and school libraries play a crucial role in early childhood development by offering a variety of books and resources to give every child a head start in life and learning. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, may establish State infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks to provide loans for building or repairing schools and libraries. Congress grants consent for interstate compacts between States for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish multistate infrastructure banks with grants for loans to local educational agencies and public libraries. Each bank must use loan repayments to fund additional loans, and grant applications must be processed within 90 days. States must meet requirements to establish an infrastructure bank under this section. Each State establishing an infrastructure bank under this section must contribute a minimum of 25 percent of the capitalization grant from non-Federal sources, identify an operating entity to manage loan funds, allow funds to be used as reserves for debt issued by the State, and ensure that investment income generated by the funds will be credited to the account and available for providing loans. The infrastructure bank must ensure that funds are available for loans to eligible projects, invested in approved instruments to earn interest, and that loans bear interest rates at or below the lowest offered for tax-exempt bonds. Repayment of loans must start within a year of project completion, and loan terms should be reasonable. An infrastructure bank established under this section may make loans to local educational agencies or public libraries for eligible projects, with loan repayment terms not exceeding 30 years. The bank must provide annual reports to the Secretary and comply with guidelines. The infrastructure bank requires detailed information for renovation projects, including descriptions of deficiencies, corrective actions, improvements, cost estimates, energy conservation promotion, and any other necessary information. Final action on completed applications must be taken within 90 days. The infrastructure bank considers applications for loans based on the fiscal capacity of the local educational agency or public library, the safety concerns for students, and the demonstrated need for construction, reconstruction, or renovation projects. Final action on completed applications must be taken within 90 days. Qualifying projects for loans from an infrastructure bank include construction of new schools, repair or upgrading of classrooms, activities to increase safety, and enhancements to educational facilities based on age and condition. Activities to enhance educational facilities include providing access for individuals with disabilities, addressing environmental hazards like poor ventilation, and ensuring basic infrastructure for educational technology. Additionally, work may be done to bring facilities into compliance with environmental and safety regulations. The curr_chunk discusses various types of work that may be eligible for funding, including compliance with environmental and safety regulations, efficient use of energy resources, asbestos hazard detection and removal in educational facilities, and construction or repair of public library facilities. The Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements apply to individuals employed on infrastructure projects funded by an infrastructure bank. Loans from the bank must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds. Repayment of loans cannot count towards the non-federal share of project costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish procedures for the bank's operation. Federal funds do not create an obligation for the United States. The infrastructure bank established under this section does not create an obligation for the United States. Federal funds contributed to the bank are not a commitment or guarantee by the United States. Management of these funds is exempt from certain sections of the United States Code. States can use a small percentage of federal funds for administration of their infrastructure bank. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and the next 4 years for grants to States for infrastructure bank capitalization. Secretary of the Treasury to review bank financial condition and report to Congress within 90 days."
