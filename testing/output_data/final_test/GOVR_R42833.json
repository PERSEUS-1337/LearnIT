    "content": "Recent advancements in natural gas production, such as hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, have significantly increased the United States' supply of natural gas. This has made the U.S. the largest producer of natural gas in the world, with projections showing continued growth in unconventional gas activity through 2040. The U.S. projects a significant increase in unconventional gas activity by 2040, making up 80% of total natural gas production. Exploiting new resources could reshape energy policy, alter geopolitics, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas is seen as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil, making it a potential \"bridge\" fuel to a more sustainable economy. Natural gas emits less carbon dioxide, mercury, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides compared to coal and oil when used in electric utility plants. Pollution control measures for natural gas have historically received less attention, but concerns have arisen due to increased production from unconventional resources. Issues include water quality, land use changes, and environmental impacts from hydraulic fracturing. The development of natural gas in the United States is regulated under local, state, and federal laws addressing various aspects of exploration, production, and distribution. State and local authorities oversee regulation of natural gas systems, with each state having regulatory agencies permitting wells and their operations. State and federal laws regulate natural gas development, including pollution controls for water management, air emissions, and worker safety. Federal statutes like the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act address surface water discharges and underground injection of wastewater. The Clean Air Act limits air emissions from natural gas systems. The Clean Air Act regulates emissions from engines and gas processing equipment used in hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuel. Natural gas, a nonrenewable fossil fuel, is utilized for energy and chemical purposes. The oil and gas industry conducts drilling and extraction activities to recover raw natural gas from geologic formations. The industry encompasses crude oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and distribution. The report focuses on the crude oil and natural gas industry, tracking activities in natural gas systems including production, emissions, and regulations. Production operations involve extraction, recovery, and treatment of oil and/or natural gas. The industry encompasses production, processing, transmission, and distribution. Production operations in the crude oil and natural gas industry involve drilling, hydraulic fracturing, completion, and workover activities. This includes portable apparatus for well operations, production sites for separating and storing oil, gas, and water, as well as gathering pipelines. Natural gas, primarily methane, also contains natural gas liquids (NGL) that need to be removed before distribution. Natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from raw natural gas through processing operations to produce \"dry\" natural gas for consumption. Dry natural gas then enters the transmission segment through pipelines, which can be interstate or intrastate. Compressor stations are used to maintain pressure in the pipelines. The distribution segment is the final step in delivering natural gas to customers, with thousands of miles of pipes, compressor and metering stations, and delivery points from transmission pipelines. The citygate is where natural gas transitions from transmission to distribution, marking the transfer of ownership. Raw natural gas, primarily methane, undergoes purification before distribution. Emissions in the natural gas industry come from various activities like construction, drilling, and gas processing. The natural gas industry emits pollutants like methane, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and hazardous air toxics. Emissions are categorized as fugitive (intentional or unintentional release of gas vapors), combusted, and associated. Fugitive natural gas emissions can be intentional (vented) or unintentional (leaked), with intentional releases designed into the system for safety. Unintentional emissions result from uncontrolled leaks due to wear, tear, or improper maintenance. Natural gas is mainly methane but can also contain other hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, and butane. The chemical composition of raw natural gas varies greatly across resource reservoirs, with nonmethane hydrocarbons, nonhydrocarbon gases, and water vapor present in varying proportions. Natural gas can be \"dry\" or \"wet\" depending on the presence of heavier hydrocarbons, nonhydrocarbon gases, and water vapor. Quantities of VOCs, HAPs, and H2S can vary significantly depending on the resource reservoir. The composition of natural gas can vary depending on the resource reservoir, with VOCs, HAPs, and H2S present in different proportions. Higher H2S content in natural gas makes it \"sour\" or \"acid\" gas. Combusted emissions from burning natural gas release pollutants like CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, and PM through flaring or combustion for industrial operations. Flaring is a method used to eliminate natural gas that is impractical to use, capture, or transport. It serves as a safety device to minimize explosive conditions, especially during drilling and well completion phases. Flaring helps incinerate VOCs and HAPs, making natural gas combustion a cleaner pollution control mechanism compared to venting. Associated emissions are secondary sources of emissions from natural gas operations. The report focuses on fugitive and combusted natural gas emissions, which can contribute significantly to air pollution. It emphasizes the release of natural gas and pollutants during operations, rather than emissions from combustion of other fossil fuels for process heat and transportation. Air quality considerations in the crude oil and natural gas sector are unique due to the release of natural gas and pollutants during operations. Various activities and equipment in natural gas systems have the potential to emit air pollutants, common in both conventional and unconventional development. Emissions occur during drilling, with fugitive natural gas and pollutants escaping during initial drilling operations. Combusted natural gas releases CO2, NOx, and potentially SO2 at the well site through engine combustion and flaring activities. Well test flaring and solution gas flaring are common during drilling and testing of oil and gas wells. The drilling and testing of oil and gas wells, along with \"solution gas flaring,\" release air pollutants. Well completions involve processes like hydraulic fracturing, which emits methane and VOCs during flowback. Flaring flowback gas can release nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide. EPA estimates the emissions from these activities. EPA estimates that hydraulic fracturing well completions can release significantly more natural gas and emissions compared to non-fracturing completions. Compression machinery in the natural gas sector, such as turbines and internal combustion engines, may also contribute to VOCs and methane emissions. Compression machinery in the natural gas sector, such as centrifugal and reciprocating compressors, are significant sources of fugitive VOCs and methane emissions. Centrifugal compressors with wet seals vent absorbed gas to the atmosphere when purged, while reciprocating compressors leak natural gas due to worn piston rod packing systems. Using dry-seal centrifugal systems or replacing worn rod packing systems can help control emissions. Alternatively, electric motors can be used to operate compressors without using natural gas, but they require electricity. Pneumatic controllers in the natural gas sector regulate pressure, temperature, and flow using high-pressure natural gas. Gas-driven controllers release gas intermittently or continuously, categorized as high-bleed or low-bleed. Non-gas driven controllers use alternative power sources like solar or electric to reduce emissions. Storage vessels separate gas from the stream. After natural gas is separated from the stream, crude oil, condensate, and produced water are stored in fixed-roof storage vessels at atmospheric pressure. Emissions from these vessels include working, breathing, and flash losses. Working losses occur during tank filling and emptying, breathing losses result from temperature fluctuations, and flash losses happen when liquids are transferred between vessels with different pressures. To control emissions, vapor recovery units (VRU) can be installed or emissions can be routed from the tanks. Dehydrators like glycol dehydration are used to remove residual water from natural gas. Fugitive emissions can come from valves, pump seals, and other equipment in the gas processing system. Equipment leaks in natural gas facilities can result from valves, pump seals, flanges, compressor seals, and other components. These leaks can be caused by wear, tear, corrosion, improper installation, or overpressure. With over 300,000 miles of transmission pipelines in the US, equipment leaks are a significant source of emissions. Workovers and maintenance activities can also release fugitives into the atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies air pollutants under different categories: Criteria Pollutants, Hazardous Air Pollutants, and Greenhouse Gas Pollutants. Criteria pollutants harm human health and the environment, while hazardous air pollutants are toxic chemicals known to cause serious health effects. Greenhouse gas pollutants contribute to climate change. These categories are regulated under the Clean Air Act. The natural gas industry produces emissions that fall under different categories regulated by the Clean Air Act. Methane, a key component of natural gas, is a precursor to ground-level ozone formation and a potent greenhouse gas. Emissions from natural gas systems have the potential to emit methane, contributing to air pollution and climate change. The EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions estimates that in 2011, methane emissions from natural gas systems accounted for 1.5% of the industry's production and 25% of total methane emissions in the U.S. Natural gas systems have been the largest contributor to U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions since 1990, posing a threat to public health and welfare under the Clean Air Act. Additionally, the crude oil and natural gas sector is a significant source of VOC emissions, contributing to ground-level ozone formation. The crude oil and natural gas sector is a major source of VOC emissions in the United States, accounting for 12% of nationwide emissions. VOCs interact with NOx to form ozone, leading to health issues like premature death, heart failure, and respiratory damage. NOx is emitted at natural gas sites through combustion. NO x emissions occur at natural gas sites from combustion processes, including flaring, driving compressors, and operating equipment. Short-term exposure to NO x can lead to respiratory issues. CO and SO are also emitted from combustion and can have harmful health effects. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) emissions from crude oil and natural gas operations can cause respiratory effects like bronchoconstriction and increased asthma symptoms. Particulate Matter (PM) from construction, traffic, and diesel exhaust is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) are known to cause serious health effects, including cancer and reproductive diseases. Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) emitted from natural gas systems, such as VOCs, n-hexane, BTEX compounds, and hydrogen sulfide, can cause cancer, reproductive diseases, and birth defects. These pollutants are primarily found in natural gas and are released from equipment leaks and various operations. The Clean Air Act aims to establish national standards to protect human health and the environment from air pollution. The Clean Air Act delegates responsibility for compliance with air quality standards to states, which often further delegate to local governments. Relevant sections of the Act pertaining to air quality in the natural gas industry are discussed, with some regulations revised by EPA in 2012. The Clean Air Act delegates responsibility for compliance with air quality standards to states, which often further delegate to local governments. EPA established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. States must monitor these pollutants to ensure they meet the standards, with additional measures required in nonattainment areas. Nonattainment findings in areas with crude oil and natural gas production may result in stricter regulations. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments introduced Title V permits for major sources of air pollution, requiring them to obtain operating permits. Responsibility for permitting has been delegated to state and local authorities. Sources subject to the permit requirements include new or modified sources emitting 100 tons per year of regulated pollutants, as well as existing sources emitting specified amounts of hazardous air pollutants. In nonattainment areas, permit requirements may apply to sources emitting as little as 50, 25, or 10 tons per year of VOCs, depending on the severity of the region's nonattainment status. Title V permits are required for major sources of air pollution, with regulations for emissions limitations, monitoring, recordkeeping, and fee payment. Most crude oil and natural gas production activities are not classified as \"major sources\" under EPA Title V permits. The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (MRR) was established in 2009, applying to facilities and suppliers in 32 source categories. The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule (MRR) applies to facilities in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring reporting of annual fugitive emissions of methane and CO2 from equipment leaks and venting, and combusted emissions from gas flaring. Facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year must comply. The EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule covers emissions from upstream oil and gas activities, requiring reporting of methane emissions from various equipment. This rule applies to 85% of GHG emissions from the U.S. petroleum and natural gas industry, with around 2,800 facilities reporting. Additionally, states have their own GHG reporting requirements, and the EPA also enforces New Source Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. The EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to establish emissions standards for new, modified, and reconstructed sources that contribute significantly to air pollution. These standards are based on the best system of emission reduction (BSER) and must be updated as new technology advances. One applicable federal standard is 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart JJJJ for Stationary Spark Ignition Internal Combustion Engines. Subpart JJJJ applies to manufacturers, owners, and operators of Stationary Spark Ignition Internal Combustion Engines (SI ICE) for new, modified, and reconstructed engines using various fuels. Emissions standards are based on engine and fuel type, with regulations for NOx, CO, VOCs, and sulfur limits on gasoline. Subpart IIII applies to Compression Ignition Internal Combustion Engines (CI ICE) for diesel engines, also covering new, modified, and reconstructed engines. Subpart IIII regulates emissions from Compression Ignition Internal Combustion Engines (CI ICE) such as generators, pumps, and compressors, with standards for NOx, PM, CO, and NMHC. Sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions are reduced through low sulfur fuel use, and particulate emissions are also controlled. Additionally, Subpart KKK addresses VOC leak detection and repair at gas processing plants extracting natural gas liquids. Subpart LLL of 40 C.F.R. Part 60 regulates SO2 emissions from gas processing plants, including gas sweetening units and sulfur recovery units. It was revised in 2012. Subpart Kb of the same regulation addresses standards for volatile organic liquid storage vessels. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) are established under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from both new and existing sources. The aim is to develop technology-based standards for both major and area sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) in the oil and gas sector. Key pollutants of concern include BTEX compounds, formaldehyde, and n-hexane. Federal NESHAPs that may apply to crude oil and natural gas systems include 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subpart ZZZZ for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICE) and 40 C.F.R. Part 63, Subpart H. Subpart H, HH, and HHH of 40 C.F.R. Part 63 regulate air toxics from oil and gas production, transmission, and storage operations. They control emissions from equipment leaks, tanks with flash emissions, and glycol dehydrators at major and area sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs). The 2012 air standards revised regulations for glycol dehydrators at major sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) and equipment leaks in the oil and gas industry. Non-governmental organizations filed a complaint under the Clean Air Act, leading to a consent decree requiring the EPA to take action on proposed standards by specific deadlines. The EPA revised air standards for the oil and gas industry in 2012, with new regulations for glycol dehydrators and equipment leaks. The new standards were finalized on April 17, 2012, published on August 16, 2012, and became effective on October 15, 2012. The regulations targeted volatile organic compounds emissions from various sources in the industry. The 2012 EPA standards regulate VOCs emissions from gas wells, compressors, controllers, storage vessels, and leaking components at onshore natural gas processing plants, as well as SO2 emissions. Gas wells drilled for natural gas production and hydraulically fractured are covered, requiring the use of reduced emissions completions to reduce VOCs emissions. Oil wells and conventional gas wells are not subject to the rule. The EPA standards require the use of reduced emissions completions (REC) to reduce VOCs emissions during well completions. Owners and operators have two compliance phases, allowing the use of REC or completion combustion devices until January 1, 2015. After this date, REC will be mandatory, with exemptions for certain types of gas wells. The EPA rule mandates a 95% reduction of uncontrolled VOCs emissions from individual storage vessels and sets limits on natural gas bleed rates for pneumatic controllers and compressors in the oil and gas industry. The EPA rule requires a 95% reduction of VOCs emissions from wet seal centrifugal compressors and reciprocating compressors in the oil and gas industry. Owners/operators must replace rod packing systems based on usage or time. The rule also revises NSPS requirements for leak detection and repair at onshore natural gas processing plants. The 2012 EPA rules revise NESHAPs for glycol dehydration units and leak detection and repair requirements. It establishes MACT standards for \"small\" glycol dehydration units and lowers the leak definition for valves at natural gas processing plants. The EPA set a limit of 500 ppm for emissions at crude oil and natural gas facilities, requiring LDAR procedures. States can implement their own programs as long as they meet federal standards. EPA designated areas as attainment or nonattainment for ozone NAAQS, with nonattainment areas needing to submit modified SIPs by 2015 and meet standards by 2015 and 2018. States are allowed to include the federal NSPS as a strategy in their nonattainment SIP to help meet ozone NAAQS standards. The 2012 air standards are expected to control VOC emissions from new gas wells, making it easier for states to reduce emissions and show progress towards meeting the ozone NAAQS. The 2012 NSPS regulates new and modified gas wells to control VOC emissions, aiding states in meeting ozone NAAQS standards. It allows emissions reductions to be credited towards progress requirements, especially in areas with future drilling activity. The 2012 NSPS regulates new and modified gas wells to control VOC emissions, aiding states in meeting ozone NAAQS standards. Compliance with the NSPS may prevent the need for major or minor source permits, providing a pathway for existing wells to avoid falling under its scope. Natural gas is a significant revenue source for the industry but also a main source of pollution. Pollution abatement can lead to economic benefits by offsetting compliance costs with the value of the gas. The 2012 air standards aim to reduce VOCs, air toxics, and methane emissions from gas wells, providing environmental and economic benefits for the industry. EPA reports reductions in VOCs, air toxics, and methane emissions, helping to reduce ground-level ozone and cancer risks. Industry costs for complying with the 2012 air standards are estimated at $170 million annually, with potential savings of $11 million to $19 million. The rule aims to reduce VOCs, air toxics, and methane emissions from gas wells, providing environmental co-benefits. EPA's cost-benefit analysis has been critiqued by industry and environmental stakeholders. Industry and environmental stakeholders have conflicting views on the economic analyses and costs of compliance with proposed rules for reducing VOCs, air toxics, and methane emissions from gas wells. Industry argues that the analyses must consider a full range of conditions and operational standards, while environmental stakeholders believe the costs of control are conservative estimates and do not fully account for social and environmental benefits. EPA's proposed rule announcement on April 12, 2013, has sparked debate between the two groups. The EPA announced proposed amendments to federal air standards for the oil and gas sector on April 12, 2013. The proposed rule grants reconsideration of implementation dates and definitions related to storage vessel provisions. The EPA proposed amendments to federal air standards for the oil and gas sector on April 12, 2013, including changes to storage vessel provisions and alternative emission limits for low uncontrolled emissions. The expansion of industry production and government regulation has raised debates on air quality concerns. Some argue that state and local governments are better suited to develop emission standards for the crude oil and natural gas sector due to regional and state-specific factors. They believe federal rules are burdensome and redundant, leading to increased costs and delays for the industry. The need for federal minimum emissions standards in the oil and gas industry is supported due to the varying state regulations and the industry operating under outdated rules. Congress may need to re-evaluate existing federal requirements in light of state and local regulations. Currently, states handle day-to-day permitting and enforcement, with federal requirements typically delegated to them. State regulatory agencies oversee permitting, design, operation, and environmental compliance for oil and gas wells. These agencies vary in structure and were initially established to facilitate resource claims. Some have taken on oversight for environmental protection. Colorado and Pennsylvania have state agencies responsible for regulating industry operations related to oil and gas. In Colorado, the Department of Public Health and Environment and the Department of Natural Resources oversee different aspects of industry operations, such as emissions and well completions. In contrast, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection Office of Oil and Gas Management is responsible for statewide oil and gas programs. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Office of Oil and Gas Management oversees statewide oil and gas programs, developing policies and regulations for exploration and development while ensuring environmental protection. They manage permitting, inspections, and industry training programs, working with relevant commissions and boards. Oil and gas laws are in place in all producing states, typically enforced through regulations and permits. Emissions from oil and gas development in different states are regulated through various statutory provisions and permitting processes. Environmental reviews, inspections, public comments, and commission hearings may lead to additional requirements being added to permits on a case-by-case basis. Many states have revised regulations for oil and gas development, focusing on issues like disclosure of fracking chemicals, well construction to prevent contamination, and waste management. Some jurisdictions have strict air quality standards, while others are considering rolling back regulations. EPA's 2012 federal air standards were based on existing regulations. Critics argue that states, with established structures and trained staff, are better suited to regulate oil and gas exploration than the federal government. They believe that states can address regional and state-specific differences in activities more effectively, balancing environmental needs with economic growth and job creation. Critics argue that federal rules for oil and gas development add unnecessary requirements, increasing costs and delays. They believe state regulatory programs can adjust more quickly to technological advancements and effectively administer rules across different types of lands. EPA has not intended to regulate oil and gas development at the state level. The EPA has not intended to regulate oil and gas development at the state level, but due to varying state and local requirements, there are calls for a minimum nationwide standard for emissions in the industry. Proponents of federal oversight argue that state agencies are underfunded and overwhelmed by national or international oil and gas companies. Oil and gas companies, often national or international in scope, have the advantage of size. State regulators have been criticized for failing to penalize violations or track enforcement data, with 40% having industry ties. A 2012 report found that over half of active wells operate without independent inspections for compliance, violations are often not recorded, and penalties are minimal, providing little incentive for companies to comply. The 2012 federal air standards focus on regulating emissions of VOCs, SO2, and HAPs from some equipment and activities in the oil and gas industry. However, some pollutants like methane emissions from midstream and downstream sectors remain uncovered by federal regulations. Critics highlight methane and hydrogen sulfide as significant omissions in the current standards. The 2012 federal air standards for crude oil and natural gas systems have significant omissions, including methane, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and hydrogen sulfide. Despite being more detailed than previous standards, these pollutants and sources in the sector remain uncovered. Congress may need to re-examine oversight activities to address these emissions. The 2012 federal air standards for crude oil and natural gas systems have been criticized for using natural gas emissions as a surrogate for VOCs and H2S/SO2 emissions, which may not adequately account for the variability of VOCs in the resource. Critics argue that regulating based on natural gas emissions instead of VOCs content essentially targets methane emissions. This approach may lead to unnecessary compliance costs in some cases. The 2012 federal air standards for crude oil and natural gas systems exempt many activities and equipment in the industry, such as oil wells, off-shore sources, and coal-bed methane production facilities. They also do not cover emissions from various sources like field engines, compressors, and storage vessels. Additionally, the standards do not address VOCs or SO2 emissions from existing sources unless classified as HAPs. The 2012 federal air standards exempt certain activities and equipment in the crude oil and natural gas industry, such as oil wells and storage vessels. They do not cover VOCs or SO2 emissions from existing sources unless classified as HAPs. The standards also specify that certain controllers, compressors, and vapor recovery units cannot replace others as the best system of emission reduction. Well completions, pneumatic controllers, compressors, and storage vessels are exempt from \"major source\" determination for CAA Title V permit requirements. The evaluation of emissions units at natural gas facilities for major source classification is complex, as an entire operation may be considered a major source based on emissions. Determining aggregation of equipment and activities for permitting purposes in the oil and gas sector is an ongoing issue. Congress may further assess EPA's requirements for major source categories in upstream oil and gas activities. The EPA and state permitting authorities can aggregate multiple operations into a single major source permit based on the definition of \"stationary source\" in the Clean Air Act. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle set boundaries for defining a source, emphasizing the need to align with New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes and a common-sense notion of a 'plant'. In response, EPA clarified in 1980 that emissions from operations can be aggregated for permitting purposes. EPA clarified that emissions from operations may be aggregated for permitting if they meet specific criteria, including being on contiguous properties, under common control, and belonging to the same industrial grouping. This aggregation applies to both NSR/PSD permits and Title V major source permitting. The intention is to review major projects causing air quality deterioration while avoiding projects with minimal impact. The EPA's 2009 guidance document, known as the McCarthy Memo, addressed CAA source determinations in the oil and gas industry. It revised the previous guidance on aggregation analysis, shifting focus from proximity to functional interdependence. The memo aimed to balance the broad concept of functional interdependence with the narrower idea of proximity in determining source aggregation for permitting major projects. The EPA's 2009 guidance shifted focus from proximity to functional interdependence in source determinations for the oil and gas industry. The agency emphasized the need for reasoned decision-making on a case-by-case basis, following a recent court challenge to its aggregation analysis. The EPA's determination regarding a Michigan natural gas plant and its production wells as a single major source was upheld by the court, ordering a new analysis based on physical proximity. EPA plans to implement the ruling in certain states, citing concerns about regulatory burdens. Congress exempted upstream oil and gas operations from aggregation in the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act exempts upstream oil and gas operations from aggregation for determining major source status and area source category. Emissions from wells, compressor stations, and pump stations are not aggregated with similar units for this purpose. Oil and gas production wells are not listed as an area source category under certain circumstances. The Clean Air Act exempts oil and gas production wells from being listed as an area source category, unless emissions present a significant risk to public health in highly populated areas. The 101st Congress found that these operations have low emissions of air toxics and are typically dispersed geographically, reducing the likelihood of significant health risks. The EPA determined it was not appropriate to aggregate crude oil and natural gas facilities in 1999. The 2012 federal air standards for the sector are based on EPA's emission estimates, with some emissions being difficult to evaluate and under considerable debate. The primary source of information on emissions from the natural gas sector is a methane study published in 1996 by EPA and the Gas Research Institute. EPA's inventory has faced criticism from industry groups and other sources, with competing estimates being put forth. A comprehensive national inventory directly measuring fugitive emissions does not currently exist, leading to uncertainty in regulating industry emissions. Congress may need to find ways to improve emissions estimates for natural gas systems, particularly in measuring fugitive emissions. The current data is over a decade old and focuses mainly on methane. The EPA has started a more detailed inventory of GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector, with the first data released in 2013. National emissions inventories for criteria and hazardous air pollutants are separate from GHG inventories and face challenges in data collection. Emissions inventories for natural gas systems are complex due to varying chemical concentrations geographically. Some states and local entities have started acquiring emissions data, but there is a lack of consistency in measurement practices. The U.S. Secretary of Energy Advisory Board recommends launching projects to improve measurement practices. The Subcommittee is urged to promptly implement projects for designing and implementing measurement systems to collect methane and other emissions data in the natural gas industry. The primary source of emissions information is a 1996 EPA/GRI study, which focused on 1992 and used various methodologies to generate emissions factors from over 100 sources within the industry. The EPA/GRI study in 1992 estimated that the natural gas industry emitted 314 \u00b1 105 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) of methane, equivalent to 127 \u00b1 42 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Emissions were calculated using methods such as tracer gas release and leak statistics. The EPA/GRI study in 1992 estimated that the natural gas industry emitted 314 \u00b1 105 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) of methane, equivalent to 127 \u00b1 42 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Roughly 60% of the industry's methane emissions are from fugitive sources, 30% from venting, and 8% from combustion. EPA annually calculates emissions estimates using updated activity data and industry activity factor drivers. The EPA revised emissions factors for gas well cleanups, condensate storage tanks, and centrifugal compressors due to new information. Emissions factors for gas well completions in unconventional resources with hydraulic fracturing were added to the inventory. EPA estimates that the natural gas industry emitted 247.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2010, with 215.4 million metric tons being methane. Emissions estimates for hydraulically fractured well completions come from industry sources provided at EPA workshops between 2004 and 2007. The EPA revised methane emissions estimates for conventional and unconventional well completions based on data from workshops between 2004 and 2007. They increased the estimate from 0.02 to 0.71 metric tons per conventional well and 177 metric tons per unconventional well. EPA assumes a 3-10 day flowback period with uncontrolled methane release, with 51% of fugitive emissions from hydraulically fractured well completions being flared. The EPA's methodology for estimating methane emissions from hydraulically fractured well completions has been criticized for small sample size and unsupported assumptions on venting practices. Industry sources like IHS CERA, American Petroleum Institute, and America's Natural Gas Alliance have reported competing emissions estimates, with discrepancies in total industry emissions compared to EPA's estimates. Devon Energy Company reports that flowback periods last on average 3.5 days, compared to EPA's estimated 3-10 days. Other studies use different methodologies for calculating leakage, such as satellite observations and ambient measurements. A NOAA study in Weld County, Colorado, found fugitive natural gas emissions from drilling operations range from 2.3% to 7.7% of industry's gross annual production. The research team used data from oil and gas operations to estimate industry emissions. Updated Colorado data and a field study in Utah showed high methane leakage rates. Industry-reported GHG emissions data for crude oil and natural gas facilities in 2011 revealed a total of 225 MMtCO2e emissions. The sector is the second-largest stationary source of U.S. GHG emissions. The crude oil and natural gas sector is the second-largest stationary source of U.S. GHG emissions, with CO2 and methane emissions from onshore production facilities being the largest contributors. Industry-reported emissions show more CO2 and less methane than estimated by EPA. The EPA has implemented a data verification process for greenhouse gas emissions reported by the crude oil and natural gas industry. They have revised their calculations for methane emissions, including liquid unloading, based on industry-reported data. EPA anticipates that data quality will improve over time as facilities become more familiar with calculation methods. The EPA has revised its calculations for methane emissions in the crude oil and natural gas industry, estimating that 177.0 MMtCO2e greenhouse gases were emitted in 2011, with 144.7 MMtCO2e being methane. The assessment of VOCs, HAPs, and other chemicals in emissions is complicated due to varying concentrations in different reservoirs. Accurate measurement of emissions and gas composition is necessary for a full assessment. The 2012 federal air standards are based on EPA's expectations that reduced emissions from natural gas systems would improve air quality and reduce health effects. However, the full quantification of health benefits for these standards is hindered by a lack of data and published studies correlating gas production to health outcomes. Stakeholders find it challenging to scientifically assess the impacts of air pollution from natural gas systems on human health and the environment. The lack of published literature makes it difficult to assess the impacts of natural gas operations on air quality standards. Congress may need to evaluate if current requirements are sufficient to address health and environmental concerns from oil and gas activities. Quantifying the contribution of crude oil and natural gas systems to air pollution is complex due to challenges in modeling emissions' direct and indirect effects on the environment. Emissions from natural gas systems can contribute to ground-level ozone, human health risks, and climate change. However, comprehensive epidemiological studies linking these emissions to specific health outcomes are scarce due to the challenges and costs associated with conducting such research. The lack of published and peer-reviewed literature makes it challenging to scientifically assess the impacts of oil and gas drilling operations. Stakeholders report general air quality issues near oil and gas operations, countered by industry reports on regulatory compliance and environmental stewardship. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the science on the impacts of natural gas drilling on health and the environment is not yet clear. The lack of published and peer-reviewed literature makes it challenging to scientifically assess the impacts of oil and gas drilling operations. More research is needed to understand the public health impacts of natural gas drilling. The available studies on air quality at shale gas development sites are limited and do not provide enough information to determine the overall cumulative effect on air quality. The cumulative effect of shale oil and gas activities on air quality will depend on the amount of development and the rate at which it occurs. Accurate information on emission levels is crucial for measuring this impact. The final recommendation in a report by the U.S. Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Shale Gas Production Subcommittee advises examining cumulative impacts from oil and gas drilling operations, support infrastructure, and related activities. Some agencies are investigating the human health and environmental impacts of oil and gas production, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the states of Colorado and Maryland. Several studies have shown that oil and gas production releases VOCs and methane, which can combine with nitrogen oxides to create ground-level ozone. This has led to serious ozone pollution in areas with heavy drilling activities, such as the Rocky Mountains. A 2005 report found that operations in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana released over 430,000 tons of VOCs in 2002, with projections of doubling emissions in 15 years. Oil and gas production in states like Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah is projected to double VOCs emissions by 2018, releasing over 965,000 tons annually. Ozone pollution from these activities surpasses vehicle emissions in some areas, leading to ozone nonattainment designations. Recently, northeastern Utah experienced unprecedented ozone levels in the Uintah Basin, with over 68 exceedances of the federal health standard in early 2010 and more than 24 exceedances in the winter of 2011. The Bureau of Land Management attributes the ozone pollution to oil and gas activities in the region. A 2009 study predicts that \"Class I areas\" in the Rocky Mountain region, including national parks and wilderness areas, will be impacted by increased ozone pollution due to oil and gas development. These areas near concentrated oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin include Mesa Verde National Park, Weminuche Wilderness Area in Colorado, and San Pedro Parks Wilderness Area, Bandelier Wilderness Area, Pecos Wilderness Area, and Wheeler Peak Wilderness Area in New Mexico. The evidence linking oil and gas development to high ozone levels in the Rocky Mountains remains inconclusive. Factors like sunlight reflection from snow cover and temperature inversions can contribute to ozone problems. The 2012 Uintah Basin Winter Ozone & Air Quality Study found no exceedances of the ozone standard, despite higher levels of ozone precursors and VOCs. The Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas, with significant oil and gas development, has counties designated as \"nonattainment\" by the EPA. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, five of the nine counties designated as \"nonattainment\" for ozone have significant oil and gas development. Studies have shown that emissions from oil and gas operations exceed those from motor vehicles, contributing to high levels of ground-level ozone and formaldehyde. However, the direct link between oil and gas development and high ozone levels remains inconclusive. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality conducted surveys on air quality in the region in 2009 and 2010. The TCEQ study found a 15% drop in ozone levels despite increased natural gas production. Other studies focus on the health impacts of hazardous air pollutants from oil and gas operations. Approximately 37% of chemicals used in natural gas operations can become airborne and harm various organs. Hazardous air pollutants from oil and gas operations can harm various organs such as the brain, nervous system, cardiovascular system, blood, and kidneys. These pollutants can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin, increasing exposure risks. Studies suggest multiple sources of hazardous air pollutants in the oil and gas industry, including venting, dehydration, gas processing, leaks from equipment, waste ponds, and land application of volatile wastes. Hazardous air pollutants from oil and gas operations in Fort Worth, TX are documented to range from 0.02 to 25 tons per year, with emissions coming from various sources such as well pads, compressor stations, processing facilities, and saltwater treatment facilities. Oil and gas development in the area has expanded recently, posing potential risks to the environment and public health. Several health agencies, including CDC, ATSDR, AOEC, and PEHSU, have raised concerns about the health impacts of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emissions from oil and gas facilities. ATSDR's investigation found elevated cancer risk at one site and recommended further investigation into HAPs emissions and risks at all sites. The Colorado School of Public Health identifies air pollution from crude oil and natural gas activities as contributing to health problems for those living near drilling sites. Critics have raised concerns about the study's data, emissions estimates, risk assessments, and study design. The Colorado School of Public Health links air pollution from oil and gas activities to health issues near drilling sites. Studies by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas and Plains Exploration and Production Company found no clear health risks from hydraulic fracturing operations. The studies examined did not find direct evidence of health impacts on workers or the public near oil and gas industry activity. Industry sources argue that standards under the 1999 Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production NESHAPs protect public health. Critics are concerned with EPA's regulatory changes, which they claim result in inflated risk estimates. The studies examined the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from crude oil and natural gas operations, advocating for increased natural gas production. However, when considering methane emissions, the advantage of natural gas over other fossil fuels is less clear. EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions estimates natural gas systems emitted 144.7 million metric tons. The EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions from natural gas systems in 2011 showed a decrease in methane and non-combustion CO2 emissions compared to 1990 levels. Improved management practices, technology, and equipment replacement helped stabilize CO2 emissions. Despite the decrease in methane emissions, natural gas systems remained the largest contributor to U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions, accounting for 25% of total domestic methane emissions and 2% of all GHG emissions in the United States. Some studies suggest that expanding natural gas production could worsen global warming due to methane's high global warming potential compared to carbon dioxide. Methane leaks during production could negate any benefits from switching away from oil or coal. EPA's updated estimates show natural gas systems leak approximately 1.5% of gross national production. Some researchers, like Robert Howarth of Cornell University, argue that emissions from natural gas leakage could be as high as 7.9% of gross national production over the entire natural gas life-cycle. Howarth estimates that shale gas has a footprint at least 20% greater than coal and possibly more than twice as great on a 20-year horizon. However, others claim Howarth's analysis is flawed and that he overestimates the impact. Some argue that Howarth's analysis overestimates emissions from unconventional gas extraction, undervalues green technologies, and fails to capture the contrast between CO2 and methane residence times in the atmosphere. This controversy has led to various life-cycle GHG assessments comparing natural gas to coal, using data from the 1996 EPA/GRI study as a starting point. Methane leakage, changes in radiative forcing from sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols emissions, and differences in electricity production efficiency between coal and gas-fired power generation contribute to additional warming when gas replaces coal. Studies show varying estimates of greenhouse gas impacts, with shale gas emissions 11% higher than conventional gas for electricity generation. Gas-fired electricity emits 47% less greenhouse gases than coal according to some assessments. Alvarez (2012) suggests that for natural gas electricity generation to surpass coal in emissions, leakage must be below 3.2%. Switching to natural gas for vehicles or diesel would require even lower leakage rates of 1.6% and 1.0% respectively. This highlights the importance of reducing methane leakage to mitigate climate impacts. Alvarez emphasizes that the climatic impact of replacing fossil fuels with natural gas varies depending on factors like time horizon, end-use sector, and fuel type. Natural gas is a revenue source for the oil and gas industry but also a major source of pollution when emitted. Pollution abatement can lead to economic benefits for the industry by offsetting compliance costs with the value of recovered natural gas and its byproducts. Many recovery technologies have been implemented to meet regulations, such as the 2012 federal air standards requiring emissions reductions. The 2012 federal air standards require natural gas producers to capture 95% of methane and VOC emissions from hydraulic fracturing operations. Compliance costs are estimated at $170 million annually, but incorporating the sale of recovered products could result in a net gain of $11-19 million. Industry disputes these estimates, projecting compliance costs over $2.5 billion annually. Third parties estimate a net cost of $316-511 million, approximately 1% of industry revenue. Congress may consider aligning costs with sustainable resource expansion, industry growth, and job creation. EPA estimates 2012 air standards could save $11-19 million in 2015 through recovered natural gas and condensate sales. Compliance costs for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production NESHAPs are estimated at $3.3 million annually. The estimated net annual cost for industry compliance with the final NSPS is approximately $170 million, with potential cost savings of $15 million. Producers could earn $4/Mcf for recovered gas and $70 per barrel for condensate, resulting in 43 million Mcf of natural gas and 160,000 barrels of condensate recovered in 2015. Operation costs for hydraulic fracturing with reduced emissions completions are estimated at $700 to $6,500 per day, with an additional $3,500 per well for flare equipment. The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimates compliance costs of over $2.5 billion annually for the proposed regulation, with flaring emissions costing $90,000 per well and operation costs for reduced emissions completions at $180,000 per completion. API reports a limited capacity of only 300 REC sets, capable of producing 4,000 wells a year, while EPA projects 25,000 new or modified hydraulically fractured wells annually. API argues that the equipment needed for reduced emission completions would not be available in time. API argues that the equipment needed for reduced emission completions would not be available in time to comply with the rule schedule. They also contend that EPA's cost analyses are not representative of all equipment and compliance costs, and fail to identify when controls are no longer economic. The proposed air standards could potentially slow down unconventional resource development, resulting in fewer reserve additions, lower production, royalties, and severance tax payments. The burden of regulations would primarily fall on producers due to economic incentives. The EPA's rule on reducing emissions from natural gas production would impose costly regulatory compliance efforts on producers. The final Regulatory Impact Assessment in April 2012 estimated compliance costs for hydraulically fractured wells. Approximately 6,600 wells are assumed to already use reduced emissions completions voluntarily or under state/local regulations. API and other industry players claim that a significant percentage of natural gas producers are already using Reduced Emissions Completions (REC) where feasible and economically viable. Chesapeake Energy limits emissions on a high percentage of its wells, while Devon Energy uses REC for 91% of its wells. Surveys show that API members and other production companies are using REC on a majority of their wells. The overall industry practice regarding REC usage is difficult to determine accurately. A comparative report by Bloomberg Government calculates that compliance costs for the regulation on affected wells would range between EPA's and API's projections. Initial spending on new equipment would be $125 million with annual rental and service fees of $383 million starting in 2015. Total net compliance costs would be between $316 million and $511 million per year, potentially impacting drilling activity. EPA's analysis assumed natural gas sales may decrease slightly. The BREATHE Act, introduced in the 113th Congress, aims to amend the Clean Air Act by including hydrogen sulfide as a hazardous air pollutant and repealing the exemption on aggregating emissions from oil and gas sources. EPA's analysis suggests that natural gas prices would need to rise to $10/Mcf to offset compliance costs, potentially impacting drilling activity. The BREATHE Act introduced in the 113th Congress aims to include hydrogen sulfide as a hazardous air pollutant and repeal the exemption on aggregating emissions from oil and gas sources. U.S. natural gas production has grown due to increased activities in unconventional resources, with many advocating for its use for economic, national security, and environmental reasons. Natural gas is considered a cleaner-burning fossil fuel compared to coal and oil, making it a potential \"bridge\" fuel to a less polluting economy. The recent expansion in natural gas production in the United States has raised concerns about human health and environmental impacts, particularly on air quality. The oil and gas industry is regulated by a complex set of laws at the local, state, and federal levels. State and local authorities are primarily responsible for regulating natural gas systems, with many states passing laws to address air quality issues. Organizations like STRONGER help states assess environmental regulations for oil and gas operations. The EPA has also set minimum standards at the federal level. The EPA has established federal air standards for VOCs, SO2, and HAPs in the crude oil and natural gas sector, focusing on production and processing. Producers have implemented recommended practices to reduce emissions, with economic incentives for capturing fugitive releases. Various partnerships support emissions reduction efforts in the industry, including the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program and the Global Methane Initiative. Some programs like the Global Methane Initiative, World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, and federal air standards aim to control emissions from the natural gas production sector. Debate continues over compliance costs, covered sources, pollutants, and regulatory institutions. Methane, hydrogen sulfide, and other emissions from various sources remain unregulated. The debate over regulating fugitive emissions from natural gas systems at local, state, or federal levels continues due to the lack of a comprehensive national inventory. Without a reliable assessment of industry-wide emissions, the basis for regulation remains uncertain. Fugitive natural gas is mainly composed of methane and other hydrocarbons, but a detailed composition is lacking. Natural gas contains various hydrocarbons like ethane, propane, and butane, along with non-hydrocarbon gases like CO2, helium, and nitrogen. When combusted, it releases CO2, CO, NOx, and other pollutants. Compared to coal and oil, natural gas is considered cleaner in terms of emissions. When comparing the emissions of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, and transportation fuels, it is important to note that natural gas releases minimal sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, virtually no ash or particulate matter, and lower levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and reactive hydrocarbons. End-uses of these fuels vary across sectors, and pollution control mechanisms are in place for many combustion activities."
