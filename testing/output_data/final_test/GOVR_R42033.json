    "content": "President Obama introduced the American Jobs Act in response to high unemployment rates and a weak economy. The legislation aimed to create more jobs and increase income for working individuals. The bill was introduced in the Senate as S. 1549 and in the House as H.R. 12, with an estimated spending of $447 billion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid later reintroduced the proposal as S. 1660, which included a 5.6% surtax on income above $1 million to offset the spending provisions. The American Jobs Act, introduced by President Obama, aimed to create jobs and increase income. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reintroduced the bill as S. 1660, including a 5.6% surtax on income above $1 million. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would increase revenues by $453 billion over FY2012-FY2021. Provisions in the Act focused on promoting hiring, preventing layoffs, assisting unemployed workers, and expanding workforce development opportunities. The American Jobs Act, introduced by President Obama, aimed to create jobs and increase income. The Act includes relief for workers and businesses through temporary payroll tax reduction and tax credits for employers. It also focuses on putting workers back on the job while building and modernizing America. Title II of the American Jobs Act aims to put workers back on the job by creating hiring incentives for veterans, authorizing grants to prevent layoffs and create jobs for teachers, law enforcement officers, and firefighters, and providing funding for the modernization of schools and colleges. It also includes subtitles related to infrastructure development such as transportation grants and a National Wireless Initiative. Title III of the American Jobs Act includes provisions for assistance to the unemployed, creating programs for reemployment, incentives for hiring veterans and long-term unemployed workers, and prohibiting employment discrimination based on unemployment status. Title IV focuses on tax provisions to offset the costs of the Act. The American Jobs Act includes provisions to promote hiring and prevent layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officers, and firefighters through grant programs. It also offers tax credits to employers for hiring veterans and the long-term unemployed, and prohibits employment discrimination based on unemployment status. The American Jobs Act includes a $30 billion Teacher Stabilization program to prevent teacher layoffs and create jobs in education. It is similar to the Education Jobs Fund but with additional funding. The American Jobs Act includes a $30 billion Teacher Stabilization program to prevent teacher layoffs and create jobs in education. Funds would be allocated to outlying areas, schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Education, and for program administration. State governors would receive the remaining funds based on a population-based formula. The Teacher Stabilization program in the American Jobs Act allocated funds to state governors based on a population-based formula. If a governor failed to submit an approvable application within 30 days, the Secretary could award the funds to another entity in the state under specified conditions. The Teacher Stabilization program in the American Jobs Act allocated funds to state governors based on a population-based formula. If a governor failed to submit an approvable application within 30 days, the Secretary could award the funds to another entity in the state under specified conditions. The Secretary could allocate up to 50% of the funds to another entity in the state if the state educational agency demonstrated meeting maintenance of effort requirements for FY2012, or if the Secretary determined the state would meet those requirements. If a state does not receive full funding, the remaining funds would be reallocated to other states based on the population-based formula. Each state could reserve up to 10% of the funds for state-funded early learning programs and up to 2% for other purposes. The American Jobs Act allocates funds to state-funded early learning programs, with up to 2% for administrative costs. These programs must provide educational services from birth to kindergarten entry and receive state funding. Funds can only be used for educator compensation, benefits, and necessary expenses. States must obligate funds by September 30, 2013. The American Jobs Act allocates funds to state-funded early learning programs, with states required to obligate all funds by September 30, 2013. States must provide remaining funds to local educational agencies (LEAs) within 100 days, based on enrollment and Title I-A funds. LEAs can only use funds for compensation, benefits, and necessary expenses to retain, recall, or hire employees for educational services. LEAs are prohibited from using funds for general administrative expenses or other support services. The Education Jobs Fund had similar use of funds requirements, and ED issued guidance on compensation, benefits, and other expenses. It may be informative to examine the guidance issued by ED regarding the use of funds for the Education Jobs Fund. According to guidance provided by ED, compensation and benefits and other expenses include... The guidance provided by ED allows funds to be used for salaries, bonuses, benefits, and other expenses for teachers and school staff members providing educational services. This includes support for principals, academic coaches, counselors, and classroom aides. The Education Jobs Fund money can be used for salaries and benefits of various school staff members, including assistant principals, academic coaches, counselors, librarians, and others. However, it cannot be used for contractual school-level services or general administrative expenses. The Teacher Stabilization program prohibits the use of funds for administrative expenses at the LEA level, including salaries and benefits of administrative employees. It also prohibits funds for fiscal services, program planners, researchers, and human resource services. States are not allowed to use funds to establish or supplement rainy-day funds or reduce state debt obligations. States would be prohibited from using funds to reduce state debt obligations or establish rainy-day funds. The term \"rainy-day fund\" is not defined in the American Jobs Act, making it difficult to predict how the prohibition would be applied across states. Federal funding for education is meant to add to, not substitute for, state and local education funding. The fiscal accountability requirements in federal education programs ensure that funds supplement state and local funding for eligible students, not replace it. Two key requirements, maintenance of effort and federal funding for education, apply to major K-12 education aid programs and would be relevant to the Teacher Stabilization program. The federal funds must supplement, not supplant state and local funds for education. This means that federal funds cannot be used to replace services previously funded by state or local funds, required by law, or provided to some students but not others. Funds from the Teacher Stabilization program are exempt from these requirements. The Teacher Stabilization program allows an LEA to use funds to pay teacher salaries and shift state and local funds to other purposes. States must meet MOE requirements for FY2012 and FY2013 to receive funds. The Teacher Stabilization program requires states to meet MOE requirements for FY2012 and FY2013 to receive funds. The Secretary may waive requirements under exceptional circumstances. States must submit annual reports on fund usage and job support. The Teacher Stabilization program requires states to report on how funds were used and jobs supported, but the information may not be detailed enough for Congress to make informed decisions on future programs or extensions. The Teacher Stabilization program requires states to report on how funds were used and jobs supported. P.L. 111-226 provided $10 billion for an Education Jobs Fund, with $6.264 billion outlayed by states as of October 7, 2011. Some states drew down nearly 100% of awarded funds, while others only drew down about 7.8%. The American Jobs Act proposes a $5 billion Community Oriented Policing Stabilization Fund to prevent layoffs and support jobs for law enforcement officers and first responders. $4 billion would go to the COPS Office for a grant program to hire, rehire, or retain officers, while $1 billion would be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security for fire department staffing. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, created in 1994, aims to advance community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring and training officers, deploying new technologies, and testing innovative strategies. Grants are managed by the COPS Office under the Department of Justice. The American Jobs Act would ensure grants are awarded according to the program's guidelines. The proposed program for the COPS Office would waive the matching requirement and maximum grant award amount, allowing grants to cover the entire cost of hiring, rehiring, or retaining law enforcement officers. However, this may result in fewer grants being awarded. The COPS Office would still need to ensure that every state receives a minimum allocation and that half of the funds go to law enforcement agencies serving smaller jurisdictions. The COPS Office established the COPS Hiring Recover Program (CHRP) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to award funds based on community fiscal health, crime rate, and community policing activities. The COPS Office established the COPS Hiring Recover Program (CHRP) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to award funds based on community fiscal health, crime rate, and community policing activities. The final score for funding was based on fiscal health factors and crime rate, with no requirement to use the CHRP methodology for selecting applications. $1 billion from the proposed Community Oriented Policing Stabilization Fund would be transferred to a First Responder Stabilization Fund for competitive grants for hiring, rehiring, or retaining firefighters. The SAFER grant program, administered by the Department of Homeland Security, provides competitive grants for hiring, rehiring, or retaining firefighters. These grants are awarded through a peer-review process and help fire departments with employment costs. The program was established by the 108th Congress and is funded through the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974. The SAFER grant program, funded through the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, provides grants for hiring, rehiring, or retaining firefighters. Congress has appropriated $1.5 billion to SAFER from FY2005 to FY2011. The program does not allow grants to supplant local budget shortfalls, but waivers have been added since FY2009 to allow for flexibility in grant usage. The American Jobs Act would provide an additional $1 billion in grant money for FY2012, with waiver authority to use grants for retaining and rehiring firefighters. The American Jobs Act proposes waivers for the SAFER grant program to eliminate cost-share requirements, remove the five-year requirement, and increase funding per position. It also expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for certain veterans and long-term unemployed individuals. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is being expanded for veterans, including those eligible for disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The new provisions target qualified veterans and change the amount of first-year wages that can be claimed for the WOTC. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is being expanded for veterans, with varying maximum wages for different eligibility criteria such as receiving SNAP benefits, length of unemployment, and disability compensation from the VA. The American Jobs Act expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for veterans, making it refundable for certain non-profit employers. The credit rate for non-profits is 26%, and eligible organizations include 501(c) tax-exempt entities and public higher education institutions. The WOTC is extended to U.S. possessions with a similar tax system, with the Treasury Secretary compensating for lost taxes. Additionally, a new targeted group is added to the WOTC for non-student individuals. The American Jobs Act expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) by adding a new targeted group for individuals with 6 months or more of unemployment prior to being hired. The maximum wages for calculating the WOTC for qualified long-term unemployed persons would be $10,000. The act also makes the WOTC refundable for certain non-profit employers who hire from the long-term unemployed targeted group, with a credit rate of 26%. Eligible non-profit employers include 501(c) tax-exempt organizations and public higher education institutions. The WOTC is extended to U.S. possessions with a tax system similar to the U.S. The American Jobs Act expands the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to include a new targeted group for long-term unemployed individuals. It also establishes the Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2011 to prohibit discrimination against the unemployed in job advertising and hiring practices, similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Fair Employment Opportunity Act would prohibit discrimination based on unemployment status, covering most public and private employers with some exemptions for small businesses. It defines \"employer\" and \"employment agency\" similar to Title VII, but broadens the definition of employment agency to include online platforms advertising job opportunities. The Fair Employment Opportunity Act aims to prevent discrimination against the unemployed by covering public and private employees, including those under specific acts. It defines \"status as unemployed\" and prohibits employers from discriminating in job advertisements based on unemployment status. The Fair Employment Opportunity Act prohibits employers and employment agencies from discriminating against the unemployed in job advertisements, hiring processes, and referrals. The Fair Employment Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination against the unemployed in job advertisements, hiring processes, and referrals. It also prevents employers and employment agencies from limiting an unemployed individual's access to job information and from retaliating against those who exercise their rights under the act. The act allows employers to consider an individual's employment history and reasons for unemployment when making hiring decisions, as long as it is job-related or consistent with business necessity. Enforcement procedures under the act are similar to those of Title VII. Enforcement procedures under the Fair Employment Opportunity Act mirror those of Title VII. The Department of Justice would enforce the act against state and local governments, while the EEOC would handle administrative enforcement for private employment. Federal courts would have the same jurisdiction and powers to devise remedies for unemployment discrimination as they do under Title VII, including the ability to order affirmative action. Individuals who sue for violations of the advertising provisions of the act could be awarded remedies such as an injunction, reimbursement of costs, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees. Remedies for other violations would be similar to Title VII, including equitable relief, limited back pay awards, capped compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination by private employers, and compensatory damages against governmental entities. The American Jobs Act focuses on compensatory damages against federal, state, and local governmental agencies, limiting damages to $5,000 for cases without lost compensation. It also addresses unemployment discrimination and benefits for long-term unemployed workers under EUC08 and EB programs. The American Jobs Act proposes to extend federal provisions for unemployment benefits and programs, including the Reemployment NOW program and funding for short-time compensation programs. These provisions were temporarily extended in December 2011 and further extensions are pending in H.R. 3630. The American Jobs Act proposes to extend federal provisions for unemployment benefits, including the EB program which provides up to 26 weeks of benefits and may be extended for an additional 13 or 20 weeks depending on state conditions. The EB program is funded 50% by the federal government and 50% by states. The 2009 stimulus package temporarily provided 100% federal funding for the EB program until January 4, 2012, and was extended through March 7, 2012 by P.L. 112-78. States were allowed to use a three-year unemployment rate data lookback for EB triggers under P.L. 111-312. This option was set to expire in December 2011 but was extended by P.L. 112-78. The American Jobs Act proposes a year-long extension of 100% federal financing for the EB program through 2012. It also extends states' authorization to use three-year lookbacks for EB triggers. This extension does not add extra weeks of benefits but may reduce the maximum availability of benefits from 99 weeks to 79 in most states due to high unemployment rates. The EUC08 program, created in response to the recession, provides up to four tiers of additional weeks of unemployment benefits to certain workers. Tiers I and II are available in all states, while Tiers III and IV have specific eligibility criteria based on state unemployment rates. The program was initially set to expire in January 2012 but has been extended to March 2012 under P.L. 112-78. The American Jobs Act proposes a year-long extension of the EUC08 program through 2012, without increasing the number of weeks of benefits available. It also extends increased railroad unemployment benefits through June 2012, funded by the Tax Relief Act of 2010. New federal requirements and funds would be provided for states to offer reemployment and eligibility assessments. The American Jobs Act proposes new federal funds for states to provide reemployment and eligibility assessments to certain EUC08 claimants. States would need to enter agreements with the Department of Labor and require new EUC08 claimants to report to One-Stop Career Centers. The Act would provide $200 per unemployed worker for assessments and authorize states to pay Self-Employment Assistance benefits for up to 26 weeks to eligible individuals participating in entrepreneurial training activities. The proposal suggests providing Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) benefits to EUC08 recipients, allowing them to receive benefits equal to EUC08 for up to 26 weeks while engaging in activities to start their own businesses. SEA participants would be exempt from work search requirements and could stop participation to receive remaining EUC08 benefits. Up to 1% of EUC08 recipients in each state could qualify for SEA benefits. The \"Reemployment NOW\" program would provide $4 billion in direct appropriations to states based on the number of unemployed persons and long-term unemployed. States with agreements for Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) benefits could use funds for administrative costs. The Reemployment NOW program requires states to submit a plan outlining activities to assist eligible individuals in finding employment, performance measures, coordination with federal programs, timelines, enrollment estimates, assurances for providing services to EUC08 claimants, and reporting to the Department of Labor. DOL will provide guidance and evaluation for activities funded by Reemployment NOW. Allowable uses of funds include providing reemployment services and reporting employment outcomes. The Reemployment NOW program allows individuals to receive EUC08 benefits as wages for work in a short-term placement. Participants work up to 25 hours per week, with suspended work search requirements. Earnings are not considered for employment taxes but as unemployment benefits for tax purposes. Wage insurance supplements income for EUC08 claimants. Wage insurance allows states to provide income supplements to EUC08 claimants who find reemployment at a lower wage. The benefit level is determined by states, capped at 50% of the wage difference, with a maximum benefit amount and a two-year duration. Eligibility criteria include being at least 50 years old, earning under $50,000 annually, working full-time, and not being rehired by the previous employer. The American Jobs Act proposes reemployment services for EUC08 claimants and those who have exhausted benefits, including one-on-one counseling and case management. States can use funds for administrative costs and innovative programs to facilitate reemployment. It also clarifies requirements for short-time compensation programs and offers temporary federal financing for up to three years. The American Jobs Act proposes federally financing STC benefits for up to three years in states with new STC programs. States without existing programs can receive federal reimbursement for administrative expenses and temporary federal financing of 50% of STC payments. DOL grants would be awarded to eligible states for program implementation and promotion. The American Jobs Act proposes federally financing STC benefits for up to three years in states with new STC programs. States without existing programs can receive federal reimbursement for administrative expenses and temporary federal financing of 50% of STC payments. DOL grants would be awarded to eligible states for program implementation and promotion, with a maximum grant amount of $700 million. Additionally, the proposal includes the Pathways Back to Work Act of 2011, which would provide $5 billion for grant programs to promote the employment of unemployed low-income adults and youth. The Pathways Act funding would be available for obligation by the Department of Labor until December 31, 2012, and for expenditure by grantees until September 30, 2013. The Secretary of Labor could reserve up to 1% of funding for technical assistance. The first program under the Pathways Act would provide $2 billion to subsidize employment for unemployed, low-income adults, with funds used for recruiting employers and identifying job opportunities. The initiative aims to prioritize opportunities for unsubsidized employment in high-demand occupations. State and local entities can determine the level and duration of subsidies. Support services like transportation and child care will be provided. Eligibility criteria include being 18 years or older, unemployed, low-income, and seeking assistance under the American Jobs Act. The proposal in the American Jobs Act would allow state and local entities to increase the eligibility threshold for subsidized employment to 200% of the poverty line. States can choose to administer funds through Workforce Investment Boards or entities responsible for TANF. States must submit a plan to the Secretary of Labor outlining strategies, participant eligibility, administration plans, performance outcomes, and coordination to receive formula allotments for the subsidized employment initiative. The American Jobs Act proposal allows state and local entities to increase subsidized employment eligibility to 200% of the poverty line. States must submit plans to the Secretary of Labor outlining strategies, participant eligibility, administration plans, performance outcomes, and coordination with other programs to receive formula allotments. States with approved plans would receive funding from a $2 billion allocation, with reservations for outlying areas. The American Jobs Act proposal includes reservations for outlying areas and Native American programs for subsidized employment opportunities. The remaining funds would be allocated to states based on factors like total unemployment, excess unemployment, and economically disadvantaged adults and youth. Ineligible states would lose funding to a competitive pool. The proposed Jobs Act would reallocate funding from ineligible states and localities to a competitive grant program. Governors can reserve up to 5% of the state's allotment for administration. Remaining funds would be allocated to entities administering subsidized employment programs, with local areas able to reserve up to 10%. The proposed Pathways Act programs would allocate funds to local entities for administration, with reporting requirements on performance measures. Grantees would need to provide information on participants, expenditures, jobs created, and participant demographics. The Pathways Act programs under Section 364 require grantees to report performance outcomes for participants, including entry into unsubsidized employment, retention, and earnings. The second program allocates $1.5 billion for employment opportunities for low-income youth, with funds used by state and local WIBs for summer employment linked to learning and support services like transportation and child care. Authorized by the Pathways Act, Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) can provide year-round employment opportunities for low-income youth aged 16 to 24, prioritizing high school dropouts or those with basic skills deficiencies. Emphasis is placed on in-demand occupations, public or non-profit sectors, and industry-recognized certificates. Participants must be between 16 and 24 years old and low-income to be eligible. The Pathways Act allows Workforce Investment Boards to offer year-round employment to low-income youth aged 16-24 with basic skills deficiencies or high school dropouts. Eligibility criteria include being low-income and meeting specific characteristics like homelessness, pregnancy, or needing educational or employment assistance. Local WIBs can adjust the income threshold for eligibility up to 200% of the poverty line. Funding is administered through state and local WIBs. To receive funding for youth employment initiatives, states and local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) must submit modified plans outlining strategies for summer and year-round employment opportunities for low-income youth. This includes participant eligibility criteria, performance outcomes, implementation timelines, and program monitoring assurances. The Secretary of Labor approves state plans for youth employment initiatives to receive funding from a $1.5 billion allotment. Reservations are made for outlying areas and Native American programs before allocating funds to states based on specific factors. The proposed Act allocates funding based on specific factors for youth employment initiatives. States and local WIBs must submit plans for approval to receive funding, with unapproved entities having their funding reallocated. Governors can reserve up to 5% of the state's allotment for administration. Remaining funds are allocated to local WIBs using the same formula as states. The proposed Pathways Act allocates funds to local WIBs based on specific factors, allowing up to 10% for administration. Grantees must report performance measures for subsidized employment, youth employment, and work-based strategies initiatives. Reporting requirements include participant numbers, expenditures, job creation, and participant demographics. The Pathways Act requires grantees to report performance outcomes for low-income youth participating in summer and year-round employment programs, including work readiness skills, education/training placement, attainment of credentials, and entry into unsubsidized employment. $1.5 billion in funding is provided for competitive grants to support a variety of activities and strategies. Entities eligible for funding under the Pathways Act's work-based strategies initiative can implement activities like on-the-job training, sector-based training, and career academies to provide unemployed, low-income individuals with skills for employment. Eligible entities include local elected officials collaborating with stakeholders. The Pathways Act's work-based strategies initiative involves local elected officials collaborating with eligible entities to implement various training programs for unemployed individuals. $1.5 billion in funding will be distributed through competitive grants based on submitted applications outlining the planned strategies and expected outcomes. The Pathways Act's proposed programs require grantees to demonstrate local employer commitment, efficient fund utilization, coordination with other government programs, and effective monitoring. Priority is given to areas with high poverty and unemployment rates. Grantees must report performance measures such as number of participants, expenditures, jobs created, and participant demographics. The American Jobs Act would authorize new grant programs for education facility modernization. Grantees must report on funds, job creation, and participant demographics. Low-income adults must show attainment of credentials and entry into unsubsidized employment. The American Jobs Act proposes a new grant program for federal assistance to eligible postsecondary education facilities for modernization, renovation, and repair. Funds cannot be used for routine maintenance, stadiums, or facilities primarily used for athletic events. Additionally, funds cannot be used for new construction of elementary and secondary education facilities or facilities used for sectarian instruction or religious worship. The proposed grant program for postsecondary education facilities prohibits the use of funds for facilities used for religious worship or sectarian instruction. Funds must be used for modernization, renovation, and repair activities such as roofing, heating systems, and code compliance. Additionally, funds must adhere to wage rates in the Davis-Bacon Act and prioritize American iron, steel, and manufactured goods. The funds are meant to supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds for facility improvements. The FAST Act of 2011 includes provisions similar to Title II-D of the American Jobs Act, with differences in administrative cost allocations. The FAST Act allows states to reserve up to 1% of their allocation for administrative costs for school and community college modernization programs, while the American Jobs Act restricts it to 1% or $750,000 each. The FAST Act does not include equitable participation requirements for private school students. The FAST Act allows students to apply for funding under the Elementary and Secondary Schools Modernization program, with additional reporting requirements. Each LEA and state receiving grants must report annually on projects and jobs created. The Secretary and GAO would also report on program impact. The House version of the FAST Act does not include the American Jobs Act. H.R. 2948 does not include the American Jobs Act provision for Elementary and Secondary Schools Modernization funds. It defines eligible institutions for the Community College Modernization program. The American Jobs Act includes provisions for School Modernization, allocating $25 billion for early learning, elementary, or secondary education facilities. This includes set-asides for Bureau of Indian Education schools, outlying areas, and a survey of public school construction needs. The distribution methodology for funds among BIE-funded schools and outlying areas is not specified. The American Jobs Act allocates $25 billion for school modernization, with set-asides for Bureau of Indian Education schools and outlying areas. The remaining funds are distributed among states and 100 local educational agencies based on specific formulas. States and the 100 largest LEAs must obligate their funds within 24 months. The American Jobs Act allocates $25 billion for school modernization, with funds distributed among states and 100 local educational agencies. States and the largest LEAs must obligate their funds within 24 months. States can reserve 1% or $750,000 for administrative costs. Formula subgrants will be awarded based on FY2011 ESEA Title I-A allocation, with a minimum subgrant of $10,000. LEAs must obligate their funds within 24 months. Competitive grants will be awarded to LEAs not among the 100 largest LEAs. The proposal allocates funds for school modernization to LEAs not among the 100 largest, based on objective criteria with priority for project need and rural LEAs. Funds can be used for green building/energy rating standards. LEAs must use funds within 36 months. Equitable participation requirements for private school students apply. Under the American Jobs Act, private school students with child poverty rates of at least 40% would receive equitable special educational services or benefits that are secular, neutral, and nonideological. These services must be comparable to those provided to public school students and staff, delivered in a timely manner, and with expenditures equal to public school students. Under the American Jobs Act, private school students with child poverty rates of at least 40% would receive equitable special educational services or benefits that are secular, neutral, and nonideological. Expenditures for services would be considered equal if per-pupil expenditures for eligible private schools match those for public schools in the LEA receiving funds under the program. Eligible private schools can use funds for modifications necessary to meet standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and asbestos or polychlorinated biphenyls abatement in school facilities are addressed in the implementation of Section 9501 for ESEA programs. Private schools under the Elementary and Secondary Schools Modernization program would retain title to their property. The minimum LEA formula subgrant of $10,000 may not be sufficient for significant modernization projects. Examples of project estimates are provided by various education departments. The American Jobs Act would allocate $5 million. The American Jobs Act proposes allocating $5 billion in FY2012 to modernize facilities for postsecondary students pursuing two-year degrees. Funds would be distributed to states based on enrollment and degree/certificate awards. Tribally controlled colleges and outlying areas would receive set-asides. The proposal for allocating $5 billion in FY2012 to modernize facilities for postsecondary students pursuing two-year degrees would be based on enrollment numbers at various types of institutions and degree/certificate awards. Data from the Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) would be used to determine grant amounts. The proposal for allocating $5 billion in FY2012 to modernize facilities for postsecondary students pursuing two-year degrees would be based on enrollment numbers at various types of institutions and degree/certificate awards. States receiving a grant would need to report annually on fund usage to the Secretary starting on September 30, 2012. The proposal requires states to report annually on fund usage to the Secretary, including project descriptions, subgrant amounts, and job creation. States can reserve up to 1% or $750,000 for administrative costs. Eligible institutions can receive grants for modernization projects, with a focus on green building/energy rating standards. IHEs can use funds to modernize, renovate, or repair facilities for postsecondary students pursuing two-year degrees. Four-year IHEs cannot use funds for facilities not available to these students. Funds must be obligated within 36 months of enactment."
