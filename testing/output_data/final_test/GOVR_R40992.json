    "content": "The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 emphasized support for democratization in Hong Kong and required annual reports on its status to Congress. It also granted the President the authority to suspend Hong Kong's separate treatment from China if China did not fulfill its obligations under the Joint Declaration. The 111th Congress showed continued interest in Hong Kong's democracy, allocating funds for promoting democracy in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. China's stance on Hong Kong's democratization may reflect its approach to political reforms and reunification with Taiwan. The \"one country, two systems\" policy, established in 1981, laid the foundation for Hong Kong's Handover and future relations with Taiwan, but its viability is uncertain given Taiwan's democratic progress and China's reluctance for political change in Hong Kong. China's stance on Hong Kong's democratization is crucial, especially if China is hesitant to allow significant political change in Hong Kong. The Basic Law of Hong Kong specifies the gradual progress towards universal suffrage for selecting the Chief Executive and Legco members, requiring approval from the Chief Executive and two-thirds of Legco members for any election process changes. Democratic reforms have been a prominent issue in Hong Kong for the past 12 years. Efforts to modify Hong Kong's election system have faced opposition from locals and intervention from the Chinese government. Proposed changes for the 2007 and 2008 elections were rejected by Hong Kong's Legislative Council in 2005. China's decision in 2007 precluded universal suffrage but allowed for limited reforms for the 2012 elections. Debate continues on establishing a fully democratic election system. Significant changes were made in June 2010, expanding the selection committee for the Chief Executive from 800 to 1,200 members starting in 2012. The Legislative Council passed motions to increase its size and expand the selection committee for the Chief Executive. This move, brokered by the Democratic Party and China's central government, has sparked debate on Hong Kong's path towards universal suffrage and caused internal rifts among the pan-democratic coalition. The implications of these motions remain to be seen as Legco considers implementing ordinances. The passage discusses the historical development of Hong Kong's political system, highlighting the evolution of the Legislative Council (Legco) from a body appointed by the Governor to a semi-democratic institution with expanded powers. In 1985, Legco saw its first \"elected\" members, including those from \"functional constituencies.\" Ten years later, Hong Kong's last Legco under British rule was selected under political reforms proposed by Governor Chris Patten. The final British Legco consisted of 60 members\u201420 elected by regional plebiscites, 10 selected by a special Election Committee, and 30 selected by 29 functional constituencies. Patten's reforms included abolishing \"corporate\" votes in the functional constituencies and expanding them so that most adults in Hong Kong could vote in one. The Chinese government viewed Patten's actions as a violation of the Joint Declaration. The Joint Declaration between the UK and China governed the transfer of Hong Kong, allowing for separate legislative power but stipulating that existing laws would remain unchanged. China opposed Governor Patten's Legco reforms, leading to the reversal of these changes after the Handover. A pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, led by parties like the Democratic Party and the Frontier Party, advocated for universal suffrage in Chief Executive and Legco elections. The Basic Law of Hong Kong, passed in 1990, established the new government structure under Chinese sovereignty. It created an executive-led government with a Chief Executive and a Legislative Council. The Chief Executive was chosen by an Election Committee, and the Legco consisted of 60 members elected from geographical districts. Other political parties in Hong Kong supported a more gradual approach to election reforms. Legco, with 60 members, is elected from geographical districts and functional constituencies. The Basic Law aims for universal suffrage in selecting the Chief Executive and Legco members. Annexes I and II outline the process for reform, requiring approval from Legco, the Chief Executive, and the NPCSC. Changes to election laws must be approved by the Chief Executive and Legco in office. Following the Handover, democratic reforms became a key political issue in Hong Kong, with pressure from \"pan-democracy\" parties and organizations for universal suffrage. Tung Chee-hwa resigned in 2005 due to public dissatisfaction over his lack of support for universal suffrage. Donald Tsang Yam-kuen succeeded him and faced controversy over proposed reforms for the Chief Executive and Legco elections. Changes to election laws require approval from the Chief Executive and Legco in office. In 2005, Donald Tsang proposed increasing the Election Committee size and Legco seats, facing opposition due to including non-elected members and lack of universal suffrage roadmap. The proposal failed to pass in Legco, impacting the 2007 Chief Executive and 2008 Legco elections. The focus of Hong Kong's democratic movement shifted to the 2012 Chief Executive and Legco elections, with debates on universal suffrage. In 2007, a Commission studied the issue, leading to a heated debate on election reforms until December 29. In 2007, the NPCSC ruled out direct election of Hong Kong's Chief Executive and Legco by universal suffrage in 2012, but stated that the Chief Executive could be directly elected by universal suffrage in 2017. The NPCSC also decided that all Legco members may be elected by universal suffrage after the Chief Executive election in 2020. The NPCSC's decision in 2007 ruled out direct universal suffrage for Hong Kong's Chief Executive and Legco in 2012 but allowed for possible changes before 2017. The Chief Executive would still be chosen by the Election Committee, but adjustments could be made to the committee's size and regulations. The 50-50 split in Legco seats between geographical and functional constituencies could not be changed, but the number of seats and nature of functional constituencies could be altered. The decision outlined a process for amending Hong Kong's election system, starting with a report from the Chief Executive to the NPCSC. The 2008 Legco elections in Hong Kong saw a campaign for democratic reforms, with pro-democracy and pro-Beijing parties advocating different approaches to universal suffrage. The outcome of the election surprised many, with the pro-business Liberal Party performing poorly. The 2008 Legco elections in Hong Kong saw the pro-business Liberal Party losing all three of its geographical constituency seats, while the DAB gained three seats. Despite public concern about democratic reforms, pan-democratic parties lost two seats but retained enough seats in Legco to veto proposed election reforms. Pan-democrats began lobbying for Hong Kong's transition to full democracy after the 2008 Legco was sworn in. The League of Social Democrats pushed for universal suffrage in the 2012 elections, while other pan-democrats focused on possible election reforms in 2012 and a roadmap to universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020. Pro-Beijing Legco members generally accepted the NPCSC decision and discussed possible changes for the 2012 elections. Chief Executive Tsang initiated a period of study and public consultation on possible amendments to Hong Kong's election process for the 2012 elections, following the NPCSC's decision. Despite campaign promises for universal suffrage, the work of the Commission on Strategic Development has faced challenges. The next election reform proposal for Hong Kong includes changes for the 2012 elections and the transition to universal suffrage. Chief Executive Tsang delayed the public consultation on the 2012 elections to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to an economic crisis, but assured that it was not canceled and there was still time to make amendments before the elections. The Hong Kong government released a Consultation Document in November 2009 for the 2012 elections, focusing on key issues like the Election Committee's composition and Chief Executive nomination process. For the Legco elections, key issues included the number of seats in Legco. The Consultation Document for the 2012 elections in Hong Kong identified three key issues: the number of seats in Legco, the electorate base of functional constituencies, and restrictions on non-Chinese nationals holding seats. The document also presented various alternatives and the government's recommendations. Some functional constituency seats in Legco are held by corporations, not individuals, and the Election Committee includes non-individual voters. The Consultation Document for the 2012 elections in Hong Kong raised concerns about the inclusion of corporations as \"voters\" in the Election Committee, seen as undemocratic and violating universal suffrage principles. Critics viewed the release of the document as a failure to fulfill promises for electoral reforms. The document suggested transferring voting rights to specific directors or executives of corporations, but avoided providing a clear roadmap for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. The Consultation Document for the 2012 elections in Hong Kong raised concerns about electoral reforms. The LSD organized the resignation of five Legco members for a de facto referendum on universal suffrage. The by-election was held on May 16, 2010, with all incumbents winning by a large margin. The by-election in Hong Kong in 2010 saw incumbents winning by a large margin, with a low turnout rate of 17.2%. The LSD and its supporters considered it a success, while opponents criticized it as a waste of time and government resources. Chief Executive Tsang proposed motions to Legco for election reforms, including expanding the Election Committee and setting nomination criteria. The Chief Executive proposed motions to Legco for election reforms, including enlarging Legco to 70 members in the 2012 elections. The additional seats would be allocated through local ordinances following the approval of the motions. The vote on the motions was scheduled for June 23, 2010, with a two-thirds majority required for passage. All 23 pro-democracy members of Legco pledged to vote against the motions. The 23 pro-democracy members of Legco pledged to vote against the motions for election reforms unless significant changes were made. The Hong Kong government launched a campaign to raise public support for the reforms. A televised debate was held on the proposed reforms. The Democratic Party indicated they might support the motions with certain changes, including maintaining the current nomination threshold for candidates for Chief Executive. The Chinese government promised to abolish functional constituencies by 2020 and proposed new seats to be chosen by popular vote. Secret negotiations with the Democratic Party began in February 2010 and intensified after the May by-elections. NPCSC Deputy Secretary Qiao Xiaoyang addressed the Democratic Party's proposals and reaffirmed China's commitment to universal suffrage in Hong Kong. The Democratic Party and Chinese government reached an agreement on new functional constituency seats, maintaining the nomination threshold and allowing popular vote for five seats. This caused division within the pan-democratic coalition, with some members opposing the deal. Several members of the pan-democratic coalition, including Andrew Cheng Kar-foo and Martin Lee Chu-ming, opposed the agreement reached between the Democratic Party and the Chinese government on new functional constituency seats. Chief Executive Tsang's lack of involvement in the negotiations raised concerns about China's direct influence in Hong Kong's political system. The Legislative Council (Legco) voted on motions regarding the selection of the Chief Executive, with some members voting against the motions. LSD member Leung Kwok-hung was removed from the chamber for protesting during the vote. On December 10, 2010, Chief Executive Tsang submitted two bills to amend Hong Kong's election laws. The bills aim to expand Legco for the 2012 elections and establish principles for selecting the Chief Executive. The bill regarding the Chief Executive's selection includes provisions for allocating additional EC members among different sectors. The bill submitted by Chief Executive Tsang aims to expand Legco to 70 members, with provisions including adding five geographical constituency seats and redesignating the District Council functional constituency. The bill also includes changes to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance, expanding the Election Committee to include new members from various sectors and raising the nomination threshold to 150 members. The bill aims to expand Legco to 70 members, adding five geographical constituency seats and creating a new \"District Council (second) functional constituency.\" Eligible voters for the new seats will be registered electors for geographical constituencies. Nominees and nominators for these seats must be elected members of the District Councils. The proposed legislation in Hong Kong includes adding new District Council (second) functional constituency seats to Legco, with nominees needing to be nominated by 15 elected District Council members and campaign expenses limited to HK$6 million. Anson Chan Fang On-sang expressed concerns about the changes, criticizing the lack of restructuring in the Election Committee for Chief Executive selection. Anson Chan Fang On-sang criticized the proposed legislation in Hong Kong for the overrepresentation of certain sub-sectors and the underrepresentation of others. She also disagreed with the election of new functional constituency seats and the setting of a 15-nomination threshold for District Council seats. Anson Chan Fang On-sang criticized the proposed legislation in Hong Kong for overrepresentation in certain sub-sectors and underrepresentation in others. Robert Keatley echoed Chan's criticisms, stating pro-democracy parties wanted more diversity in the Election Commission. Secretary Lam defended the decision to have candidates for new functional constituency seats run in a single election. The Hong Kong government proposed a fair arrangement for political representation, with speculation on Chinese government response. Analysts believe Chinese government may support expanding the Election Committee, but the issue of universal suffrage remains unresolved for the 2017 and 2020 elections. The 2017 Chief Executive election in Hong Kong is crucial for the transition to universal suffrage for Legco elections. Reforms in Legco elections in 2012 and 2016 are also important. The Election Committee may be transformed into a purely nominating body for selecting Chief Executive nominees, who will then be elected by the public subject to NPCSC approval. The transformation of the Election Committee into a nominating committee for selecting Chief Executive nominees is seen as a way to ensure NPCSC approval. The main political struggle is over the size and constituency of the nominating committee, with pan-democrats favoring a larger committee with more elected members, while the Chinese government prefers a smaller committee based on the Election Committee. The balance of power between these two forces is uncertain. The path for transforming Legco into a body with universal suffrage is challenging, especially after the 2010 reforms. A key dilemma is that any changes must be approved by two-thirds of Legco members, requiring support from functional constituency members. Two scenarios for a fully democratic Legco involve reducing power for existing members. The first scenario entails eliminating functional constituencies to have members elected by universal suffrage. The release of the Consultation Document, Legco by-election, and submission of motions have reignited discussions on democratic reforms in Hong Kong. There is skepticism about functional constituency members willing to give up their seats by 2020, and uncertainty if enough Legco members will support changes that dilute their power. The Hong Kong government's recommendations for universal suffrage may not please everyone, but Chief Executive Tsang has clarified the next steps. Congress could respond by indicating concerns directly to Hong Kong and Chinese governments through resolutions, hearings, or submitting comments. Alternatively, Congress could inquire about the Obama Administration's actions regarding Hong Kong's 2012 elections and the use of funds for democracy promotion. In response to the Hong Kong government's recommendations for universal suffrage, Congress could request a report on Hong Kong's autonomy and progress towards democracy. The Council endorsed the \"(Draft) Amendment to Annex I to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" concerning the method for selecting the Chief Executive by a two-thirds majority of all Members. The Election Committee to elect the fourth term Chief Executive in 2012 shall be composed of 1200 members from various sectors. Candidates for the office of Chief Executive may be nominated jointly by not less than 150 members of the Election Committee. The term of office of the Election Committee shall be five years. The HKSAR Government will propose a draft motion to the Legislative Council regarding amendments to the formation and voting procedures of the Legislative Council, based on the Basic Law and previous interpretations and decisions by the National People's Congress. The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region endorsed the draft amendment to Annex II of the Basic Law concerning the formation and voting procedures for the fifth term Legislative Council in 2012. The composition will consist of 70 members, with 35 from functional constituencies and 35 from geographical constituencies through direct elections."
