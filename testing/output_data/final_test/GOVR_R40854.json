    "content": "OMB Circular A-76 is a federal policy that applies to executive branch agencies, outlining a process for public-private competitions to determine who should perform government functions. It includes commercial and inherently governmental activities, with a focus on efficiency and productivity. The concept of OMB Circular A-76 involves public-private competitions for government functions, with a focus on efficiency. It originated as a federal policy in the Eisenhower Administration and has undergone revisions, with competitive sourcing being a key initiative in the Bush Administration's Presidential Management Agenda. The A-76 initiative was identified in 2001 by the Bush Administration to improve government management. Some Members of Congress criticized A-76 competitions under the Bush Administration, leading to a moratorium. The moratorium, tied to the debate over Circular A-76 policy, has suspended new competitions since 2008. President Obama signed a law in 2009 suspending all new OMB Circular A-76 studies. The debate over Circular A-76 policy revolves around the role of the federal government and the functions it should perform compared to the private sector. Views on A-76 competitions vary, with federal employees and labor organizations feeling it favors the private sector unfairly, while private sector contractors believe federal employees have an advantage. Proponents see A-76 as a way to improve federal operations, while opponents view it as adversarial and inefficient. The public debate was reignited in February 2007 due to published articles. The A-76 policy was reignited in February 2007 after reports of poor conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The articles highlighted administrative and bureaucratic failures, leading to investigations, resignations, and congressional hearings. The moratorium on A-76 competitions at military medical facilities led to a government-wide halt on such competitions. The Department of Defense (DOD) has conducted the most A-76 competitions due to its unique workforce and complex mission. Concerns exist that some A-76 activities may be inherently governmental and should only be done by federal employees. DOD has used A-76 competitions to achieve cost savings. The Department of Defense (DOD) has relied on A-76 competitions to achieve cost savings for defense operations. There are three main points of contention: savings generated, oversight mechanisms, and performance of \"inherently governmental functions\" by contractors. OMB reports that competitions generate 10%-40% cost savings, but GAO questions the reliability of DOD's cost accounting systems for measuring these savings. The former GAO Comptroller General testified about challenges facing DOD in conducting A-76 competitions, including difficulties in selecting functions and estimating savings. Questions have been raised about the reliability of DOD's cost accounting systems to measure savings from these competitions. The GAO and DOD have raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the DCAMIS software system used to track savings from A-76 competitions. Reports have highlighted issues with overstated savings, understated costs, and incomplete data collection, making it challenging to determine the overall savings. The DOD Inspector General also questioned the reliability of the DCAMIS data, citing instances of inaccurate data entry and lack of supporting documentation. The DOD Inspector General found that data for A-76 competitions were unreliable, with different methods used by Navy, Army, and Air Force. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of cost tracking and savings calculations. Policymakers questioned the effectiveness of Circular A-76 competitions in saving money for the government. The government's oversight capacity over private contractors is questioned, as shown in scandals involving reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina. The Government Accountability Office found that A-76 privatization reviews often cost more than they save due to poor direction from the Office of Management and Budget. Policymakers are concerned that contractors may be handling functions that should be done by the government. Some policymakers are concerned about contractors performing inherently governmental functions that should be done by federal employees. Congress lacks a detailed report on the number and costs of federal government contractors and the services they provide. There are concerns that the Department of Defense has not complied with the requirement to develop an inventory of contractor activities. This inventory would help identify the number of contractors, their functions, and which agencies they work for. Currently, there is a moratorium on OMB Circular A-76 competitions until FY2012. The moratorium on OMB Circular A-76 competitions has been extended through FY2012, prohibiting public-private competitions in the federal government. This is consistent with legislation prohibiting the conversion of work from civilian personnel to contractors. The moratorium has been in place since 2008, halting new competitions, with no new competitions taking place. The moratorium on OMB Circular A-76 competitions has been extended through FY2012, prohibiting public-private competitions in the federal government. Legislation enacted since 2008 has prohibited the initiation of new competitions, with specific restrictions outlined in various bills. The use of appropriated funds for OMB Circular A-76 competitions government-wide was prohibited by legislation enacted since 2008. This included a government-wide moratorium on new public-private competitions through FY2012, with specific restrictions outlined in various bills. Congress prohibited the spending of FY2010 funds for public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76 and restricted the Secretary of Defense from establishing quotas for converting functions to contractors without proper research and analysis. The report on the conversion of functions to performance by DOD civilian employees during FY2010 was required to be submitted to Congress by March 31, 2011. GAO completed an assessment of DOD's report, stating that while DOD met statutory requirements, there were still concerns about certain issues raised by the DOD IG and GAO in the past. The DOD's report addressed various issues related to public-private competitions, including upgrades to data tracking systems, the overhead rate used in cost comparisons, and recommendations for competition time limits and comprehensive guidance. The report also highlighted the need for policy changes and best practices to improve competitions. The report recommends lifting the moratorium on DOD's use of public-private competitions, as outlined in Section 8103 of P.L. 112-10. The prohibition on new competitions under OMB Circular A-76 was in place, with exceptions for awarding functions to contractors or converting functions to contractor performance. Section 733 of P.L. 112-74 also prohibited funds for initiating or announcing studies or competitions. The moratorium on DOD's use of public-private competitions, outlined in Section 8103 of P.L. 112-10, prohibited funds for initiating studies or competitions regarding the conversion of functions to contractor performance. The Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued a reminder memo on the moratorium, clarifying the statutory language in 10 U.S.C. 2461. The Obama Administration sought to prohibit public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76. Congress enacted legislation requiring reports to evaluate DOD's conduct of A-76 competitions. The moratorium on A-76 competitions cannot be lifted until these reports are completed. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2010 required DOD to conduct a comprehensive review of A-76 policies, cease spending FY2010 funds for competitions, publish in the Federal Register that the review was completed, submit reports on contracts for services, and provide budget information on contract services. GAO was also required to assess DOD's review and report findings to Congress within 90 days. The DOD's response to Section 325 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2010 was released in June 2011, with GAO's assessment completed in February 2012. The DOD report focused on five specific issues raised in Section 325(b), including compliance with requirements, actions taken by the Secretary, reliability of systems, and cost differentials. The DOD's response to Section 325 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2010 focused on five specific issues, including the appropriateness of cost differentials and the adequacy of policies in implementing requirements. OUSD (P&R) recommended that DOD develop policies to improve the A-76 competitive sourcing policy and process, with specific recommendations for incentivizing managers and providing centralized support. The DOD recommended improving training delivery, lowering competition costs, and incorporating full cost guidance into planning processes. They also suggested lifting the A-76 competition suspension and excluding planning from time limits. The Department aims to rebuild a viable program with informed recommendations for improvement. The DOD recommends informed improvements for acquisition processes, with joint oversight by OUSD (P&R) and OUSD (AT&L). Competitions nominated by commanders and managers will be crucial for success. Legislative remedy to section 322 of P.L. 111-84 is essential for future competitions. The management-level evaluation process for preliminary planning of competitions is crucial for success. The start date of the competition should be the public announcement date, and the end date should be the performance decision date. OUSD (P&R) recommends adopting a Navy best practice of announcing preliminary planning intent to Congress for accountability. The preliminary planning process for competitions begins with a letter to Congress announcing the start date and estimated review period. This includes details on DOD functions, manpower criteria, locations, and positions under review. Consultation with civilian employees is required monthly, and results must be certified with documentation. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 required documentation of acquisition feasibility for public-private competitions, reviewed by GAO in 2011. GAO assessed DOD's compliance with statutory requirements and A-76 policies. The GAO reviewed DOD's compliance with statutory requirements and A-76 policies for public-private competitions. DOD complied with the requirements but faced ongoing challenges. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 limited A-76 competition duration to 24 months, extendable to 33 months with congressional notification. Preliminary planning was recommended to be excluded from time-limits. The GAO reviewed DOD's compliance with A-76 policies for public-private competitions. The length of time to conduct a competition could range from 20-22 months for a single function competition and 31-35 months for a multifunction competition. Some in Congress view the current moratorium period as an opportunity to examine the OMB Circular A-76 policy and review the inventory of contracted services. Some in Congress question the need for the current moratorium on A-76 competitions, citing concerns about efficiency and cost-savings. Reports from the GAO and DOD Inspector General raised doubts about the savings generated from A-76 competitions and the reliability of cost data. The debate continues on whether the federal government should invest resources in future A-76 competitions. The DOD Inspector General reported in 2003 that the standard 12% rate for calculating overhead costs in A-76 competitions was unfair. DOD officials planned to review cost estimation procedures for workforce mix decisions. Congress debated lifting the moratorium on A-76 competitions in the proposed NDAA for FY2013. The Secretary of Defense is required to implement an efficiencies plan for the civilian and service contractor workforce of the Department of Defense to achieve savings from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2017. Section 955 of H.R. 4310 also mandates the Comptroller General to review DOD's annual status reports from FY2015 to FY2018 and submit a report to congressional defense committees. Section 955 requires the Secretary of Defense to develop an efficiencies plan for the civilian personnel and service contractor workforce of the Department of Defense to support the National Military Strategy. The plan must be consistent with other policies and procedures and implemented within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The plan required under section 129a of title 10, United States Code, aims to determine the most cost-efficient mix of military, civilian, and service contractor personnel for the Department of Defense. It must achieve savings in funding over the period from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017, excluding expenses related to core mission functions. The Secretary of Defense must consider various factors when determining expenses related to core mission functions, including personnel in critical occupations, personnel at facilities providing core logistics capabilities, and personnel in the Offices of the Inspectors General. This is in line with the workload analysis and risk assessments required by sections 129 and 129a of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense must consider expenses for personnel in critical functions such as maintenance, medical services, and financial audits. Reports detailing the plan implementation must be submitted to Congress annually. The Secretary of Defense must submit annual reports detailing the savings achieved through workforce reductions in military, civilian, and service contractor personnel. Any shortfall in savings must be explained. Exclusions granted by the Secretary must be identified in the report. The Secretary must ensure that required savings are not achieved through unjustified transfers of functions within the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense must report on savings from workforce reductions in military, civilian, and service contractor personnel. Congress recommends allocating 30% of reduced budget funds to assist military personnel transitioning out of the Armed Forces. Service contractor workforce is defined as contractor employees performing contract services, excluding overseas contingency operations. The Comptroller General of the United States will review status reports to ensure savings are achieved in civilian and service contractor workforce. Reports will be submitted to congressional defense committees annually. Section 733 of P.L. 112-74 and Section 8103 of P.L. 112-10 prohibit federal agencies from initiating new public-private competitions under OMB Circular A-76, except under certain conditions. The exception allows for the award of a function to a contractor or the conversion of a function to contractor performance after a study conducted under OMB Circular A-76. The duration of an A-76 competition is limited to 24 months, with a possible extension to 33 months if DOD notifies Congress. This is in accordance with Section 322 of the FY2010 NDAA and Section 2461(a) of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of Defense may specify an alternative period of time for a public-private competition, not exceeding 33 months, if the competition is too complex to be completed within 24 months. This must be justified in written notification to Congress, addressing efforts to break up the study geographically or functionally, the justification for the competition instead of internal reengineering alternatives, and the expected cost savings. The Secretary of Defense may specify an alternative period of time for a public-private competition, not exceeding 33 months, if the competition is too complex to be completed within 24 months. The cost savings expected from the competition must be justified in written notification to Congress. The specified time period for the competition does not include any delays due to protests before the Government Accountability Office or the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Secretary of Defense may terminate or extend a public-private competition if a protest is sustained, causing a delay in implementing a final decision. If the competition is not terminated, the Secretary must notify Congress with a justification and a new time limitation for the competition. The Secretary of Defense may terminate or extend a public-private competition if a protest is sustained, causing a delay in implementing a final decision. A new time limitation for the competition, not exceeding 12 months from the final decision, shall be binding on the Department. Section 325 of the FY2010 NDAA temporarily suspended ongoing public-private competitions by the Department of Defense and established a review process for recommencing such competitions. During fiscal year 2010, the Secretary of Defense will review Department of Defense policies on public-private competitions for functions performed by civilian employees. No new studies or competitions can begin until a certification is submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Defense will review Department of Defense policies on public-private competitions for functions performed by civilian employees and submit a report to Congress by June 15, 2010. The review will address compliance with legal requirements, actions taken to address issues raised by the Inspector General, and the reliability of systems for tracking cost and quality of performance. The Secretary of Defense will review Department of Defense policies on public-private competitions for functions performed by civilian employees. The review will assess compliance with legal requirements, actions taken to address Inspector General issues, and the reliability of systems for tracking cost and performance quality. The Comptroller General will conduct an assessment of the review and submit a report to Congress within 90 days. The Secretary of Defense must certify the completion of the review in the Federal Register and to the congressional defense committees. The congressional defense committees have certified completion of various requirements related to contracts for services and budget information under the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act. Section 323 of H.R. 6523, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011, prohibits the establishment of goals or quotas for A-76 competitions in the Department of Defense. It also mandates reporting to Congress on the inventory of service contracts. The Secretary of Defense is restricted from setting numerical goals for converting functions to civilian employees without proper research. The costing methodology outlined in the act must be used for decisions on insourcing functions. The Secretary of Defense must use specific costing methodology for determining costs when making decisions based solely on costs. Military departments can issue additional guidance for decisions affecting their functions. The Secretary of Defense is required to report to Congress on decisions regarding the conversion of functions to civilian employees, including the agency involved, basis for the decision, and number of contractor employees. The Secretary of Defense must report to Congress on decisions to convert functions to civilian employees, including agency involved, basis for decision, and number of contractor employees. The Comptroller General will review the report within 120 days. Nothing in this section prevents the Secretary of Defense from setting goals for conversion based on research, or requires a cost comparison before converting functions to civilian employees. The Secretary of Defense or a military department cannot be directed by the Office of Management and Budget to conduct public-private competitions or convert Department of Defense functions to contractor performance. Similarly, the Secretary of Defense or a military department cannot initiate such competitions or conversions without external direction. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense will conduct a comprehensive review of compliance with regulations regarding public-private competitions or conversions of Department of Defense functions to contractor performance. Reports will be submitted to congressional defense committees, including an interim report within 90 days and a final report by December 31, 2008. The Secretary of Defense must ensure the Inspector General has access to all relevant Department records of communications. An amendment to allow DOD to use OMB Circular A-76 for public-private competitions was proposed but failed in a vote. Another amendment to reintroduce competition by ending the moratorium on Circular A-76 competitions also failed in a recorded vote. The goal is to remove the law preventing the Secretary of Defense from using private sector competition for new products or services. The amendment sought to remove restrictions on the Secretary of Defense from utilizing private sector competition for new products or services, allowing for competitive bidding and selecting cost-effective options. It also aimed to eliminate criteria forcing the Pentagon to insource competitive contracts. The amendment failed to pass in a vote. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \"Approve public-private competition for work by Bureau of Prisons employees.\""
