    "content": "The \"Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999\" is cited as the title of this Act. It amends Title 18 of the United States Code by adding a new chapter prohibiting partial-birth abortions. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 prohibits physicians from knowingly performing a partial-birth abortion, with exceptions for cases where the mother's life is endangered. The term 'partial-birth abortion' is defined as delivering a portion of a living fetus outside the mother's body for the purpose of performing an overt act. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion, defined as delivering a portion of a living fetus outside the mother's body to kill the fetus. The term 'physician' refers to a doctor authorized to practice medicine by the state, and individuals not authorized to perform abortions but still do so are subject to the provisions of the Act. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion. The Act allows for civil action by the father, maternal grandparents, or others in certain circumstances, seeking relief including money damages and statutory damages. Defendants can seek a hearing before the State Medical Board to justify the necessity of the procedure to save the mother's life. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999 allows for a delay in the trial if the defendant's life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury. A woman who undergoes a partial-birth abortion cannot be prosecuted under this section. Congress acknowledges that abortion has been legal since Roe v. Wade and that partial-birth abortions should be banned, except when necessary to save the life of the mother. It is also recognized that partial-birth abortions are considered horrific and should be prohibited. Congress recognizes the importance of protecting a woman's life and health in reproductive health legislation, in line with Supreme Court rulings. Additionally, Congress acknowledges the significance of Roe v. Wade. Congress finds that reproductive rights are essential for women to fully exercise their rights under Federal and State law, with abortion being a constitutionally protected medical procedure since Roe v. Wade. The decision in Roe v. Wade set limits on States' power to restrict a woman's right to choose, preventing women from being forced into illegal and dangerous abortions. It is the sense of Congress that Roe v. Wade was an appropriate decision securing an important constitutional right. The decision in Roe v. Wade secured an important constitutional right and should not be overturned. The Senate passed S. 1692 on October 21, 1999, to ban partial-birth abortions."
