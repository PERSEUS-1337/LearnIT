    "content": "Immigration cases are primarily reviewed by federal appellate courts through petitions to review final orders of removal by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA hears appeals of rulings made by Immigration Judges (IJs) and if the BIA upholds an order of removal, the alien can petition the court of appeals for review. Judicial review of BIA decisions is typically deferential and limited to the administrative record. The majority of BIA rulings reviewed by federal appellate courts are upheld. Judge Alito has a track record of dissenting in cases where the court overturns BIA decisions, believing the majority is not deferential enough to administrative authorities. He has also voted to remand BIA decisions when important documentation supporting an alien's claims is excluded without explanation. Alito has disagreed with some Third Circuit colleagues on BIA denials of discretionary relief, as seen in the Tipu v. INS case. In Tipu v. INS, the BIA denied deportation relief to an alien with a decade-old drug conviction. The BIA's decision was evaluated by a three-judge panel under an abuse of discretion standard. The majority vacated the decision, finding that the BIA had not adequately considered factors in favor of the petitioner, including the hardship deportation would cause to his seriously ill, dependent brother. The dissenting Judge Alito criticized the majority's decision to vacate the BIA's denial of deportation relief to Tipu, arguing that the BIA had properly considered the alien's drug conviction as a serious adverse factor. Alito emphasized the importance of evaluating all factors in the case and giving proper weight to each one. The dissenting Judge Alito criticized the majority for not giving proper weight to a third factor, demonstrating the wrong standard of review. In Dia v. Ashcroft, Judge Alito dissented from an opinion that he believed did not defer enough to an Immigration Judge's credibility finding. In Dia v. Ashcroft, the Third Circuit criticized the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding as arbitrary and conjectural. The majority found fault with the IJ's reliance on background knowledge and personal experiences to reject Dia's asylum application. The Third Circuit criticized the Immigration Judge's decision in Dia v. Ashcroft, questioning the credibility finding. The majority disagreed with the IJ's reasoning, particularly regarding the wife urging her husband to flee Guinea without her after being assaulted. Judge Alito, in a dissent, defended the use of background knowledge in assessing testimony credibility. The Third Circuit criticized the majority for misapplying the INA's \"reasonable adjudicator\" standard for judicial review of administrative findings of fact in Dia v. Ashcroft. Judge Alito disagreed with the majority's interpretation, arguing that it ignored precedent and gutted the statutory standard. The majority defended their position, stating that adverse credibility findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record, allowing for reversal based on speculation or minor inconsistencies. In the 2004 case of Liu v. Ashcroft, Judge Alito reversed adverse credibility findings after documents corroborating an alien's claims were excluded without sufficient explanation. The Third Circuit reviewed a BIA decision denying asylum to a Chinese couple who claimed persecution via coercive population control measures by the Chinese government. The couple's evidence of forced abortions was excluded for not being authenticated by a U.S. Foreign Service Officer as required by immigration regulation. In Liu v. Ashcroft, Judge Alito reversed credibility findings due to documents being excluded without proper explanation. The Third Circuit reviewed a BIA decision denying asylum to a Chinese couple based on persecution claims related to coercive population control measures by the Chinese government. The couple's evidence of forced abortions was rejected for not being authenticated by a U.S. Foreign Service Officer as required by immigration regulation. However, it was later acknowledged that documents could be authenticated in alternative ways. Judge Alito emphasized the importance of legal determinations that could impact the balance of facts and evidence in agency decisions. Judge Alito found legal errors in excluding abortion certificates in Liu v. Ashcroft, remanding the case for further review. In a similar 2005 case, Zhang v. Gonzales, he emphasized the importance of considering documents that could support asylum claims. Judge Alito's opinion in a case involving asylum claims emphasized the importance of corroborating documents and highlighted errors in excluding such documents. The Circuit panel vacated the BIA's decision and remanded the case for further review to determine why the documents were excluded or to explain why the petitioner's claim lacked credibility. Asylum is a discretionary form of relief for eligible aliens fearing persecution based on specific characteristics. The INA specifies that persecution on account of political opinion can include forced abortion or sterilization under a coercive population control program. Judge Alito's opinions have focused on issues related to asylum eligibility, with deference given to the BIA's interpretation of immigration laws in cases of unclear congressional intent. Judge Alito's asylum opinions often defer to the BIA's interpretation of immigration laws, including the concept of \"particular social group\" for asylum purposes. In the case of Fatin v. INS, a Third Circuit panel upheld the denial of asylum to an Iranian woman based on her Westernized views on women's rights. Alito examined the legislative history behind the INA's use of the term \"particular social group\" in his decision. Judge Alito's interpretation of the term \"particular social group\" for asylum eligibility included women opposed to gender-specific restrictions in their country. Despite this, the Circuit panel upheld the denial of asylum for Fatin, citing insufficient evidence of persecution. Alito's opinion has influenced asylum claims involving gender-based persecution. Judge Alito's interpretation of \"particular social group\" for asylum eligibility, including gender-related persecution claims, has been expansive. In a case involving coercive population control practices by the Chinese government, the BIA limited asylum eligibility to spouses, not unmarried partners, a decision upheld by a three-judge panel. Judge Alito supported the BIA's decision to restrict asylum eligibility to spouses, citing efficiency and avoiding complex relationship inquiries. Marital status is commonly used as a criterion in various fields of law. In a separate case, the BIA denied asylum to an alien fearing persecution for political reasons. The alien, Chang, led a Chinese technical delegation to the U.S. and faced prosecution for violating China's security laws. The IJ and BIA denied his asylum application, but a panel overturned the decision, stating that Chang's prosecution would be politically motivated. Judge Alito disagreed, noting that Chang failed to demonstrate that his prosecution was politically motivated. The majority argued that Chang's defiance of Chinese government orders constituted a political opinion, while Judge Alito disagreed, stating that Chang failed to prove his prosecution was politically motivated. Judge Alito has a broad interpretation of immigration statutes, sometimes differing from his Third Circuit colleagues. In the 2004 case of Lee v. Ashcroft, Judge Alito reviewed deportation orders for a married couple convicted of tax fraud. The BIA considered their convictions as aggravated felonies, but Judge Alito found the interpretation impermissible. The majority overturned the BIA's orders of removal, stating that tax evasion is the only tax crime designated as an aggravated felony for deportation. Judge Alito dissented, arguing that tax offenses involving fraud or deceit should also be considered aggravated felonies. The majority overturned the BIA's orders of removal, stating that tax evasion is the only tax crime designated as an aggravated felony for deportation. Responding to Judge Alito's dissent, the majority emphasized interpreting statutes in favor of the alien and highlighted Congress's modifications to the INA in 1996. In the 1999 case of Sandoval v. Reno, a Third Circuit panel determined that AEDPA and IIRIRA did not eliminate court review of immigration decisions via habeas proceedings. The majority held that habeas review could not be stripped from federal courts without clear intent from Congress. The majority in Sandoval v. Reno upheld the courts' power to entertain petitions for writs of habeas corpus, citing previous Circuit Court decisions. Judge Alito dissented, arguing that congressional intent was to eliminate federal habeas review of immigration decisions, despite acknowledging constitutional entitlement to judicial review through a petition for review. In INS v. St. Cyr, the Supreme Court resolved a Circuit split on habeas review in immigration proceedings, adopting the majority position from Sandoval. Justice O'Connor dissented, agreeing with Judge Alito that the 1996 INA amendments eliminated habeas review for certain aliens. Congress then amended the INA in 2005 to expressly eliminate habeas review in response to the Court's ruling. In response to the Supreme Court ruling in St. Cyr, Congress amended the INA in 2005 to eliminate habeas review via the REAL ID Act. Judge Alito has generally upheld immigration authorities' interpretation of regulations, except in the case of Soltane v. U.S. Dept. of Justice in 2004. In the 2004 case of Soltane v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, a nonprofit religious organization sought review of the denial of its visa petition for an alien employee engaged in a \"religious occupation or vocation.\" Immigration authorities denied the petition, stating that the proposed houseparent position did not qualify as a religious occupation. In a unanimous panel opinion, the court held that the denial of the visa petition for a houseparent position was not supported by the record due to an impermissible reading of the regulation defining \"religious occupation.\" The job could qualify as a \"religious occupation\" as long as it had \"some religious significance,\" as per the regulatory definition. The immigration authorities were criticized for not providing substantial evidence to support their determination of the secular nature of the position. The panel criticized immigration authorities for omitting the religious component of the alien's job duties, leading to the vacating and remanding of the lower court's decision on the visa petition denial."
