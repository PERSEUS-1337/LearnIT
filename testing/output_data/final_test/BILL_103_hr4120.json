CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT REGARDING INCARCERATION OF CRIMINAL ALIENS DEPORTED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. Congressional findings state that undocumented aliens entering the US without permission have become a major economic and social problem, with a significant number committing felony crimes in California and other states. The cost of incarcerating these individuals in California prisons is high, with approximately 15% of the state prison population being undocumented aliens. The State of California has spent over a billion dollars in the past 5 years to incarcerate undocumented criminal aliens. The average cost to deport an undocumented criminal alien is $600. The United States has bilateral treaties concerning prisoner transfers with strict criteria. The President should direct negotiations with other countries to establish agreements for incarcerating deported aliens. Existing prisoner transfer agreements should be renegotiated to remove barriers, and ensure prisoners serve full sentences upon transfer."
