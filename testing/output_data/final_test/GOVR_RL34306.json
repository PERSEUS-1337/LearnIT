    "content": "Contemporary mentoring programs aim to supplement a youth's relationship with parents, administered by adult volunteers recruited by various organizations. These programs have broad youth development goals or focus on specific outcomes like reducing gang activity or improving grades. Research shows positive outcomes, but long-term effects are uncertain. Congress has supported mentoring programs for vulnerable youth since the mid-1990s, with the DOJ's Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) being the first in 1994. The Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) was the first mentoring program implemented in 1994 for at-risk youth ages 5 to 20. Federal government has supported various mentoring efforts for vulnerable youth since JUMP ended in FY2003. Programs like Mentoring Children of Prisoners (MCP) and Safe and Drug Free Schools (SDFS) provided federal funding but were short-lived. Currently, DOJ funds mentoring initiatives through short-term grants. The DOJ has allocated funding for mentoring programs for vulnerable youth, including research on mentoring. The federal government also funds programs like Youth ChalleNGe, an educational and leadership program for at-risk youth. Federal agencies coordinate on mentoring issues through the Federal Mentoring Council, which has been inactive since 2008. The Federal Mentoring Council, inactive since 2008, addresses mentoring issues for the federal government. The report discusses goals, federal policies, funded initiatives, and potential issues for Congress regarding mentoring programs. In the context of this report, mentoring refers to the relationship between a youth and an adult who supports, guides, and assists the youth. Youth can receive mentoring through informal and formal relationships with adults. Formal mentoring relationships for vulnerable youth are cultivated through structured programs sponsored by various organizations. Approximately 4.5 million youth are in structured mentoring relationships facilitated by volunteers recruited from communities, religious organizations, and workplaces. Structured mentoring programs aim to reduce risks for high-risk youth by supplementing their relationships with parents. Programs have various goals such as reducing gang activity, substance abuse, or improving grades. They can be community-based or school-based, with some taking place on school grounds to facilitate relationships with teachers. The co-location of mentoring programs in schools allows teachers to refer youth to mentors who provide academic assistance, recreational opportunities, and promote cognitive and emotional development. Structured mentoring programs originated from charity groups in the early 1900s, aiming to support vulnerable youth by providing practical assistance and creating recreational outlets. Big Brothers, now known as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, is the oldest mentoring organization in the country. The contemporary youth mentoring movement began in the late 1980s with support from foundations and corporations like Fannie Mae, Commonwealth Fund, and United Way of America. Nongovernmental organizations such as One to One in Philadelphia and Project RAISE in Baltimore were established to expand mentoring services to vulnerable youth. The federal government has also supported structured mentoring programs since the beginning of the movement, recognizing mentoring as a promising strategy to enrich the lives of youth, particularly those living in poverty. The federal government supported youth mentoring initiatives in the early 1990s to improve the lives of vulnerable youth, including the Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) and initiatives promoted during the 1997 Presidents' Summit. Studies show that structured mentoring programs, especially those with federal funding, are most successful when they have strong support. Mentoring programs with federal funding are successful when they have a strong infrastructure and caring relationships. This includes activities like identifying the youth population, screening and training mentors, supporting mentoring relationships, collecting data on outcomes, and creating sustainability strategies. Mentor screening selects adults who value trust and can commit time, while orientation and training help mentors and youth understand their roles. Ongoing support and supervision assist pairs in overcoming challenges. Successful youth mentoring programs focus on maintaining strong relationships between mentors and mentees over a year or more. They also prioritize closing the mentorship in a way that acknowledges the contributions of both parties. These programs employ strategies to retain current funders and attract new financial support, while also measuring the impact of mentoring on youth outcomes. Research shows that close, consistent, and enduring mentoring relationships lead to positive outcomes for youth. Closeness and consistency in mentoring relationships are crucial for positive youth outcomes. Mentor characteristics and regular contact contribute to strong relationships, with longer durations showing better results. A 2011 analysis of 73 mentoring evaluations highlighted the effectiveness of mentoring programs in promoting positive youth outcomes through lasting relationships. The analysis focused on mentoring programs for youth under 18, using various formats and strategies, including paid mentors and group formats. Evaluations included comparison groups to estimate impact, with random assignment yielding the best results. Overall, the programs showed modest gains and positive effects on outcomes. The analysis of mentoring programs for youth under 18 showed positive effects on academics, attitudes, social skills, and psychological status. Follow-up assessments indicated enduring benefits, with factors like preexisting difficulties and mentor demographics influencing effectiveness. The analysis of mentoring programs for youth under 18 found that programs with well-matched mentors, based on mutual interests, can benefit youth in various domains. However, few evaluations assessed key outcomes like educational attainment and juvenile offending, and the overall effect of the programs was small. Some studies have shown strong gains for youth who are mentored, such as improved educational outcomes and reduced likelihood of drug use and violence. A 1995 study of the Big Brothers Big Sisters program found that mentored youth had better school attendance and lower rates of drug use and violence compared to their counterparts without a mentor. A 2002 review of various community-based programs also showed positive outcomes for youth with mentors. Improved educational outcomes were observed in youth participating in mentoring programs, with gains in class attendance and better attitudes towards school. Reduction in negative behaviors was also noted, with mentored youth showing fewer misdemeanors and felonies compared to non-mentored youth. Additionally, mentored youth displayed improved social and emotional development, including more positive attitudes towards the elderly and helping behaviors. Participants in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program experienced improved trust and communication with their parents compared to non-mentored peers. A study on school-based mentoring programs showed that mentored youth had better academic performance, increased school competence, and lower rates of skipping school. While mentoring has benefits, some studies suggest limitations in improving all youth outcomes. The 2002 and 2007 evaluations of mentoring programs showed mixed results in improving youth outcomes. Academic gains were not always sustained, and non-school related outcomes like substance use and self-worth did not improve significantly. High attrition rates and program design weaknesses were also identified as challenges. The 2008 study of Big Brothers Big Sisters school-based mentoring found that while mentored students experienced gains on some outcomes, these improvements were not sustained for students who ended their involvement after one school year. Similarly, an evaluation of a discontinued federal school-based mentoring program showed no impact on students in terms of interpersonal relationships, academic outcomes, and delinquent behaviors. This report provides an overview of federal efforts to support mentoring. The federal government lacks a coordinated approach to mentoring, with the DOJ administering the main mentoring program known as the Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP). Established in 1992 under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, JUMP aims to reduce delinquent behavior and improve academic performance, particularly focusing on reducing school dropout rates. The Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) aimed to reduce delinquent behavior and improve academic performance, focusing on reducing school dropout rates. Congress appropriated $104 million from FY1994 to FY2003, with annual funding ranging from $4 million to $15.8 million. JUMP was repealed by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, which replaced it with a block grant program for juvenile delinquency prevention. The limited funding for JUMP may have contributed to its elimination. The JUMP program, aimed at reducing delinquent behavior and improving academic performance, was eliminated in 2003 due to limited funding. Congress replaced it with a block grant program for juvenile delinquency prevention. After JUMP's discontinuation, mentoring funds were appropriated separately under the JJDPA. The JUMP Program ended in FY2003, and Congress resumed funding for DOJ mentoring in FY2005. Funding from FY2008 through FY2017 ranged from $70.0 million to $102.8 million annually. In FY2017, $80 million was appropriated for the DOJ Mentoring program, with $66.4 million available for the program. Funds were used for grants, research activities, and training. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNS) administers programs supporting volunteer services, including mentoring programs for at-risk youth. Funding for mentoring is provided through statutes like the National and Community Service Act and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNS) funds mentoring programs through AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps, providing mentors for at-risk youth. AmeriCorps members serve as mentors or help build capacity in mentoring organizations. SeniorCorps programs like RSVP and Foster Grandparents offer mentoring to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. CNS also promotes National Mentoring Month to raise awareness and recruit mentors. Funding for mentoring programs is authorized by the Serve America Act. The Serve America Act authorizes funding for mentoring programs through AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps, including initiatives to expand the number of mentors for disadvantaged youth. The Youth ChalleNGe Program, administered by the Army National Guard, includes mentoring as a required component. The CNS website connects potential mentors with mentoring programs. The Youth ChalleNGe Program, established under the National Defense Authorization Act, is a mentoring program for youth aged 16 to 18 who have dropped out of school or been expelled. Currently operating in 40 sites across 29 states, the program requires participants to be drug-free and not on parole or probation. With nearly 9,000 cadets graduating annually, the program consists of three phases. The Youth ChalleNGe Program has three phases: a pre-program assessment phase, a residential phase, and a post-residential phase. Cadets work towards their diploma or GED, develop life skills, and engage in community service. The post-residential phase focuses on building on the gains made during the program and implementing a Post-Residential Action Plan (P-RAP). Within six months of graduation, most 2015 program graduates pursued further education, work, or military service. The post-residential phase includes mentoring to help cadets achieve goals outlined in their P-RAP. Mentors, nominated by parents and youth, should be respected individuals who serve as positive role models. Immediate family, ChalleNGe staff, and their spouses are ineligible to be mentors. A National Guard-approved curriculum is used before formal mentor matching in week 13 of the program. During the mentoring program, mentors and cadets must follow National Guard-approved curriculum, undergo background checks, and maintain regular contact. They are encouraged to participate in community service or job placement activities. Meeting in person is preferred but not mandatory. The Youth ChalleNGe program requires mentors and cadets to follow a National Guard-approved curriculum, undergo background checks, and maintain regular contact. Mentors report monthly on cadets' progress and activities, with an exit interview conducted at the end of the program. The program was evaluated by the Manpower Development Research Corporation using a random assignment research design. The Youth ChalleNGe program evaluation showed positive outcomes for participants in terms of education attainment, work history, GED attainment, college credit, employment, earnings, and criminal justice involvement. Positive impacts on health and criminal justice involvement faded over time. The Youth ChalleNGe program evaluation showed positive outcomes for participants in education, work history, GED attainment, college credit, employment, and criminal justice involvement. However, these positive impacts faded over time. The RAND Corporation is examining the program's long-term impacts on individuals and communities beyond three years. The analysis of 10 ChalleNGe sites in 10 states from 2005 to 2008 concluded that the program has a return on investment of 166%. Positive evaluations of mentoring programs, such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, show benefits for mentored youth in terms of reduced drug use, violence, and school absenteeism. Discussions around federal support for mentoring programs should consider the need for additional mentors, especially for vulnerable populations. The long-term impact of mentoring for youth is uncertain, as studies have shown mixed results in improving academic and other outcomes. While some gains were temporary and limited, they may still be a valuable public policy goal. Concerns have been raised about the methodology used in evaluating mentoring programs. Concerns have been raised about the methodology used in the evaluation of mentoring programs, specifically the federal Safe and Drug-Free Schools mentoring program. One concern was the lack of random selection of grantees, impacting the focus on improving academic outcomes and teaching risk avoidance. The selected grantees were more likely to serve females and students of certain ethnicities, and were predominantly school districts with more experience. The evaluation of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools mentoring program raised concerns about the selection of grantees, who were more experienced in running school mentoring programs and serving more students. Some mentored youth did not receive certain services tied to study outcomes, such as academic support. It remains unclear if school-based mentoring programs should focus on improving academic outcomes along with reducing risky behaviors. The evaluation's design, using random assignment, was also noted as a possible limitation. The evaluation of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools mentoring program highlighted concerns about the control group receiving mentoring from other organizations, potentially diluting the program's impact. The SDFS mentoring program did not fully adhere to best practices, with mentoring relationships lasting an average of 5.8 months and delayed mentor assignments. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools mentoring program had mentoring relationships lasting an average of 5.8 months, with mentors not being assigned until about five weeks after being randomly assigned. Ongoing training was not widely available, with only 41% of mentors reporting access to it. Most mentors received pre-match training and had access to support staff when needed. Concerns were raised about the lack of technical assistance available to grantees implementing the program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools mentoring program lacked prescriptive protocols for conducting mentoring activities, supervising mentors, and training mentors. Training and technical assistance were provided by a contractor and ED staff. Analysis of school-based mentoring programs showed small effects, leading to skepticism among stakeholders. The number of mentoring programs has grown in recent years, with different formats serving specific youth populations. Stakeholders may be skeptical of findings from mentoring programs, while others see promise in improving interventions. Researchers caution that administrators should implement programs carefully. The Obama and Trump Administrations have allocated funding for grants to research on mentoring for at-risk youth. MENTOR: A National Mentoring Partnership estimated that 9.4 million at-risk youth need a mentor. Recruiting and retaining volunteers is a major challenge for mentoring organizations funded through federal programs. The Government Accountability Office found that new grantees struggle more with recruiting and supporting mentors. Some mentors in organizations funded for Mentoring Children of Prisoners had dropped out before being matched. Funding for mentoring programs funded from FY2003 through FY2010 dropped out before being matched with a youth due to time and energy commitment. Research shows that mentoring organizations attract middle-aged, educated individuals with children in their household through word of mouth. Retention in formal mentoring programs is higher when mentors feel adequately prepared and programs monitor relationships for effectiveness. The mentoring gap may be wider for special populations, as programs primarily serve youth ages 9 through 11 who come to the attention of a parent or teacher. Recent efforts to recruit volunteers to mentor vulnerable populations have been under way, as evidenced by DOJ mentoring grants in recent years for selected youth populations. Nonetheless, potential mentors may still be discouraged from working with youth facing serious personal difficulties and challenges in their communities."
