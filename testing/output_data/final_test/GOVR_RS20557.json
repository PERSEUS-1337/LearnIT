    "content": "Network-centric warfare (NCW) is a key element of defense transformation, focusing on integrating military personnel, platforms, and formations through high-speed data links and networking software. The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Navy see NCW as crucial for improving combat capability and efficiency. The Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system links Navy ships and aircraft into an integrated air-defense network, allowing real-time sharing of radar data for a common air-defense picture. The Navy is implementing the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system to create a real-time air-defense network. This system allows ships to shoot air-defense missiles at incoming threats using radar data from other units. The Navy plans to install CEC on various ships and aircraft, with potential for expansion to Army and Air Force systems. Despite initial interoperability issues, the system passed technical evaluation after fixes were made. The CEC system passed technical evaluation testing after fixes were made. Raytheon faced competition from Lockheed and Solipsys for developing CEC Block II. Raytheon later purchased Solipsys and teamed up with Lockheed to compete for Block II development, raising concerns about reduced competition in Navy's acquisition strategy. The Navy's acquisition strategy for Block II faced concerns about reduced competition, leading to plans for incorporating open-architecture standards. However, in December 2003, the Navy canceled Block II development in favor of a joint-service successor to Block I. The FY2004 defense appropriations act directed the Navy to keep the Appropriations committees informed on potential changes to the CEC Block II acquisition strategy. The Navy's efforts to improve interoperability between the CEC system and other combat direction systems were praised by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The requirement for the Navy to report to Congress on these efforts on a quarterly basis was ended. The Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) system aims to combine the CEC system with the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye carrier-based airborne radar and control system and the SM-6 version of the ship-based Standard air defense missile to enhance the Navy's networked air-defense capabilities. The Navy is developing the NIFC-CA system to enhance air-defense capabilities with the SM-6 missile. IT-21 is the Navy's strategy for establishing an intranet using commercial desktop computers and networking software to improve warfighting capability and reduce costs. Deployment is planned for FY2011 and full deployment by 2014. The Navy's IT-21 strategy aims to reduce time and personnel needed for tactical and administrative functions. FY2008 funding supports the procurement and installation of Integrated Shipboard Network Systems to achieve Full Operational Capability by FY2011. FORCEnet is the Navy's approach to linking networks for naval NCW, highlighted in Sea Power 21. Undersea FORCEnet Satellite Communications funding in FY2008 provides IP connectivity for collaborative Anti-Submarine Warfare. FORCEnet aims to prevent friendly fire incidents and position ASW platforms effectively against threat submarines. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of specificity and documentation, prompting the Navy to improve the concept document. The FY2003 defense appropriations bill expressed similar concerns and directed the Navy to submit a detailed report on FORCEnet. The FY2004 defense appropriations bill (S. 1382) expressed support for the FORCEnet program but raised concerns about the lack of approved requirements and duplication of effort. The Committee directed the program to establish requirements, test them, and release approved changes quickly. The Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) is a significant program related to Network-Centric Warfare (NCW), with plans to have 344,000 computer workstations, of which 264,000 were fully implemented by January 2006. The Navy aimed to achieve steady-state operation of all NMCI seats by FY2007. The Navy awarded a $8.9 billion contract to Electronic Data Systems (EDS) Corporation for the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) in 2000. Congress authorized a two-year extension to the contract in 2002. The program faced challenges and delays, with a 2005 report identifying problems. In 2004, the Navy and EDS restructured the contract to focus on measuring results. User reactions to the system have been mixed, as reported in a 2006 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report. The 2006 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on NMCI stated that the Navy did not meet its strategic goals of providing information superiority and fostering innovation. The Navy developed a performance plan in 2000 but did not implement it effectively, leading to only meeting 3 out of 20 performance targets associated with the program's goals. This lack of effective performance management has resulted in heavy investments without the expected outcomes. The GAO's analysis of the NMCI program revealed that the contractor's satisfaction of service level agreements has been mixed, with only 55 to 59 percent of eligible seats meeting performance requirements. This highlights the need for effective performance management to address program deficiencies and implement necessary changes. The GAO analysis of the NMCI program showed varying levels of satisfaction among different customer groups, with end user satisfaction consistently below the target of 85 percent. Survey results indicated that 74 percent of end users were satisfied, while commanders and network operators were not satisfied. Dissatisfaction was also reported by customers at shipyards and air depots. This lack of satisfaction poses a challenge for the Navy in meeting program goals. The Navy faces challenges in meeting program goals due to varying levels of satisfaction among customers. Despite initiatives to improve customer satisfaction, the lack of a documented plan limits their effectiveness. After investing 6 years and $3.7 billion in NMCI, expectations have not been met. Congress is concerned about the adequacy of NMCI implementation, goal achievement, acquisition strategy for CEC Block I successor, and definition of the FORCEnet concept. The Navy is facing challenges in meeting program goals, with concerns about NMCI implementation, CEC Block I successor, and the FORCEnet concept. Key questions include the adequacy of satellite bandwidth capacity, development of new tactics for NCW, and the impact on U.S.-allied naval interoperability."
