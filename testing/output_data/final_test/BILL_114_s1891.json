    "content": "The \"Coal Royalty Fairness Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. It addresses the valuation of coal royalties. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) on royalties for Federal coal, defining assessment value and exclusions. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to include a new subsection (d) on royalties for Federal coal, defining assessment value and exclusions. The terms 'broker', 'coal price index', and 'purchaser' are also defined in relation to Federal coal sales. The term 'purchaser' is defined as a person who buys Federal coal directly from a mine operator or indirectly from a broker for use in industrial or energy conversion processes. Exclusions from this definition include coal brokers and other third parties. The term 'quality' refers to the measurement of Federal coal in British thermal units, sulfur, moisture, and other relevant criteria as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. The term 'type' categorizes Federal coal into general categories like metallurgical coal or steam coal. The 'transportation cost index' is established under paragraph (7) to determine transportation costs. The Secretary determines royalty payment rates for Federal coal, with a minimum of 12.5% of the assessment value. Exceptions may apply for underground mining operations. The valuation for royalties will be established within a year of enactment. The purchaser of Federal coal must submit an annual report to the Secretary with necessary information. The Secretary has the authority to audit records of those involved in the purchase, sale, transportation, or marketing of Federal coal. A coal price index will be compiled by the Secretary based on the type and quality of coal. The Secretary will publish the coal price index quarterly, including the method of calculation and other relevant information for transparency. If a person disagrees with the index, they can petition the Secretary to use their supplied information instead. The Secretary may require information from a person to determine assessment value and audit records for coal royalties. For exported Federal coal, the Secretary can request necessary information from the exporter to determine assessment value. When determining royalties for exported coal, the Secretary will use the price of coal at the port of origin and limit deductions to costs incurred before being loaded onto the vessel. If the export price is uncertain, royalties will be based on a coal price index for similar coal types with limited deductions. The Secretary will compile a transportation cost index for coal and determine transportation cost deductions based on it, limiting deductions to costs incurred within the contiguous United States. The transportation cost index, based on average transportation costs per unit, considers differences in transportation costs based on mode, region, and industry characteristics. The transportation cost index, calculated by the Secretary, excludes certain costs like penalties, damages, and speculative aspects of transactions. It is published twice annually with a methodological description. The transportation cost index, calculated by the Secretary, includes methodological details such as calculation method, data sources used (without revealing proprietary information), and any other relevant information for transparency. If a person believes the index deviates significantly from their transportation costs, they can petition the Secretary to consider their supplied information. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct reviews every 3 years to ensure transparency and fairness in the administration of the Federal coal program, submitting reports to Congress describing the program's review. The Comptroller General will consult with various government officials and conduct a review of coal production, reserves, and revenues from Federal land. The Comptroller General will review total revenues from the Federal coal program, market prices for coal and transportation costs, and the appropriateness of royalty rates. The information will be reported in aggregate for the United States and categorized by State for the top 10 Federal coal-producing States. The Comptroller General will review total revenues from the Federal coal program, market prices, transportation costs, and royalty rates. This subsection applies to coal mined from Federal land but not from tribal land."
