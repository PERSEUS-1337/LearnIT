    "content": "Child nutrition programs and the WIC program were up for review in 2009, but Congress delayed action due to concerns over costs. The Administration proposed $10 billion to end childhood hunger by 2015, but Congress did not make specific changes. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-296) made significant changes to child nutrition and WIC programs, with less new spending than initially proposed. It included a controversial provision reducing SNAP benefits to offset costs. The law adopted the Senate's reauthorization bill (S. 3307) over the House's more expensive version. This update followed the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-265). The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 made significant changes to child nutrition and WIC programs, representing the most far-reaching revisions since the 1970s. It is expected to add significant new funding and increase funding for school lunches, linking it to updated nutrition standards. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 increases funding for school lunches and ties it to updated nutrition standards. It also expands access to free school meals, establishes nutrition standards for foods sold in competition with school meals, and supports initiatives to combat childhood obesity. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 enhances food safety requirements for school foods, improves procurement practices, increases WIC program support for breastfeeding, introduces electronic benefit transfer systems, enhances accountability for program operations, sets new nutrition standards and physical activity rules for child care settings, and funds initiatives to end childhood hunger. The main issue in the debate was the costs of the proposed revisions. The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee reported a bill with costs of nearly $5 billion over 10 years. The bill included four offsets, with two smaller offsets facing no opposition. The larger offsets were controversial, one reducing payments for the Environmental Quality Incentive Program and the other cutting spending for nutrition education in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Critics argued against these cuts, while supporters struggled to find alternative offsets under House/Senate \"pay-go\" rules. The child nutrition/WIC reauthorization bill passed by the Senate on August 5, 2010, replaces the controversial EQIP offset with a provision that reduces future SNAP/food stamp benefits. This offset was criticized for transferring funding meant for low-income households to other nutrition programs. The House and Senate debated the child nutrition/WIC reauthorization bill, with the House initially having higher costs and small offsets. The 111th Congress addressed policy questions on federal rules for competitive foods and minimum prices for school lunches for non-poor children. Federal rules may require minimum prices for school lunches served to non-poor children, with gradual increases proposed in both Senate and House bills. Concerns were raised that federal school meal payments may be subsidizing meals for non-poor children, diverting funds intended for services to poor children. Opponents argue that the current system increases participation among non-poor children and generates more revenue for school food service authorities, allowing for better meals. The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee proposed federal rules to regulate school meal pricing, with concerns about potential higher costs for \"non-poor\" children. The House bill suggested a review of new ingredients in WIC program foods to assess their nutritional value. WIC program advocates pushed for adoption of House provisions, while others debated giving the Agriculture Department authority over the matter. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-296) was enacted without granting the Agriculture Department authority over WIC food items. The bill was identical to the Senate's version, with no changes made by the House. The Education and Labor Committee reported a different version of H.R. 5504, which was extensively revised. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 reauthorized expiring child nutrition and WIC authorities through FY2015, with estimated costs of $4.65 billion over 10 years. The House Education and Labor Committee approved an amended version of H.R. 5504, the Improving Nutrition for America's Children Act, with estimated new spending of $7.78 billion over 10 years and $2.6 billion over 5 years. The bill included offsetting savings but had higher costs compared to the Senate's measure. The Senate approved an amended version of S. 3307 on August 5, 2010. The bill included a \"bonus\" commodity offset saving $500 million over 5 years and $1 billion over 10 years. It also called for independent review of eligibility applications for free and reduced-price school meals, saving an estimated $63 million over 10 years. The estimated cost of the bill was $6.72 billion over 10 years and $2.08 billion over 5 years. The Senate approved a bill with a \"bonus\" commodity offset saving $500 million over 5 years and $1 billion over 10 years. It also included a reduction in SNAP benefits scheduled for November 2013, expected to result in monthly benefit reductions averaging $10-$15 per person. The Senate committee bill proposed significant savings by amending the EQIP law, reducing annual funding by $2.87 billion over 10 years. Another revision targeted the nutrition education component of SNAP, aiming to cut spending by $1.3 billion over 10 years. P.L. 111-296 establishes a new grant program for nutrition education and obesity prevention, providing $375 million for grants in FY2011. The funds are distributed to states without requiring state matching funds, allowing them to operate programs for SNAP recipients and low-income individuals. The Agriculture Department's authority to use surplus commodities for child nutrition programs is extended. The reauthorization of child nutrition programs in P.L. 111-296 includes provisions for commodity support and additional oversight for eligibility determinations. These changes are estimated to produce savings of $1 billion over 10 years and $500 million over 5 years. Additionally, local educational agencies with high levels of administrative error must have eligibility determinations independently reviewed, saving an estimated $63 million over 10 years and $26 million over 5 years. P.L. 111-296 includes major changes in child nutrition programs, with increased funding for school lunches and requirements for schools to raise prices for paid lunches gradually. Congress oversees the implementation of these policies. Section 101 and 103 of P.L. 111-296 change rules for determining eligibility for free school meals, including direct certification methods to reduce errors in eligibility procedures. Funding is provided for performance awards for states with outstanding performance in direct certification. Section 103 of P.L. 111-296 establishes a demonstration project to directly certify most children in Medicaid households for free school meals. Section 102 makes foster children automatically eligible for free school meals. Section 104 gives Local Educational Agencies two new options to offer free meals to all schoolchildren. Provision 2 and Provision 3 allow schools to determine federal meal subsidies based on approved applications from a base year, eliminating the need for annual eligibility checks. P.L. 111-296 introduces two more options for schools to provide free meals to all students without the need for applications, requiring schools to find funding for any additional costs. Section 201 of the legislation allows schools to receive federal meal subsidies based on direct certification or survey options to determine eligibility for free and reduced-price meals without the need for household applications. The legislation includes regulations updating meal patterns and nutrition standards for school meal programs, providing increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements. It also addresses rules for milk served in school meals, requires schools to offer free water, and mandates wellness policies for all participating LEAs. The legislation mandates wellness policies for all participating LEAs, including nutrition education goals, increased physical activity, and guidelines for all foods available on school campuses. The Agriculture Department is required to establish science-based nutrition standards for all foods offered in schools throughout the school day. Section 209 of the legislation requires LEAs to report on the school nutrition environment, including food safety, wellness policies, program participation, and meal quality. Section 210 authorizes a pilot project for grants to increase organic food in the School Lunch program. Section 243 provides mandatory funding for competitive grants to assist schools and nonprofits in improving nutrition. Section 244 authorizes the Agriculture Department to establish a program promoting healthy eating and reducing obesity, especially among children. It also allows after-school providers in all states to receive federal subsidies for suppers served in after-school care programs. Additionally, the legislation makes it easier for family day care homes to qualify for higher federal subsidies. Section 221 of the legislation establishes new nutrition requirements for meals served under the CACFP, aligning them with school meal programs. $10 million in mandatory funding is provided for promoting physical activity and limiting electronic media use in child care venues. Section 222 mandates coordination between the Agriculture Department and Health and Human Services Department to encourage state child care agencies to include nutrition and child wellness standards in licensing rules. Section 223 requires a national study on the nutritional quality of foods served in child care centers and family day care homes. Sections 331-333 include provisions to ease administrative rules for child care programs. Sections 331-336 of the legislation focus on easing administrative rules for day care providers under the CACFP. This includes access to hearings, payment for valid claims, standardized federal administrative payments, increased funding for audits, and efforts to reduce paperwork. Section 111 eliminates rules limiting the number of sites nonprofit summer program sponsors can operate. Section 112 requires schools to inform families about summer program meal sites and school breakfast availability. Section 113 authorizes $20 million annually for grants to improve summer food service programs. Sections 321-322 simplify administrative rules for summer program sponsors and establish procedures for termination of sponsors. Section 105 authorizes grants to expand school breakfast programs. Section 242 requires the Agriculture Department to develop food procurement specifications. Section 302 mandates food safety rules for school meals. Section 302 mandates food safety rules for school meals and any facility involved in school nutrition programs. Section 308 improves procedures for dealing with suspect food items in school meal programs. Section 131 allows states to certify children for WIC benefits for up to one year with regular health assessments. Section 231 expands the Agriculture Department's promotion of breastfeeding through WIC. Section 232 requires a review of WIC food items every 10 years. Section 351 involves sharing information on WIC nutrition education. Section 352 of the WIC program makes changes to increase funding for program evaluation, revise administrative rules for supplying food items, mandate the use of electronic benefit transfer systems by October 2020, and allow states to use rebates from infant formula manufacturers for food costs. Additionally, sections 141 and 142 provide funding for research on childhood hunger causes and consequences, as well as grants for innovative strategies to end childhood hunger. Section 143 authorizes the Agriculture Department to award State Childhood Hunger Challenge Grants to governors to end childhood hunger. It requires a review of current practices for school meal payments and alternate meals. Section 206 mandates that revenue from non-program foods must cover costs. Section 207 establishes an audit system for participating schools. The new legislation includes an audit and compliance review system for schools covering financial and nutritional requirements, with results made public. Privacy measures now only require the last four digits of the primary wage earner's Social Security number for free or reduced-price school meals. The department can now fine schools and state agencies for serious violations. States and program providers must cooperate in evaluations, and professional standards for food service directors will be established with mandatory funding. The new legislation includes mandatory funding for training and certification activities in food service management. It also requires guidance on charging school food service budgets for indirect costs and a study on the reasonableness of these charges. Agreements between the department and state agencies must support the full use of child nutrition and WIC programs. The legislation provides provisions to support full use of federal funds for child nutrition and WIC programs, excluding federally funded activities from state budget limitations. It also includes eligibility criteria for child nutrition providers and increases funding for the Food Service Management Institute and federal administrative support for child nutrition program operations. The House Education and Labor Committee approved a bill (H.R. 5504) with provisions beyond the Senate's bill, which was never voted on. These differences contributed to the higher cost of the House bill. The House bill has higher costs due to additional outside-of-school and summer initiatives, expanded provisions for direct eligibility certification of children in Medicaid households, and funding for a Nutrition Wellness and Promotion program. Section 409 requires schools to increase non-federal revenues gradually, while Section 103 covers more states and children for free school meals eligibility through direct certification from Medicaid households. Section 107 allows Local participation. Section 107 of the House bill would have allowed Local Educational Agencies to automatically certify children in military households receiving a Defense Department allowance as eligible for free school meals. Section 146 required the Agriculture Department to assess access to school meals for children in military households and recommend improvements. Section 207 proposed a new Nutrition and Wellness Promotion program funded by a \u00bd cent for each subsidized lunch, totaling $25-30 million annually. Section 244 authorized the Agriculture Department to consult on these matters.

Section 335 would have increased administrative cost payments to sponsors of day care homes, and Section 113 would have funded a grant program for up to 10 states to implement year-round food service programs in low-income areas. Section 115 would have lowered the threshold for qualifying as a low-income area in the summer program for rural areas, potentially making more rural sponsors eligible. Section 441 would have loosened \"low-income area eligibility\" rules, potentially allowing more organizations to operate summer programs. Section 106 would have provided mandatory funding for schools to expand the School Breakfast program. Section 425 would have required an independent review of new ingredients added to WIC foods. Section 143 would have... Section 143 would have required schools to notify parents about policies regarding school meals for children with insufficient funds or outstanding meal debts.

Section 147 would have allowed schools to donate unused food to charitable organizations. Section 245 would have authorized grants for schools to purchase food service equipment, while Section 248 called for a study on cafeteria equipment adequacy. Section 246 would have authorized a pilot program for \"green cafeterias\" by the Agriculture Department in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency. Section 313 would have authorized an examination of states' policies and practices with respect to participation of charter schools in school meal programs, along with establishing a \"green cafeterias\" pilot program for schools making environmentally suitable changes in their meal programs."
