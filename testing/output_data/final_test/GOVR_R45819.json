    "content": "The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) was a response to recent natural disasters, such as the 2017 hurricane season and wildfires in California. It is the most comprehensive reform of FEMA's disaster assistance programs since the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. DRRA aims to improve disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) aims to improve disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, including pre-disaster mitigation. It amends sections of the Stafford Act to clarify assistance program eligibility and increase FEMA's transparency and accountability. DRRA also includes new standalone authorities and requires reports to Congress and rulemaking. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) made major changes to the Stafford Act, including programmatic and procedural modifications to disaster assistance programs. The report provides detailed explanations of DRRA modifications in various sections such as preparedness, mitigation, public assistance, individual assistance, flood plain management, and flood insurance. It also includes deadlines for reporting, rulemaking, and other implementation actions. DRRA Section 1208 mandates FEMA to provide guidance and training to prioritize assistance to medical facilities during power outages from natural hazards. Recent hurricanes have caused power outages affecting millions, including those in medical care facilities. For example, after Hurricane Harvey, 200,000 people lost power in south-east Texas, and after Hurricane Irma in Florida, 4 million people lost power leading to 11 deaths at a nursing home. DRRA Section 1208 aims to better prepare medical care facilities for power outages and mitigate associated damage. DRRA Section 1209 requires FEMA to develop evacuation route guidance for state and local governments. The FEMA Administrator is tasked with revising or issuing new guidance on evacuation routes, considering factors like disaster resistance, special needs populations, information sharing, sheltering evacuees and their animals, contraflow operations, and input from federal land management agencies. The FEMA Administrator, in coordination with relevant agencies, is required to provide annual guidance and training on emergency response plans to governments, first responders, and hazardous material storage facilities. This includes recommendations on evacuation route planning and implementation, utilizing tools and technology for hurricane modeling and transportation analysis. The annual guidance and training on emergency response plans for hazardous material storage facilities will include a list of required equipment, health risks of exposure, and best practices for mitigating damage. This training must be implemented within 180 days of DRRA's enactment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security currently provides information on hazardous materials from various sources, including procedures for responding to releases and resources for medical management of chemical exposures. DRRA Section 1236 requires plan coordination training and the development of resources to streamline information for emergency response plans. DRRA Section 1234 authorizes the National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund, allowing for 6% of the Disaster Relief Fund to be set aside for mitigation efforts. The Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation program aims to reduce risk from future hazards and lessen reliance on federal funding. Funding for the program comes from the DRF, with grants awarded competitively to states, jurisdictions, and tribal governments. Each eligible entity receives a baseline level of financial assistance, with additional funding available through competitive awards. In FY2018, FEMA awarded $235.2 million in Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) funding, with priorities set annually for competitive funding. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) authorizes the National Pre-Disaster Mitigation (NPIPDM) program, allowing the President to allocate 6% of estimated grants for hazard mitigation. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) authorizes the National Pre-Disaster Mitigation (NPIPDM) program, allowing the President to allocate funds for hazard mitigation activities. The NPIPDM funds can be used for various purposes, including technical and financial assistance, enforcement activities, and implementing hazard-resistant designs and standards for eligible structures and facilities. The changes to PDM funding in DRRA may increase the focus on funding public infrastructure projects that improve community resilience before a disaster occurs. FEMA has discretion to shape the program, with potential for significantly increased funding post-DRRA through a new transfer from the DRF. Congress allocated $250 million for PDM in FY2019, which may be merged with funds for the NPIPDM once fully implemented. The FY2019 PDM program will be the last cycle before the new BRIC Program replaces it. Funding not used in FY2019 will carry over to the first year of BRIC. Funding not used in FY2019 will carry over to the first year of BRIC, which is expected to begin in FY2020. PDM projects already in progress will continue under current guidance. Unobligated PDM funds may be rolled into a \"carryover PDM\" account for ongoing projects. Legacy PDM funds may eventually merge with BRIC funds for both PDM and BRIC work. FEMA is determining allocation of funds under the 6% set-aside to various government entities. BRIC is anticipated to be funded solely by the 6% set-aside, but Congress could allocate additional funds. FEMA aims to set aside the full 6% estimate within 180 days of a disaster declaration. DRRA Section 1234 establishes criteria for awarding mitigation funds, including requirements for states and Indian tribal governments. DRRA Section 1235(a) amends Stafford Act Section 404(a) to allow the President to contribute up to 75% of cost-effective hazard mitigation measures. The DRRA allows for funding of hazard mitigation measures that increase resilience to future damage in areas affected by major disasters. FEMA is required to define terms like resilient and resiliency, which may also apply to mitigation activities. Funding can be used to help reduce the risk of disasters. The DRRA allows funding for hazard mitigation activities to reduce future damage in disaster-affected areas. Eligible activities include wildfire and windstorm mitigation. The amendment encourages mitigation in communities affected by disasters under the Stafford Act. Section 1204 of DRRA amends Stafford Act Sections 420 and 404(a) to include HMGP for Fire Management Assistance Grant declarations. FMAGs provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities, while emergency and major disaster declarations offer aid for property protection and broader supplemental assistance, respectively. HMGP grants are available to help state and local governments, families, individuals, and certain nonprofit organizations recover from disasters. The grants can fund mitigation projects to protect private or public property, as long as they align with government mitigation strategies and HMGP guidelines. Grant amounts are determined based on the percentage of funds spent on Public and Individual Assistance for each major disaster declaration. States and tribes with approved mitigation plans can receive up to 15% of the first $2 billion of disaster assistance. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) Section 1204 outlines the allocation of disaster assistance funds, with up to 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion. The FEMA Administrator is required to submit annual reports on mitigation projects and funding to relevant congressional committees. Concerns may arise regarding the cost implications of providing mitigation funding for Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) declarations, as it could increase federal expenditures for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) without significant impact compared to HMGP funding for major disasters. HMGP grants for FMAG declarations may have additional costs compared to major disasters, but the funding amounts would likely be less. For example, $12.3 million has been obligated for FMAG declarations, while $1.7 billion has been obligated for Hurricane Matthew. HMGP funding for FMAGs could be seen as an investment to reduce future recovery costs. DRRA Section 1233 allows hazard mitigation assistance to reduce earthquake risks. DRRA Section 1233 allows hazard mitigation assistance to reduce earthquake risks by improving earthquake early-warning systems, including regional seismic networks, geodetic networks, and seismometers. The focus has shifted from predicting earthquakes to mitigating hazards and enhancing early-warning capabilities. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018 shifted the focus from earthquake prediction to issuing early warnings and alerts. The USGS is working on developing an earthquake early-warning system for high-risk regions, starting with California, Oregon, and Washington, and potentially expanding to other states like Alaska and the New Madrid Seismic Zone in the Midwest. DRRA Section 1233 aims to improve earthquake early-warning systems and mitigate earthquake risks. The DRRA Section 1233 aims to enhance the U.S. early-warning capability for earthquakes by addressing components like seismometers and GPS receivers. While it does not directly tackle the challenge of communicating timing and location of shaking, improvements to the specified components would likely enhance overall system performance. The guidance issued on property acquisition for open space as a mitigation measure under Stafford Act Section 404 includes notification requirements to local government and recommendations for implementing a memorandum of understanding. DRRA Section 1215 amends Stafford Act Section 324(b)(2)(A) by setting specific management cost caps for hazard mitigation. A grantee under Stafford Act Section 404 may be reimbursed up to 15% of the total award, with 10% for the grantee and 5% for a subgrantee. DRRA Section 1207(c) amends Stafford Act Section 428(d) to prohibit conditioning federal assistance on the election of an eligible entity to participate in alternative procedures. DRRA Section 1207(d) amends Section 428 of the Stafford Act to require certified cost estimates by an engineer to be presumed reasonable unless fraud is evident. FEMA no longer has discretion to make case-by-case determinations on cost eligibility. Section 406 of the DRRA allows for base and overtime wages for extra hires to enforce building codes after a disaster declaration. Eligible costs must be based on repairing or replacing facilities in accordance with the latest hazard-resistant designs and standards. DRRA Section 1235 amends Stafford Act Section 406 to authorize contributions for eligible costs on an actual cost basis or through cost-estimation procedures. It also directs FEMA to establish new rules for defining \"resilient\" and \"resiliency\" for eligible costs under the Stafford Act. DRRA Section 1228 requires the FEMA Administrator, in coordination with the FHWA Administrator, to develop and issue guidance for repair, restoration, and replacement of inundated and submerged roads damaged by a disaster. The guidance must address expenses incurred by governments for roads eligible for assistance under Stafford Act Section 406. Prior to DRRA's enactment, FEMA did not issue guidance specifically addressing inundated and submerged roads for repair, restoration, and replacement after a disaster. DRRA Section 1215 places a cap of 12% on administrative costs for Stafford Act Sections 403, 406, 407, and 502, with the primary grantee receiving 7% and subgrantees receiving 5% of the total award amount. FEMA's Multifamily Lease and Repair program, under DRRA Section 1213, expands eligible areas for temporary housing assistance by entering lease agreements with owners of multifamily rental units and making improvements or repairs for eligible individuals and households. FEMA's Multifamily Lease and Repair program, under DRRA Section 1213, expands program eligibility for properties impacted by a major disaster, allowing greater flexibility and options for housing disaster victims. This may increase the number of FEMA-leased multifamily rental properties, providing more housing options for eligible individuals and households. FEMA's Multifamily Lease and Repair program, under DRRA Section 1213, expands program eligibility for properties impacted by a major disaster, allowing greater flexibility and options for housing disaster victims. The Individual Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG) states that properties must be located in designated areas for eligibility, but FEMA can add counties/jurisdictions specifically for implementing Multifamily Lease and Repair. The Multifamily Lease and Repair program under DRRA allows for greater flexibility in housing disaster victims, expanding eligibility for properties impacted by a major disaster. FEMA may need to update its guidance to align with the changes in the program post-DRRA, including defining what it means for a property to be \"impacted by a major disaster\" and any additional eligibility criteria. The restriction on the value of improvements or repairs not exceeding the lease agreement has been removed post-DRRA. The Multifamily Lease and Repair program under DRRA allows for greater flexibility in housing disaster victims. FEMA considers cost-effectiveness when entering into lease agreements for temporary housing. FEMA determines cost-effectiveness by multiplying the approved monthly Rental Assistance rate by the number of units. FEMA guidance states that determining cost-effectiveness for multifamily lease and repair properties involves updating the IAPPG to clarify the process. The impact of removing the restriction on repair costs exceeding the lease value is uncertain. DRRA Section 1211(a) amends Stafford Act Section 408(f) to expand the types of FEMA Individuals and Households Program (IHP) assistance that a state, territorial, or Indian tribal government may request to administer under Stafford Act. FEMA must assess the use of direct assistance authority within two years and submit a report to Congress by October 5, 2020. DRRA Section 1211(a) expands FEMA Individuals and Households Program assistance that state, territorial, or Indian tribal governments can administer under Stafford Act. This includes Direct Temporary Housing Assistance and Permanent Housing Construction, in addition to Other Needs Assistance. The provision aims to empower states to manage housing assistance efforts effectively, incentivizing innovation and cost containment. FEMA emphasizes the importance of local response to disasters and states' understanding of survivors' temporary housing needs. The DRRA Section 1211(a) expands FEMA Individuals and Households Program assistance for state, territorial, or Indian tribal governments under the Stafford Act. This allows them to design their own disaster housing programs with 100% federal funding, creating a block grant for housing assistance. This flexibility may expedite and enhance disaster recovery efforts by tailoring solutions to the specific needs of disaster victims. Designing and administering customized disaster housing programs by state, territorial, or Indian tribal governments may pose challenges. These challenges include unclear application processes, differing program requirements, and varying program implementations across jurisdictions. This could result in difficulties for individuals, households, client advocates, and case managers in participating in and supporting these programs effectively. Additionally, administering multiple programs with different requirements may also be a struggle for governments. State, territorial, or Indian tribal governments may face challenges in managing disaster housing programs due to varying application processes and program requirements. The flexibility provided by the Stafford Act allows for programmatic changes, but it may be difficult for federal partners to keep track of these differences. Governments can use up to 5% of the grant for administrative costs, which can help improve program administration efficiency. The Stafford Act allows state, territorial, or Indian tribal governments to administer Direct Temporary Housing Assistance and Permanent Housing Construction. FEMA must issue final regulations by October 5, 2020, on how this assistance is to be administered. In the meantime, FEMA can run a pilot program. DRRA expands the types of assistance state, territorial, and Indian tribal governments may administer, adding requirements for approval. Previously, a governor had to request a grant to provide financial assistance, but now an application must be submitted to the President for Direct Temporary Housing Assistance, Permanent Housing Construction, and/or ONA. Criteria for approval include submitting a housing strategy and demonstrating the ability to manage the program. Indian tribal government must have an approved housing strategy to manage the program under this section, comply with applicable Federal laws and regulations, and provide assistance. Requirements include compliance with established rules and regulations and verification measures. Strategies for effective local disaster response require demonstrated government capacity to manage housing programs. An approved State Administrative Plan is necessary to administer ONA. The President must implement controls to prevent mismanagement, with the ability to withdraw approval for housing assistance programs. FEMA is developing guidance for housing administration. FEMA may need to clarify application and approval requirements for Direct Temporary Housing Assistance, Permanent Housing Construction, or ONA. Unclear definitions of \"waste\" and \"abuse,\" determination of satisfactory program administration, and management post-withdrawal of approval are key concerns. FEMA is expected to provide guidance on housing administration by October 5, 2020. FEMA is required to issue final regulations on the administration of the program by October 5, 2020, addressing application and approval processes, capacity requirements, and withdrawal of approval. State and local governments can be reimbursed for locally-implemented housing solutions meeting specific conditions outlined in DRRA Section 1211(b). The reimbursement request must be submitted within three years of a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. The housing solution must cost 50% of a comparable FEMA solution or the locally implemented solution cost, comply with local regulations, and be implemented within 90 days of the disaster. FEMA may issue new rules on how reimbursement will be provided for eligible housing solutions. Under FEMA's IHP, financial assistance is available for housing assistance and Other Needs Assistance (ONA) for individuals and households affected by disasters. Prior to DRRA, the maximum financial assistance was $33,300, including both housing assistance and ONA. Post-DRRA, the maximum financial assistance for housing-related needs is $34,900. Financial assistance for housing needs and Other Needs Assistance (ONA) is capped at $34,900 annually. Separate caps have been established for each category. Rental assistance for alternate housing is not subject to the cap. FEMA's IAPPG has not been updated to reflect DRRA changes, causing potential confusion for disaster assistance entities. FEMA has posted a memorandum on the policy changes on its website. The changes to FEMA's policy, as outlined in a memorandum on their website, will be included in a future publication of the IAPPG. DRRA Section 1212 expands financial assistance eligibility for individuals with disabilities. Retroactive payments are being processed for applicants who exceeded the financial cap for disasters declared after August 1, 2017. FEMA exceeded the financial cap for disasters declared after August 1, 2017. In April 2019, they started evaluating applications for additional rental assistance for eligible survivors. Administrative challenges may arise if eligible applicants who already received the maximum financial assistance now request more funds for programs they didn't apply for previously. This could result in insufficient funding for applicants with significant home damage or other needs. Changes to Stafford Act Section 408(h) post-DRRA could increase assistance for disaster survivors, leading to higher federal spending on temporary housing assistance and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). This may better address the recovery needs of individuals and households with significant disaster-related damage. However, it may also discourage sufficient insurance coverage as eligible individuals can now receive separate and increased housing assistance and ONA awards. FEMA has the authority under DRRA Section 1216(a) to waive debts related to assistance provided. FEMA can waive debts related to assistance provided under Stafford Act Section 408. Federal laws require agencies to identify and recover improper payments, with FEMA's IHP being a significant source. IPERA directs agencies to review programs susceptible to improper payments and take action to collect overpayments. The challenge lies in balancing expedited assistance to disaster survivors with maintaining eligibility controls. FEMA has discretionary authority to waive debts arising from improper payments for disasters declared between August 28, 2005, and December 31, 2011, as per the Disaster Assistance Recoupment Fairness Act of 2011. Congressional concerns about fairness led to this provision, allowing FEMA to collect overpayments while also providing expedited assistance to disaster survivors. DRRA Section 1216(a) allows FEMA to waive debts related to improper payments for disasters declared between August 28, 2005, and December 31, 2010, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The waiver can be granted if the payment was made in error by FEMA, there was no fault on the debtor's part, and collection would be unjust. This provision is retroactive to disasters declared on or after October 28, 2012, expanding FEMA's discretion in debt collection. Exceptions include cases involving fraud, false claims, or misrepresentation by the debtor. \"FEMA may lose waiver authority if error rate exceeds 4% of assistance distributed. Current error rate for improper payments is less than 2%. Process for reviewing waivers unclear, may use DHS IG's recommendations.\" The Recoupment Fairness Act of 2011 report recommends that FEMA establish quality assurance procedures for recoupment cases, create an audit trail for waiver decisions, and clarify criteria for approving waivers to prevent financial hardship for disaster survivors. DRRA Section 1216(b) limits FEMA's ability to recoup assistance without evidence of fraud. The Recoupment Fairness Act of 2011 limits FEMA's ability to recoup assistance without evidence of fraud, establishing a three-year statute of limitations on debt collection for assistance provided under IHP. This provision aims to reduce administrative costs and provide certainty to disaster survivors. FEMA's guidance states that there is no statute of limitations on initiating recoupment of IHP debt owed to the U.S. Government through administrative means. Despite the three-year goal to notify applicants of potential debt, FEMA may still initiate recoupment beyond this timeframe if it deems it in the best interest of the Federal government. Congress may require FEMA to update its guidance to reflect DRRA Section 1216(b), which may cause confusion in determining if the section is discretionary or mandatory. The legislation states that FEMA may not recoup covered assistance after three years, causing potential confusion. Congress may need to clarify if this provision is mandatory to avoid ambiguity. The three-year window for recouping IHP payments will vary for each award, posing an administrative challenge for FEMA. DRRA Section 1216(c) changes the statute of limitations for FEMA to recover payments made to state or local governments under the IHP program. The new provision prevents any administrative action to recover payments after 3 years from the final expenditure report for project completion. This change applies retroactively to assistance provided since January 1, 2004, terminating any pending administrative actions upon DRRA's enactment. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) of 2018 introduced changes to the statute of limitations for FEMA to recoup funding from disaster recovery projects. Prior to DRRA, FEMA could pursue funding from projects completed years ago, but now, there is a post-DRRA project-by-project statute of limitations. This change provides certainty to state, territorial, and tribal governments on which projects may be subject to recoupment and incentivizes timely project closeouts, easing administrative and financial burdens on FEMA. DRRA Section 1206(a) allows state and local governments to use federal assistance funds for building code enforcement and floodplain management. If a building in a Special Flood Hazard Area is deemed substantially damaged, it must be brought into compliance with local floodplain standards, which may include demolition and elevation above Base Flood Elevation. Local government officials, not FEMA, determine substantial damage. DRRA Section 1207(b) amends Stafford Act Section 406(d)(1) to provide relief from a reduction in disaster assistance for certain public and private nonprofit facilities damaged by disasters in 2016 to 2018. Applicants for Public Assistance are required to obtain flood insurance on damaged insurable facilities. Applicants for Public Assistance must have flood insurance on damaged insurable facilities to receive grant funding. Insurance coverage must be subtracted from grants to avoid duplication. FEMA will reduce funding for facilities in SFHAs without flood insurance. The Stafford Act previously required a reduction in disaster assistance for nonresidential buildings without flood insurance. The new provision in DRRA limits this reduction to one building in multi-structure campuses for certain entities. This amendment applies to disasters declared between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, restoring funding for organizations affected by floods like the 2016 Louisiana floods and Hurricanes Matthew, Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Florence. DRRA Section 1240 mandates FEMA to report on Public Assistance self-insurance shortfalls annually until 2023. Applicants in Special Flood Hazard Areas must obtain and maintain flood insurance on damaged facilities to receive PA grant funding. They can request to use a self-insurance plan, with details outlined in FEMA guidance. DHS IG reports have raised concerns about applicant compliance with insurance requirements. The new reports mandated by DRRA Section 1240 will focus on self-insurance shortfalls in addressing flood damages. DRRA Section 1224 establishes new requirements for FEMA to publish grant award information on their website. FEMA is now required to publish information on grants awarded under Stafford Act Section 406 for damaged facilities exceeding $1,000,000. This includes details such as FEMA region, declaration number, federal share amount, and award date. Additionally, FEMA must also disclose contract information for contracts over $1,000,000, including contractor name, award date, contract amount, competitive bidding status, and declaration number. This new requirement was established by Stafford Act Section 430(d) and was not in place before DRRA's enactment. Section 430(d) of the Stafford Act requires FEMA to report on contracts awarded without competitive bidding, including reasons for bypassing bidding, contract amounts, and damage category codes. Section 430(e) mandates FEMA to track contracts over $1,000,000 for Public Assistance recipients. Federal Emergency Assistance for contracts over $1,000,000 requires collection of specific contract information including disaster number, contractor name, contract amount, and competitive bid process details. FEMA Administrator must share this information with DHS IG, GAO, and congressional committees upon request. A report on FEMA's efforts to collect contract information must be submitted within 365 days of DRRA's enactment. Prior to DRRA, FEMA lacked comprehensive contract information and did not submit annual reports. DRRA Section 1221 amends Stafford Act Section 705 to authorize FEMA Administrator to develop incentives and penalties for grant closeout activities. It aims to improve closeout practices, reduce time between awarding a grant and closing out expenditures, and issue regulations for facilitating grant closeout. Congress designed this provision to incentivize timely closeouts and make such activities a requirement rather than discretionary for FEMA. DRRA Section 1225 prohibits FEMA from reimbursing grantees for contracts entered into after August 1, 2017, that restrict auditing. DRRA Section 1237 mandates FEMA to validate covered disaster assistance and restore withdrawn funding. The DHS IG found that inaccurate information from a Technical Assistance Contractor led to local governments approving ineligible contracts for debris removal. DRRA Section 1210 allows the President to waive duplication of benefits if in the public interest and not wasteful. The President may consider recommendations from FEMA or other agencies, cost effectiveness, equity, good conscience, and public policy in deciding on duplication of benefits. DRRA Section 1210 aims to reduce hardships from benefit recoupment. Using multiple sources of assistance after a disaster can lead to duplication of benefits. Stafford Act Section 312(a) prohibits financial assistance for losses already covered. The federal duplication of benefits policy, outlined in the Stafford Act Section 312(c), holds recipients accountable for receiving duplicative assistance and aims to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. 44 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7206.191 provides procedural guidance to prevent duplication between federal assistance programs, state programs, volunteer programs, and insurance benefits. The delivery sequence determines the order in which assistance should be provided to avoid duplication. The regulation requires individuals to repay all duplicated assistance based on the delivery sequence hierarchy that outlines the order assistance should be provided. Critics argue that the delivery sequence lacks specificity, as certain programs like HUD's CDBG-DR Program are not listed. However, Stafford Act Section 312 also states that assistance cannot be withheld from those entitled to receive benefits. The delivery sequence for federal assistance allows for flexibility in certain cases, such as when timely assistance is needed. For example, SBA disaster loans can be processed quicker than FEMA grants, and CDBG-DR grants require Congressional appropriation. Repayment of duplicative assistance is required, but assistance cannot be withheld from those entitled to receive benefits. The federal government provides funding to states in the form of block grants for disaster assistance, prioritizing quick delivery to survivors. However, this approach can lead to problems such as duplication of benefits, which may not be identified immediately, causing surprise recoupment notifications to survivors who unknowingly exceeded their allowable assistance. DRRA Section 1210 prohibits loans as duplicative assistance if all federal aid is used for disaster recovery. SBA disaster loans may be excluded from the delivery sequence. Implementation of this provision is pending. FEMA Administrator must provide a report with recommendations for improving disaster assistance delivery. The report must include actions planned by agencies, legislative proposals for coordination in disaster assistance delivery, clarification of delivery sequence and federal interpretation of Stafford Act Section 312, and recommendations for improving communication with disaster assistance applicants. DRRA Section 1239 and Section 1232 require FEMA to update factors for evaluating disaster declaration requests and consider cost estimates for disaster assistance. FEMA is required to consider factors that may impact a local jurisdiction's ability to respond to disasters, including severe local impact or recent multiple disasters. They use the estimated cost of assistance to evaluate the severity of a disaster and determine if federal assistance is needed, with thresholds based on public infrastructure damages and state population. FEMA recommends declaring a major disaster if public infrastructure damages exceed $1 million and meet or exceed $1.50 per capita based on state population. Concerns include some states finding it difficult to reach the per capita threshold, potentially denying federal disaster assistance to areas that overwhelm local capacity despite not exceeding the statewide threshold. FEMA is required to update factors for evaluating major disaster declarations, including cost estimation and response capacity. The per capita threshold may be reconsidered, taking into account the results of the 2020 U.S. Census. Adjustments to agency policy and regulations are mandated to provide greater assistance. FEMA is required to adjust agency policy and regulations to grant greater consideration to severe local impact or recent multiple disasters when evaluating major disaster declarations. The per capita threshold may still play a significant role in determining the amount and type of damages caused by an incident. DRRA Section 1219 amends Stafford Act Section 423 to add a right of arbitration for applicants appealing decisions regarding assistance eligibility or amount. Prior to DRRA, FEMA could only review its own decisions, but now applicants can bring claims before an independent arbiter within 60 days of notification. This change was prompted by disputes following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. In 2005, disputes arose from public assistance payments under Stafford Act Sections 403, 406, and 407 post-Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. An arbitration process was established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to expedite recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast Region. The arbitration panel has authority over disputed public assistance applications for hurricane damage. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA) allows for arbitration for disputes over $500,000 in public assistance funding for disasters after January 1, 2016. States can request arbitration to challenge eligibility or repayment. FEMA's appeal process and arbitration rights were added to the Stafford Act Section 423 under the ARRA. FEMA will implement Section 423 arbitration for disputes over $500,000 in public assistance funding. The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals will conduct arbitration, with their decision being binding. FEMA plans to revise regulations to include arbitration and rely on the Public Assistance Appeals process in the interim. FEMA will rely on the Public Assistance Appeals and Arbitration fact sheets for dispute resolution. The CBCA published proposed rules for Section 423 arbitration. FEMA will provide information on second level appeals or arbitration for disputes after January 1, 2016. There is debate on whether arbitration expedites resolution, with the CBCA panel cited for faster resolution. The arbitration process for FEMA's Public Assistance often takes years to resolve disputes, involving multiple steps like appeals, panel selection, hearings, and final decisions. The length and cost of arbitration depend on project complexity and associated expenses, with fees for panel, experts, and attorneys being the responsibility of both parties. The Senate HSGAC's DRRA Report states that implementing the arbitration provision for FEMA's Public Assistance could cost $4 million over the 2019-2023 period. Congress may consider reviewing the arbitration process to assess its effectiveness and cost efficiency, and explore ways to improve its efficiency if necessary. DRRA Section 1218 authorizes the FEMA Administrator to establish national veterinary emergency teams at accredited colleges of veterinary medicine. These teams deploy with Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) response teams to care for various animals, recruit and train veterinary professionals for emergency response, assist in emergency planning for animal rescue, and coordinate with other government and healthcare professionals. Veterinary professionals also aid in agriculture emergencies. Veterinary professionals play a crucial role in emergency support, addressing wildlife health impacts, ensuring food safety, and providing care to working animals. While the Stafford Act does not specifically mention veterinary services, it authorizes essential assistance for individuals with household pets and service animals, which could include veterinary services. State and local recipients of emergency preparedness planning grants are required to address the needs of individuals with household pets. The federal department coordinates veterinary support in emergencies, focusing on public health or animal health. The National Disaster Medical System provides health services during public health emergencies and currently supports veterinary response teams. The Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service also plays a role in emergency response. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) responds to animal health emergencies. DRRA Section 1229 extends Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) for up to 26 weeks after a major disaster declaration, providing benefits to those who are typically ineligible for Unemployment Compensation (UC). The Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) benefits have been extended up to 52 weeks for individuals in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands affected by Hurricane Irma or Hurricane Maria. Those who exhausted Unemployment Compensation (UC) may be eligible for DUA benefits for any remaining weeks. DRRA Section 1226 mandates an audit of FEMA contracts for disaster relief supplies. The DHS IG is required to audit FEMA contracts for tarps and plastic sheeting in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The audit will review FEMA's contracting process, assessment of contractor performance, capacity, contract compliance, and impact of contract failures on supply provision. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to relevant committees within 270 days. FEMA exhausted pre-negotiated contracts during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma response operations, leading to new contracts being awarded for tarps in response to Hurricane Maria. Despite cancelling three contracts, including those for tarps and plastic sheeting, FEMA stated that it did not hinder their mission. However, issues with the contracts did delay the delivery of plastic tarps to Puerto Rico. The DHS IG audit requirement in the DRRA may have stemmed from concerns about FEMA's management of contracts for tarps and plastic sheeting during the 2017 hurricane season. A Senate HSGAC report highlighted deficiencies in FEMA's contracting process, such as not effectively using prepositioned contracts, awarding contracts without proper vetting, and facing delivery failures from contractors. The Senate HSGAC report identified issues with FEMA's contracting process for tarps and plastic sheeting during the 2017 hurricane season. Contracts were cancelled due to delivery failures, lack of competition, and logistical challenges. The report highlighted delays in delivering 1.1 million tarps and 60 thousand rolls of plastic sheeting, as well as issues with other contracted companies struggling to meet delivery timeframes. FEMA also faced challenges with commodity delivery, truck and driver shortages, and contractor shortages. Senator Mike Enzi raised concerns about these issues. Following Hurricane Katrina and the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, FEMA aimed to improve its contracting process. However, a 2015 GAO report found deficiencies in FEMA's contracting guidance. In 2017, the GAO recommended that FEMA update its strategy for advance contracting to define objectives and prioritize contracts for post-disaster awards. Senator Mike Enzi also criticized FEMA for not properly vetting companies receiving contracts, potentially wasting taxpayer dollars and denying services to citizens in need. The GAO recommended updating FEMA's strategy for advance contracting to prioritize contracts for post-disaster awards. In May 2019, the DHS IG reported that FEMA should not have awarded contracts to Bronze Star LLC for tarps and plastic sheeting, as they were cancelled due to nondelivery. The DHS IG's report found that FEMA awarded contracts to Bronze Star LLC that were later cancelled due to nondelivery. Recommendations include updating FEMA's contracting strategy and providing guidance on advance contracting. DRRA Section 1226 may require changes to FEMA's policies and procedures. The implementation of DRRA includes over 50 provisions that require FEMA policy changes, giving FEMA discretion in implementation. Congress may oversee the process to ensure it aligns with their intent. FEMA's response to DRRA requirements and recommendations remains unclear. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 includes standalone authorities and requires reports to Congress, rulemaking, and other actions to support disaster preparedness and increase transparency with FEMA. Three tables outline deadlines for reporting, rulemaking/regulations, and other required actions under DRRA. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 includes various requirements and deadlines for implementation actions. Some sections may have multiple actions and requirements, with due dates specified as calendar deadlines. Certain sections may have ongoing requirements with deadlines listed as \"ongoing\" or \"N/A.\" Acronyms used in the tables are defined in the associated notes sections. Note that the information in the tables may be subject to change and may not be up-to-date. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 includes provisions from various bills aimed at reforming FEMA. Some bills incorporated into DRRA include H.R. 4460, S. 3041, and H.R. 3176, with modifications. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, incorporating provisions from various bills, amended the Stafford Act to limit the statute of limitations for actions to recover disaster assistance payments. Additionally, it included provisions for FEMA to provide technical assistance to common interest communities and guidance on eligibility for reimbursement. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, incorporating provisions from various bills, included measures for property acquisition for open space, giving weight to severe local impact for disaster declarations, using mitigation assistance for earthquake hazards, and promoting resiliency targets through the SMART Rebuilding Act. The SMART Rebuilding Act (H.R. 4455) established the National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation Fund as a separate account, allowing the President to contribute up to 75% of the cost of cost-effective hazard mitigation measures. This differs from the DRRA Section 1234, which allows for a set-aside from the Disaster Relief Fund. Additionally, the SMART Rebuilding Act includes provisions for additional mitigation activities."
