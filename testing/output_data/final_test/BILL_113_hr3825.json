    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freight Infrastructure Reinvestment Act of 2013\" and includes a National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program to provide grants for projects improving efficiency and capacity in freight mobility. States and designated entities must submit grant applications meeting specified criteria for selection. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program will provide grants for projects of national or regional significance, including grade separations, railroad bypasses, and tunnel expansions to accommodate increased vehicular and rail volumes. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program aims to enhance transportation infrastructure by adding railroad tracks, intermodal facilities, and improving highways and roads at international gateways, ports, and logistic centers to facilitate the flow of freight traffic. This includes constructing and improving rail and highway bridges to support heavy weight vehicles and traffic volume. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program focuses on enhancing transportation infrastructure by constructing and improving rail and highway bridges, ramps, and lanes to improve freight mobility, capacity, and efficiency in the United States. This is cost-effective and based on preliminary engineering results, justified by its economic development impact at the state, regional, or national level. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program aims to enhance transportation infrastructure by creating new businesses and jobs, increasing State and local tax receipts, and improving safety through reductions in accidents. It also seeks to maximize economic opportunities for communities and requires non-Federal financial commitments to support the project. The project must have contingency amounts for unanticipated cost increases and stable non-Federal financing sources. The Secretary considers project requirements, alignment with freight plans, and facilitation of higher volume freight throughput. The program facilitates freight throughput of higher volume and values, uses operational efficiencies like intelligent transportation systems, helps maintain or protect the environment, and improves segments of the primary freight network. The Secretary must notify Congress at least 90 days before making a grant, and funding comes from the National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Fund. The Mobility Infrastructure Fund, established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, limits grant distribution to 10% per state. Full Funding Grant Agreements can span multiple fiscal years and establish maximum federal assistance for projects. The Federal Government provides grants for projects with a maximum 80% Federal share of the cost. The Secretary considers existing financial commitments and the dedication of financing sources when assessing non-Federal financial commitments. The Secretary ensures that grants for projects have a non-Federal financial commitment exceeding the required share of the project cost. Grants for highway construction must adhere to title 23, United States Code. All grants are subject to terms and conditions determined necessary by the Secretary, including requirements for the disposition of property value increases from the project. The Secretary aims to minimize administrative costs for the program, submit annual reports to specific committees, issue regulations within 180 days, and define \"designated entity\" as per the program requirements. The term \"designated entity\" refers to an entity eligible for funding under the program, including a state-designated entity, regional authority, or public port. Eligible costs cover project development and construction activities. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program covers construction, acquisition of real property, environmental mitigation, equipment acquisition, and operational improvements. The program is defined as the National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program, and a State is defined as per section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Improvement Program includes construction, property acquisition, environmental mitigation, equipment acquisition, and operational improvements. A new subchapter is added to the Internal Revenue Code imposing a tax for transportation by freight and highway. A tax of 1 percent is imposed on taxable ground transportation of property within the United States. The tax is paid by the person making the payment subject to tax, or in the case of transportation by a related person, by the person for whom such transportation is made. If a payment subject to tax is made outside the United States and the tax is not paid, it shall be paid by the person to whom the property is delivered in the United States. The tax of 1 percent is imposed on taxable ground transportation of property within the United States. The tax is paid by the person making the payment subject to tax, or by the person for whom such transportation is made in the case of transportation by a related person. If a payment subject to tax is made outside the United States and the tax is not paid, it shall be paid by the person to whom the property is delivered in the United States after the final segment of transportation in the United States. Rules similar to section 4271(c) apply for determining amounts paid in certain cases. Fair market value of transportation by related persons is determined on an arms' length basis. The term 'taxable ground transportation' refers to transporting property by freight rail or commercial motor vehicle for over 50 miles, excluding passenger baggage. A 'related person' is defined as someone with a specified relationship to another person according to certain sections of the law. The tax imposed on taxable ground transportation does not apply to transportation of property purchased for exclusive use. Amounts equivalent to tax are transferred to the National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Fund. The tax does not apply to transportation of property purchased for exclusive use. Section 6415 of the Code is amended to include taxes collected under sections 4271, 4286. The Secretary of the Treasury must issue regulations within 180 days of the enactment. The amendments apply to transportation starting after the 180-day period from the regulation issuance date. SEC. 4. NATIONAL FREIGHT MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FUND. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Fund. The National Freight Mobility Infrastructure Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States, funded by taxes under section 4286. The Secretary of Transportation can use the Fund for expenditures related to the Freight Infrastructure Reinvestment Act of 2013 from 2014 to 2039 without further appropriation. Administrative expenses are limited to 4 percent per fiscal year."
