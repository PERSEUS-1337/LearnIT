    "content": "The U.S. Congress is exploring ways to stimulate technological innovation in response to competition from foreign firms. Technological advancement is crucial for economic growth, creating new industries, jobs, and improving efficiency. Technology also influences international trade patterns and joint ventures aim to promote technological progress in the industrial sector. Cooperative ventures in technology development involve academia, industry, and government working together to generate new goods, processes, and services for the marketplace. These projects aim to utilize the strengths of each sector and share costs, risks, facilities, and expertise. Various institutional and legal arrangements are used in collaborative industry-university efforts. Cooperative ventures in technology development involve academia, industry, and government collaborating on research projects, funding, and personnel exchanges. Different types of cooperative arrangements allow for tailored institutional and organizational plans to address specific project needs, with issues such as patent ownership and antitrust resolved based on established legal guidelines. Collaborative ventures in technology development can be structured horizontally or vertically, with companies working together to perform research and use the results within their organizations. Government funding for research and development typically focuses on basic research to address obstacles to American firms' competitiveness in the marketplace. Research and development (R&D) is crucial for breakthrough achievements in the marketplace, with societal benefits often outweighing individual company gains. Federal funding supports collaborative research in the industrial community, encouraging cooperative arrangements to facilitate costly and boundary-crossing R&D projects. Joint ventures leverage existing resources and foster new knowledge and facilities. The venture utilizes existing resources and supports the development of new knowledge and skills. Policy decisions used to focus on increased research for technological advancement based on the \"pipeline model\" of innovation, but this model is now considered invalid. Innovation is not a linear process, with most advancements being incremental improvements to existing products and processes. In some fields like biotechnology, research is closer to a commercial product than previously thought. In biotechnology, the commercialization of research is crucial for economic benefits. Foreign companies have been faster at commercializing U.S. funded research. Speed to market is essential for competitiveness. Cooperative efforts are being made to expedite the commercialization of American R&D results. Industry-university cooperation in R&D is a key mechanism for technological innovation. Universities conduct basic research essential for technological advancements, as they are not driven by profit motives like industry. They also play a role in educating scientists, engineers, and managers for companies. However, universities lack the commercialization capacity of industry needed to turn research results into products. After World War II, the federal government became the main funder of university research, leading to a disconnect between academia and industry in terms of commercialization. This shift impacted the translation of research into marketable products and processes. Efforts to promote collaboration between academia and industry can enhance technological advancement. Company support for university research provides additional funds and industry insights. However, collaborative ventures may fail due to conflicting goals and financial disagreements. The federal government can share facilities, expertise, and new technologies with partners in cooperative ventures. Government laboratories have scientists, engineers, and equipment for technology development. Collaboration with industry provides valuable information for government R&D. Private sector is more advanced in certain technologies crucial for national defense and welfare. The concept of cooperative ventures in R&D has a long history, with various organizations like the National Science Foundation and the Electric Power Research Institute established in the 1970s. Private sector entities like the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation and the Semiconductor Research Corporation were created in the 1980s. Today, there is a focus on promoting cooperative ventures through legislative activity to address national needs and economic growth. The government has been stimulating innovation and technological advancement in industry by removing barriers to technology development in the private sector. The National Cooperative Research Act was passed in 1984 to encourage joint research efforts among companies, clarifying antitrust laws and promoting cooperative R&D ventures. The National Cooperative Research Act, passed in 1984, clarified antitrust laws and promoted cooperative R&D ventures. It eliminated treble damage awards for violations if prior disclosure was made and made changes to attorney fees to discourage frivolous litigation. The Act was extended to joint manufacturing ventures in 1993. The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 clarified antitrust laws and promoted cooperative R&D ventures. In 1993, provisions were extended to joint manufacturing ventures in the United States or its territories, with specific requirements for participants. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology, created by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, facilitated collaborative work until it was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program in FY2008. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) replaced the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) in FY2008, with reduced funding in FY2011 and no support in FY2012. TIP funded 824 projects with $1.6 billion in federal financing matched by $1.5 billion from the private sector, encouraging joint ventures. Funding under TIP was limited to small and medium-sized businesses, unlike ATP which was available to companies of all sizes. Under ATP, companies of all sizes could receive funding, while joint ventures had to include two separately owned for-profit firms. In contrast, TIP limited funding to small and medium-sized businesses, with joint ventures allowed between two for-profit companies or a small/medium-sized firm and a university. ATP provided up to $2 million for a single company over three years, while TIP offered up to $3 million for the participating small/medium-sized business over the same period. Cost-sharing was not required for small/medium-sized companies under ATP, but there was a 50% cost-sharing requirement for TIP. The Advisory Board for the Advanced Technology Program included industry and government representatives, while the Technology Innovation Program's board consisted of private sector members. In January 2009, nine awards were given for new research projects developing advanced sensing technologies for monitoring infrastructure. $42.5 million in federal funds were expected to be matched by $45.7 million in private funding. In December 2009 and 2010, additional awards totaling almost $71.0 million in NIST financing and $145.7 million in funding from other sources were announced for various projects in monitoring and inspection of civil infrastructure, advanced repair, process scale up for advanced materials, predictive modeling, biopharmaceuticals, electronics, nanotechnology, renewable energy, and energy sources. Federal funding was expected to be matched by private sector support. Title II of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 provided a temporary 25% tax credit for company payments to universities for basic research. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the credit to 20% of corporate expenditures for basic research. Additionally, the 1981 Act increased charitable deductions for donations of new equipment to higher education institutions for research in the United States. The research tax credit in the United States, which expired in 2011, provided a tax deduction for manufacturer's costs and fostered interaction between academia and the business community through the Bayh-Dole Act. The Bayh-Dole Act encourages universities to commercialize patents, leading to increased patent applications and licensing. Federal departments support industry-university programs to facilitate technological advancement. Efforts to support cooperative ventures in specific industries, driven by national defense and economic security concerns, have led to initiatives like SEMATECH and the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences. These joint ventures, funded by the Department of Defense and other agencies, aim to advance technology through collaborations between federal laboratories and private firms. The federal government promotes joint R&D between federal laboratories and private firms to enhance industrial competitiveness and commercialization. Approximately $138.9 billion was allocated in FY2012 for research and development, leading to the creation of technologies and knowledge with potential applications beyond their original purpose. Various laws and acts, such as the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act and the Federal Technology Transfer Act, have been established to facilitate the transfer of ideas and technologies between the public and private sectors. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act, along with the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act, amended existing laws to promote technology transfer from federal government to private sector through various means like CRADAs and easier patent practices. The CREATE Act amended patent laws to facilitate licensing of government-held inventions to the private sector. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act established regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology to transfer knowledge and technologies to the private sector. The Competitiveness Act and the FY1991 National Defense Authorization Act encouraged government-industry collaboration to improve private sector access to federal technology. The Small Business Technology Transfer program promotes cooperative work between small companies and federal laboratories for commercializing new technology. The Small Business Technology Transfer program, initially set to end in FY2009, has been extended multiple times and is now scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2017. Federal support for cooperative ventures may not indicate a long-term commitment to technology development due to budget concerns. However, utilizing the government's R&D system can provide academia and industry with resources beyond their financial means. Despite budget constraints, federal funds and non-monetary contributions can be leveraged for cooperative ventures. State and local agencies, along with the private sector, contribute funds and resources to cooperative ventures focused on innovation and technology in economic development. These efforts aim to support high-tech businesses, establish new companies, and modernize traditional industries. The use of new technologies and processes in traditional industries is supported by industry-university-government cooperation. Congressional proposals aim to increase cooperative ventures, with expanding federal support. Questions may arise regarding whether cooperative ventures are meeting expectations, as more industries seek federal assistance for cooperative R&D activities. Despite some opposition, government sectors are providing funding for cooperative ventures in specific industries. Government funding for cooperative ventures in specific industries requires private sector matching funds. Programs aim to facilitate cooperation across industries. Decisions need to be made on the effectiveness of different approaches and the selection of industries for funding. Questions remain on the best models for cooperative ventures and their implications for policymaking in Congress. Innovation is a dynamic process involving idea origination, research, development, commercialization, and diffusion. It is not always linear and can result in incremental changes to existing goods and services. The availability and use of technology in the marketplace are crucial factors. Commercialization and diffusion have been challenges for U.S. industries compared to countries like Japan, China, India, and East Asian newly industrializing countries. The United States excels in basic research and science, but market leadership depends on technology development and application for consumer goods. Simply encouraging cooperative research may not enhance competitiveness without efforts to commercialize technologies effectively. The competitiveness of American industry can be increased through the effective application of research from joint ventures in manufacturing and services. Government incentives may be needed to encourage companies to invest in commercialization in addition to research, especially in the manufacturing sector where American companies are vulnerable to foreign competition. Process technologies in manufacturing can significantly reduce production costs. The President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness emphasized the importance of mastering advanced manufacturing processes for competitive success. Small manufacturing companies face high costs for new equipment, but federal cooperative efforts like the Manufacturing Technology program and Manufacturing Extension Centers aim to address these concerns. Government activities like the Manufacturing Extension Centers aim to facilitate the development of new manufacturing techniques. Joint ventures and cooperative efforts could help improve the manufacturing capability of U.S. firms. The effectiveness of existing cooperative programs in increasing the competitiveness of American industry is questioned, leading to discussions on expanding or developing new efforts in different departments. The need for a lead government agency in policy determinations is also considered. The question of which federal department should be responsible for cooperative ventures with federal financial support remains. Industries have approached the Department of Defense and Department of Energy's Defense Programs due to their resources and expertise in operating large-scale programs. However, concerns exist about whether sponsorship by these departments will lead to increased commercialization in the civilian marketplace. Critics argue that defense spending may not effectively boost industry innovation for civilian markets. Research in defense tends to be too specialized and costly for commercial use, focusing on weapon systems rather than manufacturing productivity. The U.S. military R&D commitment has helped the defense and aerospace industries' trade balance. DOD support in SEMATECH aimed to develop technologies with defense applications for commercial use. SEMATECH, a semiconductor consortium initially funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, now operates independently to develop new products for both defense and commercial markets. Cooperative efforts between the Defense Department and private sector have led to advancements in commercial technologies through projects like the Technology Reinvestment Project and the Dual-Use Partnership Project. The Department of Energy has also increased collaborative R&D activities with industry, including defense program laboratories. The Department of Energy is increasing collaborative efforts with industry, despite decreased technology transfer budgets. Foreign companies are rapidly utilizing research results from the United States and their own countries to produce high-quality commercial goods. Many are acquiring American businesses or establishing U.S. subsidiaries for access to American expertise. The speed of utilizing scientific knowledge for product development is crucial for competitiveness. With federal support, questions arise about barring foreign companies from accessing research results. Defining an \"American company\" based on ownership, location, or value added is a key issue. Cooperative activities between American and foreign firms may lead to information outflow. Government efforts include indirect supports like tax policies and direct funding for joint ventures. The government has supported joint efforts like the Advanced Technology Program and the Technology Innovation Program. Recent budget decisions have led to reductions in federal financing for public-private partnerships. The future approach by Congress remains uncertain. The Congress is deciding on budget allocations for cooperative R&D, with uncertainty about the future approach."
