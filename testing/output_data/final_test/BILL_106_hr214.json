    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"District of Columbia Democracy 2000 Act\". Congress finds that the District of Columbia government has struggled with accountability issues, leading to the establishment of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. Despite initial concerns, the District has performed better than expected under the Authority's oversight, highlighting the need for clear lines of reporting authority between the Mayor, the Council, and the Authority. The Authority statute mandates efficient delivery of services and accountability. Under Mayor Anthony Williams, day-to-day operations of city agencies are delegated for clear accountability. The Congress supports giving the Mayor full authority over city agencies for clear accountability. The transition of authority to the new administration will not affect the Authority's power. Congressional intent is for full home rule by the District government once stability is achieved, expected after 4 years of balanced budgets. The District has exceeded expectations with 3 years of balanced budgets and surpluses. The Authority is an emergency body. The Authority is an emergency body that should not outlast the emergency at the expense of democratic self-government. Full self-government should be restored to the District one year earlier than planned, in the year 2000. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 are repealed, restoring management authority to the Mayor of the District of Columbia. Additionally, activities of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority are suspended. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 is amended to reduce the number of members on the board. Conforming amendments are made to other sections of the Act. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 is amended to reduce the number of board members. The amendments also include changes to other sections of the Act, with an effective date retroactively applied."
