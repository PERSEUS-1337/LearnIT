    "content": "SECTION 1. SALT CEDAR CONTROL. Congress finds that States are struggling to meet water delivery obligations under interstate compacts, facing invasive species like salt cedar in the Southwest that consume large amounts of water, and innovative solutions are needed to address water shortages due to drought and legal requirements. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a program to research control methods for nonnative phreatophytes like salt cedar, including herbicides, mechanical means, and biocontrols. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a program to research control methods for nonnative phreatophytes like salt cedar in various bodies of water in the southwestern United States, utilizing expertise from institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations. Institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations actively conducting research on salt cedar control in specified states include Colorado State University, Dine College, Mesa State College, New Mexico State University, Northern Arizona University, Texas A&M University, and University of Arizona. The research and demonstration program under subsection (c) will be carried out at full Federal expense and in consultation with various entities including the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, Governors of specific states, tribal governments, and other relevant agencies. The research will focus on supplementing and integrating information from past studies. The research and demonstration program will focus on integrating information from past studies, carrying out demonstration projects to control salt cedar and other nonnative phreatophytes, producing water savings, and identifying long-term management approaches. The Secretary will conduct at least 10 demonstration projects in consultation with relevant entities. Each demonstration project in the research program will cost up to $7,000,000 and last 2-5 years to determine the optimal control method. Projects will be coordinated with existing control efforts and conducted in select States. Each demonstration project in the research program will cost up to $7,000,000 and last 2-5 years to determine the optimal control method. Projects will use various control methods such as herbicides, mechanical means, biocontrol (e.g., goats or insects), and others to measure costs and benefits. The demonstration projects in the research program will use different control methods to measure costs and benefits, including water savings. Each project will be monitored and maintained for up to 5 years at a cost of $100,000 per year. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for fiscal years 2004 through 2007."
