The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended China as a \"country of particular concern\" due to widespread and violent crackdowns on the group. The State Department designated China as a CPC for the sixth consecutive year in 2005, citing continued arrests, detentions, and harsh treatment of Falun Gong practitioners. The Chinese government has detained thousands of Falun Gong adherents since July 1999, leading to international human rights concerns. Despite efforts to suppress FLG activity, followers have shown tenacity and dedication. The PRC government has discredited Falun Gong and prevented linkages with other social protest movements. FLG has become an irritant in China's image as a peaceful world power and raised suspicions of collusion with the U.S. government. Falun Gong practitioners in the United States are vocal in criticizing the Chinese government and raising awareness about human rights abuses. The practice combines exercise, meditation, moral values, and spiritual beliefs derived from qigong, Buddhist, and Daoist concepts. Falun Gong promotes truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance as core virtues. Falun Gong practitioners believe in truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance, aiming to achieve physical well-being, emotional tranquility, and moral virtue through cultivation. Critics view Falun Gong as cult-like, citing its founder's unquestioned support, departure from orthodox Buddhism and Daoism, and emphasis on supernatural powers. The Chinese government accuses Falun Gong of disrupting social order and causing deaths by discouraging medical treatment. Falun Gong gained a large following in the mid-1990s, with estimates of 3 to 70 million members worldwide. The practice attracted people from various backgrounds in China, offering healing powers that became appealing as medical benefits decreased due to economic reforms. Falun Gong is not a religion and followers believe in voluntary practice with varying levels of faith and involvement. The crackdown on Falun Gong in 1999 led to many citizens losing medical benefits and services. The group was embraced by CCP and government officials, with one-third of known members belonging to the CCP. Falun Gong's organization was described as loose but effective, with an underground network continuing after the ban. Falun Gong, a spiritual practice developed by Li Hongzhi in the late 1980s, gained popularity in China. Li, who now lives outside New York City, remains in seclusion but occasionally appears at gatherings. Reports suggest he directs his followers from behind the scenes. In 1999, thousands of practitioners gathered in protest. In April 1999, thousands of Falun Gong practitioners protested in Beijing against government restrictions. Premier Zhu Rongji assured them they wouldn't be punished, but President Jiang Zemin ordered a crackdown due to concerns about U.S. involvement. Party leaders were divided on banning Falun Gong, with circulars later forbidding Party members from practicing. The government crackdown on Falun Gong began in July 1999, with circulars forbidding Party members from practicing and an arrest warrant issued for Li Hongzhi. An \"anti-cult\" law was passed in October 1999 to suppress the movement and other religious sects. Police stated they would not interfere with individuals practicing alone in their homes. In Beijing, public security officers closed 67 teaching stations and 1,627 practice sites related to Falun Gong. Over 30,000 followers were detained and questioned nationwide, with most released after promising to quit or identifying group organizers. Cult leaders and recruiters could face 7 or more years in prison, while disruptive members could be sentenced to 3 to 7 years. Between 150 and 450 leaders and members were tried and sentenced to up to 18-20 years in prison. Estimates suggest 10,000 to 100,000 individuals have been detained or sent to \"labor reeducation\" since 1999. Since 1999, hundreds to a few thousand FLG adherents have died in custody from torture, abuse, and neglect. The PRC government took over two years to subdue the Falun Gong organization using social control methods deeply rooted in Chinese history. Incremental improvements in China's rule of law have not protected the constitutional rights of FLG followers. The central government combined propaganda campaigns with internal party directives to suppress the group. The Chinese government's crackdown on Falun Gong involved attempts to persuade members to stop practicing or protesting, but many continued to demonstrate in Beijing. The government used threats and incentives to prevent public displays of Falun Gong, leading to local suppression tactics against practitioners. The Chinese government has been cracking down on Falun Gong, resorting to local suppression tactics and reported use of torture. Despite little recent FLG activity, hundreds of thousands of practitioners still exist in China, with many practicing in secret. Estimates suggest 60,000 FLG practitioners remain, with half in detention and the other half under surveillance. Between 15,000 and 25,000 political or religious prisoners in China are linked to the Falun Gong movement. Adherents in China continue to disseminate information about the practice. Between 2002 and 2005, Falun Gong members disrupted programming in Chinese cities, broadcasting their own images. PRC courts sentenced 27 practitioners to prison terms for these activities. In 2005, satellite broadcasts were interrupted by a 15-minute FLG video. U.S. citizen Charles Li was sentenced to three years in prison for \"intending to sabotage\" Chinese television broadcasts. Li reported physical and mental abuse in prison. U.S. Falun Gong representatives claimed thousands of practitioners were sent to 36 concentration camps in March 2006. Falun Gong representatives claimed that thousands of practitioners were sent to 36 concentration camps in the PRC, particularly in the northeast, where many were killed for profit through organ harvesting. The Epoch Times reported on allegations about a camp in Sujiatun, Liaoning province, where 6,000 adherents were detained, with three-fourths allegedly having their organs removed. American officials visited the area and hospital site on two occasions. Shenyang visited the hospital site twice, finding no evidence of organ harvesting. Amnesty International cannot confirm claims of systematic organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners. Chinese officials admitted to using organs from executed prisoners for transplants but denied non-consensual removal. Stricter regulations were announced in 2006 to require written consent for organ donation and ban the sale of human organs. On July 6, 2006, Canadian investigators published a report confirming allegations of live organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China. The report relied on logical inferences and was conducted in response to a request by a U.S.-based organization. The Kilgour-Matas report, published by the Falun Dafa Association in April 2006, includes recordings of telephone conversations indicating organ harvesting of live Falun Gong detainees in China. While some of the report's claims are accepted by human rights experts, key allegations are disputed due to inconsistencies with other investigations. The report heavily relies on transcripts of phone calls with Chinese respondents admitting to using organs from Falun Gong detainees for transplants, raising doubts about the credibility of the information provided. Some argue that the credibility of telephone recordings indicating organ harvesting of live Falun Gong detainees in China is questionable due to Chinese government controls over sensitive information. In Hong Kong, Falun Gong is permitted, and members frequently protest against PRC policies. Courts in Hong Kong have overturned convictions of Falun Gong members for demonstrating and assaulting police, citing the right to peaceful demonstration protected by law. The HKSAR government has occasionally denied entry to foreign Falun Gong adherents. In February 2006, the HKSAR government barred entry to 83 overseas Falun Gong practitioners, mostly from Taiwan, prior to a conference organized by the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa. The movement has a significant presence in the United States and other countries with large ethnic Chinese populations, where members stage demonstrations, distribute flyers, and sponsor cultural events. FLG followers are also affiliated with mass media outlets, including The Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty Television. Several media outlets, such as New Tang Dynasty Television and Sound of Hope, report on human rights abuses in China, particularly against Falun Gong members. U.S. Internet companies like Dynaweb Internet Technology Inc. and UltraReach Internet Corporation have developed software to help Chinese Web users bypass government censorship. The United States Broadcasting Board of Governors has provided funding to these efforts. The United States Broadcasting Board of Governors funds companies like Dynaweb Internet Technology Inc. and UltraReach Internet Corporation to help Chinese Web users access the Internet freely. Falun Gong adherents in the U.S. have filed civil complaints against PRC leaders for human rights violations. Lawsuits against former PRC President Jiang Zemin and Beijing Party Secretary Liu Qi have been dismissed or ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in U.S. federal courts. PRC officials in the United States have engaged in a public relations campaign to counter Falun Gong efforts, pressuring U.S. mayors and officials not to support the movement. Falun Gong practitioners claim PRC consulates sent letters to discourage support. Lawsuits have been filed alleging harassment and interference by PRC officials in the U.S. since 2001. Dozens of incidents of harassment, eavesdropping, and property destruction against Falun Gong adherents in the US have occurred, with little evidence of direct Chinese government involvement. PRC consular officials deny involvement, citing diplomatic immunity. In 2002, a PRC immigrant was charged with battery for assaulting a Falun Gong hunger striker in Chicago. In 2005, Falun Gong members reported a global campaign of telephone harassment, with messages originating from China. In May 2005, Chen Yongli, a political officer at the PRC Consulate General in Sydney, defected and sought asylum, claiming persecution if returned to China. Chen revealed Beijing's directive to target and harass Australian Chinese community members deemed subversive by the PRC, such as democracy activists and Falun Gong practitioners. He resisted orders to provide detailed information on Falun Gong adherents in Australia, alleging the deployment of 1,000 agents and spies to discredit Falun Gong and spy on its members. The Chinese government deployed spies in Australia to discredit Falun Gong and spy on its members. Falun Gong was considered a serious threat to stability by the Chinese government. The crackdown on Falun Gong deepened anti-government sentiment among adherents and non-adherents. There is little indication that Falun Gong has become a rallying cry for other social groups or political activists in China. Many Chinese have become critical or apathetic towards Falun Gong due to government propaganda or indifference. Some accuse Li Hongzhi of exploiting followers and exaggerating healing powers. The 2001 self-immolations on Tiananmen Square further alienated PRC citizens. US Congress members have shown support for Falun Gong, condemning religious persecution in China. The House passed resolutions condemning religious persecution in China, specifically targeting the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The US Department of State has designated China as a country of particular concern for severe violations of religious freedom, including the persecution of Falun Gong. In April 2006, 81 Members of Congress co-signed a letter supporting an investigation into allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong adherents in China."
