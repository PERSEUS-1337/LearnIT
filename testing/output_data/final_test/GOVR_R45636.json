    "content": "The federal courts have been crucial in resolving legal disputes, including those involving executive actions. Congress and its Members often engage in litigation in federal court to uphold their institutional priorities, challenge the Executive's decisions, or advance their legislative interests. For example, during the Obama Administration, legislative entities brought or joined lawsuits to contest the Executive's spending without congressional approval, defend laws like the Defense of Marriage Act, and challenge executive actions. Congressional involvement in federal court litigation has been significant, with challenges to executive actions and decisions. This includes challenges to military action in Libya and lawsuits against the Trump Administration for alleged unconstitutional actions. With the current divided government, congressional interest in litigation may continue to grow, as seen in resolutions authorizing participation in ongoing lawsuits and challenges to presidential appointments. However, parties must demonstrate that their disputes belong in federal court before invoking its power. The federal courts require parties to demonstrate standing before their disputes can be heard. The standing doctrine ensures that courts do not overstep their bounds and decide issues reserved for other branches of government. This report provides an overview of standing as it applies to lawsuits involving legislators, committees, and houses of Congress. The report discusses the standing doctrine in federal courts, focusing on its role in protecting the court's constitutional balance of powers. It also examines Supreme Court cases on legislator standing and how lower courts have interpreted this issue. Additionally, it considers cases involving individual legislators and entire institutions participating in litigation. The report discusses legislator participation in litigation, including intervention and amicus curiae roles. It addresses unresolved doctrinal questions and offers insights for potential congressional litigants regarding the limitations imposed by Article III of the Constitution on federal courts' judicial power. The standing doctrine in federal courts is crucial for parties seeking judicial relief, requiring a personal stake in the outcome to invoke federal-court jurisdiction. The standing doctrine in federal courts requires a party to demonstrate a genuine stake in the relief sought by showing a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact that is traceable to the opposing party's actions and redressable by a favorable judicial decision. This requirement is considered the central focus of the inquiry for standing. A party seeking standing must show a \"concrete\" injury that is real, not abstract, and can be intangible, such as the deprivation of a constitutional right. The Court has provided guidance on distinguishing between intangible and abstract injuries, including looking at traditional bases for lawsuits. Congress can also define intangible injuries. The Court has emphasized the need for a \"concrete\" injury to establish standing, rejecting abstract injuries like psychological discomfort. Congress can define intangible harms that meet Article III requirements and create new causes of action to address them. Injury must be real, not abstract, and particularized to support standing. The requirement for alleged injury to be \"particularized\" focuses on affecting the plaintiff in a personal and individual way, barring redress for generalized grievances. Plaintiffs must connect to the injury alleged in a particular way, even if widely shared, to establish standing. The Court concluded that the deprivation of a statutory right granting access to information \"directly related to voting\" was sufficiently \"specific\" to allow Congress to authorize individuals to vindicate that right, despite the requirement for alleged injury to be \"particularized.\" The Court ruled that proponents of an initiative could not claim to be acting on behalf of the State of California due to lack of control or authority, requiring concrete and particularized injury for standing in cases involving government action. This is crucial for preserving the separation of powers. The standing doctrine is essential for preserving the separation of powers, as it determines which disputes are appropriately resolved in the judicial process. The Supreme Court recognizes that separation of powers is the driving force behind the standing doctrine, ensuring that activities are appropriately assigned to legislatures, executives, and courts. The standing doctrine ensures courts do not exceed their role, preventing disputes better suited for the political process. It is especially rigorous in cases involving government action's constitutionality, focusing on separation of powers, particularly when a branch of government is the plaintiff. The Supreme Court has decided few cases on legislative standing, with principles applying when a legislative entity is the plaintiff. In the 1939 case Coleman v. Miller, Kansas legislators challenged the ratification of the Child Labor Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In the 1939 case Coleman v. Miller, Kansas legislators challenged the ratification of the Child Labor Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs argued that the lieutenant governor's vote was invalid, and they sued to annul the ratification. The Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff legislators had standing to bring the case. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote the opinion for the Court, stating that the petitioners had an \"adequate interest to invoke [the Court's] jurisdiction.\" In the case of Coleman v. Miller, Kansas legislators challenged the ratification of the Child Labor Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled that the legislators had standing to bring the case, despite dissent from Justices Butler and McReynolds. Justice Frankfurter argued that intra-parliamentary disputes should be left to parliaments to avoid judicial interference. In Coleman v. Miller, Kansas legislators challenged the ratification of the Child Labor Amendment, with Justice Frankfurter arguing against judicial interference in intra-parliamentary disputes. The Supreme Court acknowledged legislators' interest in their votes as a potential injury that could be addressed in federal court, setting a precedent for cases like Powell v. McCormack 30 years later. Powell sued the Speaker of the House, seeking a judgment that his exclusion was unconstitutional and an injunction to be seated in the House. The Supreme Court found his case justiciable, stating that legislators have a pecuniary interest in their salary. In Raines v. Byrd (1997), legislators with a personal pecuniary interest in their salary challenged the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, allowing the President to cancel spending measures. Senator Robert Byrd and others sued, claiming the act violated the Constitution. Senator Robert Byrd and other legislators sued under the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, alleging it was unconstitutional. Byrd claimed the act injured him in his official capacity by altering the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branches. The Supreme Court ruled that Byrd and the legislators lacked standing to bring their claims. Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized the importance of the standing doctrine in keeping the Judiciary's power in check and questioned whether the plaintiffs had a personal, concrete interest to justify court involvement. Unlike in Powell, Senator Byrd did not claim a personal entitlement but argued that the statute shifted power from Congress to the President, leading to an \"institutional injury\" shared by all legislators. The Court found that such abstract injuries could not establish standing. The Court found that Senator Byrd's claims of institutional injury did not meet the standing requirement as they were deemed \"wholly abstract and widely dispersed.\" Unlike in a previous case, where legislators had standing due to their votes being nullified by illegal actions, Senator Byrd simply lost a vote without any illegal interference. The Court in Raines limited individual legislators' ability to sue on behalf of their institutions, stating that they could repeal the Line Item Veto Act instead. The decision reaffirmed the possibility of asserting institutional injury but emphasized that Congress did not authorize the plaintiffs to bring the suit. The plaintiffs in the Line Item Veto Act case sued on their own behalf, not on behalf of their respective houses of Congress. This distinction was crucial in the Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission case, where the Arizona state legislature challenged the Commission's redistricting map for the 2012 elections as unconstitutional. The legislature argued that only the \"Legislature\" of a state had the authority to set election procedures. The Arizona State Legislature challenged the Commission's redistricting map for the 2012 elections as unconstitutional, arguing that only the \"Legislature\" had the authority to set election procedures. The Court found that the Arizona legislature had standing as an institutional plaintiff with a personal stake in the suit, unlike the individual Members in a previous case. The Commission's authority nullified any vote by the legislature on redistricting, causing institutional injury. The Supreme Court ruled that the Arizona State Legislature had standing to challenge the Commission's redistricting map for the 2012 elections, citing institutional injury caused by nullifying the legislature's vote on redistricting. The Court distinguished between institutional and personal injury, highlighting the impact on all members of Congress equally. The Arizona State Legislature court ruled that individual legislators generally cannot assert institutional injuries, except in cases like Coleman v. Miller where their votes were nullified, justifying standing for legislators in such situations. The D.C. Circuit has significant influence over case law concerning congressional standing, especially in cases where Members of Congress assert institutional injuries similar to those in Coleman v. Miller. The court's approach to analyzing this question differs slightly from other courts, given that cases involving congressional lawsuits often originate in D.C. federal court due to the presence of the federal government in Washington, DC. In cases following Raines, the D.C. Circuit considered when individual Member plaintiffs can assert institutional injuries. In Chenoweth v. Clinton, Members of the House sued to enjoin the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, arguing that it violated the Constitution by creating the program via executive order. The D.C. Circuit disagreed with the Members' argument. The D.C. Circuit disagreed with the Members' argument in Chenoweth v. Clinton, stating that the injury asserted was fundamentally the same as in Raines - an alteration in the constitutional balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches. The court noted that Congress had a legislative remedy to terminate the AHRI if a sufficient number in each House were so inclined. The case was dismissed for want of standing as the Representatives did not allege that the necessary majorities in Congress had voted to block the AHRI. The Campbell v. Clinton case challenged the legality of U.S. involvement in NATO air and cruise missile attacks in Yugoslavia. Congress had voted on resolutions related to the conflict, but the plaintiffs, 31 Members of Congress, alleged that the President's use of American forces violated the Constitution's War Powers Clause and the War Powers Resolution. The D.C. Circuit disagreed with Representative Tom Campbell and other Member plaintiffs in the Campbell v. Clinton case, stating that their votes were not nullified like the Kansas senators in Coleman. The court emphasized the unique context of the Coleman case, where the Kansas senators were unable to rescind a ratification, unlike the situation in Campbell v. Clinton. The D.C. Circuit found that the Campbell plaintiffs' votes were not \"nullified\" like the Kansas senators in Coleman. The court determined that the Campbell plaintiffs' argument was that the President acted illegally in excess of his constitutional authority and in violation of a statute, similar to Raines. As a result, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had not suffered a concrete and particularized injury. In 2002, the court ruled that Members of the House lacked standing to challenge President Bush's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, citing the availability of other remedies like appropriations power or impeachment. Similarly, in a 2011 case, a D.C. district court found that 10 Members lacked standing in federal litigation. In a 2011 case, a D.C. district court determined that 10 Members of the House lacked standing to challenge President Obama's alleged violation of the War Powers Clause of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution by pursuing military action in Libya without Congress approval. The court emphasized that \"nullification necessitates the absence of a legislative remedy\" and found that the plaintiffs had \"voted on essentially what the plaintiffs now ask this Court to award.\" The one post-Raines ruling from a D.C. district court to find legislative standing was the 2018 case Blumenthal v. Trump, where approximately 201 minority Members of the Senate and House alleged similar claims. In the case Blumenthal v. Trump, minority Members of Congress alleged that President Trump violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause by receiving benefits from his business dealings with foreign governments. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the President from accepting further emoluments without Congress' consent, arguing that this nullified their voting rights. The district court acknowledged the institutional injury but ultimately dismissed the case. The Blumenthal court found that the injury suffered by the minority Members of Congress was comparable to the injury in Coleman, as they were not complaining about a dilution of legislative power but the nullification of their votes. The court noted that the plaintiffs lacked a legislative remedy, unlike in other cases such as Raines and Chenoweth. The district court concluded that the plaintiffs had no means to remedy their complaints as the President never gave them the opportunity to approve the emoluments. The court rejected proposed legislative remedies for the President's alleged receipt of emoluments, stating they were inadequate and would not require congressional consent or approval. Impeachment was deemed too extreme as a remedy. The court found that appropriations remedies would not work in this case as there are no federal appropriations associated with the President's alleged receipt of emoluments. The availability of legislative standing for individual legislators varies among different circuits. The Sixth Circuit, in Baird v. Norton, ruled that Michigan state legislators lacked standing to challenge gaming compacts approved without following constitutional procedures. The court considered the harm inflicted by neglecting these procedures as a \"generalized grievance.\" The court in Baird v. Norton ruled that Michigan state legislators lacked standing to challenge gaming compacts approved without following constitutional procedures. The harm inflicted by this neglect was considered a \"generalized grievance\" shared by all residents and could not give rise to standing. The court concluded that legislators must possess votes sufficient to approve or defeat the measure in order to have standing. Individual legislators can never bring suit according to the Tenth Circuit. In Kerr v. Hickenlooper, the Tenth Circuit ruled that individual legislators cannot bring suit for institutional injuries. The court reconsidered standing for Colorado legislators challenging a constitutional amendment on tax approval, concluding that only institutional plaintiffs like the Arizona state legislature could assert such claims. The Tenth Circuit ruled in Kerr v. Hickenlooper that only institutional plaintiffs like the Arizona state legislature could assert claims for institutional injuries. The court determined that the injury in Coleman was personal, not institutional, as it only affected the senators whose votes were nullified. Therefore, the plaintiffs in Kerr lacked standing as they only asserted institutional injuries to the power of the legislature. The D.C. Circuit has a more receptive standard for institutional injuries compared to Baird and Kerr. They focus on the lack of a legislative remedy and whether the legislature as a whole has ample power to address the alleged wrong. Lower courts have distinguished between personal entitlements and institutional injuries in cases like Powell v. McCormack. In Powell v. McCormack, lower courts have distinguished between \"personal\" and \"institutional\" injuries, with a focus on justiciability considerations. Raines and Arizona State Legislature involved clearly institutional injuries affecting all Members of Congress equally. Despite potential unequal effects within the legislature, injuries can still be considered \"institutional.\" The \"Seven-Member Rule\" allows minority party Members to request information from the Administration but lacks explicit judicial enforcement. In Waxman v. Thompson, House Members sued for incomplete response to their demand for documents on Medicare costs. The court found their injury did not nullify their vote, as they only lacked full information for legislating. The plaintiffs in the case argued that their injury was personal, not institutional, as they had a distinct legal entitlement. However, the court disagreed, stating that their injury was to Congress, not themselves personally. This issue also arose in Cummings v. Murphy in 2018, where minority Members of the House Oversight Committee sought documents tied to their constitutional duties. The court determined that the plaintiffs' injury was institutional, rooted in their rights as Members of Congress, despite their argument that it was not shared by all members equally. This was based on the \"Seven-Member Rule\" violation, making it an institutional injury. The court ruled that the injury suffered by the plaintiffs was institutional, stemming from their rights as Members of Congress. This was determined based on the violation of the \"Seven-Member Rule,\" indicating an institutional injury rather than a personal one. The court requires legislators to meet standing requirements for alleged injuries, even if they seem personal. Cases show how injuries to legislators can fail to meet these requirements, such as electoral or reputational harm being deemed too speculative for standing. Schaffer, a Member of Congress, challenged the cost of living adjustment (COLA) in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, claiming it violated the Twenty-seventh Amendment. He argued that the COLAs damaged his political position and credibility, citing a previous case where a similar challenge was allowed. However, the Tenth Circuit rejected Schaffer's claim, stating there was no concrete evidence of reputational injury. The injury alleged in the case was deemed insufficiently concrete and particularized to establish standing, as it lacked concrete evidence of reputational harm. This was similar to a previous case where a challenge based on reputational injury was rejected. Another case highlighted how alleged injuries to legislators may fail to meet standing requirements, even if seemingly concrete and particular. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision was challenged by Members who claimed injury from alterations to their districts, reducing their incumbency advantage. The court found that elected representatives do not have a legally cognizable interest in their electoral district's composition. The Members' claim failed on the causation prong of standing as they could not trace their injuries to the court-drawn map. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision was challenged by Members claiming injury from district alterations, reducing their incumbency advantage. The court found that elected representatives do not have a legally cognizable interest in their district's composition. The Members' claim failed on the causation prong of standing as they could not trace their injuries to the court-drawn map. In another case, a legislator's claims could not overcome the standing inquiry elements in Rangel v. Boehner. Representative Rangel alleged improprieties in the Ethics Committee proceedings and sued House officials for declaratory relief and injunction. He claimed injuries to his reputation, loss of committee status, political harm, and due process violation. The court found his claims lacked causation and redressability, as he did not sue the House itself. The court found that Representative Rangel's claims lacked causation and redressability as the House censured him, not the individual House Members. The court also noted that it had no authority to order the House to rescind his censure, as authority over the House's Journal was constitutionally vested in the House itself. This highlights that a legislator plaintiff with a concrete injury may not establish Article III standing when seeking court involvement in the internal affairs of other branches of government. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission further supports that an institutional plaintiff, like a state legislature, typically has standing to assert an \"institutional injury.\" The Arizona state legislature had standing to assert an \"institutional injury\" in the case of the Redistricting Commission's usurpation of its redistricting responsibility. The Supreme Court determined that a legislature as a whole can potentially claim institutional injury and obtain standing in federal court, leaving open the possibility of different outcomes in cases involving separation-of-powers concerns. The Arizona State Legislature had standing to sue the President, raising questions about institutional plaintiffs and injuries. Courts emphasize that congressional plaintiffs with authorization have a higher likelihood of standing to address institutional injuries. Authorization from the respective institution reduces the risk of asserting third-party rights. The Arizona State Legislature had standing to sue the President, emphasizing the importance of congressional plaintiffs with authorization to address institutional injuries. Courts have allowed a plaintiff to sue on behalf of a single house of Congress to protect its unique institutional interests, without requiring authorization from both chambers. Several cases prior to Arizona State Legislature have considered what authorization is needed for a legislative institution to bring a lawsuit. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's power of inquiry to obtain information for its constitutional role. However, there is a distinction between Congress using its own powers to demand information and involving federal courts to enforce its demands. To utilize the judicial process, plaintiffs must show they are validly acting on behalf of the injured institution. This was seen in the 1976 case of United States v. AT&T Co. In the 1976 case of United States v. AT&T Co., the D.C. Circuit ruled that the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations had standing to challenge the executive branch's objection to a subpoena issued to a private party. The court reasoned that the House as a whole has standing to assert its investigatory power and can designate a member to act on its behalf. This was possible because the House of Representatives had passed a resolution authorizing the chairman to participate in the case on behalf of the Committee and the House. In the 1976 case of United States v. AT&T Co., the D.C. Circuit ruled that congressional plaintiffs usually have standing to assert Congress's interests in obtaining information with authorization. Courts have held that a house of Congress can authorize a committee to sue on its behalf, as seen in the 2008 case of Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives v. Miers. The House of Representatives authorized a committee to file a lawsuit in federal court to enforce a subpoena against executive officials. The court determined that the committee had standing to enforce the subpoena because it was authorized by a House Resolution. This distinguished the case from others where individual legislators had tried to assert injuries on behalf of the institution as a whole. The key factor was the House's explicit authorization for the lawsuit. The House committee was authorized to sue in federal court to enforce a subpoena, with the key factor being the House's authorization for the lawsuit. This distinguished the case from others where individual legislators lacked standing to assert injuries on behalf of the institution as a whole. The court concluded that individual Members of Congress generally do not have standing to vindicate institutional interests without authorization from their respective chambers. Authorization is a necessary factor in cases involving disputes between the Executive and Legislative Branches. The court rejected the argument that the Comptroller General had standing to sue the Vice President without specific authorization from Congress. The court rejected the argument that the Comptroller General had standing to sue the Vice President without specific authorization from Congress, emphasizing that no committee requested the documents or issued a subpoena. The court concluded that the statutory language empowering the Comptroller General did not authorize pursuing the information through a judicial proceeding without explicit congressional authorization. In Alaska Legislative Council v. Babbitt, the D.C. Circuit determined that the Alaska Legislative Council lacked standing to challenge federal management of subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on federal lands in Alaska. The Alaska Legislative Council lacked standing to challenge federal management of subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on federal lands in Alaska because the injuries did not belong to the council but to the State itself, and only the governor could bring such a suit on behalf of Alaska. Legislative plaintiffs lack standing to assert a generalized interest in the interpretation or application of a statute. In Newdow v. U.S. Congress, the Senate tried to intervene in a case challenging the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance but was denied standing by the Ninth Circuit. The Senate was denied standing to defend the constitutionality of a law due to a general desire to see it enforced as written. In a separate case, the House of Representatives had standing to pursue a constitutional claim regarding the Affordable Care Act but not a statutory claim against the Secretary of the Treasury. The court determined that the House had standing to pursue a constitutional claim but not a statutory claim against the Executive. The House's ability to challenge the Executive's actions was based on the constitutional authority of Congress to direct spending from the U.S. Treasury. However, the House lacked standing to challenge the Executive's violation of statutory schemes, as Article III does not allow for general legislative standing. The court ruled that the House had standing to pursue a constitutional claim but not a statutory claim against the Executive. It was determined that the Executive's alleged violation of the ACA would not harm the House, leading to the dismissal of the statutory claim. Separation-of-powers concerns were raised but deemed not controlling in this case. The court emphasized the importance of these concerns in determining when Congress can intervene in litigation. Congressional entities may intervene in existing federal cases initiated by noncongressional parties, allowing them to become full parties in the litigation and participate in various aspects of the case. Congressional entities may intervene in federal cases initiated by noncongressional parties, allowing them to defend the constitutionality of federal statutes when the executive branch declines to do so. An example is the U.S. House of Representatives intervening in Texas v. United States to defend provisions of the Affordable Care Act. When the executive branch refuses to defend a federal statute, questions arise about the justiciability of the case and whether Congress can intervene to defend the statute's validity. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of an adversary context in federal court cases, ruling that lawsuits between friendly parties are not within the court's purview. This adversity requirement, like standing, is a justiciability doctrine derived from Article. The Supreme Court's adversity requirement, derived from Article III, states that when both litigants desire the same result, there is generally no case or controversy, leading to a lack of jurisdiction. This requirement also has a prudential dimension, where even if federal jurisdiction is permitted, prudential considerations may advise against adjudicating a lawsuit without concrete adverseness between parties. The standing doctrine is concerned with whether a plaintiff is a proper party to a lawsuit, and other parties like intervenor-defendants or defendant-appellants also need to demonstrate standing to obtain relief. The Supreme Court has ruled that intervenors do not need independent standing if they seek the same relief as existing parties in a case. The Supreme Court has ruled that intervenors seeking relief different from existing parties must have independent standing. In cases where the executive branch does not defend a statute, Congress can step in to defend it, as seen in INS v. Chadha. The Supreme Court ruled that the \"one-house veto\" provision was unconstitutional, determining that there was a genuine controversy in the case due to Congress defending the statute's constitutionality. The Court found concrete adverseness existed when Congress intervened in the case, and even prior to their intervention, there was adequate adverseness as the INS would have deported the alien against his wishes if the federal courts rejected his challenge. The Supreme Court found the \"one-house veto\" provision unconstitutional, citing a genuine controversy in the case with Congress defending the statute's constitutionality. The Court determined that there was concrete adverseness due to Congress's intervention, and even before that, there was sufficient adverseness as the INS would have deported the alien against his wishes if the federal courts rejected his challenge. Prior to the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor, Chadha was seen as allowing Congress to defend a federal law only if it directly impacted Congress's powers. However, Windsor expanded this by allowing congressional intervention even when the law in question did not affect Congress's powers. In Windsor, the respondents challenged the constitutionality of a provision in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on equal protection grounds. The Attorney General of the United States notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the constitutionality of the challenged provision in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The House's Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) voted to intervene in the litigation to defend the provision's constitutionality. The Supreme Court allowed BLAG to intervene in the case regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) after the executive branch conceded that the provision was unconstitutional. The Court determined that there was a justiciable dispute and that the United States had a stake in the case, supporting jurisdiction for the appeal. The Supreme Court allowed BLAG to intervene in the case regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) after the executive branch conceded that the provision was unconstitutional. The Court concluded that the legislative branch's involvement in the case addressed any concerns about the executive branch's refusal to defend the provision. The Court found that BLAG's adversarial presentation satisfied prudential concerns, and Windsor and the United States presented a justiciable controversy. The Court did not need to determine if BLAG had standing to intervene independently. The Court hinted that the case might have been nonjusticiable if the Executive had not enforced the statute in addition to not defending it. The Supreme Court allowed legislative intervention in cases where the executive branch does not defend a statute, as seen in Chadha and Windsor. Lower federal courts have permitted legislative actors to intervene as defendants in cases where the executive branch agrees a statute is unconstitutional. This intervention helps address prudential concerns and ensures a justiciable controversy. The Supreme Court allowed legislative intervention in cases where the executive branch does not defend a statute, as seen in Chadha and Windsor. Lower federal courts have permitted legislative actors to intervene as defendants in cases where the executive branch agrees a statute is unconstitutional, addressing prudential concerns and ensuring a justiciable controversy. The Court concluded that the \"refusal of the Executive to provide the relief sought\" sufficed to preserve a justiciable dispute as required by Article III, regardless of congressional intervention. The United States retains a stake to support Article III jurisdiction when enforcing a statute it declines to defend in court. In cases like Chadha and Windsor, congressional intervenors were relieved of the burden to demonstrate standing before participating. The Windsor Court did not decide if a house of Congress would have standing to defend a statute if the Executive also refused to enforce it. Justices in Windsor disagreed on when a house of Congress possesses standing to defend an undefended statute. Justice Alito argued that Congress has standing to defend an Act of Congress when the Executive declines to do so, as it impairs Congress' legislative power. In contrast, Justice Scalia suggested that Congress can only intervene in lawsuits involving the validity of congressional actions, not to correct perceived inadequacies. The circumstances under which Congress may intervene to defend the validity of a statute the Executive refuses to enforce remains an unanswered question, with implications for policies and principles governing lawsuits to vindicate Congress's institutional interests. Other legal principles may also affect whether a congressional entity can intervene in a federal case to defend a statute's constitutionality. Congressional entities typically cannot intervene in a federal case without authorization. If authorized, they must comply with all rules governing legislative intervention. If unable to participate fully, they may still join as an amicus curiae. An amicus curiae, or \"friend of the court,\" can participate in a case by submitting legal briefs in support of a particular position. Congressional entities have filed amicus briefs in various cases, such as defending legislation's constitutionality and debating the vitality of Roe v. Wade. Federal courts have broad discretion to allow nonparties to submit amicus briefs in cases, but some courts have rejected congressional attempts to file such briefs. For example, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims recently prohibited the House of Representatives from filing an amicus brief in a lawsuit against the United States, citing that it would intrude on the Department of Justice's authority. Courts have identified considerations for assessing if a legislative entity has standing to seek judicial relief, including congressional authorization, absence of other remedies, vote nullification allegations, historical practice, availability of alternative plaintiffs, and the nature of the lawsuit. These considerations offer guidance but may not address all standing questions in such cases. The legal principles in congressional standing cases are not always consistent, making it hard to predict if legislative participation in litigation will overcome the standing hurdle. There is limited case law on legislative standing, so it is important to identify areas of uncertainty and ways for Congress to increase the likelihood of success in lawsuits. One key question is what authorization is needed for a legislative plaintiff to assert institutional injury. In congressional standing cases, it is crucial for a legislative plaintiff to have the necessary authorization to assert an institutional injury. Previous court cases have shown that specific authorization is required for a Member of Congress or the Comptroller General to bring legal action on behalf of their respective institutions. This highlights the importance of clarity in authorization for congressional litigants seeking to address institutional injuries. In congressional standing cases, specific authorization is crucial for a legislative plaintiff to assert an institutional injury. The standing requirement is more likely to be satisfied if a congressional litigant has express authorization to participate in a specified lawsuit. However, it is uncertain when a statute authorizing an entity to litigate on Congress's behalf generally, without a specific vote for a particular case, would meet the authorization prong of the standing analysis. Additionally, the availability of legislative remedies like impeachment may impact a legislative litigant's standing to seek judicial relief against the executive branch. In congressional standing cases, specific authorization is crucial for a legislative plaintiff to assert an institutional injury. The standing requirement is more likely to be satisfied if a congressional litigant has express authorization to participate in a specified lawsuit. However, the availability of legislative remedies like impeachment may impact a legislative litigant's standing to seek judicial relief against the executive branch. In conflicting strands of congressional standing precedent, courts have debated the adequacy of impeachment as a remedy for presidential non-compliance with the Emoluments Clause. Further litigation is needed to resolve these issues. Plaintiffs can sue for discrete injuries, such as informational harm from an agency's refusal to comply with a subpoena. Recent cases suggest a broader view of institutional injury, with courts allowing claims related to constitutional violations like unauthorized fund withdrawals by the Executive. The court in U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell emphasized Congress's exclusive authority over Treasury funds as a basis for standing. The court in U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell emphasized Congress's exclusive authority over Treasury funds as a basis for standing. Similarly, the Blumenthal v. Trump court concluded that individual Member plaintiffs possessed standing because they were prevented from discharging their constitutionally designated role in the emoluments process. This suggests that Congress could have a justiciable injury when the executive branch violates the Constitution in a way that undermines Congress's authority in a particular governmental process. The Burwell and Blumenthal courts adopted broad conceptions of congressional standing, but the Supreme Court never confirmed their decisions due to settlements. Some academics argue that this expanded standing may be unsound, allowing congressional litigants to bring executive branch entities to federal courts in various circumstances. The Burwell and Blumenthal cases suggest that congressional litigants may have standing to sue the executive branch over unappropriated funds and executive actions requiring congressional approval. Future judicial decisions will clarify the extent of this congressional authority. The Supreme Court has affirmed that Congress cannot change standing requirements through legislation, but it may define new circumstances where it can sue in federal court. In federal court, Congress may have the power to pursue a claim that it cannot pursue in the absence of specific legislation. The extent of this power in the context of legislative standing may require further clarification from the courts. To navigate this, a congressional litigant should seek authorization from Congress, argue that other remedies would be futile, show how the alleged action affects Members of Congress, cite historical precedent, demonstrate unique standing, and avoid presenting a generalized legal theory. The federal judiciary may hesitate to intervene in interbranch disputes, suggesting that Congress may need to rely on the political process to resolve conflicts with the executive branch. Not all constitutional disputes need to be resolved in court, and Congress should avoid framing legal theories as generalized grievances against federal statutes."
