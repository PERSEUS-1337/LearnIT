    "content": "Federal law requires all aliens to enter the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). There are two main categories of aliens: immigrants who are admitted permanently, and nonimmigrants who are admitted temporarily for reasons like studying or tourism. Foreign nationals who lack proper immigration authorization fall into three categories: overstaying nonimmigrant visas, entering the country without inspection, or using fraudulent documents. These violations of the INA can lead to removal. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under INA Section 244 offers temporary relief from removal and work authorization to foreign nationals from countries experiencing conflict or natural disasters. The report discusses Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for foreign nationals in the United States from countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters, or extraordinary circumstances. It also covers Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) and legislative efforts to provide permanent resident status to TPS-designated individuals. The United States, as a State Party to the 1967 U.N. Protocol, upholds the principle of nonrefoulement for refugees. The United States upholds the principle of nonrefoulement for refugees, which prevents the return of a refugee to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. This principle is reflected in U.S. immigration law, specifically in provisions that withhold the removal of a foreign national if their life or freedom would be threatened based on various factors. The legal definition of a refugee in the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act aligns with the U.N. Protocol, stating that a refugee is someone unwilling or unable to return to their country due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The legal definition of refugees and asylees in the United States is based on persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Refugees apply for status when displaced abroad, while those in the U.S. or at a U.S. port of entry apply for asylum. Other foreign nationals in the U.S. may be eligible for relief through TPS or DED, which provide humanitarian protection for individuals fleeing dangerous situations. The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was established by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to designate a country for TPS under certain conditions, such as armed conflict, environmental disaster, or extraordinary circumstances preventing safe return. Designation is not allowed if it goes against U.S. national interest. The Secretary of DHS can designate a country for TPS for 6 to 18 months, extendable if conditions are met. Eligible foreign nationals in the U.S. must pay fees, submit an application with supporting documentation to USCIS before the deadline. Grounds of inadmissibility include criminal convictions, drug offenses, terrorist activity, and persecution of others. TPS recipients are eligible for employment. Individuals granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are eligible for employment authorization, cannot be detained based on immigration status, and are not subject to removal while under TPS relief. They may be ineligible for public assistance by a state and can travel abroad with DHS Secretary's consent. TPS does not lead to permanent residence or citizenship, but recipients can adjust status if requirements are met. Information collected during TPS registration may be used for immigration enforcement. Withdrawal of TPS may lead to exclusion or deportation. Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is another form of relief from removal. Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is a temporary stay of removal granted to aliens from designated countries at the President's discretion. DED, unlike TPS, is based on the President's constitutional powers and has been used five times since 1990. Currently, Liberia is the only country designated under DED, with the designation set to end on March 30, 2020. DED is typically granted in response to war, civil unrest, or natural disasters, with eligibility guidelines provided by executive order or presidential memorandum. In 1990, Congress granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Salvadoran nationals in the United States for 18 months. Since then, TPS has been granted and terminated for individuals from various countries, including Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Guinea, Lebanon, Liberia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone. Unlike TPS, Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) does not require consultation with the Secretary of State and is triggered when a protected individual faces removal. The George H. W. Bush Administration granted DED to Salvadorans and Chinese nationals, President Clinton granted DED to Haitians, President George W. Bush granted DED to Liberians, and President Trump terminated DED for Liberians in 2020. Approximately 417,000 foreign nationals were affected by these decisions. Approximately 417,000 foreign nationals from 10 countries have TPS: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Administration has announced terminations of temporary protections for seven countries. Table 1 lists current TPS-designated countries, recent decisions, residency requirements, expiration dates, and registration numbers. Several lawsuits challenge these decisions. The history of TPS dates back to 1990 when Congress granted it to eligible Salvadoran nationals in the US. Temporary protection was also granted to nationals from Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador due to natural disasters like Hurricane Mitch and earthquakes. The George W. Bush Administration granted TPS to Salvadoran nationals after earthquakes in 2001. The Trump Administration terminated TPS for Nicaragua and El Salvador, citing completed recovery efforts. TPS for Honduras was put on hold pending further information. El Salvador's TPS was terminated in January 2018. The Trump Administration terminated TPS for El Salvador and Honduras with an 18-month transition period. The terminations are currently on hold due to a court order. Supporters argue for extending TPS due to ongoing violence and political unrest in these countries. The large-scale return of TPS recipients could negatively impact the US economy, labor supply, American families, foreign relations, and remittance flow to Central America. There is debate in Congress about allowing long-term TPS recipients to stay permanently, while some argue for maintaining the program's original intent of temporary relief. The 2010 Haiti earthquake led to calls for TPS for Haitians. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti prompted calls for TPS for Haitian nationals in the US. DHS granted TPS for 18 months to those in the US as of January 12, 2010, due to the humanitarian crisis. Secretary Napolitano emphasized the need to support Haiti's recovery. DHS extended the TPS registration period for Haitian nationals facing difficulties. The TPS designation for Haiti was extended multiple times, with the latest extension through July 22, 2017. A letter from the Congressional Black Caucus urged an 18-month extension, citing ongoing recovery difficulties from the 2010 earthquake, cholera epidemic, and damages from Hurricane. The TPS designation for Haiti was extended multiple times due to ongoing recovery difficulties from the 2010 earthquake, cholera epidemic, and damages from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Despite a request for an 18-month extension, DHS announced the termination of TPS for Haiti with an 18-month transition period, set to terminate on July 22, 2019, but currently on hold due to a court order. In 1991, civil war broke out in Liberia, leading to a second civil war in 1999. Approximately 10,000 Liberians in the US were granted DED after their TPS expired. TPS for Liberia was extended multiple times until it expired in 2007, but eligible Liberians were granted DED until 2010. Due to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, eligible Liberians were granted TPS again. In 2016, a six-month extension of TPS benefits was provided for Liberia. President Trump extended TPS benefits for Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to May 21, 2017, and extended Liberia's DED status to March 31, 2018. He later announced the termination of DED for Liberia due to improved conditions, leading to a lawsuit. Despite initially ending the wind-down period, Trump later extended it to March 30, 2020. Trump extended the wind-down period for Liberia to March 30, 2020, affecting approximately 840 Liberians with approved EADs. Nepal was designated for TPS after a devastating earthquake in 2015, with TPS being terminated in April 2018. The TPS designation for Nepal was terminated due to improved conditions, with a 12-month delay for an orderly transition. The termination date was set for June 24, 2019, but is currently on hold due to a court order. Somalia has faced chronic instability since 1991, lacking a central authority for security and services. Somalia has maintained TPS due to insecurity and armed conflict, preventing nationals from returning safely. Sudan and South Sudan have also been designated for TPS multiple times due to ongoing conflict and conditions preventing safe return. The DHS Secretary designated South Sudan for TPS in response to ongoing armed conflict and humanitarian disaster. TPS has been extended multiple times due to brutal violence and human rights abuses. Sudan's TPS designation was set to expire in 2018 but is on hold due to a court order. The political uprising in Syria led to a violent civil war, causing millions of Syrians to flee. TPS was granted to Syrian nationals in the US due to unsafe conditions in Syria. TPS for Syrians has been extended multiple times, with the latest extension announced in January 2018. The TPS designation for Syria was extended for 18 months due to ongoing armed conflict. Syrians who entered the US after August 1, 2016, are not eligible. Yemen was designated for TPS until March 3, 2017, citing ongoing armed conflict. The civil war in Yemen has led to a high civilian death toll and food crisis. The TPS designation for Yemen was extended through September 3, 2018, and then again for another 18 months until March 3, 2020, due to ongoing violence and infrastructure damage in the country. Individuals with TPS from Yemen reside in various states across the US, with the highest populations in California, Florida, Texas, and New York. States with significant TPS recipients include California, Florida, Texas, New York, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Georgia. TPS does not guarantee a pathway to permanent residency, but recipients can adjust their status if they meet requirements. Congress has historically provided LPR status to certain groups with temporary relief, such as Chinese nationals after the Tiananmen Square massacre. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act provided eligibility for LPR status to certain nationals who had applied for asylum and had been living in the United States for a certain period of time. Legislation allowing nationals with TPS to adjust to LPR status has been considered in past Congresses but not enacted. The 113th Congress immigration reform bill did not address adjusting status for foreign nationals with TPS, but some could have qualified for provisional immigrant status. Proposals in the 115th and 116th Congresses include extending TPS for certain countries, prohibiting funds for TPS terminations, and providing LPR status for long-term TPS recipients. Other bills aim to limit TPS by transferring authority to Congress, making unauthorized aliens ineligible, and phasing out the program."
