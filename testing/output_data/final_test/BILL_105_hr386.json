    "content": "The \"Educational Quality Index Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress acknowledges that cohort default rates alone do not reflect an educational institution's quality. It is important to consider the population served by the institution when evaluating its performance. Schools with students from disadvantaged backgrounds face challenges with cohort default rate standards, limiting access to technical and vocational education in impoverished areas. Many individuals in these areas are denied opportunities for higher education. The performance of a technical or vocational institution of higher education can be measured by objective data concerning student outcomes. SEC. 3. USE OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY IN INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY FOR GUARANTEED STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. Section 435(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new paragraph (4) regarding ineligibility based on educational quality index for proprietary institutions of higher education. This new provision replaces cohort default rate with an educational quality index for determining eligibility. The Secretary of Education will prescribe an educational quality index to evaluate proprietary institutions of higher education, consisting of a placement rate index, a cohort default rate index, and a successful completion index. The Secretary of Education will define the minimum aggregate score required for proprietary institutions of higher education to remain eligible for federal programs, based on graduation rates, certification or licensure rates. The Secretary of Education will define the minimum aggregate score required for proprietary institutions of higher education to remain eligible for federal programs, based on graduation rates, certification or licensure rates. Participating programs must adjust indexes based on the difference in Pell grant eligibility between enrolled students and all students at higher education institutions. The Secretary of Education will define the minimum aggregate score required for proprietary institutions of higher education to remain eligible for federal programs, based on graduation rates, certification or licensure rates. The weights attributed to 3 indexes for aggregating the score are specified, with 50% to one index, 30% to another, and 20% to a third index. Procedures for determining scores for individual institutions and resolving issues are also established. The Secretary of Education will define the minimum aggregate score required for proprietary institutions of higher education to remain eligible for federal programs, based on graduation rates, certification or licensure rates. Procedures for determining scores for individual institutions and resolving issues are also established. The Secretary of Education will set a minimum educational quality index score for proprietary institutions of higher education to maintain eligibility for federal programs. This score will be based on graduation rates and certification or licensure rates. The criteria for state review entities and program reviews will include this educational quality index score requirement."
