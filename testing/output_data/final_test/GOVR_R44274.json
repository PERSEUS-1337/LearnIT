    "content": "The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) provides eligible employees with unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical needs, including the arrival of a newborn, serious health conditions, and the employee's own health issues. Congress aimed to balance workplace responsibilities with the growing need for leave due to family and medical events. The FMLA of 1993 provides unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical needs. Congress added new categories of leave in 2008 and 2009 for military families facing deployments. This addressed potential complications for employers by setting clear parameters for leave coverage based on employer size and employee eligibility criteria. The FMLA of 1993 provides unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical needs, with additional categories of leave added in 2008 and 2009 for military families. FMLA grants employers the right to advance notice of leave needs and request medical documentation in certain situations. It applies to covered employers and eligible employees in the private and public sectors, with Title I covering private sector and government employees, and Title II covering federal civil service employees. The FMLA provides unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical needs, with additional categories added for military families. It covers employer and employee responsibilities, including granting eligible employees up to 12 workweeks of leave for various reasons such as the birth or adoption of a child. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of leave for eligible employees to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness sustained in the line of duty. The FMLA provides up to 26 workweeks of military caregiver leave for eligible employees to care for a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Military caregiver leave and other FMLA-qualified leave combined cannot exceed 26 weeks in a 12-month period. Special rules apply to airline flight crew employees, who are entitled to 72 days of leave for certain reasons and 156 days for military caregiver leave in a single 12-month period. Spouses employed by the same employer may have a combined limit of 12 weeks of FMLA leave for the arrival of a new child or caring for a parent with a serious health condition. They may also have a combined limit of 26 weeks for military caregiver leave. The terms serious health condition, qualifying military exigency, and care have specific meanings under the FMLA. A serious health condition requires inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. FMLA leave can be taken for inpatient care, incapacity requiring multiple visits to a healthcare provider, and pregnancy or prenatal care. FMLA leave can be used for pregnancy, prenatal care, chronic conditions, and long-term or permanent conditions. There is no specific duration of incapacity required for using FMLA leave for pregnancy or prenatal care. Chronic serious health conditions require periodic medical treatment and may cause episodic periods of incapacity. Long-term or permanent conditions that are not effectively treated also qualify for FMLA leave. FMLA leave can be used for conditions requiring multiple treatments like restorative surgery or medical treatments for serious illnesses such as cancer or kidney disease. It cannot be used for minor ailments or routine appointments. The FMLA allows eligible employees to use leave for serious health conditions that require overnight hospitalization or result in incapacitation, hospitalization, and subsequent treatment. It also permits leave for qualified military exigencies related to a family member's active duty status in the Armed Forces. The FMLA allows eligible employees to use leave for qualified military exigencies related to a family member's active duty status in the Armed Forces, including short-notice deployment activities and military events. FMLA allows eligible employees to use leave for various reasons related to a family member's active duty status in the Armed Forces, including attending military ceremonies, family support programs, childcare arrangements, financial and legal matters, and counseling. FMLA leave can be used for counseling, rest and recuperation, post-deployment activities, and parental care related to a covered military member's active duty status. FMLA leave can be used for parental care of a military member's parent who is unable to care for themselves. It can also be used for addressing other needs arising from a covered military member's active duty or call to active duty status. The leave is available to eligible employees who are spouses, children, parents, or next of kin of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. This includes current members of the Armed Forces, National Guard, Reserves, or recent veterans undergoing medical treatment. A covered servicemember is someone undergoing medical treatment for a serious injury or illness and was released from the Armed Forces under conditions other than dishonorable within the last five years. For current members of the Armed Forces, a serious injury or illness is one incurred in the line of duty that renders them unfit for their duties. A covered servicemember is someone undergoing medical treatment for a serious injury or illness and was released from the Armed Forces under conditions other than dishonorable within the last five years. The concept of care under FMLA includes both physical and psychological care, and FMLA leave may be taken to assist an eligible family member or covered servicemember with medical, nutritional, and health and safety needs. FMLA leave is an entitlement for eligible employees with a qualifying need for leave, guaranteeing unpaid leave, job protection, and continuation of group health benefits. Employers may delay approval of FMLA leave for various reasons, such as lack of advance notice or medical certification for serious health conditions or injuries. Medical certification for leave related to a serious health condition or injury must be provided within 15 days of employer's notice. Leave may be denied if certification is incomplete or insufficient, but can be approved retroactively if the reason qualifies under FMLA. Unpaid leave is guaranteed, but paid leave can be used concurrently if agreed upon. Employers must inform employees they can use paid leave with FMLA leave and specify conditions. FMLA leave guarantees job protection, except for key employees in certain cases. Key employees may not be reinstated if it causes significant economic harm to the employer. The FMLA and DOL regulations define a key employee as a salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10% of all employees within 75 miles of the worksite. The employer must meet notification requirements when designating a key employee and may deny reinstatement if it would cause substantial economic harm. Key employees retain FMLA rights unless they choose not to return to work or are denied reinstatement. Reinstatement can be delayed if the employee has been laid off for reasons unrelated to FMLA leave. During FMLA leave, reinstatement may be delayed if fitness-for-duty certification is not provided. Employers can deny reinstatement if the employee is unable to perform essential job functions. Fraudulent use of FMLA or violation of employment policies during leave can result in loss of reinstatement rights. Employers must maintain health coverage during FMLA leave, with both parties responsible for premium payments. Employers can recover premiums if the employee does not return to work after leave. Employees must return to work after FMLA leave, except for certain circumstances like serious health conditions, injuries, or military exigencies. Intermittent leave is allowed for medical necessity or military-related reasons. This includes reducing hours worked per week or per day. Employees can use FMLA leave for reduced schedules to care for themselves or family members when medically necessary or for military exigencies. Notice and certification may be required for intermittent or reduced schedule leave. Employers may temporarily transfer employees to a better-suited position for anticipated schedules. The FMLA allows employees to use leave for caring for family members, with special rules for certain employees. The set of family members for whom FMLA leave may be taken varies by the reason for leave. The FMLA allows employees to take leave to care for specific family members, including a spouse, son or daughter, parent, or next of kin. Other relatives like parents-in-law, grandparents, cousins, siblings, or grandchildren are generally not covered. A son or daughter can be biological, adopted, fostered, stepchild, legal ward, or under the care of the employee. FMLA leave can be used for a child under 18 or over 18 with a disability, while military leave can be used for any age child. Spouse refers to a legally married husband or wife, including common law marriages. The FMLA definition of family members includes spouses of a marriage performed legally in the United States, as well as parents, including biological, adoptive, step- or foster parents. FMLA does not require a legal relationship between a parent and child, allowing individuals to take on parental roles. FMLA leave can also be taken by an employee who is next of kin for a covered servicemember with a serious illness or injury. The FMLA defines family members as spouses, parents, and next of kin for covered servicemembers. Employers may require confirmation of the relationship for FMLA leave. FMLA applies to private-sector employers with at least 50 employees and all public agencies. Title I provisions and DOL regulations apply to covered employers in the private sector. The FMLA provisions apply to covered employers in the private sector, state and local governments, and some federal agencies. Title I provisions extend to congressional employees and are enforced by the U.S. Congress Office of Compliance. Title II covers most federal civil service employees and is administered by OPM. Title I, administered by DOL, applies to specific federal agencies and employees. FMLA eligibility is based on an employee's work history with a specific employer and the size of the employer's workforce. To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for a covered employer, have 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months prior to the start of leave, have worked for the employer for 12 months, and work at a qualifying location. In practice, FMLA eligibility is not transferable across employers and is not permanent. An employee may lose eligibility if their hours dip below 1,250 hours in the 12 months before leave, if the employer's workforce falls below 50 employees within 75 miles, or if the employer is no longer covered by the law. Special rules apply to airline flight crew employees. The act also outlines notification requirements, scheduling responsibilities, certification rights, and recordkeeping requirements for both employers and employees. Employers must fulfill notification requirements under FMLA, including General Notice and Eligibility Notice. General Notice must be posted in a visible location and provided to employees, while Eligibility Notice must be given each time an employee requests FMLA leave. Electronic posting is allowed. Employers must provide a written notice outlining employees' rights and obligations under FMLA within five business days of a leave request. They must also determine if the leave qualifies for FMLA and inform the employee, specifying how much leave will count against their entitlement. Employees must provide enough information for the employer to determine if the requested leave qualifies for FMLA, including the expected timing and duration of the leave. A 30-day advance notice is required for foreseeable leave. The employer has five business days to provide a written designation notice once sufficient information is acquired, unless extenuating circumstances exist. A fitness-for-duty certificate may be required upon return to work. Employees must provide a 30-day advance notice to employers for foreseeable leave, but notice must be given \"as soon as practicable\" for unforeseeable situations or military exigencies. Employers can delay FMLA leave approval if notice requirements are not met, but cannot impose longer notice periods than the 30-day requirement in the act. Employer policies for requesting leave must be followed, such as written requests or call-ins for intermittent leave, but cannot be used to deny or delay FMLA leave. Employers cannot impose a longer notice period than the 30-day requirement in the act for FMLA leave requests. Requests that do not meet employer policy may not be denied in cases of unusual circumstances. Employees must make an effort to schedule planned medical treatments to minimize disruption to business operations. Employers may require medical certification for FMLA leave requests. Employers may require medical certification for FMLA leave requests, including certification for serious health conditions every 12 months. Certification must be obtained from a healthcare provider chosen by the employee and should include specific information about the condition, its duration, and relevant medical facts. Failure to provide certification may result in denial of leave. Employees requesting FMLA leave may be required to provide medical certification, including details about the serious health condition, expected duration of the condition, inability to perform essential job functions, or the need to care for a family member. Employers can request a second opinion at their expense if they doubt the validity of the certification. Conflicting opinions are resolved by a third medical opinion. Employers have the right to request recertification of a medical condition \"on a reasonable basis,\" allowing them to confirm the condition's presence. Recertification may be required every 30 days in connection with an absence, unless the original certification indicates a longer duration. Circumstances like an extension of leave or significant changes in the condition may also prompt recertification within 30 days. Employers may request recertification of a serious health condition every six months, regardless of the expected duration. For FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember, military and medical certification is required. Second opinions on recertification are not allowed. Employers can collect information from healthcare providers regarding the covered servicemember's injury or illness, including details about the provider and the condition, to support the need for FMLA leave. Employers may collect information from employees caring for covered servicemembers, including contact details, relationship statement, and Armed Forces status. Second and third opinions are not required for FMLA leave to care for a servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Employees can use FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, certified by specific healthcare providers. Second and third opinions are allowed if the certification is from a different provider. Recertifications are not allowed for this type of leave. Employers must accept invitational travel orders for family members to join the servicemember, serving as sufficient certification for the need for leave. Leave can be used in one block as indicated on the order or authorization. Employees can use FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, certified by specific healthcare providers. Employers must accept documentation showing a veteran servicemember's enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers as certification of the servicemember's serious injury or illness. Additional certification may be required for leave that extends beyond the indicated time period on the order or authorization. An employer may also request certification that the covered veteran was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. For qualifying military exigency leave, an employee may need to provide a copy of the military member's active duty orders or other military documentation. An employee seeking leave for a qualified military exigency must provide appropriate facts describing the qualifying exigency, expected start and leave dates, frequency and duration of the exigency for intermittent leave, contact information for meetings with third parties, and a copy of active duty orders for rest and recuperation leave. An employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification for an employee returning from FMLA leave for their own serious health condition, as part of a uniformly-applied policy. However, certification cannot be required for intermittent or reduced schedule leave, unless there are reasonable safety concerns. Second or third opinions cannot be mandated by employers. Employers are required to maintain specific records, including basic payroll and employee data, FMLA leave dates, hours of FMLA leave taken in increments less than a full day, copies of employees' leave requests, documents on employee benefits and leave policies, premium payments, and records of any disputes over FMLA leave designation. FMLA requires employers to maintain confidential medical records separately from usual personnel files. Special recordkeeping rules apply to airline flight crew employers. Employers are prohibited from interfering with FMLA rights, taking adverse actions against employees for taking FMLA leave, or manipulating eligibility for FMLA leave. Interference with proceedings or inquiries is also prohibited. Employees have rights under FMLA and interference with proceedings is prohibited. Employees cannot waive their rights under FMLA. They can file a complaint with DOL or bring a civil action against an employer for violations within two years. Remedies for violations include damages for lost compensation and equitable relief like reinstatement. The Airline Flight Crew Technical Correction Act amended FMLA to establish special rules for airline flight crew employees, addressing unique scheduling practices and extending eligibility to this group. Additional recordkeeping requirements were also imposed on employers of airline flight crew. The Airline Flight Crew Technical Correction Act amended FMLA to extend eligibility to airline flight crew employees. A crewmember meets the hours-of-service requirement for FMLA eligibility by working at least 60% of the total monthly guarantee and 504 hours in the previous 12 months. An eligible airline flight crew employee is entitled to 72 days of leave in a 12-month period for various reasons. The FMLA provides leave for various reasons such as the birth or placement of a child, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, the employee's own serious health condition, and qualified military exigencies. Airline flight crew employees are entitled to 156 days of leave for the care of a covered military servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Employers can record FMLA leave for airline flight crew employees in one-day increments. FMLA leave for airline flight crew employees can be taken in one-day increments, even for needs less than a full day. After intermittent leave, employees must return to the same or equivalent position, unless physically impossible (e.g., mid-flight). Employers must keep records of monthly guarantees and collective bargaining agreements for airline crew. Special rules for local educational agency employees under FMLA include job restoration and special provisions for instructional employees regarding intermittent leave and reduced schedules. Congress aimed to balance the educational mission of schools with teachers' family leave needs. Agencies can use policies or collective bargaining agreements for job restoration. Local educational agencies may require instructional employees with a foreseeable need for intermittent leave or reduced leave schedules to take a block of leave or accept a temporary reassignment. The entire period of leave will count as FMLA leave and be deducted from the employee's entitlement. Local educational agencies may apply restrictions on intermittent or reduced leave schedules for FMLA based on serious health conditions or injuries that are foreseeable. Instructional employees may be required to continue leave until the end of an academic term, with only FMLA qualifying leave deducted from entitlement. Protections for group health insurance and job restoration are provided for the entire leave period. A local educational agency may require an instructional employee to continue leave through the end of an academic term under specific conditions related to bonding with a newborn, caring for a family member with a serious health condition, or caring for a covered servicemember.
