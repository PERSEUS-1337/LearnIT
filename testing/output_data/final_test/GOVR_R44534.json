    "content": "The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, also known as New Starts, provides federal funds for new fixed-guideway transit systems and expanding existing systems. Fixed guideway includes rail, catenary systems, passenger ferry systems, and bus rapid transit. CIG funding is mainly used for heavy rail, light rail, and commuter rail projects in cities like Charlotte, Denver, Minneapolis, and Salt Lake City. Rail transit systems in cities like Minneapolis and Salt Lake City have expanded significantly, with route-mileage doubling between 1985 and 2012. Light rail mileage quadrupled, commuter rail mileage doubled, and subway mileage grew by 25%. These systems now account for 45% of public transit trips, up from 31% in 1985. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program has been a major source of federal funding for bus rapid transit (BRT) projects, including Small Starts projects costing $300 million or less to build. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), includes Small Starts projects and Core Capacity projects. The program was reauthorized in the FAST Act, providing $2.3 billion per year from FY2016 through FY2020. The CIG program accounts for about 19% of FTA's budget and is one of six major funding programs. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, funded by the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, allocates discretionary grants to local transit agencies. Funding levels have been increasing since FY2014, with CIG projects also receiving support from other sources like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, funded by the U.S. Treasury, has seen increasing funding levels since FY2014. CIG projects also receive support from other federal programs like FTA's Urbanized Area Formula program and FHWA's Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program. Funding sources for CIG projects include the CIG program, FHWA flex funds, other FTA programs, and other federal sources, with a maximum federal share of 80% for CIG projects. The CIG program limits federal funding for New Starts projects to 60% and allows up to 80% for Core Capacity and Small Starts projects. The federal government typically pays 45% of New Starts project costs and 67% of Small Starts project costs, with the rest covered by local and state sources. The majority of state and local contributions for New Starts projects come from public funds raised by taxes, bonds, and tolls, with only 3% from private investment or public-private partnerships. Four types of projects are eligible for CIG funding: New Starts projects costing $300 million or more, Small Starts projects costing less than $300 million, and BRT projects. A corridor-based BRT service aims to emulate rail service without the need for a separated right-of-way. Core Capacity projects involve expanding fixed-guideway corridors to increase capacity by 10% or more. Program of Interrelated projects involves developing multiple New Starts, Small Starts, or Core Capacity projects simultaneously. Federal funding for these projects is typically committed in a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) between the federal government and transit agencies. An FFGA establishes terms for federal financial participation in transit projects, with three major phases: project development, engineering, and construction. To enter the project development phase, applicants must apply to FTA and complete NEPA requirements. FTA reviews project justification and local financial commitment during this phase, with a two-year timeline for completion. FTA can expedite the review process for sponsors with a successful track record in completing projects. Special warrants can advance projects with federal shares of $100 million or less or 50% of the total cost, qualifying them for automatic ratings on cost-effectiveness criteria without detailed analysis. The FTA can expedite project reviews for sponsors with a successful track record. Special warrants can advance projects with federal shares of $100 million or less, qualifying them for automatic ratings on cost-effectiveness criteria without detailed analysis. Projects must meet specific criteria to enter the engineering phase, including being selected as the locally preferred alternative and having an acceptable degree of local financial commitment. Core Capacity projects must be in a transit corridor over capacity or projected to be within the next five years. Interrelated projects must be logically connected and have a project implementation plan showing construction will start. The project implementation plan must show construction will start in a reasonable timeframe. The amount of CIG funding requested is fixed when the project enters engineering, leading to potential funding shortfalls. Prior to MAP-21, project costs were fixed later in the process before a grant agreement. FTA determines whether to sign an FFGA after engineering work is completed. FTA decides whether to sign an FFGA for a project to begin construction, overseeing its progress for compliance. Funding for approved projects is requested annually from Congress. FTA may issue a Letter of Intent or an Early Systems Work Agreement to provide some funding before the FFGA is awarded. Core Capacity projects are treated slightly differently than New Starts projects. Core Capacity projects are treated differently by FTA, with simplified eligibility parameters and evaluation measures. Small Starts projects, requesting less than $100 million in federal assistance, have two phases: project development and construction. FTA makes one formal decision for Small Starts projects - whether to award funding and move the project into construction. Funding for successful Small Starts projects is provided in a Small Starts grant. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) evaluates projects based on project justification and local financial commitment criteria to determine funding approval. Projects must achieve a minimum medium rating on a five-point scale to advance to the construction phase. Small Starts projects do not require a minimum rating for grant eligibility. The Federal Transit Administration evaluates projects based on project justification criteria, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and congestion relief. Projects do not need a minimum rating for grant eligibility. High ratings are awarded to projects generating 30 million linked trips annually and showing benefits in air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and safety. Congestion relief is measured by the increase in weekday linked transit trips.

High ratings are awarded to projects generating 30 million linked trips annually and showing benefits in air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and safety. Congestion relief is measured by the increase in weekday linked transit trips. The new project is evaluated based on economic development effects, land use, and pedestrian infrastructure near stations. The Federal Transit Administration evaluates projects based on project justification criteria, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and congestion relief. Cost effectiveness is measured by the annual capital amortized over asset lifetimes and operating cost per trip. A high rating is awarded for projects with a cost per trip less than $4 for New Starts projects and less than $1 for Small Starts projects. Local financial commitment is required for federal funding approval, including stable financing, sufficient resources for maintenance, and contingency funds for cost overruns.

Cost effectiveness is measured by the annual capital amortized over asset lifetimes and operating cost per trip. Local financial commitment is required for federal funding approval, including stable financing, sufficient resources for maintenance, and contingency funds for cost overruns. Capacity, current capital and operating condition, and commitment of funds are also key factors in project evaluation. The Federal Transit Administration evaluates projects based on project justification criteria, including mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and congestion relief. Cost effectiveness is measured by annual capital and operating cost per trip. Local financial commitment is required for federal funding approval, based on financial capacity, reasonableness of assumptions, current capital and operating condition, and commitment of funds. Projects rated at least medium on project justification and local financial commitment are typically recommended for funding. FTA considers project readiness and available funds when signing new agreements and allocating funds. The CIG program has faced controversy but is deemed necessary by FTA for transit agencies. Critics of the CIG program argue that it incentivizes communities to prioritize costly fixed-guideway infrastructure over improving bus services. They also call for more flexibility in federal transit funds usage, as a large portion, including CIG funds, can only be used for capital investment. Comprehensive benefit-cost studies of completed CIG projects are lacking to assess their success. Studies of completed CIG projects evaluate the program's success as federal policy. Since 2005, before and after studies are required for each project to compare expected costs and benefits, including service and ridership. However, these studies do not provide enough evidence to assess effectiveness. Economists generally view rail transit investments as ineffective and costly, with benefits not justifying costs. Some projects show varying benefit/cost ratios, with subway systems showing the largest net benefits. According to a study, subway systems in San Francisco and New York City have the largest net benefits, while the rail system in Buffalo and those operated by New Jersey Transit in Newark, Jersey City, and Trenton have significant net losses. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has recommended increased funding for Capital Investment Grants (CIG) to accommodate demand, especially for Core Capacity projects. The number of projects in the CIG pipeline has increased, with more Small Starts and Core Capacity projects, and fewer New Starts projects. Stakeholders attribute this increase to projects no longer needing to be rated before entering development. FTA has requested increased funding for Capital Investment Grants (CIG) to meet the growing demand for projects, especially Core Capacity projects. The proposed budget for FY2017 is $3.5 billion, higher than previous years, to lower financing costs and manage the program effectively. The funding source for CIG may shift from the general fund to the mass transportation account. The funding source for the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program may shift from the general fund to the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund. This change could lead to the exhaustion of funds in the mass transit account by FY2019 if an additional $2 billion to $3 billion per year is allocated to the CIG program starting in FY2017. The program has faced criticism for favoring large, costly rail projects over smaller, cheaper options like streetcars. The FTA's FY2017 recommendations include funding for 6 BRT projects and 5 streetcar projects out of 31 projects, marking a shift towards lower-cost projects. A decade earlier, most projects were light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail. The addition of Core Capacity projects could further impact funding opportunities for new public transit systems. Peter Rogoff highlighted the opportunities for new Core Capacity projects in various urban areas to receive funding from the CIG program. Core Capacity projects are seen as a way to support increased ridership without crowding out other project types. Currently, four Core Capacity projects are in project development, including commuter rail in San Francisco, heavy rail in Chicago and New York, and light rail in Dallas. As of March 31, 2016, none of these projects had a funding agreement with the FTA. FTA has discretion in evaluating Core Capacity projects funding requests, with debates on methodology changes affecting project ratings. For example, MAP-21 altered criteria to consider annualized costs per trip, favoring projects with shorter trips like streetcars over commuter rail. Research on factors influencing CIG funding awards found that local financial capacity plays a significant role in FTA decisions. Project justification scores are crucial for funding consideration, but local sponsors' ability to provide funding is the most important factor once the threshold is met. Concerns over the complexity and expense of the federal funding approval process have been ongoing. The approval process for federal funding through the CIG program involves extensive data development and preparation of detailed reports. The evaluation process has been suggested as a model for other federal programs, but concerns have been raised about its time-consuming and costly nature. Legislative changes in MAP-21 and the FAST Act aim to expedite CIG project development by simplifying the process and reducing the number of steps required. The MAP-21 and FAST Act legislation aimed to expedite CIG project development by reducing steps and simplifying the process. Changes include project justification warrants for automatic satisfactory ratings and an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program for P3 projects. However, there have been no comprehensive evaluations on whether these changes have sped up project progression through the CIG pipeline. The MAP-21 and FAST Act legislation aimed to expedite CIG project development by reducing steps and simplifying the process. Changes include project justification warrants for automatic satisfactory ratings and an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program for P3 projects. Federal law promotes the use of P3s in the construction of major capital transit projects supported by the CIG program. DOT provides education on related laws and regulations and technical assistance on best practices for utilizing private providers of public transportation. In July 2014, DOT created the Build America Transportation Investment Center (BATIC) to promote P3s. The Transportation Investment Center (BATIC) promotes P3s and offers financing support through TIFIA and private activity bonds. The FAST Act created the Expedited Project Delivery for Capital Investment Grants Pilot Program for P3 projects. Benefits of P3s include private financing, cost savings, quicker project completion, improved infrastructure quality, and risk transfer to the private sector. The Purple Line light rail project in Maryland involves risks being transferred to the private sector through a P3, including design errors, utility relocation issues, inflation during construction, cost overruns, and schedule delays. Risks retained by the public sector include right-of-way acquisition and fare revenue. Some risks are shared between both sectors. Congress has aimed to involve the private sector in CIG projects through the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P) to streamline project development. The private sector is involved in designing, building, and operating projects through design-build contracts. The Eagle Project in Denver and Maryland's Purple Line involve private financing for public transportation projects. The Las Vegas Monorail was a private venture that faced bankruptcy due to poor ridership. The CIG program allows private sector involvement in designing, building, and operating projects through design-build contracts. The company is proposing to extend its 3.9-mile line under the CIG program, which originated from the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. DOT issued policy statements in the 1970s on principles for distributing federal funding for \"new starts,\" which were later incorporated into federal law. Congress enacted principles for CIG projects in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA; P.L. 100-17) and added criteria in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240) including cost-effectiveness, mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) added considerations such as congestion relief, energy consumption, and economic development for CIG projects. TEA-21 required FTA to rate projects and approve them to move from preliminary engineering to final design. FTA published its Final Rule in response to TEA-21 in 2000. SAFETEA (P.L. 109-59) changed the rating scale to five points and elevated economic development effects and public transportation supportive land use policies as project justifications. It introduced the Small Starts program for projects costing less than $250 million seeking $75 million or less in CIG funding. SAFETEA reserved $200 million per year for Small Starts and targeted funding to projects with a medium or better rating. The FTA announced that funding would target projects with a medium or better cost effectiveness rating, in response to concerns from Congress, GAO, and DOT's Inspector General. A proposed rule required a medium rating for funding recommendation, with cost effectiveness weighted at 50%. Other criteria included land use and economic development (20%), mobility benefits (20%), environmental benefits (5%), and benefits to transit-dependent riders (5%). This proposal faced criticism from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and respondents. The rule proposed by FTA in response to concerns from Congress, GAO, and DOT's Inspector General faced criticism for placing too much emphasis on cost effectiveness and not enough on economic development effects of transit projects. Congress included language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to prevent FTA from implementing the rule. Congress also amended 49 U.S.C. \u00a75309 to require FTA to give comparable weight to each project justification criteria. This requirement was carried forward in MAP-21. FTA withdrew the 2007 NPRM. FTA withdrew the 2007 NPRM in February 2009 and issued final guidance in July 2009, establishing cost effectiveness as 20% of the project rating. Other factors included economic development, mobility improvements, land use, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. In January 2010, FTA announced a change in funding recommendations to projects with an overall medium rating or better. They also planned to issue a new NPRM for evaluation changes in New Starts and Small Starts projects, issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2010. FTA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2010 to improve measurement of cost effectiveness, environmental benefits, and economic development for projects. A final rule was published in January 2013, along with revised policy guidance. MAP-21 made changes to the CIG program, including funding for Core Capacity improvement projects and simplifying the New Starts process. The New Starts process was simplified under MAP-21, reducing major stages to project development, engineering, and construction. Applicants only needed to apply to FTA and initiate the NEPA review process. The act eliminated duplicative alternatives analysis and changed project justification criteria, adding congestion relief and revising cost effectiveness definition. The FTA made significant changes to the evaluation process of New Starts/Small Starts projects, aiming to measure a broader range of benefits and simplify the process. Some changes included dropping operating efficiencies as a project justification and adding congestion relief. The goal is to evaluate environmental benefits more comprehensively. FTA will evaluate environmental benefits by measuring changes in air quality, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and safety. They will simplify measures, eliminate baseline alternative requirements, and improve data submission and evaluation processes. Mobility improvements will be assessed by the total number of trips generated, with extra weight for transit-dependent individuals. This replaces previous measures like incremental travel time saved per passenger mile. On August 5, 2015, FTA announced final interim policy guidance on the CIG program to improve project ratings for shorter trips like streetcars. The guidance addressed measures and breakpoints for congestion relief, evaluation processes for Core Capacity Improvement projects, and criteria for project justification and local financial commitment. The FAST Act, enacted in December 2015, made changes to the CIG program, including increasing the funding threshold for Small Starts projects to $100 million and eliminating certain requirements for corridor-based BRT services. The FAST Act made changes to the CIG program, including reducing weekend service requirements and limiting funding for New Starts projects to 60%. It also added authority to fund projects benefiting public transportation and intercity rail."
