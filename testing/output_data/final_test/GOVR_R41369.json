The country is diplomatically influential, with a well-trained military active in peacekeeping operations. Despite ethnic and religious divisions, they play a lesser role in politics compared to other West African countries. Economic growth has been concentrated in the capital, Dakar, and among elites, posing challenges for President Macky Sall in meeting public expectations to alleviate poverty and improve governance. Senegal faces high public expectations to address poverty, improve transparency, and end separatist conflict in Casamance. The country is also concerned about regional security due to terrorist activity in neighboring Mali. Senegalese troops are involved in a U.N.-authorized military intervention in Mali, with U.S. logistical support. Senegalese troops in Mali face an uncertain threat environment, lacking experience in desert warfare and sophisticated terrorist attacks. The U.S. views Senegal as a key partner in combating security threats, with President Obama emphasizing Senegal's democratic track-record. Congress shapes U.S. policy through foreign assistance authorization and oversight. The U.S. provides significant financial assistance to Senegal for various development projects, including health, food security, governance, economic growth, and military professionalism. A $540 million MCC compact funds infrastructure and agricultural projects. Congressional interest focuses on Senegal's democracy, security role, and oversight of development aid. Senegal's first post-independence leader, L\u00e9opold Senghor, was a poet and politician known for his close ties with the West and resistance to Eastern Bloc influence. He ruled as a socialist and pan-Africanist until 1981 when he was succeeded by Abdou Diouf. Diouf continued Senghor's pro-Western policies but faced allegations of fraud and repression during elections. In 2000, opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade won presidential elections considered free and fair. Abdoulaye Wade won presidential elections in 2000, marking a landmark for democracy in Senegal. However, during his second term, concerns arose over democratic backsliding and corruption. In the 2012 election, Wade lost to Macky Sall, leading to a peaceful transfer of power and a victory for democracy in the region. President Sall, a geological engineer by profession, rose to national prominence in Senegal as a senior official in Wade's party. He founded the Alliance for the Republic (APR) and emerged as the opposition front-runner in the 2012 election, leading to a peaceful transfer of power. In the 2012 election in Senegal, Wade failed to win a majority, leading to a run-off against Sall, who won with 65.8% of the vote. Senegal's electoral system is strong due to factors like media freedom, civil society involvement, and transparent institutions. EU election observers have noted the system's effectiveness. President Sall's coalition, \"United in Hope,\" gained control of the Assembly in 2012 with 119 out of 150 seats. Former Prime Minister Niasse was elected speaker. A 2010 law increased women's representation in the National Assembly to 43%. EU observers recommended campaign finance reforms for greater transparency in Senegal. President Sall concentrated power by abolishing the Senate, reducing presidential term to five years, and limiting cabinet ministers. This follows reforms by his predecessor Wade, who later reversed similar changes. President Sall has implemented constitutional term limits, reduced the number of cabinet ministers, and launched a campaign to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption, including former President Wade's son, Karim. The anti-corruption efforts have received support from the World Bank, but Wade supporters criticize them as a political witch-hunt. President Sall's anti-corruption efforts have faced criticism from Wade supporters, who view them as a witch-hunt to sideline political opponents. It remains uncertain if Sall can address public expectations for better employment opportunities and lower living costs. Despite improvements in health and education services, challenges persist in rural and urban areas with infrastructure like roads, electricity, and sanitation. Senegal's HIV/AIDS and anti-malaria programs have been praised for their effectiveness. Despite improvements in health and education services, challenges persist in rural and urban areas with infrastructure like roads, electricity, sanitation, and drinking water. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and affiliated groups pose a threat in neighboring Mali and elsewhere, with potential infiltration into Senegal due to porous borders. Senegal's underemployed youth are susceptible to radicalization, and the country faces threats of extremist attacks, especially with its involvement in regional stabilization efforts in Mali. The presence of Western residents and offices in Dakar also raises security concerns. Senegal faces security threats from potential terrorist attacks targeting Western residents and offices in Dakar, as well as its airport. The country has actively countered terrorist financing and monitored arms trafficking. Internal security concerns include unrest in the Casamance region due to a separatist insurgency, leading to economic challenges and population displacements. Combatants in the region are involved in banditry and organized crime. The Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) in Senegal has faced fragmentation since the death of its leader in 2007. Illicit trafficking, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, poses a significant challenge to regional stability. Senegal's international airport is a hub for drug couriers. Senegal's law enforcement agencies are effective but may lack capacity to prevent money laundering linked to organized crime, including drug trafficking. The drug trade utilizes regional smuggling networks for various illegal activities. Senegal has a good record on human rights and press freedom, but issues like physical abuse, torture by security forces, limits on freedoms of speech and assembly, and corruption persist. The human rights situation in Senegal includes poor treatment of detainees, long pretrial detention, lack of judicial independence, violence against women, child abuse, child labor, discrimination against LGBT persons, people with HIV/AIDS, and trafficking in persons. There are also reports of police abuses against gay men, economic exploitation of children in Quranic schools, and criminal activities by rebels in Casamance. Senegal is a source, transit, and destination country for forced labor, begging, and sex trafficking of children and women. Children in Senegalese Quranic schools are often separated from their families and forced to beg. Rights groups criticize delays in prosecuting former Chadian President Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 for crimes committed in Chad. The African Union directed Senegal to prosecute Habr\u00e9 in 2006, but progress stalled due to funding issues. President Sall has made progress towards a trial after the International Court of Justice ruled that Senegal must try Habr\u00e9 or extradite him. The International Court of Justice ruled that Senegal must try Habr\u00e9 or extradite him to Belgium. Senegal's economy relies on fishing, peanuts, phosphates, tourism, and remittances. Despite decent economic growth, obstacles like corruption and electricity shortages hinder private sector development. Senegal faces challenges such as shortages, lack of transparency in public contracting, judicial inefficiency, and opaque land titling procedures. The country ranks low on the U.N. Human Development Index and relies heavily on food imports. Chronic food insecurity and emigration due to poor socioeconomic conditions are prevalent. Despite some improvement in food security, discontent persists, leading to high emigration rates. Senegal has close partnerships with Western donors for development assistance. Senegal has strong partnerships with Western donors for development assistance and military cooperation, particularly with France. Former President Wade sought economic support from the Middle East and China to emphasize independence and hedge against Western aid conditionality. Senegal is an active member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and has cut ties with Iran due to an arms shipment destined for rebels. Senegal focuses on regional diplomatic leadership and conflict resolution efforts. Senegal has provided troops for U.N. peacekeeping missions in Darfur, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, and Mali. Tensions occasionally arise with Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia over alleged links to rebels and border disputes. In 2011, relations with Guinea were strained over accusations of hosting an armed plot. Unrest along the border with Mauritania in 1989 sparked riots and reprisals in both countries. Unrest along the border with Mauritania led to riots and forced expulsions into Senegal. Senegal and Mauritania improved relations in the mid-2000s, with President Wade brokering a political agreement in 2009. Senegal is considered a strong U.S. ally and partner, with the U.S. Embassy in Dakar being the third largest in Africa. Security and judicial cooperation are expected to increase, with the establishment of a DEA office in Senegal. Ambassador Jim Bullington was appointed as a special envoy in 2012 to support President Sall's efforts.

Past U.S. Presidents, including Clinton, Bush, and Obama, have visited Senegal and praised its democratic elections. The Obama Administration has shown strong support for President Sall's leadership, with Senegal being one of three African countries visited by President Obama in 2013. During his second trip to Africa in late June 2013, President Obama visited Senegal. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised President Sall's focus on transparency, accountability, and judicial independence. The U.S. supported Sall's plans for agricultural production, land reform, and resolving conflicts. The Obama Administration criticized former President Wade's political trends and aid budget request for Senegal highlighted governance issues. They also opposed Wade's third-term presidential candidacy. Senegal's former President Wade faced pressure to step down after losing the election due to alleged foreign interference. The country is eligible for trade benefits under AGOA, with minimal exports to the US. US bilateral foreign assistance to Senegal has increased significantly in recent years. French companies are the largest foreign investors in Senegal. US bilateral foreign assistance to Senegal has increased significantly in recent years, from under $60 million in FY2008 to $109.6 million in FY2012, with a five-year MCC compact worth $540 million. Key aims of U.S. aid include agricultural development, health assistance, democratic governance, economic growth, rural development, countering violent extremism, and military effectiveness. The Administration proposed $89.8 million in bilateral aid for FY2013, and has requested $89.2 million for FY2014. Congress has influenced the level and balance of aid, recommending \"not less than\" $50 million in Development Assistance funding for Senegal. The report highlighted concerns about former Chadian president Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 not being extradited for prosecution for crimes against humanity. U.S. security assistance in Senegal focuses on military professionalization, counterterrorism, maritime security, and peacekeeping training. Thousands of Senegalese peacekeepers have been trained through the State Department's Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program, with logistical support provided to regional troops deployed to Mali. The U.S. provides support to Senegal's military, including counter-narcotics assistance and training for peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts. Senegal is part of the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership and has received security assistance packages from the Department of Defense. Additionally, Senegal participates in multinational exercises and a State Partnership Program with Vermont's National Guard. The MCC approved a $540 million compact with Senegal in 2009 to promote economic growth through infrastructure and agriculture. The compact focuses on road rehabilitation and agricultural development in the Senegal River Valley and Casamance region. Concerns over democratic backsliding and corruption have lessened under President Sall, with smoother disbursements and strong support for the compact. Various U.S. agencies, including the State Department, USAID, MCC, and DOD, are involved in the partnership. Senegal benefits from various U.S. agencies and international financial institutions, receiving significant support. The country also qualified for debt relief in 2004. The 2012 presidential election was crucial for Senegal's democratic reputation. The 2012 presidential election in Senegal was a potential watershed for the country's political future, with the outcome determining whether democratic consolidation would continue or if a flawed election could harm its international image. Despite concerns over democratic erosion, the election was conducted fairly, resulting in incumbent President Wade's loss to Macky Sall. However, Sall's ability to address governance issues and economic hardships remains uncertain, with challenges such as political instability, corruption, insecurity in Casamance, and drug trafficking potentially hindering socioeconomic development and security. Events in the turbulent surrounding region, including the political and security crisis in neighboring Mali, may impact Senegal's trajectory."
