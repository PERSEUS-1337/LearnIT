    "content": "The \"Promoting Partnerships to Transform Opportunities Act\" aims to provide resources to nonprofit organizations and minority-serving institutions to help individuals with barriers to employment, especially underrepresented minorities, by offering support services, job training, and education. It includes a new section on underrepresented minority programs in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The purpose of this section is to support employment and training activities for individuals with multiple barriers to employment to enhance their skills and competitiveness in the workforce. It also aims to promote economic and social development in minority communities through minority-serving institutions like historically Black colleges, Hispanic-serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and Predominantly Black Institutions. The text defines terms such as Historically Black College or University, Hispanic-serving Institution, Nonprofit organization, and Predominantly Black Institution in the context of supporting employment and training activities for individuals with barriers to employment. The text defines terms related to minority-serving institutions and nonprofit organizations partnering to support individuals with barriers to employment through grants, contracts, or agreements for authorized activities. The text outlines authorized activities for nonprofit organizations partnering with minority-serving institutions to support individuals with barriers to employment, including education services, workforce access activities, and additional support services like health and nutrition assistance. Nonprofit organizations partnering with minority-serving institutions must submit a program plan to the Secretary outlining strategies to assist individuals with barriers to employment. The plan should identify the target population, address their education and employment needs, describe the activities to be provided, and explain how these activities will help individuals secure or maintain unsubsidized employment. After consulting with the Secretary, nonprofit organizations must outline performance measures for assessing their activities. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016."
