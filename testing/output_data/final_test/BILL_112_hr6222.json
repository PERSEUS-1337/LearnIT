    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Heating Oil Act of 2012\". It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that in 2010, 3.93 billion gallons of heating oil were consumed in the United States, accounting for 7.2% of total distillate oil demand. The sulfur content of heating oil is the main difference from highway diesel fuel, but New York will align the sulfur content with diesel fuel standards in 2012. The Environmental Protection Agency has limited sulfur content in diesel fuel to 15 parts per million since 2010. Heating oil constitutes 54% of total emissions according to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. The Energy Information Administration estimates that the US exported 8.65 billion gallons of low sulfur diesel fuel in 2011. The EPA reported in 2008 that reducing sulfur dioxide exposure has health benefits. Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management predicts that lowering sulfur content in heating oil will eliminate 167,000 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, benefiting US citizens' health. EPA has the authority to regulate sulfur content. The EPA can limit sulfur content in heating oil under the Clean Air Act, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings in system maintenance. SEC. 132 of the Clean Air Act amends Part A of title I to regulate the sulfur content of heating oil. SEC. 132 of the Clean Air Act regulates the sulfur content of heating oil, defining it as specific distillates used for heating purposes. Effective June 1, 2016, heating oil must not contain sulfur concentrations exceeding 15 parts per million, unless a lower limit is set under subsection (c). The Administrator has the authority to grant early use credits. The Administrator may issue credits to refiners and importers for heating oil produced or imported before June 1, 2016, with limitations. These credits can be used or transferred to others for compliance purposes, but they expire on June 1, 2019. The Administrator has the authority to reduce sulfur concentration in heating oil to protect public health. Waivers can be granted for compliance under certain circumstances. The Administrator can waive requirements for heating oil if criteria are met, subject to limitations. Waivers can also apply to heating oil from small refineries. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations to enforce section 132 of the Clean Air Act within 24 months of its enactment. Penalties and injunctions for violations will be applied in the same manner as for other sections of the Act."
