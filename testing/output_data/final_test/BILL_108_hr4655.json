    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Patriotic Employers of Guard and Reservists Act of 2004\" and includes provisions for Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit under section 38 is 50% of the actual compensation amount or $30,000, whichever is less. The actual compensation amount is the pay for days of qualified active duty. No credit is given for days when the employee was not scheduled to work for reasons other than duty. Qualified active duty, as defined in this section, includes active duty other than training duty specified in relevant codes, entitling employees to reemployment rights, benefits, or leave of absence under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, and hospitalization incident to such duty. The term 'compensation' refers to remuneration for employment deductible from gross income. A 'Ready Reserve-National Guard employee' is a member of the Ready Reserve of an Armed Force. Rules similar to section 52 apply, and a portion of the credit is refundable for employers of qualified first responders. The credit allowed to a taxpayer under subpart C is increased by the lesser of the credit allowed without regard to limitations or the increase in credits if the limitation imposed by section 38(c) is raised by the amount of employer payroll taxes. This credit does not count towards the overall allowable credit. The credit under subpart C can be increased by the employer payroll taxes without affecting section 38(c) limitations. A qualified first responder is defined as a law enforcement official. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit is added to the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. A law enforcement official, firefighter, or paramedic who is a Ready Reserve-National Guard employee is eligible for this credit. Additionally, a denial of double benefit is implemented to prevent overlapping employment credits. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include the Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit after section 45F. The Ready Reserve-National Guard employee credit amendments apply after September 30, 2004. A new section, 30B, introduces the Ready Reserve-National Guard Replacement Employee Credit. The Ready Reserve-National Guard Replacement Employee Credit allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year for each qualified replacement employee. The credit is 50% of the individual's qualified compensation, up to $12,000. Qualified compensation is contingent on the employee's presence for work. The Ready Reserve-National Guard Replacement Employee Credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified replacement employees. The credit is 50% of compensation, up to $12,000, contingent on the employee's presence for work. Qualified replacement employees are individuals hired to replace Ready Reserve-National Guard employees or self-employed taxpayers. The Ready Reserve-National Guard self-employed taxpayer is defined as a taxpayer with net earnings from self-employment who is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of the regular tax for the taxable year reduced by certain credits over the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year. No credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) to a taxpayer for failure to comply with employment or reemployment rights of members of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States. The credit under subsection (a) is available to eligible taxpayers for three consecutive taxable years following a final order or judgment related to a violation of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code. Eligible taxpayers include small business employers and Ready Reserve-National Guard self-employed taxpayers. The term 'small business employer' refers to an employer with an average of 50 or fewer employees during a taxable year. Controlled groups are treated as a single employer. 'Qualified active duty' is defined in section 45G(d)(1). Special rules apply to qualified manufacturers, with adjustments to certain thresholds. The term 'qualified manufacturer' refers to a person in sectors 31, 32, or 33 of the NAICS, with all production facilities in the US. The credit can be carried back or forward. The credit allowable under subsection (a) can be carried back or forward if it exceeds the limitation for the taxable year. Rules similar to section 39 apply to the credit carryback and carryforward. No deduction for compensation taken into account for credit under Section 280C(a) of the Code is amended to include \"or compensation\" after \"salaries\" and to insert \"30B,\" before \"45A(a).\" A conforming amendment is made to Section 55(c)(2) by inserting \"30B(e)(1),\" after \"30(b)(3),\" and a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections by adding a new item after section 30A. The amendment under Section 30B allows for a credit for Ready Reserve-National Guard replacement employees. Effective after September 30, 2004, in taxable years ending after that date."
