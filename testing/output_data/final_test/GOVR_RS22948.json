    "content": "In December 2008, the United States and Russia signed a protocol to resolve trade issues affecting U.S. livestock and poultry exports. However, by December 2009, Russia escalated these issues, threatening to block U.S. exports. Russia's concerns included antimicrobial use in U.S. meat production. Efforts to resolve these issues were progressing in early 2010. Russia is a significant market for U.S. meat and poultry, purchasing over $1.2 billion in 2008, making it the largest export market for U.S. poultry products. In 2008, Russia was the largest export market for U.S. poultry products, valued at over $820 million. It was also a leading market for U.S. pork and beef products, with values of $330 million and nearly $70 million, respectively. Russia banned U.S. beef imports in 2003 due to mad cow disease but resumed imports in 2008. Agriculture in Russia has historical and political significance, despite accounting for only 5.2% of the GDP in 2009. Agriculture in Russia has been severely affected by the transition to a market economy, with a 40% decline in production since 1991. The country is not competitive in global markets for red meats and poultry, leading to high levels of imports. The government has set targets for self-sufficiency in various commodity groups, including meat and meat products. Russia has set targets for self-sufficiency in meat and meat products, aiming for at least 85% production. Imports have made up a significant portion of pork, poultry, and beef consumption. The government faces pressure to protect agriculture and make it competitive, leading to trade constraints like import quotas on poultry and tariff-rate quotas on beef and pork. In 2005, the United States and Russia signed an agreement setting quota levels for Russian imports of U.S. poultry, pork, and beef products through 2009. The U.S. had a significant share of Russia's quotas for poultry, pork, and beef in 2008. Quota levels for 2009 were adjusted in a protocol to the 2005 agreement. In 2009, the United States had 79% of Russia's global poultry quota and 19% of the pork quota. Russia's import tariffs for poultry, beef, and pork vary, with out-of-quota tariffs being prohibitive. In 2010, Russia reduced its global import quotas for pork and poultry, with U.S. pork quota decreasing by over 40% and poultry quota down to 600,000 MT from 750,000 MT in 2009. In 2010, U.S. poultry quota allocations decreased to 600,000 MT from 750,000 MT in 2009. Russia's beef import quotas increased to 560,000 MT from 450,000 MT, and for the United States, it rose to 21,700 MT from 18,500 MT. Russia has imposed SPS measures affecting U.S. meat and poultry imports, including a ban on U.S. poultry in 2002 due to avian influenza concerns. Negotiations resolved the dispute in 2003, but exporters remain cautious of future safety concerns from Russia. Exporter concerns were reawakened in June 2008 when Russia announced it would block U.S. poultry imports by prohibiting the use of chlorine in antimicrobial washes. Russia's SPS standards are strict and not always based on science, creating difficulties for U.S. exporters. In 2003, Russia imposed quotas and TRQs for meat and poultry, causing opposition from the United States and other WTO member countries. They argued that Russia's actions violated the \"standstill\" principle of refraining from new trade restrictions during WTO accession. Russia defended its restrictions to protect domestic meat producers from import surges. In June 2005, the United States and Russia signed an agreement on livestock and poultry trade, setting quotas for poultry and TRQs for pork and beef. The agreement also established rules for veterinary permits and import licenses, as well as mechanisms for resolving trade-related issues. In November 2006, a bilateral market access agreement was reached between the United States and Russia in preparation for Russia's accession to the WTO, which included phased reductions in tariffs for various U.S. export sectors, including agricultural products. The U.S.-Russia 2006 bilateral market access agreement addressed various sensitive economic issues, including agriculture. It allowed for the immediate resumption of beef imports and accepted safety certifications for pork and poultry exports to Russia. The U.S. and Russia signed a protocol in December 2008 to continue U.S. poultry, pork, and beef exports to Russia until the end of 2009, adjusting quota levels for poultry and pork. The 2005 agreement set quota levels for poultry and pork exports to Russia, but did not address other trade issues. Russian officials threatened to reduce U.S. permits for poultry and pork imports and suspend trade agreements, citing lack of benefit to their economy. Putin mentioned that these suspensions could be reversed once Russia joined the WTO. In 2008-2010, U.S.-Russian livestock and poultry trade faced issues as Russia disputed USDA's authority to inspect and relist meat and poultry plants. Russia's actions threatened to block U.S. exports, including delisting major processors. USDA provides information on current export requirements to Russia. Russia implemented a ban on the use of chlorine in antimicrobial washes for poultry imports, citing food safety concerns including antimicrobial residues and chlorine rinses on U.S. meat exports. This led to reduced import quotas and delisting of U.S. pork processing companies, potentially impacting U.S. livestock and poultry exports to Russia. In 2008 and 2009, Russia refused meat imports from European countries and U.S. plants due to trace amounts of tetracycline and oxytetracycline in pork. By January 2010, nearly 30 U.S. plants were delisted for export to Russia, leading to a \"full market closure\" for the U.S. pork industry. Russia's strict \"zero tolerance\" on antimicrobial use is considered the most restrictive among U.S. trading partners. Additionally, in 2009, Russia imposed H1N1-related import restrictions on U.S. pork products. Russia imposed import restrictions on uncooked pork and pork products due to H1N1 in 2009. In October 2009, the restrictions were lifted for pork products from all countries. In March 2010, a new agreement was reached between the United States and Russia to reopen the Russian market to U.S. pork. U.S. plants must meet specific Russian microbiological and antibiotic residue requirements to export to Russia. USDA's AMS requires approval for pork exports to Russia, following specific EV programs. The ban was lifted for most U.S. plants in 2010, pending written confirmation. In late August 2008, Russia banned poultry shipments from 16 U.S. establishments due to safety issues uncovered during joint inspections. In March 2009, Russia temporarily suspended poultry imports from three U.S. processing plants for antibiotic residue concerns. The Russian Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service found higher levels of antibiotics and arsenic in products from delisted plants. The delisted U.S. processing plants had higher levels of antibiotics and arsenic than allowed by Russia. The U.S.-Russia poultry agreement does not require visits to U.S. poultry farms. Russia's Chief Medical Officer banned the use of chlorine in antimicrobial washes on poultry imports from the U.S. in 2008. Russia banned the use of chlorine in antimicrobial washes on poultry imports from the U.S. starting January 1, 2010, affecting all exporting countries including the United States. This action was expected to effectively ban all U.S. poultry exports to Russia due to the common use of pathogen reduction rinses in U.S. poultry production. The United States and Russia have been negotiating new restrictions on poultry exports to Russia, with discussions on alternative antimicrobial treatments. Progress was reported in late March 2010, with U.S. negotiators presenting safe treatment options to Russian counterparts. The EU also has a similar trade dispute with the U.S. over antimicrobial rinses on poultry. Members of Congress are closely monitoring negotiations between the United States and Russia regarding poultry exports. They have expressed concerns about trade disputes and proposed alternative measures to address issues such as antibiotic residues and chlorine rinses. Representative Slaughter has recommended proactive steps and legislation to resolve these trade issues. Representative Slaughter has introduced legislation in H.R. 1549 (PAMTA) to limit the use of medically significant antibiotics in animal production, similar to laws in other countries. A similar bill (S. 619) has been introduced in the Senate. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40739, Antibiotic Use in Agriculture: Background and Legislation."
