The \"Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of 2016\" requires the President to submit a cybersecurity report every 180 days on activities conducted by persons on behalf of the Government of Iran against the United States or its citizens. The report must include the identity of individuals involved in supporting these activities. The report mandated by the \"Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of 2016\" must include details on individuals involved in activities undermining cybersecurity, assessment of foreign government involvement, and a strategy to counter these activities. The report required under the \"Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of 2016\" must be submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. The President is mandated to include individuals on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list if they are involved in significant cybersecurity activities against the US government or its citizens. The President can exclude certain individuals from the sanctions list if reasons are provided to Congress. Sanctions will be imposed using Executive Order 13694 against those on the list for malicious cyber activities. The President must provide briefings to Congress on the implementation of sanctions against individuals involved in malicious cyber activities. The appropriate congressional committees include the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, as well as the House's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, Financial Services, and Ways and Means. Significant activities undermining cybersecurity include efforts to deny, disrupt, or destroy information systems, exfiltrate unauthorized information, destructive malware attacks, denial of service activities, and other significant activities outlined in regulations. The term \"United States person\" refers to an individual who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident, an entity organized under US laws or any jurisdiction within the US, including foreign branches, and any government entity at the federal, state, or local level."
