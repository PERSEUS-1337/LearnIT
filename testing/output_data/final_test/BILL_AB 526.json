    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Education Code allows school districts to offer advanced scholastic or vocational work to eligible pupils, with the goal of providing educational enrichment opportunities and facilitating a smoother transition to college. Pupils can attend a community college as special part-time or full-time students with parental consent. If a school district denies a highly gifted pupil's request for enrollment at a community college, they must provide a written recommendation within 60 days. The pupil will receive credit for completed community college courses based on the governing boards' determination. Principals can recommend pupils for community college summer sessions if they demonstrate adequate preparation in the discipline. Principals can recommend pupils for community college summer sessions if they demonstrate adequate preparation in the discipline and exhaust all opportunities to enroll in an equivalent course at their school. The recommendation should not exceed 5 percent of the total number of pupils who completed the grade before the recommendation. A high school pupil recommended by the principal for enrollment in a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) program course is not subject to the 5-percent limitation if certain criteria are met, such as the course being a lower division, college-level course for credit. The high school principal must provide data to the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges upon request. The course must be a college-level, occupational course with a priority code of \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d or \u201cC\u201d under the Student Accountability Model. It should be part of a vocational education sequence leading to a degree or certificate. Additionally, the course can assist high school seniors who have not passed the CAHSEE and do not offer college credit in English or math. The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges reports annually to the Department of Finance on high school seniors recommended to enroll in community college summer sessions. The Board of Governors does not include enrollment growth from these recommendations in its budget request. The act ensures timely availability of scholastic and vocational opportunities for pupils without interruption to ongoing programs. It becomes effective immediately as an urgency statute for public peace, health, and safety."
