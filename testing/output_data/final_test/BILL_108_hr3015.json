The Secretary will make payments to each State with an approved application for a controlled substance monitoring program. The amount allocated to each State is based on the number of pharmacies in the State compared to all States with approved applications. To apply for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application including a budget estimate for their monitoring program and proposed security standards for information handling. The State must submit an application with proposed standards for electronic format, information availability, database access, redisclosure, penalties, and compliance. The Secretary will approve or disapprove within 90 days. The Secretary will approve the State's application if they demonstrate the establishment of a controlled substance monitoring program. If the State fails to implement the program, the Secretary will give notice and withdraw approval if corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time. The funding agreement for receiving payments under this section requires States to give notice before discontinuing their controlled substance monitoring program. If approval is withdrawn or the program is ceased, the State must return a portion of the payment based on the remaining time period for expenditure. The State must comply with reporting requirements for a controlled substance monitoring program, including dispensers reporting each dispensing within a week. Certain exclusions apply to the reporting requirement. The reporting requirements for a controlled substance monitoring program include dispensers reporting each dispensing within a week. Exclusions to the reporting requirement include dispensing limited to treat the user for 48 hours or less and dispensing in accordance with other exclusions identified by the Secretary. Information to be reported includes the DEA Registration Number of the dispenser and the DEA Registration Number and name of the prescribing practitioner. The reporting requirements for a controlled substance monitoring program include details such as the practitioner's name, address, drug identification, quantity dispensed, refill information, dispensing dates, and prescription origin. Dispensers must report this information in the specified electronic format. The State must share information reported under the controlled substance monitoring program with another State if it involves dispensing to a resident of that State or a prescription from a practitioner in that State. The State can also notify authorities about potential drug diversion based on information in the database. The State must establish and maintain an electronic database for a controlled substance monitoring program, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of reported information. Security measures must be in place to protect the database's integrity and access. In implementing a controlled substance monitoring program, a State may provide information from the established database to practitioners for medical treatment purposes and to law enforcement authorities upon certification. The curr_chunk discusses the certification process for accessing information related to investigations or research involving controlled substances. This includes certification by authorities or agents of relevant departments or programs. The administration of a controlled substance monitoring program must limit information provided to the minimum necessary and cannot disclose individually identifiable information. The Secretary will specify a uniform electronic format for reporting and sharing information. The section provides rules of construction for the reporting and sharing of information in electronic format. It clarifies that authorities can still perform functions authorized by law, states can impose additional privacy protections, and certain confidentiality requirements must be met. Certain confidentiality requirements under part 2 of title 42 CFR must be followed. No federal private cause of action can be created. Information sharing is subject to HIPAA regulations. The Secretary has preference in awarding drug abuse-related grants from January 1, 2007. The Secretary gives preference to States with approved applications under this section for drug abuse-related grants. A study must be completed within 2 years to assess State progress in establishing controlled substance monitoring programs, feasibility of real-time electronic monitoring, and privacy protections for reported information. The establishment of a controlled substance monitoring program in each State receiving a grant is required, along with a comparison to privacy requirements for covered entities. States may establish an advisory council to assist in program implementation. In establishing an advisory council for a controlled substance monitoring program, States should consult with professional boards and interested parties. Definitions include terms like 'bona fide patient,' 'controlled substance,' 'dispense,' and 'dispenser.' The term 'dispenser' refers to individuals like physicians or pharmacists who provide controlled substances to users. A 'practitioner' includes licensed professionals who can distribute, dispense, or research controlled substances. 'State' refers to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, while an 'ultimate user' is someone who lawfully possesses a controlled substance. The section authorizes appropriations for carrying out the provision, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2006 to 2010. The House of Representatives passed the provision on October 5, 2004."
