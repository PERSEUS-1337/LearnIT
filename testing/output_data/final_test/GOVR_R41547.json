    "content": "Organized crime has become more complex in the last two decades, presenting challenges for U.S. federal law enforcement. Criminals have adapted by adopting networked structures, internationalizing their operations, and becoming more tech savvy. They now see international borders as opportunities, while law enforcement sees them as obstacles. This evolution has expanded criminals' tools and targets, making them more elusive. Law enforcement risks dealing only with the weakest criminals and easiest problems if they continue to operate by outdated rules. Organized crime has evolved in the last two decades, becoming more complex and challenging for law enforcement. Criminals now use networked structures, internationalize their operations, and exploit technological advances. They capitalize on commercial and technological advancements to move illegal proceeds globally and create ties between powerful figures. Modern organized crime prefers flexible cellular or networked models, making it harder for law enforcement to infiltrate and dismantle conspiracies. The Obama Administration issued its Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in 2011 to address the evolving nature of organized crime groups. These groups may outsource operations and form around short-term schemes, posing a strategic threat to national security. Law enforcement has shifted focus towards counterterrorism activities since 9/11, complicating efforts to combat transnational organized crime. The report analyzes how organized crime has adapted to globalization, utilizing borders and technology while impacting U.S. interests. It discusses law enforcement's approach to organized crime in the 21st century and potential issues for Congress, including national security threats and resource allocation for combating organized crime. The report discusses a broad conceptualization of organized crime, including various criminal groups like drug traffickers, mafia families, and violent gangs. It highlights the impact on U.S. interests and the evolving nature of organized crime structures. The cases and examples provided are meant to inform future legislation on organized crime. The report discusses the evolving nature of organized crime, with nimble, adaptive small groups using global reach to harm various interests. Commercial and technological innovations have facilitated this transformation, allowing for easy global movement of money through integrated financial systems. Money laundering is estimated to equal between 2% and 5% of world GDP annually. Organized crime groups exploit social disorder, inadequate policing, and poor governance in various nations, including the United States. They use immigrant communities as cover for their operations and are increasingly involved in high-tech crimes like identity theft and fraud. They take advantage of weaknesses in international transportation for their activities. Organized criminals exploit weaknesses in international transportation and customs security to smuggle goods, people, and information across borders. Despite enhanced border security measures post-9/11, specialized criminal networks continue to smuggle narcotics, counterfeit goods, stolen items, and bulk cash globally, including into the United States. They conceal their contraband within the increasing volume of legitimate global trade, with drug traffickers using containerized shipping to move cocaine from South America to Mexico for eventual distribution in the U.S. International counterfeiters use containers to smuggle fake goods into the United States, involving copycats, smugglers, and traffickers. Organized crime groups engage in counterfeiting and smuggling across U.S. borders, impacting Americans, businesses, and government. Counterfeiting shows the link between globalization and modern organized crime, with organized criminals deeply involved in these activities. Attorney General Holder emphasized the need for international law enforcement in combating this issue. Attorney General Holder highlighted the importance of combating international networks of organized criminals profiting from intellectual property crimes, such as counterfeiting and piracy. These activities do not require high entry costs and can be very lucrative, posing a threat to industries reliant on intellectual property rights for innovation and protection. Criminals can easily imitate branding and packaging with minimal infrastructure, impacting legitimate businesses and consumers. Counterfeiting and piracy pose a threat to businesses and consumers by flooding markets with inferior products. In FY2011, IPR-related law enforcement seizures in the US totaled $178.9 million, with 80% originating from China. International networks of organized criminals profit from intellectual property crimes, impacting industries reliant on innovation and protection. International automobile theft rings benefit from globalization, stealing vehicles in the United States and shipping them abroad to meet global demand for luxury cars. These operations target large U.S. metropolitan areas with diverse vehicle options and utilize rail or port facilities for transportation. In 2011, the Department of Justice (DOJ) took legal action against a money laundering network involved in these illicit activities. In 2011, the Department of Justice filed a civil suit against a money laundering network linked to Mexican drug traffickers and Hezbollah. The scheme involved used auto sales in the U.S., targeting the Lebanese Canadian Bank and two exchange houses. Over $300 million was allegedly part of the money laundering operation, with funds transferred to U.S. automobile buyers to purchase cars that were then shipped to West Africa and sold, with profits returned to Hezbollah. Criminal organizations exploit international migration for profit, including illegal immigration to the United States. Despite a decline in illegal immigration since 2007 due to factors like the global recession and increased border enforcement, criminal groups still take advantage of unauthorized immigrants' desire to enter the country. Networks of human smugglers, Mexican drug trafficking organizations, and others engage in various illicit activities such as human and weapon smuggling, counterfeiting, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion to bring unauthorized immigrants into the U.S. Cheng Chui Ping, also known as \"Sister Ping,\" was a key figure in an international human smuggling ring that operated from the early 1980s to April 2000. She initially used aircraft and fake documents to bring Chinese villagers into the United States but later switched to maritime shipping to smuggle larger groups. Ping took advantage of the increasing global cargo traffic to conceal her illegal activities and eventually managed to transport hundreds of victims at a time on cargo ships. Criminals smuggle individuals into the United States via cargo ships, hiding them below deck until reaching their destination. They may then exploit the victims by increasing their debts and forcing them into labor or sex trafficking. Human trafficking generates billions for organized crime annually, but estimates on the global scale of trafficking are questionable. International criminal organizations target both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals for forced labor and sex trafficking, exploiting victims' desires to live or work in other countries. Borders play a significant role in these crimes, with victims perceiving them as insurmountable barriers. While not prosecuted as traditional organized crime, cases like the exploitation of Thai nationals in forced labor highlight the dynamics of trafficking networks. The defendants allegedly exploited approximately 400 Thai workers in the United States through forced labor, confiscating their passports and threatening them with harm and deportation. In another case, individuals from the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala were involved in a sex trafficking organization targeting young Mexican women, luring them with false promises and forcing them into commercial sex. Asian organized crime groups are increasingly becoming involved in domestic human sex trafficking as pimps or brokers. In September 2012, the Obama Administration expanded anti-trafficking efforts, providing training and guidance to federal prosecutors, judges, and law enforcement. Cocaine has become a global commodity, with traffickers using international distribution networks to adapt to market changes. Colombian and Mexican suppliers have started using containerized shipping to transport cocaine. The Mexican Gulf Cartel smuggles illicit material using containerized shipping within global commerce. Cocaine availability in the United States has decreased due to diversion to European and Latin American markets, coca eradication efforts, and law enforcement pressure on cartels. In November 2012, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) extradited a criminal syndicate leader from Albania to the United States. Arif Kurti led an organization that imported marijuana and ecstasy into the United States from Canada, Mexico, and the Netherlands. Arif Kurti led a criminal syndicate that imported marijuana, ecstasy, and prescription pills into the United States from various countries. ICE also mentions the distribution of narcotics to Canada and Europe. Another case involved Phuong Thi Tran leading an Asian drug trafficking ring that smuggled ecstasy pills from Canada to the United States. Tran oversaw the operation that smuggled millions of ecstasy pills between 2002 and 2008. Making illegal gains appear legitimate is crucial for organized criminals. Criminals use various techniques to launder money, moving it across borders to hide its illegal origins. Money laundering involves placement, layering, and integration of illicit funds. In 2012, DOJ indicted 14 defendants, including Miguel Angel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, for laundering drug trafficking proceeds in the US through quarter horse racing. Trevi\u00f1o, a leader in Los Zetas, was involved in the scheme since 2008. Jos\u00e9 Trevino, brother of Los Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, was indicted for laundering drug proceeds through quarter horse racing in the US. He used front companies to conceal the origin of the money, with estimates suggesting Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations earn billions annually from sales in the US. The exact amount laundered by organized criminals impacting the US is unclear. Mexican traffickers use various methods to move and launder money, including bulk cash smuggling, stored-value cards, digital currency accounts, e-businesses, online games, and mobile payments. These methods help them avoid detection and facilitate the transfer of illegal earnings across the border. Organized criminals utilize bank accounts, credit cards, and offshore locations with strict privacy laws like Panama for money laundering. They exploit the global financial system to hide illicit profits, using shell companies to obscure ownership of assets. This poses challenges for law enforcement in determining the true source of funds. Shell companies, legal entities with no independent operations or assets, exist on paper and are used for various purposes like obtaining financing. The DOJ finds U.S.-based shell companies hard to investigate due to lax company formation laws, allowing criminals to quickly and cheaply form them with virtual anonymity. Criminals use U.S.-based shell companies to conceal ownership, taking advantage of states that do not require owner information during formation or reporting. Criminals distance themselves from forming shell companies by using agents. Shell companies help move money globally through legitimate accounts discreetly. Criminal organizations can easily create multiple shell companies worldwide to hide illegal profits. Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and Eurasian crime figure Semion Mogilevich likely used U.S. shell companies for money laundering. Organized crime groups have adapted to include technology-driven fraud in their operations, posing a threat to U.S. citizens without physical presence. Organized crime groups engage in tech-savvy mass marketing frauds, including illegal gambling activities that have shifted to the Internet. The Lucchese family earned billions through offshore Internet gambling facilitated by Brian Cohen. The International Mass-Marketing Fraud Working Group defines mass marketing fraud as schemes using mass communications media like the Internet. Fraud schemes use mass-communications media to solicit money from multiple victims globally. Perpetrators can be individuals, groups, or criminal enterprises. In December 2012, an international cyber fraud ring was busted, defrauding victims of over $3 million. A cyber fraud ring defrauded victims of over $3 million by creating false advertisements for non-existent merchandise on websites like eBay.com and Cars.com. The group used sham sellers with elaborate back stories, fake websites, and fraudulent documents to trick consumers. They also employed \"boiler room\" scams, making high-pressure deceptive pitches to customers globally. Criminals have adapted by outsourcing activities and internationalizing their operations. Since the 1970s, criminal organizations have evolved their fraud schemes by outsourcing to specialists, going international, and using sophisticated communication strategies. The Cosa Nostra and other criminals utilize boiler rooms, like one raided by the FBI in 2010 involving Anthony Guarino. This operation targeted elderly investors, with 40% of funds going to the operators as commissions. Advance fee fraud (AFF) has been revolutionized by technology, now often involving spam emails requesting initial cash payments from recipients. Advance fee fraud (AFF) scams typically request an initial cash payment from recipients, promising a larger sum of money that never arrives. A recent AFF email scam impersonating the FBI's Detroit Field Office asked for $14,300 in exchange for releasing over $18 million to recipients. These scams, also known as \"419 scams,\" originated in Nigeria in the 1970s and have evolved over time. Wealthy English business owners were asked to help pay for a rescue mission in Spain in exchange for a share of a promised reward, which never materialized. Nigerian fraudsters in the late 1970s and early 1980s initiated advance fee fraud (AFF) schemes by sending unsolicited letters seeking financial assistance to transfer funds out of West African countries. With the advent of fax machines, the scams reached more victims easily, and the internet and email further expanded AFF operations globally. Recent estimates indicate that AFF networks may have defrauded over $2 billion from U.S. companies and citizens in 2009. Organized criminals have adapted to the digital age by becoming expert at stealing information electronically and defrauding victims in the virtual world. Criminal groups operating in cyberspace can be categorized as part-timers or full-time scammers who leverage digital means to dupe individuals and businesses. Today's AFF networks only need to deceive 1% of their targets to turn a profit, with estimates showing that these networks have defrauded billions of dollars from U.S. companies and citizens. Organized criminals in cyberspace are divided into part-timers and full-timers, with the latter specializing in online crimes. General statistics show that organized criminals are heavily involved in online data theft, accounting for 83% of breaches in businesses globally in 2011. They steal identities, engage in advanced credit card fraud, and target online consumers. In California, Eurasian criminals engaged in technologically advanced credit card fraud, targeting a gas station in Redondo Beach and stealing over $300,000 from more than 1,000 victims, including police officers. In Las Vegas in 2008, an Armenian criminal group skimmed over 1,000 credit and debit cards, manufacturing their own cards using stolen information, resulting in losses of $1.5 million. In 2009, another skimming scheme was uncovered with a credit card manufacturing lab. The leader of a large identity theft and retail hacking ring, Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2010 for hacking into credit card payment systems at retailers. In 2010, Albert Gonzalez was sentenced to 20 years in prison for hacking into credit card payment systems at various retailers, leading to the theft of over 40 million credit and debit card numbers. The organized retail crime involved conspirators from the United States, Ukraine, and Estonia who laundered their proceeds through banks in Eastern Europe. This criminal activity bore similarities to organized crime, involving large-scale retail theft and fraud by professional shoplifters. Organized retail crime involves a variety of thefts such as gift card fraud and ticket switching. Stolen merchandise is resold through fencing operations like flea markets and online marketplaces. Street fences sell goods directly or to mid-level fences who clean and repackage stolen items. Globalization and technology have shifted transactions online. E-fencing has become a popular method for criminals to sell stolen goods online, increasing anonymity and profitability. Criminals can make more money through e-fencing compared to traditional physical fencing locations. An example is a criminal network in Baltimore that used both traditional and advanced fencing techniques. Several individuals, including pawn shop owners, pleaded guilty in an organized retail crime ring involving the theft of products from retailers like Target, Safeway, Wal-Mart, and Kohl's. Stolen goods were sold to pawn shops, cleaned, and resold at other locations or online. The scheme involved about $20 million in stolen goods. Colombian traffickers in the 1990s began using semisubmersible maritime smuggling vessels for narcotics trafficking. Semisubmersibles are used by Colombian traffickers for narcotics trafficking due to being impractical, costly, and risky to operate. These craft have small above-water profiles and can unload cargo in shallow waters or be transported to shore by small boats. The global availability of expertise, designs, and materials, along with vast illicit cocaine markets, have enabled traffickers to profit and evade law enforcement. Semisubmersibles are used by Colombian traffickers for narcotics trafficking, accounting for 27% of cocaine movement towards the United States. Law enforcement has seized these vessels since 2006, with the Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act of 2008 enhancing prosecution. In 2010, police in Ecuador seized a fully submerged fiberglass submarine designed for drug smuggling. The diesel-powered, twin-screw sub was a significant advancement in technology, capable of carrying 10 tons of cocaine on a 10-day voyage. Mexican drug traffickers have turned to ultralight aircraft to smuggle drugs across the Southwest border, flying low to avoid detection. Some use drop baskets to release drug packages, picked up by local gangs or traffickers. Mexican drug traffickers use underground tunnels to smuggle drugs into the United States, increasing in sophistication. Early tunnels were basic, dug on the Mexican side and emerging close to the U.S. border. More advanced tunnels utilize existing infrastructure, like the one shared by Nogales, AZ. Mexican drug traffickers use sophisticated underground tunnels to smuggle drugs into the United States, with some tapping into storm drains or sewage systems. These tunnels can have rail, ventilation, and electrical systems, like the one discovered in Otay Mesa, CA in 2006, stretching nearly three-quarters of a mile and containing over two tons of marijuana. In 2010, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force uncovered a 600-yard passageway from Tijuana to Otay Mesa, seizing about 30 tons of marijuana. Law enforcement faces challenges in detecting drug smuggling tunnels along the Southwest border. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is used, but its effectiveness is limited by soil conditions, tunnel diameter, and depth. Over 150 tunnels have been found since the 1990s, primarily in Arizona and California, with more than 75 discovered since 2006. Law enforcement uses sonic equipment and seismic technologies to detect tunnel construction and blasts. Technology is not reliable in detecting sophisticated tunnels; human intelligence and tips are more effective. Criminal organizations operate in immigrant communities for cover and leverage Internet connectivity for global operations. In October 2010, 73 individuals were indicted in the largest Medicare fraud case. The Mirzoyan-Terdjanian organization, an Armenian criminal group, ran fake clinics in 25 states with leadership in Los Angeles and New York City. They exploited the immigrant population from the former Soviet Union, billing Medicare for over $163 million in fraudulent services. The Mirzoyan-Terdjanian organization, an Armenian criminal group, billed Medicare for over $163 million in fraudulent medical services, reaping $35 million in profits. The operation involved stolen identities of doctors and patients, with 118 fake clinics across 25 states. FBI described it as a \"virtual\" scheme with no real medical facilities, just stolen identities. Armen Kazarian was linked to the scheme and arrested in Los Angeles. Armen Kazarian, a vor v zakone, had significant influence in the criminal underworld. He obtained asylum in the US by lying to authorities and mediated disputes for the Mirzoyan-Terdjanian group. Kazarian pled guilty to racketeering in July 2011. The organization, mostly Armenian nationals, sent criminal proceeds to Armenia for real estate and businesses. In a separate case, five Ukrainian brothers were charged with extortion and racketeering in June 2010 for trafficking Ukrainians into the US for exploitation in cleaning crews. The DOJ uncovered a scheme where brothers exploited immigrants in cleaning crews across several states, withholding pay, threatening violence, and even committing rape. In another case, Chinese citizens were sentenced for exploiting Chinese women in massage parlors by confiscating their documents and using them fraudulently. West African criminal networks specializing in human trafficking operate in various countries, including the United States. They exploit women by confiscating their identification documents and forcing them to work long hours in massage parlors, where they are also forced to provide sexual services. Some criminals are now operating independently and sending their illegal profits back to their home countries. The traditional image of organized crime with hierarchies and codes still exists, but some criminals are now retaining their gains independently. Criminal organizations like the Cosa Nostra have traditionally had strong hierarchical structures, but in recent years, the criminal underworld has shifted towards decentralized and flexible network models. This shift has led to the emergence of brokers and agents who play a more significant role in the drug trade than traditional \"kingpins.\" These networks operate across borders, with varying compositions and activities depending on markets and circumstances. The public's perception of smugglers is still influenced by images of cartels and syndicates, but the reality is more complex and fluid. Criminals have internationalized their operations in the last two decades, utilizing networks that are decentralized and outsourced. Global businesses and criminal organizations now involve individuals or groups outside their core, often separated by long distances. The efficiency of the Internet and technological advances has led to more offshore criminal activities. The Internet and advances in transportation have led criminals to conduct more offshore business. Organized crime now operates in decentralized networks, with networked structures shielding criminals from law enforcement. Illicit networks follow two models, including \"hub and spoke\" networks. Illicit networks can broadly follow two models: \"Hub and spoke\" networks involve peripheral nodes connected to a leadership core, while \"Chain\" networks involve linear flow of information or goods without a central command. These networks can adapt quickly to changes and lack membership requirements or loyalty tests, making it easy to recruit specialists and shift allegiances opportunistically. Some criminal groups combine hierarchical structures with networked characteristics, flattening leadership arrangements and outsourcing activities. Mexican drug cartels in the United States rely on networks for trafficking, while U.S. gangs transport narcotics and procure weapons for cartels. Prison gangs form alliances with Mexican DTOs, such as the Barrio Azteca gang partnering with the Ju\u00e1rez cartel in smuggling marijuana. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel partners with criminal organizations to smuggle drugs across the Southwest border, embodying characteristics of both hierarchical and networked structures. Law enforcement faces challenges in combating agile drug cartels due to bureaucratic hurdles and interagency coordination issues. The evolving illicit world requires a shift in law enforcement strategies to effectively deal with sophisticated criminal networks. Law enforcement faces challenges in combating drug cartels due to bureaucratic hurdles, interagency coordination issues, legal constraints, and ambiguous incentive structures. Investigating organized criminal groups with extraterritorial jurisdiction constraints poses additional difficulties. Jurisdictional issues can present diplomatic and practical challenges for law enforcement. The network structure of criminal organizations presents challenges for law enforcement, with strengths also acting as weaknesses. Decentralization can hinder strategy development, slow decision-making, and lead to excessive risk-taking. Maintaining networks requires time-consuming relationship-building efforts. Criminal networks may attract participants from the licit realm. Some criminal networks recruit individuals from legitimate sectors for their specialized skills, providing logistical advantages in a globalized, high-tech era. Corrupt individuals in legal jobs offer criminals clean assets, sensitive information, and legitimacy. Globalization makes it challenging to disprove a criminal's legitimate business claims, especially across multiple jurisdictions. Organized criminals aim to integrate legitimate individuals into their operations through various perspectives. Criminal organizations recruit individuals from legitimate sectors for specialized skills, offering logistical advantages in a globalized, high-tech era. Corrupt individuals in legal jobs provide clean assets, sensitive information, and legitimacy to criminals. Globalization complicates disproving criminal's legitimate business claims across multiple jurisdictions. Organized criminals aim to integrate legitimate individuals into their operations through various perspectives. Viktar Krus operated a network that illegally brought foreign workers into the United States, relying on legitimate facilitators like Beth Ann Broyles, an Illinois immigration attorney who prepared fraudulent immigration petitions. Broyles claimed ignorance of criminal activity initially but rationalized her participation by believing she was assisting immigrants. Viktar Krus operated a network that brought in 3,800 immigrants illegally to work in the service sector and industrial jobs in the Norfolk, VA, region and elsewhere in the United States. He evaded taxes, grossed $34 million, and forced people to live in overcrowded conditions. Beth Ann Broyles, an immigration attorney, assisted in preparing fraudulent immigration petitions, claiming she was helping immigrants. Krus received a seven-year prison sentence for conspiracy, tax fraud, visa fraud, and money laundering. The Tran organization cheated casinos out of $7 million by bribing card dealers and supervisors. The Tran organization cheated casinos out of over $7 million by bribing card dealers and supervisors to rig games. They used advanced tools like hidden transmitters and custom software to predict card outcomes. Victor Kaganov was prosecuted for running an illegal money transmitting business in Oregon. The Tran organization cheated casinos out of over $7 million by bribing card dealers and supervisors to rig games using advanced tools. Victor Kaganov opened shell corporations in Oregon for Russian clients, moving over $172 million through wire transactions to over 50 countries. This criminal activity highlights services that organized criminals could use to launder money, posing a risk from Russian organized crime enhancing state actors' abilities in various markets. Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, with alleged ties to organized crime, struggled to maintain a U.S. visa despite his massive fortune. He has faced claims of criminal connections for years but has never been convicted. Deripaska, a Russian billionaire with alleged ties to organized crime, has faced accusations for years but has never been convicted. His difficulty obtaining a U.S. visa may have affected U.S. bankers' participation in an IPO for his aluminum company, UC Rusal. Similarly, Stanley Ho, a billionaire casino magnate from Macau, has denied ties to organized crime despite suspicions of links to Chinese criminal groups. These suspicions resurfaced in 2009 and 2010 involving his daughter, Pansy, and a casino venture in Macau. New Jersey gaming regulators raised concerns about MGM's ties to the Ho family, jeopardizing its 50% share in the Borgata. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement recommended both Pansy and Stanley Ho be deemed \"unsuitable persons\" due to their connections to organized crime. In March 2010, MGM decided to sell its interest in the Borgata rather than sever ties with Pansy Ho, who has direct, substantial, and continuing business and financial ties to her father. Organized criminals target individuals with specific skills or access to information for their schemes. In August 2010, Vitaly Fedorchuk was sentenced to 46 months in prison for leading a criminal organization that fraudulently procured Ohio driver's licenses for foreign nationals, with the help of a corrupt employee. In August 2010, Vitaly Fedorchuk was sentenced to 46 months in prison for leading a criminal organization that fraudulently procured Ohio driver's licenses for foreign nationals with the help of a corrupt employee, Sonya Hilaszek. Hilaszek also pled guilty and received a 33-month prison sentence for producing documents for 300-500 individuals, many from Ukraine or Uzbekistan, charging $1,500-$3,000 per document. Fedorchuk's group also worked with criminals in Ukraine to obtain non-immigrant visas from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, charging $12,000 per visa. The DHS reported a rise in corruption cases at Customs and Border Protection from 245 in FY2006 to 731 in FY2011. The number of corruption cases reported by the DHS Office of Inspector General increased from 245 in FY2006 to 731 in FY2011, indicating a growing challenge for federal law enforcement combating smuggling and trafficking along the border. To prevent corruption, federal agencies vet potential employees, with 60% of CBP applicants failing polygraph exams due to prior drug use or criminal histories. Two cases highlight the potential for corruption by organized crime along the Southwest border, including a former CBP technician involved in smuggling operations for a criminal organization. Organized crime poses a significant public security concern, endangering people, businesses, and property. A former CBP officer, Jose Raul Montano, Jr., was sentenced to 140 months in prison for bribery, cocaine trafficking, and alien smuggling at the Brownsville Gateway Port of Entry. He allowed Mexican drug traffickers and alien smugglers to transport drugs and people into the US without inspection in exchange for bribes. The National Intelligence Council highlighted the threat of international organized crime in 1995. The 2010 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on international organized crime highlighted its evolution into a national security concern. The Department of Justice (DOJ) identified five broad categories of national security threats posed by international organized crime, including influencing state institutions, threatening the global economy through illegal business practices, and engaging in cybercrimes. Alleged Eurasian mob boss Semion Mogilevich, wanted by the FBI for leading a financial scheme defrauding investors of $150 million, partnered with terrorist organizations and expanded drug trafficking reach through alliances with criminal organizations. Semion Mogilevich, a reputed mob boss, is suspected of money laundering and swindling investors. He has ties to Eastern European natural gas markets and uses his illicit gains to influence governments. Despite being arrested for tax evasion, Mogilevich was released on an oath not to flee. Organized crime poses threats to public and national security, but its scope is challenging to fully assess. Organized crime is a collection of illicit activities committed by loosely connected groups, making it difficult to define and combat. The 2011 Strategy highlighted transnational organized crime as a national security concern, but its impact on policy remains uncertain. Policymakers may review the strategy to assess the adequacy of the definition and its implications. The 2011 Strategy defines transnational organized crime as self-perpetuating associations operating internationally for illegal gains, protected by corruption or violence. Criminal structures vary from hierarchies to networks, with crimes ranging in nature. Transnational organized criminals commit various crimes, including violence and intimidation, exploiting differences between countries for economic gain and influence in government, politics, and commerce. They aim to enrich their organization, expand power, and avoid detection through their organizational structure. The term \"transnational organized crime\" (TOC) involves three key elements: transnationality, organization, and crime. The 2011 Strategy's definition of TOC addresses these elements but lacks details on factors like residence, product provenance, and supply chain complexity that determine the level of transnationality. Members of a transnational criminal group can reside in multiple countries, making it a transnational network, while residence in a single country with some activities abroad also qualifies as transnational. The concept of transnational organized crime involves elements of transnationality, organization, and criminal activities. It raises questions about what constitutes a group as transnational, such as controlling bank accounts in one country while committing crimes in another or handling illicit products with foreign origins domestically. The complexity lies in determining the level of transnationality based on factors like residence and product provenance. The complexity of transnational organized crime involves managing illicit product routes and the resources expended in moving them, such as bribing officials and developing infrastructure. This raises the question of how the level of transnationality is measured within a criminal group. The level of transnationality in a criminal network raises questions about how the U.S. government perceives it as a threat. The definition of transnational organized crime lacks clear criteria for what constitutes an \"organized\" network, particularly in terms of routine cooperation and size. The definition of transnational organized crime lacks clear criteria for what constitutes an \"organized\" network, particularly in terms of routine cooperation and size. Low thresholds for these baselines may render the concept of \"organization\" meaningless, allowing almost any criminal activity involving more than one individual to be defined as \"organized.\" The 2011 Strategy broadly describes the activities transnational groups engage in to turn profits and protect themselves, such as violence, exploiting differences between countries, and gaining influence in legitimate sectors. The 2011 Strategy outlines 10 areas of illicit activity where transnational organized crime poses a threat to national and international security, including penetration of state institutions, drug trafficking, human smuggling, and cybercrime. The influence of this definition on federal law enforcement investigations remains uncertain due to its broad scope and involvement of multiple agencies. The 10 areas outlined in the 2011 Strategy encompass various crimes, including drug and weapons trafficking, financial fraud, and identity theft. Federal investigative programs have been developed to combat these crimes without specifically labeling them as \"organized crime.\" Differentiating among transnational criminal actors based on the severity of their crimes is not clearly defined in the Strategy, posing challenges in assessing the threat they pose to U.S. national security. The 2011 Strategy outlines various crimes, including drug and weapons trafficking, financial fraud, and identity theft. It does not clearly differentiate among transnational criminal actors based on the severity of their crimes, posing challenges in assessing the threat they pose to U.S. national security. The strategy potentially targets a wide range of criminals, from a 15-year-old gang member to a powerful international mobster. A threat assessment rubric could guide federal efforts in narrowing down the targets. The Administration's efforts supporting the strategy involve some calculation of threat, as seen in the responsibility of the interagency \"Threat Mitigation Working Group\" to identify transnational networks presenting a high national security risk. The 2011 Strategy aims to target transnational criminal networks posing a high national security risk. The selection process for these networks is unclear, but it involves assessing threats and imposing sanctions on significant groups. However, determining the extent of harm caused by transnational organized crime and the allocation of federal resources for combating it remains challenging. The 2011 Strategy targets transnational criminal networks with high national security risks. However, there are questions about how resources are allocated, which federal agencies are responsible, and how threats are prioritized. Without clear answers, Congress may struggle to enhance the government's ability to combat organized crime. There is currently no statutory definition of organized crime, but past legislation has defined it as the unlawful activities of a highly organized group involved in illegal goods and services. The definition of organized crime includes various illegal activities such as gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, narcotics, and labor racketeering. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions describe organized crime in terms of an \"enterprise\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" with predicate offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a71961. However, RICO does not provide a clear distinction between criminal and legal enterprises. Currently, there is no statutory definition of organized crime, with RICO provisions describing it in terms of an \"enterprise\" and a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" However, there is limited guidance on the nature of criminal organizations and their operational structure. There is a disconnect between RICO provisions and federal law enforcement's view on organized crime. RICO lists various criminal activities, but law enforcement may not consider drug trafficking or DTOs as organized crime. A federal definition of organized crime may not fully address this issue. Congress may need to address the lack of centralized statutes specifically targeting organized crime in the U.S. Criminal Code, despite it being a significant threat to national security. This could potentially change how law enforcement approaches and investigates organized crime, as the current lack of clarity on what constitutes organized crime hinders accurate assessment of its impact on public and national security. Accurately gauging the public and national security threat posed by organized crime is complicated without a solid notion of the harm it causes. Congressional concern about organized crime dates back to the 1950s, leading to legislative efforts, commissions, and hearings to gather information on its scope. Examples include the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce in 1950-1951, Senate hearings in 1958 and 1963, and the 1967 Commission on Crime in the United States. Congressional attention has shifted away from traditional crime fighting since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since 9/11, congressional focus has shifted from traditional crime to counterterrorism. Recent hearings on organized crime have mainly centered on Mexican DTO threats. However, other organized crime groups also pose serious threats to the US, impacting economic stability and public safety. Congress may consider convening a commission to evaluate the scope of organized crime and assess law enforcement tools. The Administration has proposed a legislative package related to the 2011 Strategy, prompting Congress to explore transnational organized crime more extensively. Some argue that the shift in law enforcement attention towards counterterrorism since 9/11 has diverted resources from traditional crime fighting activities. Organized crime has wide-ranging impacts on economic stability, public health, safety, and national security. Experts suggest providing incentives, such as federal grants, to encourage law enforcement to allocate more resources towards investigating and prosecuting organized crime. Grant programs like the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) could be utilized for this purpose. Experts suggest creating a specific grant program to combat organized crime, providing funding, training, and technical assistance. One proposal is to implement a peer review system to incentivize law enforcement agencies to focus on organized crime. Congress could consider establishing a domestic peer review system for agencies investigating organized crime, tying participation to funding eligibility. The national strategy to combat organized crime may involve oversight by federal law enforcement agencies. Coordination among various agencies is a critical issue, as there is no single lead agency for investigating organized crime. Different agencies have jurisdiction based on the type of criminal violations involved, such as the DEA for drug trafficking cases and ICE for human trafficking cases. Organized crime cases can involve multiple investigative agencies like USSS, FBI, and ICE. Lack of clear agency lead can cause conflicts and hinder effective communication. Fusion centers like OCDETF Fusion Center aim to improve coordination in investigations. The OCDETF Fusion Center, IOC-2, and EPIC are intelligence centers that consolidate and disseminate information on organized crime. Various federal agencies, including DEA, FBI, and ATF, participate in the OCDETF Program targeting drug trafficking and money laundering. The IOC-2, created in 2009, brings together the FBI and other federal agencies at the OFC. The IOC-2, established in May 2009, is housed at the OFC and includes various federal agencies such as the FBI, ICE, DEA, and IRS. It aims to analyze and resolve conflicts in information on organized crime cases beyond drug trafficking, but it has yet to be funded. EPIC, originally focused on drug, alien, and weapon smuggling, expanded its mission to include counterterrorism after 9/11. EPIC, jointly operated by the DEA and CBP, combats organized crime and terrorism. Participating agencies include ICE, USCG, FBI, and others. Congress may consider supporting intelligence fusion centers like EPIC for sharing organized crime intelligence effectively. One option for combating organized crime is to create an interagency organization similar to the National Counterterrorism Center, focused on analyzing and sharing information to ensure unity of effort. The DOJ has consolidated various units to harmonize the prosecution of organized crime and gang cases. Congress may consider enforcing oversight to coordinate federal law enforcement efforts against organized crime. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General reviewed EPIC and found areas for improvement in fully developing the National Seizure System, coordinating the HIDTA program, maintaining current information, and creating objective performance measures. Additionally, the OIG found that the National Gang Intelligence Center had not created a gang information database as directed by Congress."
