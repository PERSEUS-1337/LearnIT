    "content": "Taiwan's participation in the International Criminal Police Organization is addressed in Section 1. Congress finds that safety, security, and peace are crucial for all citizens worldwide. Shared information among police authorities through INTERPOL is essential for combating criminal activities and promoting peace. INTERPOL's role, dating back to 1914, is to facilitate mutual assistance between criminal police authorities within legal limits. Ongoing international threats highlight the need for nations to collaborate in combating criminal activity. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL since 1984 hinders its access to the global police communications system. Taiwan lacks access to INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, relying on second-hand information from friendly nations like the United States. This hinders Taiwan's ability to share crucial information on criminals and suspicious activities globally, posing a risk to international crime-fighting efforts. The United States has expressed support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. Taiwan has been granted observer status at the World Health Assembly and has contributed significantly to pandemic control efforts. The President is developing a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and related meetings. The President is instructed to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and related activities. A report describing the US strategy and efforts to promote Taiwan's bid for observer status must be submitted to Congress within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The President will take actions to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and related meetings and activities. The House of Representatives passed the document on November 2, 2015, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
