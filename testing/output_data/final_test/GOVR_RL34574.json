    "content": "Detection and protection against illicit acquisition and use of special nuclear material (SNM) is a longstanding concern of the U.S. government. Federal agencies have been securing U.S. nuclear assets against diversion, theft, and attack since the development of nuclear weapons. Efforts to track, detect, and secure nuclear materials domestically and abroad are in place to prevent terrorists or non-state actors from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Intelligence gathering and law enforcement activities are crucial in preventing terrorist or non-state nuclear attacks within the United States. The federal government has implemented programs to detect and interdict illicit nuclear and radiological materials, focusing on preventing nuclear terrorism within the United States. These efforts aim to disrupt the formation and action of groups acquiring nuclear materials, with overlapping goals but different approaches to improve detection and security. The federal government has implemented programs within various departments to improve the detection and security of nuclear materials. These agencies have national and international roles in nuclear defense, protecting domestic assets and aiding in securing foreign nuclear material. Programs established by the Departments of Defense and Energy focus on the security of nuclear materials, while the DOE International Nuclear Materials Protection and Cooperation program aids in securing foreign special nuclear material. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency has enhanced the security and safety of fissile material storage. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has improved security for fissile material storage and transportation in the former Soviet Union. Programs focus on detecting nuclear and radiological materials during transit to prevent illicit transport of nuclear weapons. Various agencies work on establishing detection capabilities at ports, border crossings, and other designated locations. Additionally, efforts are made to detect nuclear and radiological materials in transit towards the United States, either at foreign ports or at the U.S. border. The DHS expanded radiation detection capabilities at ports and border crossings to prevent illicit transport of nuclear materials. Initiatives like the Container Security Initiative and Secure Freight Initiative aim to increase detection and interdiction of nuclear weapons. The federal government's efforts to detect and interdict nuclear material during shipping were criticized for being uncoordinated post-9/11. The establishment of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office aimed to centralize coordination in response to the nuclear terrorism threat. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was established within the Department of Homeland Security to centralize coordination of the federal response to nuclear threats. The office was given statutory authority by the SAFE Port Act to develop a global nuclear detection architecture in collaboration with other key departments. The Secretary of Defense retains responsibility for implementing Department of Defense requirements within and outside the United States, while the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy maintain their respective roles in guiding and implementing the global nuclear detection architecture. Coordinating federal efforts to protect against nuclear threats involves identifying overlaps and gaps, integrating current and future efforts, and complying with applicable laws and international agreements. The SAFE Port Act requires DNDO to establish an \"enhanced global nuclear detection architecture,\" which can be interpreted in various ways. DNDO describes it as a multi-layered structure of rad/nuc detection systems deployed domestically and overseas, with a network of interrelationships and systems engineering-based principles. The DNDO established an enhanced global nuclear detection architecture, involving a net assessment of federal nuclear detection capabilities and coordination of 72 programs with total funding exceeding $2.2 billion in FY2006. This architecture includes programs from various agencies and aims to streamline disparate systems into a cohesive framework. The DNDO has organized programs into a global nuclear detection architecture framework, relying heavily on technology like radiation detectors at entry points and border crossings. This architecture includes site security, data use for decision-making, reaction to detection events, and interdiction. According to the Government Accountability Office, combating nuclear smuggling requires an integrated approach with equipment and proper training for border security personnel. The DNDO has organized programs into a global nuclear detection architecture framework, emphasizing the use of radiation detectors at entry points and border crossings. Experts recommend integrating radiation detectors with other federal efforts, prioritizing identified threats, and organizing a global approach. The framework consists of three geographically distinguished layers with nine sub-layers, aiming to identify gaps and duplication in capabilities. The global nuclear detection architecture involves multiple agency initiatives and programs to achieve its goals, with effectiveness dependent on factors outside DNDO's control. Categorizing existing programs helps identify gaps for potential adversaries to exploit, which can be addressed by redirecting efforts, deploying technology, and implementing research programs. A layered defense-in-depth approach to global nuclear detection architecture is recommended to protect DOD assets against unconventional nuclear threats. This strategy acknowledges that no single layer of protection can be completely successful, but multiple layers increase the likelihood of threat detection through different detection opportunities. For example, if a threat bypasses an outer layer detector, it may be detected by an inner layer detector. This approach enhances detection capabilities and security measures. The DNDO aims to enhance global nuclear detection architecture by incorporating redundancy in detection technology at U.S. borders and random truck screening at weigh stations. This includes integrating fixed and mobile detection systems into commercial vehicle inspections, law enforcement activities, and special event screenings. Additional operational costs may be required for mobile teams sweeping areas of concern, chokepoint screening at bridges and tunnels, roadway monitoring, and reducing risks from small maritime craft pathways. This layered approach increases the likelihood of threat detection through different opportunities. The use of different detection technologies or procedures in layered systems increases the likelihood of success in detecting nuclear smuggling. Detection can occur through radiation equipment, intelligence information, and police investigations. A layered system provides multiple detection opportunities and interdiction steps, enhancing the chances of detecting terrorist activities. The global nuclear detection architecture aims to increase detection and interdiction opportunities for terrorist groups, making it harder for them to evade detection. The integration of different detection systems and data layers enhances the capability to detect nuclear threats. The global nuclear detection architecture aims to integrate detection and notification systems at various levels, requiring harmonization of procedures, technology, and data formats. It provides a framework for analyzing the effectiveness of federal nuclear detection efforts, allowing for measurement and judgment of programs within the overall structure. Decision makers may need a methodology and metrics for each layer or sublayer to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. The DNDO utilizes the global nuclear detection architecture framework to identify gaps in detection capabilities and plans to validate a risk- and cost-based assessment methodology in 2008. Studies were requested by the DHS S&T Directorate in 2004 for the development of an analytic framework and appropriate metrics, which were transferred to DNDO in 2005. Additional studies on general aviation and maritime pathways have expanded the basis for assessing investments in the global nuclear detection architecture. The global nuclear detection architecture is assessed based on analytic frameworks, which determine the utility of existing programs. An analytic framework derived solely from existing programs may not adequately consider the potential contributions of new programs. Concerns also exist regarding the ability of the methodology to reflect the effects of both large and small changes within the multi-billion dollar enterprise. The global nuclear detection architecture is a multi-billion dollar enterprise with numerous programs. An analytic methodology that encompasses all programs but lacks detail may not capture the impact of incremental changes. Experts suggest deploying radiation detection sensors at specific sites and ports of entry to enhance security. Analyzing selected components of the architecture, rather than the entire system, may improve the analytical methodology. Optimizing individual components of the global nuclear detection architecture may not optimize the overall system. The DNDO takes a systems engineering approach to develop the architecture, focusing on overall performance rather than individual programs. Treating the architecture as a \"system of systems\" requires clear metrics for efficient development. The DNDO faces challenges in identifying appropriate metrics for evaluating the global nuclear detection architecture. Outcome-oriented metrics like resolving false positives or finding threats may not effectively judge architecture effectiveness. Metrics based on existing architecture analysis may also have difficulties if the current system lacks detection capability. Incremental improvements may not lead to sufficient coverage. Global risk understanding is necessary for more desirable measures like risk reduction. The DNDO is working on identifying gaps in the global nuclear detection architecture to reduce vulnerabilities. Determining acceptable detection levels and geographic coverage is a challenge. Solutions are being developed to address these gaps, but the sufficiency of existing capabilities is open to debate. The nature of the terrorist nuclear threat adds complexity to this assessment. The effectiveness of the global nuclear detection architecture may need to evolve as the terrorist nuclear threat changes. Active testing or \"red teaming\" of the architecture is crucial to assess its capabilities accurately. Testing must align with the intended threat scenario to provide meaningful results. The DNDO plans to validate the results of \"red teaming\" exercises by conducting various assessments, including scenario-based and capabilities-based assessments. Gaps and vulnerabilities in the global nuclear detection architecture may be addressed now or in the future through research and development. Key long-term challenges and vulnerabilities in the detection architecture require attention. Key challenges and vulnerabilities in the global nuclear detection architecture require long-term, high-risk research programs to reduce risks and costs. Policymakers face decisions on investing in near-term solutions or long-term programs to address gaps. Understanding existing vulnerabilities, benefits, and costs is crucial for setting priorities in implementing the detection architecture. The global nuclear detection architecture faces challenges in incremental performance improvements and prioritizing investments. Efforts must focus on specific areas within the architecture to effectively reduce vulnerabilities and gaps. Implementing a global architecture allows for ranking investment priorities, even without a precise method for comparison. The global nuclear detection architecture is undergoing revision and refinement to prioritize investment areas and reduce vulnerabilities. The analysis methodology will be reviewed independently to ensure effectiveness in reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism. Risk and economic impact methodology documents are being prepared and reviewed to protect sensitive information. Congress may want to review the global nuclear detection architecture to address concerns and ensure robust methodology. DNDO is focusing on vulnerabilities in aviation and maritime domains, with plans for regional detection architectures. GAO recommends DNDO establish a strategic plan for the global nuclear detection office. The GAO recommends that DNDO establish a strategic plan for the global nuclear detection office to strengthen development and coordination. DNDO is responsible for coordinating activities of federal agencies in the global nuclear detection architecture, requiring substantial interagency coordination for success. Congress recognized the need for DNDO to access talent from other agencies. The DHS Secretary has requested personnel from various federal agencies to be detailed to DNDO for their expertise. This interagency workforce includes personnel from DOD, DOE, FBI, State Department, and others, who help DNDO coordinate and address nuclear detection needs. The DNDO utilizes personnel from various federal agencies to address nuclear detection needs. The Interagency Coordination Council plays a key role in developing policy and strategies for the global nuclear detection architecture, but organizational issues may hinder its success. The Director of DNDO may not have equal authority compared to officials in other agencies. The Director of DNDO may not have equal authority compared to officials in other agencies, which can impact coordination efforts. Other agencies may perceive the global nuclear detection architecture as a DNDO document, leading to potential delays in adoption of strategies. The DNDO has an Advisory Council to resolve intra-agency issues within DHS. Coordination with other federal government entities occurs through the White House. The White House facilitates coordination among federal agencies for nuclear defense through the Domestic Nuclear Defense Policy Coordinating Committee, created jointly by the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council. Congress emphasized the importance of coordination for DNDO, withholding funds until agreements were established with all participating entities. Multiple agencies are involved in implementing nuclear defense measures. Congress plays a crucial oversight role in assessing the implementation of the global nuclear detection architecture across multiple federal agencies. They are uniquely positioned to address policy challenges, funding levels, development plans, and maintenance of the architecture. The annual federal investment is distributed among various agencies and layers within the architecture. The global nuclear detection architecture involves multiple agencies and layers, with a focus on securing nuclear materials and preventing their transfer to non-state actors. Congress has invested in programs like the Cooperative Threat Reduction program and technologies like Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) and Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) for border security. Investment in the global nuclear detection architecture is mainly through existing programs to protect national nuclear facilities. The GAO reported discrepancies in funding distribution compared to DNDO's framework. Coordination with other agencies for strategic direction is lacking. Congress may adjust funding levels to align with DNDO's needs and increase overall funding for redundancy in nuclear detection efforts. Shifting funding within the global nuclear detection architecture can have complex ramifications, including imperiling international agreements and causing interagency disagreements. Without a robust evaluative system, changes in investment may not yield optimal risk reduction. Assessing the impact of shifting funds between programs requires careful evaluation, as the relative size of the programs is not the only relevant criterion. DNDO plays a key role in this process. DNDO lacks the authority to direct changes in funding for other agencies involved in the global nuclear detection architecture. Congress could grant the DNDO Director the power to review and assess budgets of other departments and recommend alternative allocations. Alternatively, agencies could be required to create a single budget for the global nuclear detection architecture to ensure transparency in funding allocation. Congress could potentially grant the DNDO Director the authority to review and assess budgets of other agencies involved in the global nuclear detection architecture. Alternatively, a budget coordinating role could be vested in the Office of Science and Technology Policy rather than within DNDO. Additionally, Congress established an Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism within the White House to advise the President and formulate national strategy and policy. The Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism advises the President, formulates national strategy, leads interagency coordination, and oversees budget development. The position is currently vacant, and agencies may prefer a bottom-up budget process over a top-down approach. Congress has mandated an annual review. The annual interagency review of the global nuclear detection architecture, overseen by key government officials, aims to assess agency participation, evaluate detection technologies, identify deficiencies, and assess implementation capacity. However, the GAO has found that this review process is not effectively utilized to clarify priorities and funding requirements for the evolution of the architecture. The joint annual interagency review of the global nuclear detection architecture is not effectively used to analyze budgets, prioritize gaps, or align detection efforts. Instead, it provides an overview of existing programs and responsibilities without assessing funding levels according to agency or government needs. The DNDO aims to enhance detection capabilities by integrating current technologies, improving them through research, and expanding capabilities at all levels of government. DNDO and other agencies are faced with a choice in improving the global nuclear detection architecture. They can either use available technologies for a partial solution or invest in research for a more complete long-term solution. The first option involves incremental improvements with marginally better detection capabilities, while the second option focuses on developing technologies for a fully acceptable level of detection and security. In improving the global nuclear detection architecture, a choice must be made between incremental advances for partial solutions or investing in research for a more comprehensive long-term solution. The latter option aims to develop a single system that would provide a fully acceptable level of detection and security, addressing known vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by attackers. The balance between incremental improvements and transformational research is crucial for developing a robust architecture, with the DNDO working on time-phased plans to address key gaps in the existing system. The DNDO is working on time-phased plans to address gaps in the global nuclear detection architecture by integrating current and near-term technologies, adopting a spiral development approach, and funding multiple types of detector technology to create a more complete solution over time. DNDO is developing and deploying various detector technologies to enhance its ability to detect and prevent radiological or nuclear attacks. Congress is focused on creating a robust global nuclear detection architecture, understanding the capabilities of new technologies, and assessing the effectiveness of risk reduction metrics. DNDO is working on establishing a robust global nuclear detection architecture to safeguard the United States. The reliance on temporary personnel like detailees and liaisons may hinder long-term sustainability, as institutional memory could be lost when they return to their home agencies. Efforts for ongoing improvement and adjustment will depend on DNDO's ability to clearly articulate and document their rationale and approaches. The DNDO is addressing the challenge of maintaining institutional memory with temporary personnel. To offset potential losses, mentoring programs, comprehensive documentation of decisions, and expanding permanent staff are being considered for long-term stability and retention of core knowledge. The DNDO is increasing its permanent federal staff to balance the need for technical expertise with building a core team. Succession planning is used to retain institutional knowledge by identifying replacements for detailees before they leave. The DNDO's succession planning and strategic decisions on detailees may require oversight from Congress to ensure program continuity. Research and development investments aim to address gaps in the nuclear detection architecture, with both DHS and DOE funding projects in this area. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 granted DNDO authority to conduct research to improve technologies for detecting nuclear threats within the United States. The DNDO conducts research and development efforts to address gaps in the global nuclear detection architecture, focusing on detecting threat materials from greater distances and in challenging environments. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 14 mandated aggressive research and development programs in this area, with the Secretary of Energy leading nonproliferation efforts. The development of nonproliferation research and dual-use counter-proliferation and counter-terrorism nuclear detection research is coordinated through various entities, including the Subcommittee on Nuclear Defense Research and Development. Congress may oversee the balance of investments between agencies to prevent duplication of efforts and ensure mission fulfillment. The authority oversees investments between agencies, addresses duplication of research activities, and adjusts resources for specific technology approaches."
