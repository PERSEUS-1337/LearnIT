    "content": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers programs to address housing issues for low-income households, including rental assistance for the poor, elderly, and disabled. Major programs include Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other specialized grants assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) also plays a role in housing initiatives. HUD's annual funding is primarily from discretionary regular annual appropriations, with components including emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. This report explores trends in HUD's funding since FY2002, discussing key budget concepts and factors influencing future budgets. The funding for HUD is primarily from discretionary regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency appropriations sometimes provided. Appropriations measures are subject to limits, and offsets are used to stay within these limits. The funding for HUD is primarily from discretionary regular annual appropriations, with additional emergency appropriations sometimes provided. Appropriations measures are subject to limits, and offsets through rescissions and receipts are used to stay within these limits, determining HUD's total net budget authority. This net budget authority is crucial for federal budgeting as it counts against discretionary spending limits, but may not fully represent the actual funding for HUD's programs and activities. The amount of funding provided for HUD's programs and activities is determined by appropriations, which may include offsets like rescissions and receipts. Despite a 21% increase in nominal dollars since FY2002, inflation-adjusted net budget authority for HUD in FY2015 was lower than in FY2002 by 6%. In FY2015, HUD's annual net budget authority was lower than in FY2002 by 6%. The trend in HUD's budget authority has been fluctuating, with significant increases from FY2002 to FY2010, followed by declines in FY2013 due to sequestration. Despite nominal increases in the past two years, HUD's net budget authority in FY2015 was still lower than in FY2002 when adjusted for inflation. In FY2015, HUD's net budget authority was lower than in FY2002 by 6%, despite a 21% increase in regular net budget authority between FY2002 and FY2015. The fluctuations in funding are influenced by changes in savings available from offsets and rescissions, complicating the resources available for HUD's programs and activities. Between FY2002 and FY2010, HUD's regular net budget authority increased by 57%, while regular appropriations grew at a slower rate of 37%. This discrepancy was due to declines in offsets, offsetting receipts, and collections. Between FY2002 and FY2010, HUD's regular net budget authority increased by 57%, while regular appropriations grew at a slower rate of 37%. The amount available from offsetting receipts and collections declined significantly during this period. However, starting in FY2011, Congress cut regular appropriations while increasing offsets. This resulted in larger reductions to HUD's regular net budget authority, with cuts of 11% in FY2011, 9% in FY2012, and 16% in FY2013 compared to the previous year. Between FY2002 and FY2010, HUD's regular net budget authority increased by 57%, while regular appropriations grew at a slower rate of 37%. Starting in FY2011, Congress cut regular appropriations while increasing offsets, resulting in larger reductions to HUD's regular net budget authority. In FY2013, the cost of providing appropriations for HUD's programs declined due to an increase in offsets, allowing for larger budget savings despite smaller cuts in appropriations. Since FY2013, net budget authority for HUD has begun to rise. In FY2015, net budget authority for HUD's programs increased by 8.6%, but appropriations declined by $89 million. The savings from offsets and rescissions also decreased by $2.9 billion. If FHA receipts continue to decline as predicted, it will be more costly to fund current services. Offset receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs decreased by 70% between FY2002 and FY2010, impacting the HUD budget. In FY2011, FHA offsetting receipts increased to over $3.4 billion, the highest in a decade, and continued to rise in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014, reaching historical highs of over $10 billion and $11 billion. These increases were due to FHA's increased market share post-recession and policy changes that raised fees. In FY2015, FHA receipts declined for the first time since FY2010, signaling a potential future decrease as the housing and credit markets recover. The growth in regular appropriations since FY2002 is mainly due to HUD's Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts, which are the largest components of the HUD budget. From FY2002 to FY2015, appropriations for HUD's Section 8 programs grew by 86%, accounting for about 64% of HUD's regular appropriations. The Section 8 programs provide rental housing assistance for low-income families through tenant-based rental assistance (vouchers) and project-based rental assistance. Appropriations for the Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account grew by 84% from FY2005 to FY2015, while appropriations for the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) account grew by about 31%. The growth in PBRA appropriations is mainly due to the renewal of old rental assistance contracts funded in the 1970s and 1980s. Funding for Section 8 has increased by 86% since FY2002, while funding for other HUD programs has decreased by 13%. The HOME and CDBG programs have seen significant funding declines, with CDBG formula grants experiencing the largest decrease in dollars. Overall, formula grants under HOME and CDBG have seen a 36% funding decrease from FY2002 to FY2015. Funding for regular CDBG formula grants declined from nearly a fifth of HUD's total appropriations in FY2002 to 8.6% in FY2015. Congress provided supplemental funding to the Community Development Fund account for special purposes, including disaster aid, foreclosure response, and economic stimulus, totaling nearly $60 billion from FY2002 to FY2015. This emergency funding primarily supported HUD programs for special purposes. The decline in funding for regular CDBG formula grants from FY2002 to FY2015 was not primarily due to program eliminations. Only three accounts were zeroed out in FY2002, totaling less than $100 million, and were not funded in FY2015. Some set-asides within HUD accounts have been eliminated or consolidated, impacting the total funding provided. Future trends in HUD funding will be influenced by factors like the Budget Control Act's budget enforcement provisions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) established enforceable discretionary spending limits, leading to sequestration in FY2013 with automatic spending cuts. This resulted in a $3 billion reduction in funding for HUD. Lower discretionary spending limits aim to reduce growth over time, requiring congressional appropriators to provide less in appropriations. Future cost growth in the Section 8 project-based rental assistance account is expected to slow down due to annual renewal cycles for old contracts, but inflation costs may still require increased funding. Cost growth in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is not expected to decrease, as individual voucher costs are driven by market factors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified these market factors as key contributors to cost increases. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report identified market factors driving cost growth in the Section 8 voucher program. The program has expanded to serve more people, but there are still waiting lists due to high demand. Congress has shown commitment to funding renewal of all Section 8 project-based rental assistance contracts. The Section 8 voucher program serves roughly 3 million families, including elderly, disabled, and families with children. Questions about future commitment and interest in cost-saving reforms have arisen due to rising program costs. Funding for Section 8 has increased while funding for other HUD programs, like HOME and CDBG, has decreased. This dynamic may be due to how the programs are perceived. The perception of HUD programs may make them vulnerable to funding cuts. Policymakers may consider cost-saving reforms, including program eliminations and consolidations. Some programs have already been eliminated, and mergers of duplicative programs may be proposed. Program consolidations may involve merging duplicative programs or expanding block grant programs. The future of FHA is uncertain, as increased offsets from receipts may have protected HUD program appropriations. However, if housing credit markets recover, FHA loans may become less desirable, leading to decreased business and receipts. FHA is currently insuring loans with higher credit profiles and stricter underwriting standards, making the insured loans less risky. The future of FHA is uncertain as it may serve fewer borrowers with lower credit scores in the future. Reforms could reduce FHA's role in the mortgage market, leading to decreased offsetting receipts. There are proposals to change how FHA is accounted for in the budget, which could impact its financial outlook. The proposed accounting changes for FHA could result in fewer offsetting receipts, potentially leading to a need for regular appropriations. This could increase pressure to further reduce appropriations for HUD's programs and activities."
