The health care clearinghouse can perform functions without individual authorization under certain conditions. Reports to third parties must only include de-identified data or protected health information with a qualifying data use agreement. Individuals still have the right to access their claims and payment records in HIPAA standard format. The health care clearinghouse must provide individuals with comprehensive records of their protected health information upon written request, unless deemed technologically infeasible. Individuals need to identify the health care provider or providers that rendered care when requesting access to records. The health care clearinghouse may purchase protected health information from other clearinghouses with individual permission. Certain regulations apply to clearinghouses not directly interacting with individuals. The health care clearinghouse must notify covered entities of any breach of unsecured protected health information and provide a notice of privacy practices on its website. Existing agreements conflicting with this section will not have legal force. Safe Harbor and Clarification of Liability: A health care clearinghouse engaging in certain functions will be solely liable for HIPAA violations. Enforcement will follow Section 13410(a)(2) and relation to other laws will be governed by Section 13421, similar to parts 1 and 2. The text discusses the definitions of terms related to health information privacy, such as 'de-identified' and 'health care clearinghouse', as outlined in Section 13421 of the Social Security Act.

The term 'HIPAA-related provision' includes specific sections of the Social Security Act and regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. 'Individual' refers to a person's protected health information, as defined in federal regulations. A 'qualifying data use agreement' outlines the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information by the recipient. A qualifying data use agreement between a health care clearinghouse and a data recipient establishes permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information, limiting them to the original purpose of disclosure. The agreement also requires the data recipient to use appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the information. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must create regulations within 30 days to enforce the amendment regarding data use agreements. Additionally, a conforming amendment to the Social Security Act requires entities receiving standard transactions to process health information in a standard format. The term \"nonstandard format or nonstandard data content\" refers to entities that process health care claims, payments, provide advice, and process eligibility claims for HIPAA covered entities."
