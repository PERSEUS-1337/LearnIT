    "content": "The Act titled \"Superior National Forest Land Adjustment Act of 2007\" includes findings and definitions. The Congress finds that fragmentation of property rights in lands near the Superior National Forest in Minnesota hampers mineral rights utilization and forest management. The public interest in selling federally owned lands outweighs maintaining them under Federal ownership, and selling surface and subsurface rights will facilitate mining and improve the economy. The Congress aims to improve the economy of the United States by providing employment and mineral resources through the sale of federally owned lands near the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. Poly Met Mining, Inc. is preparing for mining operations on these lands, with proceeds used by the Forest Service to acquire private inholdings. In this Act, \"lands\" include interests in lands, \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, and \"surface mining\" involves excavating lands for mineral extraction using various methods. SEC. 3. LAND CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY, SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST, MINNESOTA. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to sell the United States' rights to lands within the Superior National Forest in Minnesota, totaling approximately 6,700 acres in St. Louis County. This includes specific sections in Township 59 North, Range 13 West, 4th Principal Meridian. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to sell approximately 6,700 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota, including specific sections in Township 59 North, Range 12 West, and Township 60 North, Range 13 West. The lands are depicted on a Forest Service map dated October 4, 2007, titled \"PolyMet (Proponent) Case #4544\". The Secretary may modify boundaries of the lands for management considerations. Lands sold will be conveyed by quitclaim deed. Valuation will follow federal standards and require Secretary's approval. The lands authorized for conveyance include the right of the surface owner to allow or deny surface mining. Consideration for the sale of lands must be at least the appraised market value. The Secretary may sell lands at public or private sale, with Poly Met Mining, Inc. having the first offer at market value. The Secretary may offer to sell lands to Poly Met Mining, Inc. first, covering associated costs. Any counteroffer by Poly Met Mining, Inc. may be rejected if deemed inadequate. Brokers can be used for land disposition, with commissions paid from sale proceeds. SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF PROCEEDS.\n\nThe Secretary will deposit sale proceeds in the Sisk Act fund for land acquisition in the Superior National Forest. Amounts deposited are available to the Secretary without further appropriation.\n\nSEC. 5. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The Secretary must offset wetlands loss from any sale under this Act by acquiring wetlands within and adjacent to the Superior National Forest within ten years. Environmental analysis for conveyances authorized by this Act assumes future use for surface mining, with the Army Corps of Engineers' environmental impact statement considered sufficient disclosure. The Act authorizes conveyances of lands without delay for environmental impact statements. The Act exempts conveyances from certain environmental laws and prohibits administrative appeals. Lands must be sold within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
