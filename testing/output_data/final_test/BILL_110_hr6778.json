    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2008\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Ex-Offenders Voting Rights Act of 2008 emphasizes the importance of the right to vote for reintegrating offenders into society and highlights the impact of disenfranchisement laws on American communities. Reform of voting policies for inmates is being reconsidered to align with correctional objectives and democratic participation. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia prohibit inmate voting for felony offenses. Congress has the ultimate authority over federal elections, ensuring state laws comply with the Constitution. Currently, only Maine and Vermont allow inmate voting. (5) Maine and Vermont are the only states that permit inmates to vote. 35 states prohibit felons from voting while on parole, with 30 of these states also excluding felony probationers. Two states deny voting rights to all ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. Nine others disenfranchise certain categories of ex-offenders or allow for restoration of rights after a waiting period. The restoration processes in most states are cumbersome, leading to few ex-offenders being able to regain their voting rights. (6) An estimated 5.3 million Americans, or one in 41 adults, have lost their voting rights either temporarily or permanently. (7) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact ethnic minorities. Thirteen States disenfranchise ex-offenders who have fully served their sentences, regardless of the offense. In these States, regaining the right to vote is often difficult. In eight States, a pardon from the Governor is required for ex-offenders to regain voting rights. Offenders convicted of a Federal offense face barriers to regaining voting rights, as Federal ex-offenders in 16 States cannot use the State procedure for restoration. The only way to restore voting rights is through a Presidential pardon. Many lack the resources needed to succeed in this process. African-American and Hispanic citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised, with 13% of African-American men and a significant number of Hispanic citizens being disenfranchised. An estimated 676,730 women and over 2,000,000 White Americans are disenfranchised due to felony convictions. In five States, one in four Black men lose their voting rights permanently. Three in ten Black men in the next generation may face disenfranchisement, with up to 40 percent losing their right to vote in States that disenfranchise ex-offenders. The purpose of this Act is to address discrepancies in the Federal election process by allowing ex-offenders who have completed their sentences to vote. Congress should act to ensure fundamental fairness and equal protection for disenfranchised individuals. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. The right to vote in federal elections for US citizens shall not be denied due to a criminal conviction, except for those serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution. Definitions include what constitutes a correctional institution and the term \"election.\" The term \"election\" encompasses various types of elections, including general, special, primary, or runoff elections, as well as conventions or caucuses of political parties. Additionally, the term \"Federal office\" refers to positions such as President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress. SEC. 4. NOTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO REGAIN RIGHT TO VOTE. The Chief State correctional officer must notify individuals released from a correctional institution of their right to vote in Federal elections within 30 days. This does not apply to those continuing to serve sentences in a different facility. In this subsection, parole refers to release with conditions imposed by a court, while probation refers to court-imposed supervision with specified conditions. The Director of the Bureau of Prisons is subject to the same rules as the Chief State correctional officer regarding individuals released from their jurisdiction. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals affected by violations can notify the state election official and file a civil lawsuit if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. Individuals can take legal action for violations of the Act, especially if they occur within 30 days before a federal election, without notifying the state election official first. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prohibit states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act are in addition to those under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
