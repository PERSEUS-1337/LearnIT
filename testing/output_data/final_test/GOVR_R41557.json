    "content": "The economic recession that started in December 2007 officially ended in June 2009, leading to a \"jobless recovery\" with high unemployment rates, especially among older workers aged 55 and above. Unemployment rates doubled from 5.0% in December 2007 to 9.8% in November 2010. This report examines historical trends in unemployment among older workers, reasons for their unemployment, challenges faced by certain subgroups, and the availability of financial resources and health insurance during unemployment. The recession that began in December 2007 led to historically high unemployment rates for older workers, while younger workers aged 25 to 54 experienced levels similar to those in 1982. Unemployment rates for all age groups under 65 have more than doubled since the recession. The labor force participation rate is affected by older workers retiring, impacting the workforce size. During the recent economic recession, older workers saw historically high unemployment rates due to weak labor demand and increased labor force participation. Labor force participation rates for individuals aged 65 and older have varied over time, with recent trends showing a reversal in the downward trend for men aged 65 and older. This shift is attributed to factors such as improved health at older ages and less physically demanding jobs. The downward trend in retirement age is influenced by improved health, less physically demanding jobs, and changes in pension plans. Some retirees have lower guaranteed income, leading them to delay retirement. Recent surveys show more individuals aged 65 and older wanting to work for financial or non-financial reasons. Labor force participation rates for older workers aged 55 to 64 have varied over time, with a trend towards earlier retirement for men in the 1970s and 1980s. The reduction in early retirement incentives in traditional pensions and employer-sponsored retiree health insurance led to a decrease in retirement before age 65. During the recent economic recession, older workers were encouraged to delay retirement due to increased economic uncertainty. According to the 2010 EBRI Retirement Confidence Survey, 24% of respondents postponed their planned retirement in the past year. During the recent economic recession, older workers were encouraged to delay retirement due to increased economic uncertainty. Reasons for delaying retirement included the poor economy, changes in employment, inadequate finances, and stock market losses. Some workers became discouraged by rising unemployment rates and stopped looking for a job. This led to an increase in labor force participation among older workers since December 2007. Labor force participation rates increased between December 2007 and May 2010, with a 2.3% increase for those aged 55 to 64 and a 6.0% increase for those aged 65 and older. Unemployment can result from job loss, family care responsibilities, or retirement transitions. The majority of unemployed individuals aged 55 to 64 experienced job loss, with about 68% citing recent layoffs as the reason for unemployment. The majority of unemployed individuals aged 45 to 54 reported job loss as the reason for unemployment. The second largest category of unemployed are those entering or re-entering the workforce after an extended absence. Younger women are more likely to be in this category compared to younger men. For those aged 65 and older, there are no gender differences in entering or re-entering the workforce. Among older workers, retirement is the main reason for not being in the workforce initially. In October 2010, 7% of men aged 65 and older voluntarily left their jobs, compared to 5% of women in the same age group. Older unemployed individuals tend to have longer durations of unemployment, with older workers being unemployed over five weeks longer on average than younger workers. About 41% of those aged 55 and older are unemployed for more than one year. Both older men and women experience similar durations of unemployment. Among older workers, both men and women experience similar durations of unemployment, with older men averaging 45 weeks and older women averaging 44 weeks. Employment growth for older cohorts was positive between December 2007 and October 2010, while it was negative for younger cohorts. Older workers are being hired at a faster rate than younger workers, but this does not account for the aging population, where older workers make up a growing share of the workforce. The employment-to-population ratio shows positive growth for older workers aged 65 and older, but negative growth for those aged 55 to 64. Despite this, older workers face longer durations of unemployment compared to younger workers, leading to higher unemployment rates and potential challenges in securing retirement income. Older unemployed workers face unique challenges such as age discrimination and difficulty accessing affordable health insurance. Public programs providing income support and health insurance for the unemployed are not tailored to older workers returning to the workforce after an extended absence. Older unemployed workers may have an advantage in retaining their jobs due to longer tenures, age discrimination laws, and positive attributes perceived by employers. Workers over 40 are protected against age discrimination through the ADEA. Recent data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shows a rise in age discrimination claims, with merit resolutions increasing by 15.6% between 2007 and 2008. Monetary benefits related to age discrimination claims also increased by 26% during the same period. While 2009 data shows a slight decrease in claims, merit resolutions were still 10% higher than pre-recession levels in 2007. Survey data indicates that older workers are perceived more favorably in terms of experience, work ethic, and reliability compared to younger workers. Older workers are seen more favorably for their experience, work ethic, and reliability. However, they may face disadvantages in job searches due to perceived higher costs in compensation and healthcare. Employers may view older workers as less creative and lacking initiative compared to younger workers. Employers may be hesitant to hire older workers due to perceived lack of creativity and initiative. Age discrimination laws may not effectively address hiring practices, with fewer cases focusing on discrimination in hiring compared to terminations. Research on age discrimination in hiring is inconclusive, making it challenging for older unemployed individuals to re-enter the workforce or career workers to change occupations. The extent of age discrimination in hiring is mixed, with studies showing varying results. Economic slowdown has led to a larger pool of job applicants, making it challenging for older workers to find employment. Older workers may have options to supplement income and access health insurance, depending on their age and eligibility for programs like Social Security and Medicare. Older unemployed workers may have limited time to replenish lost income compared to younger workers. Options to supplement income during unemployment depend on individual circumstances. Those involuntarily terminated may be eligible for unemployment compensation, while those affected by adverse trade conditions may qualify for Re-employment Trade Adjustment. More detailed information on available resources can be found in CRS reports. Older workers who lost their jobs due to adverse trade conditions may be eligible for Re-employment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA). However, this assistance is only available for those who recently lost their job and not for those re-entering the workforce after a long period of time. Older workers between 55 and 62 who have not worked recently may not have access to unemployment compensation or Social Security benefits, forcing them to rely on retirement savings or home equity. Those aged 62 and above may be eligible for public programs like Social Security, but there are drawbacks to taking Social Security at younger ages. Access to health insurance for older Americans is closely linked to full-time employment. Studies have found that in 2007, 45% of uninsured individuals aged 55 to 64 have no full-time workers in their households. Unemployment among older workers may increase the number of uninsured in this age group. Access to health insurance for unemployed older workers under 65 depends on various factors such as retiree health coverage, tax credits, or purchasing individual health insurance, which can be costly for those with pre-existing conditions. Health care reform will improve access to health insurance for older unemployed individuals under 65, but not all provisions will be applicable. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) signed into law in 2010 aims to provide immediate reforms to the health insurance market, increasing consumer access to health insurance, especially for older unemployed individuals under 65. Premiums and cost-sharing can be a burden for older unemployed individuals over 65 who have access to Medicare. Various options are available to insure older unemployed workers or retired individuals. The PPACA, signed into law in 2010, aims to increase consumer access to health insurance, especially for those with pre-existing conditions and higher-risk groups. It will provide subsidies for eligible individuals, expand Medicaid to non-traditional groups, and cover households earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level. These provisions will not be implemented until 2014, creating an interim period where unemployed older workers may need assistance."
