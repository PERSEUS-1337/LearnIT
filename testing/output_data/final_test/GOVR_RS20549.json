    "content": "On September 12, 1972, the Defense Property Disposal Service (now DLA Disposition Services) was established under the Defense Supply Agency. DLA Disposition Services is responsible for property reuse, precious metal recovery, recycling, hazardous property disposal, and demilitarization of military equipment. They have reutilized over $2.2 billion of property in the past four years and provide support at major U.S. military installations worldwide. Headquarters are in Battle Creek, MI, with personnel in 16 foreign countries, 2 U.S. territories, and 41 states. The Reutilization/Transfer/Donation Program manages inventory no longer needed by the Department of Defense (DOD) for redistribution. Property disposal involves various activities like redistributing, transferring, donating, selling, demilitarizing, or destroying items before they leave DOD's control. Demilitarization removes military offensive and defensive capabilities to achieve disposal goals. Excess property is deemed unnecessary by a federal agency, while surplus property is no longer needed for its intended use. Property turned in to DLA Disposition Services by military services is offered for use in other DOD activities and federal agencies. Surplus property can be reused, transferred, donated, or sold to various recipients. In FY2008, over 3.5 million items were turned in by military organizations. Liquidity Services, Inc. was awarded a contract to manage surplus items. On July 31, 2008, DLA awarded Liquidity Services, Inc. a contract to manage defense surplus property for sale to the public. The contract was extended multiple times, with concerns raised by Members of Congress over the types of military equipment available to law enforcement agencies. The concerns of Members of Congress were raised after the 2014 shooting in Ferguson, MO, involving heavily armed police using equipment from federal programs. The U.S. Senate will hold a hearing on federal programs equipping law enforcement. The U.S. Army informed DLA that engines in soft-skinned Humvees could not be sold due to EPA standards. The EPA granted a National Security Exemption (NSE) to military tactical vehicles not meeting Clean Air Act standards since 1988. DLA Disposition Services was unaware of this exemption. Transfer, donation, and sale of these vehicles could violate the NSE. DLA suspended release of vehicles with diesel engines on June 30, 2014. The DLA temporarily suspended release of vehicles and equipment with diesel engines due to issues with the EPA. This decision affected surplus military vehicles used for law enforcement support and firefighting programs. On July 9, 2014, DLA Disposition Services announced the continuation of providing military vehicles to authorized law enforcement and firefighting programs, with an associated national security exemption. EPA confirmed the transfer of equipment to these agencies under the exemption, with DLA retaining ownership and management controls in place. Memoranda of Understanding will be amended to reflect this agreement. As of July 1, 2014, DLA LESO implemented policy changes for excess DOD property with Demilitarization codes A and Q. These items are now referred to as \"National Security Exemption (NSE) restricted DEMIL A and Q6 items.\" The DLA LESO will maintain a list of these items by National Stock Numbers (NSN) as controlled property. Law Enforcement Agencies must return NSE restricted DEMIL A and Q6 items to DLA Disposition Services or transfer them to another agency within DLA LESO when no longer needed. Serial numbers and possibly photographs are now required for these items acquired after July 1, 2013. Agencies can request to sell items with a DEMIL Code of Q (Integrity Code of 6). Agencies may request to sell items with a DEMIL Code of Q (Integrity Code of 6), which do not fall into the category of NSE restricted items, but must gain State Coordinator and DLA LESO approval before the sale. These items will not be systematically archived from the DLA LESO inventory. Only excess property with a DEMIL Code of A, which does not fall into the category of NSE restricted items, will continue to be systematically archived from the DLA LESO inventory one year from MRO/Ship date. Title for items in this category will continue to pass to the LEA. DLA Disposition Services manages surplus military property through the Reutilization/Transfer/Donation Program, redistributing items to various groups like law enforcement agencies, schools, and community organizations. They also oversee the DOD surplus property sales program, selling items no longer needed by the government to the public. The \"1033 Program\" allows for the transfer of federal surplus property to state and local government programs, as well as organizations promoting public health, safety, education, and other public needs. Eligible recipients may include veterans groups and Native American organizations, with a slight priority given to groups classified as a \"service education activity.\" The 1033 Program authorizes the transfer of excess DOD property to federal and state law enforcement agencies for counter-drug and counter-terrorism activities. Since 1990, over $4.2 billion worth of property has been transferred, with a record $502 million in FY2011 alone. The Secretary of Defense can provide material support in the form of transfers of articles suitable for these activities. The 1033 Program authorizes the transfer of excess DOD property to law enforcement agencies for counter-drug and counter-terrorism activities. The statute requires consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Drug Control Policy. Transfers must be made from existing DOD stocks without using procurement funds, and all subsequent costs are the responsibility of the receiving agency. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) can transfer military equipment to recipients without charge. DLA states that 88% of the equipment transferred through the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) is non-tactical, including office equipment, chairs, boots, generators, and tents. The remaining 12% is tactical, such as weapons, night vision equipment, and tactical vehicles. All equipment requisitioned under the 1033 Program has a commercial similarity or can be requested through a grant. The 1122 Program allows state and local governments to purchase law enforcement equipment. The Defense Authorization Act authorizes state and local governments to purchase law enforcement equipment for counter-drug activities through the 1033 Program. The program appoints a point of contact (POC) for each state to purchase items from DLA's inventory control points. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service manages DOD firefighting property transfers under Title 10 U.S.C. 2576b. The Federal Excess Personal Property (FEPP) Program, administered through the Forest Service, provides equipment for wild land and rural firefighting. The Defense Authorization Act allows state and local governments to purchase law enforcement equipment for counter-drug activities through the 1033 Program. Title 10 U.S.C. 2557 authorizes DOD to provide excess property for humanitarian relief, domestic emergency assistance, and homeless veterans' assistance. Property not reused or transferred can be sold through public auctions. Veteran groups can qualify for eligibility for DOD surplus property, and if property cannot be reused, it may be donated to state and local government programs. Each state has a designated State Agency for Surplus Property Program to receive and distribute federal surplus property. The program authorizes \"screeners\" to handle logistics and may charge a fee. Eligible recipients include organizations promoting public health, safety, education, and veteran's groups. Priority may be given to groups qualifying as a \"service education activity.\" Property can be acquired through donation or loan for historical, ceremonial, and display purposes. The program authorizes \"screeners\" to handle logistics and may charge a fee. Eligible recipients include organizations promoting public health, safety, education, and veteran's groups. Priority may be given to groups qualifying as a \"service education activity.\" Property can be acquired through donation or loan for historical, ceremonial, and display purposes. Works of art, drawings, plans, and models for historical, ceremonial, and display purposes can be obtained by various organizations such as Veteran organizations, State Museums, Municipal Museums, and Sons of Veterans Reserves. Other eligible recipients include museums, educational institutions, National Guard and Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps units, and the Civil Air Patrol. P.L. 112-239 (H.R. 4310, 112th Congress) introduced provisions impacting the distribution of DOD surplus or excess property, including the loan or donation of small firearms for ceremonial purposes and the transfer of mine-resistant vehicles. Section 1053 and Section 1091 of P.L. 112-81 authorized the transfer of vehicles and aircraft for specific purposes. Section 361 of H.R. 1540 clarified the conditions for the commercial sale of small arms ammunition components and fired cartridge cases. The conference report accompanying H.R. 1540 clarified that only intact expended small arms cartridge cases are subject to the provision in Section 346 of P.L. 111-383. The Department of Defense is allowed to demilitarize and recycle these cases as long as commercial demands are being met and there is no significant decrease in availability for sale. The DOD currently provides 6-8 million pounds of intact expended small arms cartridge cases for commercial sales annually. The amount may change based on force structure or training requirements. The DOD assesses commercial demands and may conduct market surveys. In the 111th Congress, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 broadened eligibility for surplus military equipment to include state and local organizations. The Affordable Reloaded Munitions Supply (ARMS) Act of 2009 (H.R. 2193) aimed to allow the sale of intact spent military small arms ammunition casings to certain domestic suppliers. The bill had 41 co-sponsors and was referred to the House Armed Services Committee.
