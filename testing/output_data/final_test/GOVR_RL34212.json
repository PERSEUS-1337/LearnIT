    "content": "For federal income tax purposes, when a mortgage is canceled, two types of income may arise: cancellation of indebtedness income and gain from property disposition. Canceled debt is typically included in gross income, known as cancellation of debt (COD) income. Borrowers must report canceled debt on Form 1099-C to the IRS and include it in gross income. There are exceptions to this rule in Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code allows borrowers to exclude canceled debt from gross income if the debt is discharged in Title 11 bankruptcy or if the borrower is insolvent. In the case of bankruptcy, the debt must be discharged by the court overseeing the proceedings. For the insolvency exception, the taxpayer calculates assets and liabilities to determine insolvency. The amount of canceled debt income that can be excluded is limited to the amount of insolvency. The taxpayer can exclude canceled debt if insolvent or in bankruptcy. To do so, they must reduce certain tax attributes, like property basis, until the reductions equal the excluded amount. This defers tax on the canceled debt income. Other exclusions exist, such as nonrecourse debt or specific cancellation circumstances. When property is sold, the gain is taxed based on how long it was held. Canceled home mortgage debt may result in gain if the property is taken by the lender. Taxpayers may have both gain from property disposition and canceled debt income. The IRC Section 121 provides an exclusion for gain from the sale of a personal residence, up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for married couples. Taxpayers who do not meet the qualifications may be eligible for a partial exclusion under certain circumstances. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excludes discharged debt income. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-142) excluded discharged qualified residential debt from gross income. Qualified indebtedness is limited to $2 million ($1 million if married filing separately) for acquiring, constructing, or improving the taxpayer's principal residence. Refinancing is included if it does not exceed the amount of refinanced debt. The taxpayer must reduce the basis in their residence by the excluded income amount. The provision applies to debt discharges between January 1, 2007, and January 1, 2010. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded discharged qualified residential debt from gross income. The exclusion was extended multiple times through various acts until the end of 2017. The extension also allowed for debt discharged after 2017 to be excluded if certain conditions were met. The policy of including discharged debt as income exists because forgiven loans increase net worth by reducing liabilities. Tax law typically treats forgiven loan proceeds as reportable income subject to tax. Lenders may cancel debt and restructure loans, leading to an increase in the borrower's net worth. The borrower's net worth may increase if debt is canceled through foreclosure or voluntarily deeding the property back to the lender. This could result in a decline in net worth if the asset value exceeded liabilities. Tax consequences of canceled debt are the same whether the home is retained or lost. The homeowner may owe $180,000 to the lender after a debt discharge of $20,000, which is taxable income subject to a 28% tax rate, resulting in a $5,600 tax liability. If the COD income is excluded, the taxpayer can avoid this tax liability. The impact of excluding COD income on basis adjustment varies depending on whether the home is retained or lost. Retaining the home and selling it later defers taxes owed on the disposition until the year of sale. However, for a taxpayer who loses their home, the timing of basis adjustment affects the tax consequences. If basis is reduced after discharge, the excluded COD income cannot be accounted for. If basis is reduced earlier, the taxpayer is worse off. Excluding debt forgiveness income can lead to unequal tax payments among individuals with similar incomes, violating the principle of horizontal equity. This exclusion can also favor higher-income individuals and reduce the progressivity of the tax system. Excluding debt forgiveness income can lead to unequal tax payments among individuals with similar incomes, favoring higher-income individuals and reducing the progressivity of the tax system. An example illustrates how income tax exclusions affect taxpayers in different brackets, with higher-income taxpayers receiving a greater tax benefit. Congress has provided relief for COD income in the past, but the circumstances varied. In 1986 and 1993, relief was given to commercial property owners, farmers, and Hurricane Katrina victims. The 2007 housing crisis led to legislative action. Lenders report canceled debt on Form 1099-C to the IRS and borrowers. The number of 1099-C forms and canceled debt increased post-financial crisis, peaking in 2011 at $13.8 billion. Recent data shows a 50% decrease from the peak but remains high, indicating ongoing financial distress for some taxpayers. Specific conclusions on mortgage-related debt are not possible from the data. The temporary changes to mortgage debt relief enacted by various legislative acts are set to expire at the end of 2017. Congress may allow the latest extension to expire, potentially subjecting canceled mortgage debt income to traditional tax treatment. Awareness about existing exclusions for canceled debt, such as for insolvency or bankruptcy, may need to be improved. Congress could choose to extend the exclusion of canceled debt income again, with possible modifications depending on the goal. Some argue for a temporary exclusion of canceled debt income to minimize adverse consequences of loan renegotiations in the short term. This is in consideration of the improved housing market conditions and existing subsidies for owner-occupied housing. Key tax provisions for owner-occupied housing include mortgage interest deduction, gain exclusion on home sales, and deduction of state and local real estate taxes. Some economists argue that preferential tax treatment for housing, including mortgage interest deduction, gain exclusion on home sales, and deduction of state and local real estate taxes, results in over $125 billion in reduced federal revenue annually. They believe this encourages households to overinvest in housing rather than business investments. There is a debate on whether this provision should be permanent or temporary to minimize hardship for taxpayers experiencing distress. Several options are being considered for excluding canceled mortgage debt income from taxation, including excluding all canceled residential debt. Currently, only debt related to the primary residence can be excluded, not vacation homes or investment properties. Some suggest disallowing second liens as qualified residential debt, although they are not directly ineligible. Qualified debt is currently limited to debt incurred in acquiring, constructing, or improving the taxpayer's primary residence. Home equity lines of credit can be used for capital improvements or consumption, raising questions about their eligibility for debt exclusion. Congress may consider adjusting the limit on excluded canceled debt, which currently stands at $2 million. Modifying homeowner eligibility requirements based on ownership tenure or income is another option for policymakers to explore. The exclusion for canceled debt income could be limited to homeowners who meet ownership and use tests similar to other housing-related tax provisions, such as the IRC Section 121. This limitation aims to prevent investors from excluding capital gains from taxation. Applying ownership and use tests to the exclusion of COD income may reduce the number of eligible tax filers and result in lower revenue loss. The reduction in filers for the exclusion of canceled debt income may lead to lower revenue loss. Adding complexity to the reporting process and capping income levels could be options to consider. Household income may not be relevant to the policy goals of mortgage debt cancellation. Household income may not be relevant to the policy goals of mortgage debt cancellation. Options to reduce revenue loss include adding complexity to the reporting process and capping income levels. Taxpayers may need to adjust tax attributes to account for excluded canceled mortgage debt income, such as reducing basis in property. The temporary exclusion of canceled mortgage debt income requires homeowners to reduce basis in their principal residence. Taxpayers may need to adjust tax attributes, with options including adjusting basis in the year following debt discharge or earlier. The requirement for homeowners to adjust basis in their principal residence after the exclusion of canceled mortgage debt income may result in differential tax consequences depending on the timing of the adjustment. Policymakers may need to consider this differential treatment, which could add complexity and administrative costs. The proposal may require policymakers to consider differential treatment, potentially increasing complexity and administrative costs."
