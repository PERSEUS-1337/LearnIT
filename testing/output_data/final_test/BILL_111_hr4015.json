Effective date for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2010. SEC. 4. EXCLUSION FROM GROSS ESTATE FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND SO LONG AS FARMLAND USE CONTINUES. This section introduces a new provision, SEC. 2033A, which allows for the exclusion of certain farmland from the gross estate as long as it continues to be used as farmland. In the case of an estate to which this section applies, if the executor elects to do so, the gross estate value will not include qualified farmland's adjusted value. This section applies to estates where the decedent was a U.S. citizen or resident at the time of death, and there was ownership of qualified farmland for at least 5 years within an 8-year period before the decedent's death with material participation. The section defines \"material participation\" in the operation of farmland, including rental of real estate for agricultural purposes. Rules similar to section 2032A(b) apply. The term \"qualified farmland\" refers to real property in the US used for farming purposes and acquired by a qualified heir from the decedent. A \"member of family\" includes lineal descendants of any spouse. The term \"adjusted value\" in this section refers to the value of farmland for estate tax purposes, reduced by certain deductions. Any term used in this section that is also used in section 2032A has the same meaning as defined in section 2032A. Tax Treatment of Dispositions and Failures To Use for Farming Purposes includes the imposition of a recapture tax if a qualified heir disposes of farmland or ceases to use it for farming purposes after the decedent's death. The amount of the tax is the excess of the tax that would have been imposed. The recapture tax is calculated as the difference between the tax on the estate with the qualified farmland interest and the tax on the estate without it, reduced by applicable credits. The value of the farmland interest is determined at the date of disposition or cessation. The adjusted value of a qualified farmland interest for tax purposes may be reduced by an $8,000,000 exclusion amount, subject to certain conditions and regulations set by the Secretary. The Secretary may not impose a lien on the estate of the decedent or qualified farmland for tax and reporting purposes. Rules similar to those of section 2032A apply, and the election must be made by the due date for filing the tax return. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the date of the enactment of this Act."
