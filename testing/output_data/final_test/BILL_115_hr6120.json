The \"SELF Act\" establishes a grant program for eligible entities to develop, implement, and evaluate parent education programs focusing on social and emotional skills for parents and children. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis with a maximum amount of $1,200,000 per grant. The programs aim to provide instruction to parents on social and emotional skills, effective teaching strategies for children, and training for teachers to support parents in teaching these skills at home. An eligible entity receiving a grant under the \"SELF Act\" must use the funds to implement a program at schools that involves teaching social and emotional skills to parents and teachers through research-based materials. The program should also offer professional development for educators and direct instruction on social and emotional learning to parents at convenient times and locations. The program funded under the \"SELF Act\" aims to increase diversity of participating families, involve parents from various organizations as mentors, and improve measurable child outcomes. State educational agencies will award subgrants to local educational agencies for program implementation. Public-private partnerships are encouraged for each eligible entity. Each eligible entity awarded a grant under the \"SELF Act\" is encouraged to partner with schools, higher education institutions, nonprofit organizations, community-based organizations, or entities with a successful educational support record. Grant applications must show a long-term commitment to the program by providing space and scaling successful initiatives for parents.
