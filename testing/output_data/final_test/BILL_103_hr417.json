    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securities Private Enforcement Reform Act\". The Congress finds that excessive securities litigation diverts capital resources, hinders companies from raising capital, and creates a nonmerit-based system where professional plaintiffs extract settlements from entrepreneurs. Securities lawsuits impose additional costs on publicly traded companies and can lead to bankruptcy. Securities fraud lawsuits harm publicly traded companies, leading to job losses and hindering the development of future products by deterring investment bankers and accounting firms from working with new venture firms. Reforms in securities fraud laws are necessary for proper adjudication of cases. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section on private civil action procedures. Sec. 20B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 introduces a requirement of proportionate liability in implied private actions. Defendants found liable for damages may only be jointly and severally liable if they engaged in knowing securities fraud. Otherwise, liability is determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the plaintiff, defendants, and other alleged parties. The trier of fact determines the percentages of responsibility for entities alleged to have caused harm to the plaintiff. Each defendant's percentage of responsibility is multiplied by the total damage suffered by the plaintiff, resulting in a verdict or judgment against the defendant. Liability is determined based on the causal relationship between the conduct and the damage claimed by the plaintiff. Liability under this subsection results in joint liability on any judgment entered against another party in the action. Defendants cannot recover from each other unless permitted by a contractual relationship. \"Knowing securities fraud\" involves making false representations with actual knowledge and awareness of potential reliance by others. The liability in damages for reckless conduct by a defendant in securities fraud shall be determined in accordance with specific provisions. This subsection only pertains to the allocation of damages among defendants and does not affect liability standards in implied private actions under this Act. Additionally, the court may award attorney fees to the prevailing party in a private action if a final judgment is entered based on a motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, or trial on the merits. The court may award attorney fees and expenses to the prevailing party unless the losing party's position was substantially justified. The determination is based on the record of the civil action. The party must submit an application for fees within 30 days of a final judgment. The court may award attorney fees and expenses to the prevailing party based on an application that verifies entitlement and amount sought. The court has discretion to allocate the award against the unsuccessful party or its attorney, and may reduce or deny the award for unreasonable conduct during the proceedings. The court may award attorney fees and expenses to the prevailing party in discovery proceedings, including expert witness expenses and attorney fees, unless special circumstances make an award unjust. The court may award attorney fees and expenses to the prevailing party in discovery proceedings, including expert witness expenses and attorney fees, unless special circumstances make an award unjust. In any implied private action arising under this Act that is certified as a plaintiff class action, reasonable costs for necessary preparation of the party's case, attorney fees, and expenses may be awarded based on prevailing market rates. In class actions under the Federal rules of civil procedure, the share of any final judgment or settlement awarded to a representative plaintiff is calculated the same as for other members of the plaintiff class. Attorneys representing the plaintiff class in implied private actions must not have any ownership or beneficial interest in the securities involved in the litigation, or be affiliated with such attorneys. Violation of this rule results in disqualification from representing any party in the action. In implied private actions under this Act, attorneys are prohibited from representing the plaintiff class if they have paid or are obligated to pay a fee to a third party for assistance in obtaining representation. Violation of this rule results in disqualification from representing any party in actions under this Act or the Securities Act of 1933. Disgorged funds from Commission actions cannot be used for attorney fees in private actions. Payment for attorney fees or expenses incurred by private parties seeking distribution of disgorged funds in implied private actions under this Act may be diminished by amounts required to be disgorged pursuant to a court order obtained by the Commission. In implied private actions where money damages can only be recovered with proof of scienter, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to establish this element by clear and convincing evidence. In implied private actions under this Act, plaintiffs must allege facts suggesting the defendant acted with scienter to recover money damages. A defendant can be held liable as an aider and abettor if they knowingly assisted another party in violating the Act for their own benefit. The Act allows plaintiffs to recover money damages in implied private actions by alleging that the defendant knowingly assisted another party in violating the Act for their own benefit. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section limiting private rights of action for violations of the Act. Private actions must be brought within 5 years of the violation or within one year of discovery. The provisions of this Act apply to actions commenced after its enactment."
