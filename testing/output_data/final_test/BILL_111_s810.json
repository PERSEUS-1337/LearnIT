    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ocean and Coastal Adaptation Planning Act\". Congress finds that oceans are a significant carbon sink, absorbing nearly 50% of human-emitted carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution. This increased absorption has led to ocean acidity, impacting marine ecosystems and carbon cycling. Climate change has also caused sea levels to rise significantly. Higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have led to increased air temperatures, warming ocean waters, and changes in ecosystem dynamics. Climate change will amplify risks to coastal populations, economies, and ecosystems, including saltwater inundation, more frequent flooding, shifts in species distributions, and beach erosion. Research is needed on the effects of climate change and ocean acidification on coastal environments. The impact of ocean acidification on coastal environments and the need for adaptation by coastal communities are crucial in responding to climate change and greenhouse gas pollution. The Act defines \"Administrators\" as the heads of NOAA and EPA, and \"Institute\" as one of the 4 Institutes for Ocean and Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification. The Administrators will establish 4 regional Institutes for Ocean and Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification at US higher education institutions. The purpose of each Institute is to conduct research, planning, and efforts to assess and adapt to climate change and ocean acidification impacts on ocean and coastal areas, including the Great Lakes. They will also serve as national and international resources for adaptation strategies. The Administrators will select 1 institution of higher education in each of the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Southeast/Gulf Coast regions to serve as an Institute for Ocean and Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification. The Administrators will select institutions of higher education in different regions to serve as Institutes for Ocean and Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification. Selected institutions will receive grants for their projects. The Administrators will select institutions of higher education to serve as Institutes for Ocean and Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change and Ocean Acidification. Selected institutions will receive grants for their projects within a specified timeline. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums may be appropriated as necessary for this Act."
