Global economic growth drives demand, while supply struggles to keep up. Small shifts in supply or demand can lead to significant price swings. Some argue that extreme price movements are not fully explained by fundamentals. The second explanation for unstable commodity prices focuses on financial markets for derivatives contracts linked to the price of oil. Many market participants are financial speculators who can drive oil prices above fundamental levels, resulting in a \"speculative premium\" that imposes unjustified costs on consumers. The relationship between speculation and commodity prices is still debated among academics and regulators. This report provides background on oil derivatives markets and the different types of firms that trade in those markets. The report provides background on oil derivatives markets and the different types of firms that trade in those markets. It also includes a brief section on the fundamental factors affecting oil prices, such as daily transactions, benchmarks for spot prices, and futures contracts. Oil futures contracts are financial instruments that track the price of oil without the need for physical delivery. Traders buy and sell these contracts, which contribute to determining the futures market price. Both physical and derivative trades impact the price of oil, making it challenging to separate the influence of trades by producers. Oil futures contracts represent 1,000 barrels of oil and involve bilateral contracts where one party gains if the price moves in one direction, and the other party gains if it moves in the opposite direction. The impact of trades by producers, commercial users, and financial speculators on oil prices remains controversial. The mechanics of oil futures and the types of traders in the market are described in the next sections. When a futures contract is made, one party agrees to buy oil at a future date from the other. Contracts have different expiration months but the size is always the same. The price is based on the current futures market price, which fluctuates continuously. If the price of oil increases, the long trader benefits by buying at a lower price. The long trader benefits from buying oil at a lower price, gaining profit as the price increases. The short trader, on the other hand, faces losses and may exit the market by entering an offsetting transaction. This evens out her position, removing her from the market. The short trader exits the market, which does not affect the long trader. All contracts are assumed by the exchange's clearing house, allowing for trading strategies based on short-term price expectations. Traders can enter and exit the market without physical commodity delivery. The exchange clearing house controls traders' funds and requires an initial margin payment. The CME Group's margin for speculators as of August 31, 2011 is marked-to-market daily. Traders can exit the market with remaining funds returned. Options on futures contracts give the holder the right to enter into a long or short futures contract. The option is exercised if price movements are favorable. Traders face high risks in futures speculation. Swap contracts are traded in the over-the-counter market, with terms negotiated between counterparties. They are equivalent to futures, where one counterparty gains if prices rise and the other if prices fall. Derivatives traders can be hedgers or speculators in futures markets. In futures markets, participants can be categorized as hedgers or speculators. Commercial hedgers are involved in the production, processing, transportation, or use of oil and petroleum products. They buy and sell oil to meet the physical needs of their businesses, engaging in both long-term sales agreements and short-term contracts for physical delivery. Derivatives in the oil market allow commercial participants to manage risks and hedge against price fluctuations. For example, an airline can purchase long derivatives contracts to offset higher jet fuel prices, while an upstream oil company can obtain short derivatives to insure against lower future oil prices. Swap dealers use futures markets to hedge risk associated with swap transactions, such as a pension fund entering into a swap linked to a commodity price index. A swap dealer in the investment portfolio may enter into a swap linked to a commodity price index. To hedge the risk, the dealer may take an opposite position in the futures market. Swap dealer positions involve both hedging and speculation, with counterparties ranging from speculative traders to producers and commercial users. Money managers, a group of speculative traders, invest in futures on behalf of clients. Money managers invest in futures for clients and must register with the CFTC. Speculators in futures include hedge funds, floor traders, firms, and wealthy individuals. Retail presence in futures is lower than in the stock market. Different terms are used for speculators with varying time horizons, such as \"scalpers\" and \"day traders.\" High-frequency trading is becoming more prevalent in derivatives trading. Oil futures trading involves different types of traders, including \"day traders\" who liquidate positions before the close of trading to avoid overnight price risk, and \"trend followers\" who hold positions open for longer periods to profit from long-term price trends. Speculators are assumed to dominate short-term trading, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission publishing data on market participants' positions in weekly reports. The data reflect the open interest as of the previous Tuesday's close of trading. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission publishes weekly reports on market participants' positions in oil futures trading, reflecting the number of contracts outstanding as of the previous Tuesday's close. The reports show changes in traders' long, short, or spread positions, but do not cover swap contracts. The CFTC has new regulatory authority over the swaps market, which may be reflected in future reports. Currently, the data only cover exchange-traded futures and options on futures. The open interest in crude oil futures and options on futures is detailed in Table 1, showing that speculators hold the majority of contracts. Producer/merchant hedgers make up 19%, swap dealers 38%, and non-reportable contracts less than 4%. No class of trader dominates the market share. The majority of crude oil futures contracts are held by speculators, with spread positions being common. Managed money positions are concentrated on the long side, suggesting profit when prices rise. Reportable positions make up over 95% of open interest, indicating limited involvement from retail investors. The CFTC released a one-time report on large trader net position changes in June 2011. The CFTC released a one-time report in June 2011 on large trader net position changes in Nymex crude oil futures, covering January 2009 to May 2011. The report shows weekly average net position changes for long and short positions for different trader categories. Figure 2 displays net buys and sells for managed money trading, including hedge funds, commodity pool operators, and others, alongside oil price changes during the same period. Each point in the graph represents a weekly change in these figures. Figure 2 displays the correlation between money manager transactions and oil price movements. Data points in the graph show weeks when money managers were net buyers and the price of oil rose, or when they were net sellers and the price dropped. The graph suggests that there is a relationship between their transactions and price changes, with a tendency for managers to buy heavily when prices rise and sell when prices fall. The correlation between money manager transactions and oil price movements is shown in Figure 2. Regression analysis in Appendix A confirms a significant correlation between the two. Commercial hedgers, swap dealers, and other speculators show no apparent correlation with price movements in Figures 3, 4, and 5. This suggests that crude oil futures do not follow the efficient market hypothesis. The group of speculators known as money managers can anticipate or influence oil price movements, raising questions about their forecasting abilities and impact on prices. It is unclear why money managers are better at predicting prices compared to other speculators or commercial hedgers, given their relatively small market share. The mechanism by which money manager trades affect prices, potentially through intraday trading, remains uncertain. Money managers may have market power beyond their position size if short-term traders copy their strategies, leading to herding behavior and a speculative premium in oil prices. This behavior raises questions about their forecasting abilities and impact on prices. Money managers may trade on fundamental information and be skilled at identifying news that moves prices, leading to observed correlations. They may profit by following price trends, buying when prices rise and selling when they fall. Questions arise about their forecasting abilities and impact on prices compared to other market participants. Other market participants, such as hedgers, swap dealers, pension funds, and hedge funds, have varying investment time horizons and sensitivity to price changes. Hedgers are less affected by price changes as they make back losses in the spot market. Swap dealers reflect long-term commodity index investments by institutional investors for portfolio diversification. Hedge funds take aggressive positions for high yields and maximum returns. The 2008 CFTC study identified speculators as \"trend followers\" who base their positions on price expectations over days, weeks, or months. Weekly COT reports and net position change data are used to track trading with this time horizon, more common among money managers in oil futures. However, the data released by the CFTC does not support the conclusion that managed money trades cause long-term price changes. When weekly position changes are compared to price changes in the following week, the correlation essentially disappears. The 2008 CFTC study identified speculators as \"trend followers\" who base their positions on price expectations over days, weeks, or months. Weekly COT reports and net position change data are used to track trading with this time horizon, more common among money managers in oil futures. However, there is no correlation between managed money trades and long-term price changes. If derivatives speculators have mispriced oil, it could be due to deliberate manipulation or normal market operations. The Commodity Exchange Act addresses speculation and market manipulation in commodities and futures markets. While there is no clear definition of excessive speculation or market manipulation, court decisions and regulatory practices have shaped the understanding of these terms over time. The relationship between speculation and commodity prices remains a topic of debate, with conflicting interpretations of the data. The Commodity Exchange Act addresses speculation and market manipulation in commodities and futures markets. Courts have determined that manipulation must include an \"artificial\" or \"abnormal\" price in the futures market, a dominant market position, and intent to cause the artificial price. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFTC with additional anti-manipulation authority, including applying anti-manipulation provisions to the swap market and increasing criminal penalties. President Obama announced efforts to root out fraud and manipulation in the market. The Attorney General is leading a team to investigate fraud and manipulation in oil markets contributing to high gasoline prices. The team includes representatives from various agencies. In 2011, the CFTC filed an enforcement action against three energy trading firms and two individuals for manipulations in oil prices. The CFTC alleges that defendants manipulated oil prices by artificially driving up the price to profit from long futures positions, then quickly selling physical oil to profit from short positions. They lost $15 million on physical transactions but earned $50 million on derivatives. Their scheme relied on manipulating price differentials between futures contracts in 2008. The CFTC complaint alleges that defendants manipulated oil prices by widening spreads between futures contracts in 2008. The manipulation started on January 3, 2008, and ended on April 17, leading to a rise in oil prices from $99.17 to $114.80. Price increases continued after the manipulation ended, with crude oil rising by $15 per barrel in May and another $12 in June. This case involves short-term price dislocations in futures markets. The allegations of oil price manipulation in 2008 involved short-term price dislocations that did not explain the price run-up. Speculation can either stabilize prices or cause unexplained trends, with Milton Friedman arguing that speculators smooth out price fluctuations by buying low and selling high. Speculation in futures markets aims to stabilize commodity prices by smoothing out peaks and troughs. Empirical research suggests that futures trading can reduce price volatility in the underlying commodity. For example, a Federal Reserve study found that the intensity of speculative activity in futures markets had no explanatory power for metal price growth rates. The Interagency Task Force found that commodity spot price changes are driven by world economy activity, not futures market activity. They concluded that speculative activity did not systematically drive changes in oil prices. The report found that speculative activity does not systematically drive changes in oil prices. J.M. Keynes distinguishes between enterprise and speculation, with speculation focusing on forecasting market psychology. Keynes criticizes the market dominated by speculation, warning that when capital development becomes a by-product of a casino-like environment, the job is likely to be poorly done. Speculators may trade on irrelevant information, harming consumers and creating economic uncertainty. However, if speculators bring new fundamental information to the market, their trading can make price discovery more efficient. The Commodity Exchange Act addresses the impact of speculation on the oil market, stating that excessive speculation may distort prices. It is challenging to determine whether speculation is beneficial or harmful, as the line between the two is subjective. The Act aims to analyze the role of speculation in price bubbles and market behavior. Excessive speculation in the oil market is not illegal but can lead to sudden price fluctuations. The regulator determines when speculation becomes excessive, with no clear definition. High and volatile oil prices are often blamed on financial speculation. Critics argue that there is too much speculative trading, which can distort prices. Excessive speculation in the oil market is a concern due to the overwhelming presence of financial traders, who now account for the majority of contracts. Studies have shown that this excessive speculation has had \"undue\" influence on price movements in markets such as wheat and natural gas. The Amaranth hedge fund's gas futures trading showed how excessive speculation can distort futures prices for many months into the future. The CFTC and exchanges aim to prevent this distortion, especially in contracts far in advance. Addressing excessive speculation is seen as a significant opportunity to reduce gas prices for consumers, with some attributing oil price gyrations to speculative trading. Oil price gyrations are believed to be influenced by speculative trading, with critics arguing that increased financial speculation has a similar economic impact as illegal manipulation. While some studies suggest speculation may have played a role in previous oil price spikes, the impact of excessive speculation on price volatility remains debated. Financial institutions and investors moving funds into commodity markets can affect prices, but whether financial speculators base their decisions on the same factors as other market participants is uncertain. Excessive speculation in oil markets can lead to destabilization as speculators do not trade based on fundamentals, causing violent price swings unrelated to supply and demand. This speculative premium can result in prices higher than justified by market fundamentals. The CEO of ExxonMobil Corporation highlighted this issue in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee in May 2011. The CEO of ExxonMobil Corporation discussed the impact of speculation on oil prices, noting that while the fundamental cost of oil production is around $60 to $70, speculation can lead to price spikes due to market insecurity about future supply. The CEO of ExxonMobil Corporation highlighted how speculation can cause price spikes in the oil market due to market insecurity about future supply. Speculation factors in concerns about possible supply disruptions and the market's ability to respond, leading to prices being influenced by expectations of future events. Free markets are expected to differentiate between relevant fundamental information and extraneous \"noise\" that can cause prices to deviate from their true value. The argument against speculation distorting the oil market is based on the belief that excessive speculation by financial traders can be equivalent to price manipulation. The oil market can experience price spikes due to speculation and market insecurity about future supply. Factors like rapid global economic growth have led to increased demand for oil, causing prices to rise. However, oil supply and demand are inelastic to price changes in the near-term, requiring larger percentage changes in prices to incentivize supply or demand adjustments. Global economic growth drove up oil demand, especially in emerging markets undergoing industrialization. Key oil exporting countries faced supply challenges due to depletion and disruptions like strikes in Venezuela. Key oil exporting countries faced supply challenges due to reduced production from various factors such as strikes in Venezuela, militant attacks in Nigeria, and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Some countries also imposed barriers to private investment in oil exploration and production. OPEC, a cartel of oil exporting countries, adjusts production levels to control oil prices and maintains spare capacity to cushion oil markets during disruptions. OPEC countries, holding 77% of the world's oil reserves, only produce 42% of the world's oil supply. The organization struggled with low spare capacity between 2004 and 2008, impacting its ability to cushion against supply disruptions. This lack of development in reserves and spare production capacity may have contributed to the recent rise in oil prices. In the oil market, supply and demand quantities can be unresponsive to price changes, leading to large swings in price for small changes in consumption and production. Limited substitutes for oil mean consumers may absorb cost increases, reducing spending on other goods. Developing countries with rising incomes could absorb higher energy costs, while some had subsidies to offset price increases. Advanced economies were already impacted by high energy costs. Global oil consumption has been on the rise since 1993, with consumers in advanced economies able to absorb higher costs due to their relatively high incomes. However, low-income households and industries reliant on oil face challenges in reducing consumption, as equipment upgrades are costly and time-consuming. This has led to inelastic demand, with consumption not decreasing proportionally to price increases, except during the 2008-2009 recession. Global oil consumption has been steadily increasing since 1993, with a shift in growth from advanced to developing economies. Oil supply is slow to respond due to the complexity and expense of developing new fields, leading to inelasticity in supply in the short run. This is exacerbated by the industry moving towards more difficult-to-exploit resources like oil sands and deepwater offshore developments. Countries may restrict oil development for various reasons such as environmental concerns, resource management, and national objectives. Alternatives to oil, like biofuels and electric vehicles, face challenges in scaling up due to high costs, infrastructure requirements, and technical limitations. Some alternatives, like ethanol and coal-to-liquids, have potential negative impacts such as higher food prices and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the challenges faced by alternative technologies like biofuels and electric vehicles, many still required public support due to policy and political uncertainties. The U.S. economic recession in 2008 led to a decrease in demand for oil, causing prices to fall. OPEC responded by cutting output to support prices in early 2009. The decision to cut oil output in early 2009 supported prices and led to subsequent price increases. Geopolitical disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa, along with supply constraints, have contributed to recent oil price levels. Legislation before Congress aims to reduce speculation in oil and related energy commodities by imposing a 12% margin requirement on certain trades. Legislation before Congress aims to reduce speculation in oil and related energy commodities by imposing margin requirements on certain trades, with exceptions for hedging transactions. Position limits on swaps and futures in crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, or heating oil would be set by the CFTC. H.R. 2003 proposes a tax on oil futures, swaps, and options transactions, excluding those for hedging commercial risk. The tax proposed on oil futures, swaps, and options transactions would be levied at 0.01% of the value of the contract or premium paid, with exceptions for hedging commercial risk. Market fundamentals and financial factors have influenced oil prices, with speculation potentially driving significant price swings. Financial market conditions in energy contracts may exacerbate volatility, raising questions about the extent of recent price movements. The analysis conducted using STATA software program shows a positive correlation between net weekly change in managed money positions and weekly change in oil prices. However, the correlation with hedgers, swap dealers, and other traders is not statistically significant. The coefficient indicates the incremental effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. The analysis found a positive correlation between net weekly change in managed money positions and weekly change in oil prices. The coefficient implies the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. The dataset had 125 observations. The correlation remains robust after controlling for certain macroeconomic variables. Options in futures contracts result in a zero-sum game. Options in futures contracts create equal losses by long traders (or vice versa). Traders can use options to limit potential losses, where gains and losses are not symmetrical. Options give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price in the future. There are two types of options: calls and puts, with each having an expiration date and a strike price. The seller of the option is obligated to buy or sell the asset at the strike price. The seller of the option is obliged to buy or sell the asset at the strike price whenever the buyer chooses to exercise the option, in exchange for a one-time payment called the premium. The buyer's risk is limited to the premium amount, while the potential profit is unlimited. Option prices are influenced by factors like the relationship between the strike price and the current market price, known as the intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of an option is determined by the relationship between the strike price and the current market price of the asset. It is the value that the option holder would receive if they were to exercise the option immediately. In addition to intrinsic value, options also have time value, which is influenced by factors such as the time to expiration and the price volatility of the underlying asset. Time value reflects the probability of the option becoming profitable before it expires. Options can be traded on securities and futures exchanges or over-the-counter. Underlying assets include stocks, stock indexes, futures contracts, currencies, interest rates, and physical commodities. OTC contracts may include option-like features such as swaps, where counterparties agree to exchange payments based on financial variables like interest rates or commodity prices. For example, in an oil swap, one counterparty might agree to buy 1 million barrels of crude oil every three months for $80/barrel, while the other counterparty would buy at the Nymex spot-month price on the payment due date. Counterparty 1 has locked in a $80 price for five years to hedge against fuel price increases, while Counterparty 2 is committed to selling oil at $80/barrel to benefit if market prices drop below $80. Swap dealers manage price exposure through offsetting swaps or futures positions. In practice, fixed for floating payments do not occur in oil price swaps. Counterparties calculate a single net payment based on price changes since the last swap date. Swaps do not involve physical oil delivery and are exempt from regulation if mandatory delivery is required."
