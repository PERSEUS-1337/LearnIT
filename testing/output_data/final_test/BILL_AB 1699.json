    "title": "AB 1699",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the presence of homeless minors in urban, suburban, and rural areas of California, lacking basic necessities and often coming from abusive or unstable homes. These youth are vulnerable to drug abuse, human trafficking, and other illegal activities, with local agencies unable to provide sufficient support services. Homeless minors in California urgently need specialized services for survival and long-term support, as demonstrated by pilot programs in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Transitional living programs are crucial for successful outcomes. The purpose of this chapter is to address these needs. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain homeless youth emergency projects in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with the possibility of establishing additional projects. It aims to examine the condition of homeless youth in urban areas and develop a profile to provide for their survival needs and assist in reunification with parents or finding suitable homes. The Office of Emergency Services is defined for the purposes of this chapter. Homeless youth projects must provide food, shelter, counseling, outreach services, health screenings, and linkage to other services. The amended Section 13703 of the Welfare and Institutions Code includes provisions for linkage to other services, long-term stabilization planning for youth, follow-up services for stable placement, and transitional living services for homeless youth aged 18-24. One homeless youth emergency service project will be established in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Santa Clara counties, with additional projects planned for Orange County and other counties lacking services. Criteria for grant selection and amounts will be developed with input from stakeholders, including homeless youth and advocacy groups. The office will prepare and disseminate requests for proposals for homeless youth projects by specific dates. Projects must be operated by agencies in accordance with grant agreements. Operations of pilot projects must begin by certain dates in designated counties. The office will prepare and disseminate requests for proposals for homeless youth projects by specific dates, with a deadline of March 31, 2017 for additional emergency service projects. An agency eligible to apply for funds under this chapter and operate a homeless youth emergency service project must be a private, nonprofit agency with a successful track record in delivering services to homeless youth. The selected agency should be able to provide the services described in Section 13701 directly or through subcontracting with a competent provider. Preference will be given to agencies with a history of coordination with other agencies in the service region and those that involve a network of youth-serving agencies in service delivery. The General Fund appropriates $25 million to the Office of Emergency Services for homeless youth emergency service projects under Chapter 6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code."
