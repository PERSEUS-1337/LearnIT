    "content": "The policy of the United States aims to end animal suffering caused by steel-jawed leghold traps by prohibiting their import, export, and interstate shipment, along with fur from animals trapped in such traps. The Act defines \"article of fur\" and \"interstate commerce\" and clarifies the term \"import\" in relation to furskins and interstate trade. The term \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and government entities under US jurisdiction. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. A \"conventional steel-jawed leghold trap\" is a device designed to capture animals by snapping closed on their limb. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED ACTS AND PENALTIES. Prohibition of importing, exporting, or shipping fur derived from animals trapped in steel-jawed leghold traps. It is unlawful to import traps or fur in violation, sell or purchase illegal traps, or violate regulations set by the Secretary. Penalties apply for knowingly committing these acts. Penalties for violating the prohibition on importing, exporting, or shipping fur derived from animals trapped in steel-jawed leghold traps include an infraction for the first offense and imprisonment or fines for subsequent violations under title 18, United States Code. The Secretary will reward individuals who provide information leading to a conviction under this Act with half of the fine paid. Government officials are not eligible for rewards. Enforcement of the Act is outlined in Section 5. The Secretary enforces the Act and regulations with the help of other agencies. Import violations are treated as customs law violations, while export violations are enforced using the Export Administration Act of 1979. The district courts of the United States may issue warrants for enforcement of the Act and regulations, allowing for detention, search, and seizure of packages suspected of containing articles in violation of the Act. The Act allows for warrantless arrests for violations, execution of warrants issued by judges, and forfeiture of exports. Forfeiture provisions apply to articles of fur or steel-jawed leghold traps in violation of the Act, subjecting them to forfeiture to the United States. Laws regarding seizure, forfeiture, disposition of property, remission, and compromise of claims also apply to such violations. The Attorney General can seek injunctions against those violating the Act or its regulations. The Secretary of Commerce and other authorized agencies can assist in managing and disposing of seized property. Cooperation among relevant departments and agencies is required to enforce the Act and its regulations effectively and efficiently. The Secretary will create necessary regulations for implementing the Act, which will come into effect one year after its enactment."
