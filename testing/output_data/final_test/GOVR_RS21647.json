    "content": "President Bush signed the Junk Fax Prevention Act in 2005, which replaced previous FCC rules on unsolicited fax advertising. The act includes provisions such as an exemption for established business relationships, a requirement for a clear opt-out notice on faxes, and the need for businesses to accept opt-out requests 24/7. The Junk Fax Prevention Act requires businesses to accept opt-out requests 24/7. The FCC conducted a rulemaking to implement the act and the GAO issued a report on FCC's enforcement policies. FCC adopted final rules in 2006 allowing fax advertisements to parties with an established business relationship. The FCC established rules in 2006 for sending fax advertisements, requiring clear opt-out information and honoring requests within 30 days. Small businesses and nonprofit associations are not exempt from these rules, and the term \"unsolicited advertisement\" was clarified. The duration of an Established Business Relationship (EBR) was not addressed in this proceeding. The FCC issued 125 citations in response to 47,704 junk fax complaints from July 2005 to July 2006. The Commission fully addressed about 85% of alleged violations, including complaints where citations were issued and non-actionable violations. The GAO submitted a report to Congress on the FCC's enforcement of the junk fax law in April 2006. The GAO report on the FCC's enforcement of the junk fax law highlighted challenges in managing the increasing number of complaints. Despite a significant rise in complaints from 2000 to 2005, enforcement actions remained low, with only 261 warnings issued. Additionally, companies were ordered to pay forfeitures totaling over $6.9 million, but none of it was collected by the Department of Justice. FCC officials cited competing demands as a barrier to effective enforcement. The GAO report highlighted challenges in FCC's enforcement of the junk fax law, citing competing demands and resource constraints as hindrances. Strengths included emphasis on customer service and efficient targeting of enforcement resources, but weaknesses included inefficient data management and lack of consumer guidance. FCC faces management challenges in carrying out its junk fax responsibilities. The FCC lacks clearly articulated goals for junk fax monitoring and enforcement, leading to a lack of data analysis. Without performance goals and analysis of complaint data, the effectiveness of current enforcement measures cannot be determined."
