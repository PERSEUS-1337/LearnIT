    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Guaranteed Oil Spill Compensation Act of 2010\". The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, establishing strict liability for oil discharge into water, shorelines, or exclusive economic zone. It also establishes liability for damages related to cleanup costs, natural resources, property, and more, while limiting responsible parties' liability for damages beyond removal costs. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 established liability limits for vessel oil spills, with Congress later increasing these limits for single- and double-hulled vessels. The Coast Guard has the authority to adjust these limits for inflation, and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund balance was estimated by the Internal Revenue Service. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund balance was $1,700,000,000 in fiscal year 2009, pending resolution of claims. The Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup cost Exxon $2,000,000,000, with a settlement of $900,000,000 paid to Alaska and the Federal Government for civil claims. Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in significant financial consequences for Exxon. This included a $2 billion cleanup cost, $900 million settlement for civil claims, $25 million in fines, $100 million in restitution for criminal conduct, a $287 million jury award for damages to private parties, and a $5 billion punitive damages award. The Supreme Court later limited punitive damages to $507.5 million. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, following a blowout on April 20, 2010, resulted in an estimated flow rate of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day, making it the largest oil spill in US waters, surpassing the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the largest known oil spill in United States waters. The Gulf Coast region is the second most productive fishing region in the United States, with significant economic contributions from seafood production and recreational fisheries. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed a large area of the Gulf region due to the spill. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration closed a significant portion of the Gulf of Mexico to fishing, affecting various commercial sectors and causing economic disruption following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010. SEC. 3. OIL SPILL RECOVERY FUND. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 8A, establishing an Oil Spill Recovery Fund. The term 'Fund' refers to the Oil Spill Recovery Fund established under subsection (c). No person can enter into a Federal oil or gas lease without paying into the Fund an amount equal to their outstanding liability under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.

Repayment provisions are outlined for individuals who have paid. Repayment provisions are outlined for individuals who have paid into the Oil Spill Recovery Fund, with the Secretary transferring unexpended funds and accumulated interest back to the person within 5 years or upon resolution of all related claims. The Oil Spill Recovery Fund requires claims to be satisfied before funds are accessed for specific purposes outlined in the legislation. Quarterly reports detailing fund operations must be submitted to relevant congressional committees. The Oil Spill Recovery Fund requires quarterly reports on deposits, expenditures, recommendations for additional authorities, remaining balance, and outstanding liabilities compared to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.
