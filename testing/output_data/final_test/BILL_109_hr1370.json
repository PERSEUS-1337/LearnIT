The Act authorizes the development of a multipurpose cadastre of Federal real property for land management and resource conservation. A report on existing real property inventories must be submitted within 180 days, including details on expenditures and activities in fiscal year 2004. The cadastre will consolidate certain components authorized by law, with justification for those not included, cost savings, and recommendations for legislation to enhance efficiency. Coordination is required for implementation. The Secretary is required to coordinate and participate in establishing standards for interoperability of geospatial information related to the cadastre. This includes coordinating with the Federal Geographic Data Committee and making the cadastre interoperable with the Federal Real Property Profile. Contracts for surveying and mapping services under Executive Order 13327 should be provided by the private sector to develop the cadastre, following selection procedures in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949.
