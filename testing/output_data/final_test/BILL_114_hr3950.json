    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Small Business Tax Credit Act of 2015\" introduces a new section called \"Veteran Small Business Start-Up Credit\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Veteran Small Business Start-Up Credit\" provides a 15 percent tax credit for qualified veteran-owned small businesses, with a maximum of $80,000 in qualified start-up expenditures. A qualified veteran is defined as an individual who has served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States. The term \"controlled\" in the context of the Veteran Small Business Start-Up Credit refers to the management and operation of a business, including sole ownership, majority ownership in a corporation, or majority ownership in a partnership or joint venture. The term 'small business' is defined as a person engaged in a trade or business in the United States with gross receipts not exceeding $5,000,000 or employing not more than 100 full-time employees. Qualified start-up expenditures are defined as specific expenses related to starting a business. The term 'qualified start-up expenditures' includes start-up expenses defined in section 195(c) and amounts paid for real or personal property used in the active conduct of a trade or business. Taxpayers can elect to apply this section for the first 2 taxable years when ordinary and necessary expenses are deductible under section 162. Controlled groups and common control are treated as a single employer for tax credit purposes. The basis of property eligible for the credit is reduced by the amount of the credit. Section 45S introduces the veteran small business start-up credit as part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the tax code. The credit applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2016."
