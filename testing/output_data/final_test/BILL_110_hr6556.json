    "content": "In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. A \"covered vessel\" is defined as a vessel less than 79 feet in length or a fishing vessel regardless of its length. Other terms such as \"contiguous zone\", \"discharge\", \"ocean\", and \"State\" have specific meanings as defined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. During a 2-year period after this Act's enactment, no permit is required for certain discharges from covered vessels, including effluent from marine engines, laundry, shower, and galley sink wastes, and other incidental discharges. Exceptions include discharges of rubbish, trash, garbage, or other materials overboard, and when the vessel is not operating as a means of transportation. The Act exempts certain discharges from covered vessels from requiring a permit for a 2-year period, including effluent from marine engines, laundry, shower, and galley sink wastes. Exceptions include discharges of rubbish, trash, garbage, or other materials overboard, and when the vessel is not operating as a means of transportation. Other exemptions include discharges used for energy or mining facilities, storage facilities, seafood processing facilities, or secured to the bed of the ocean for mineral or oil exploration. Additionally, any discharge that violates water quality standards or poses a risk to human health or the environment may require a permit. SEC. 3. STUDY OF DISCHARGES INCIDENTAL TO NORMAL OPERATION OF VESSELS. The Administrator, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct a study to evaluate impacts of marine engine effluent, laundry, shower, and galley sink wastes, and other vessel discharges. The study will include characterizations and volume determinations for different types and classes of vessels. The study will include average volumes and locations of vessel discharges, analyses of potential effects on human health and the environment, benefits of reducing discharges, and regulation status under Federal law or international obligations. The Administrator will exclude certain discharges from the study, including discharges from Armed Forces vessels, sewage discharges from vessels (excluding graywater from Great Lakes vessels), and ballast water discharges. The Administrator will also publish a draft of the study for public comment and develop a final report after considering feedback. The Administrator will exclude specific discharges from the study, such as those from Armed Forces vessels and sewage discharges from vessels. A draft of the study will be published for public comment, and a final report will be submitted to relevant committees within 15 months of the Act's enactment."
