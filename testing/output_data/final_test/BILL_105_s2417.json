    "content": "RED SNAPPER ALLOWABLE CATCH QUOTAS. The exclusive economic zone is defined as the area adjacent to the United States encompassing all waters from the seaward boundary of coastal States. Gulf red snapper refers to red snapper of the Gulf of Mexico. Total allowable catch quotas for Gulf red snapper fisheries will be determined under specific regulations. For calendar years 1998 through 2001, the total allowable catch quota for Gulf red snapper is 9,120,000 pounds. Commercial fisheries have a quota of 51% of the total, while recreational harvesters have a quota of 49%. The harvesting of Gulf red snapper under specified quotas shall not be subject to bycatch reduction device conditions. Recreational bag limit for daily catch is 4 fish until December 31, 2001. During the specified period, crew members on for-hire vessels are prohibited from catching Gulf red snapper. The minimum size limit for Gulf red snapper is set at 15 inches until December 31, 2001. The Secretary of Commerce cannot establish fishery closing dates for Gulf red snapper that contradict the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's recommendations. The Secretary of Commerce, under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Management Act, is required to review turtle excluding devices (TEDs) for bycatch reduction by December 31, 1998. If found effective, these devices will be certified as functioning bycatch reduction devices. Additionally, a study will be conducted by the Secretary of Commerce to further assess the situation. The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service, will conduct a study to estimate bycatch reduction in the Gulf of Mexico using bycatch reduction devices. The study will begin on May 1, 2001, and must be completed by August 31, 2001, with peer review of the results. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct a study on bycatch reduction in the Gulf of Mexico using devices. Results will undergo peer review, and a report will be submitted to the Senate and House committees."
