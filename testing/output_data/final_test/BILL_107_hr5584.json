The Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians in Riverside County, California, cannot transfer or have their land condemned until the Secretary of the Interior makes a final decision on a fee to trust application for the land. The land is described in Document No. 211130 of the Office of the Recorder, Riverside County, California. The Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians in Riverside County, California, cannot transfer or have their land condemned until the Secretary of the Interior makes a final decision on a fee to trust application for the land, recorded on May 15, 2001. This section clarifies that the land described should not be considered as an Indian reservation for any purpose under Federal law. Electricity transmission line right-of-way in Cleveland National Forest is addressed in this section. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture will issue necessary approvals for a high-voltage transmission line in the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest in California. The line will run north to south, connecting existing transmission lines and meeting long-term electricity needs in the region. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture will approve a transmission line in the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest in California. The line will connect existing transmission lines, support future generating capacity, and avoid entering wilderness areas. The Bureau of Land Management will oversee environmental and administrative reviews. The Secretary of Agriculture will complete environmental reviews for the corridor on Forest Service land, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior. The right-of-way route through the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest will avoid the need for regional transmission lines in heavily populated areas like the Temecula Valley. Federal agencies conducting reviews under subsection (a) must work quickly to complete the process. The necessary approvals for the transmission line right-of-way must be issued within 60 days after the completion of reviews. State authority in decision-making regarding the transmission line is preserved. The right-of-way will be subject to terms set by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. The Interior and Agriculture Secretaries will take necessary actions to protect historic, cultural, tribal, and natural resources under their jurisdiction after an environmental review."
