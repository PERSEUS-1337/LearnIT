The Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee is established within the Transportation Security Administration to advise on surface transportation security matters, including risk-based security approaches. The Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee is composed of voting and nonvoting members appointed by the Administrator to represent various modes of surface transportation. Voting members are stakeholders from passenger rail, freight rail, and other relevant sectors.

Classified information access is managed according to Executive Order No. 13526. The Advisory Committee voting members must protect sensitive security information and classified information according to regulations. They may meet with other advisory committees to discuss security issues.

The Advisory Committee must submit an annual report to the Administrator and relevant congressional committees detailing its activities, findings, and recommendations from the previous year. The Administrator is required to publish a public version of the report within 6 months of receiving it.

The Administrator must provide updates to specified committees on the status of Advisory Committee recommendations for surface transportation security efforts. A public website listing Advisory Committee members must be maintained. The Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee website must list members, provide contact information, and details on meetings, minutes, reports, and recommendations implementation. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this committee. The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration will appoint voting members within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee, established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, requires each Federal department and agency with regulatory authority over surface transportation to designate a nonvoting representative. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act. Subtitle C--Surface Transportation Security includes Sec. 1621 for the Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee. SEC. 3 outlines the Technology Investment Plan. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include additional update requirements for reports related to technology investments in transportation security. These updates must be prepared in consultation with specified individuals and entities, including the Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee. The reports should cover technology investments supported by the Department for aviation, air cargo, and surface transportation security, and may include a classified addendum on sensitive security risks. The amendment addresses transportation security risks and capability gaps that can be mitigated by security-related technology. It will take effect upon enactment and apply to future reports under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The House of Representatives passed the amendment on June 25, 2018. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
