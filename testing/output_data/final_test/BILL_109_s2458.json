    "content": "The \"Kick Start to College Act\" allows for a tax credit match of contributions to Coverdell Education Savings Accounts under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Kick Start to College Act\" allows a tax credit for contributions to a qualified higher education subaccount for the benefit of a qualified beneficiary. The credit is limited to $1,000 or $6,000 per beneficiary, reduced by the total credits allowed. The tax credit amount under the \"Kick Start to College Act\" is subject to reduction based on the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer. If the qualified beneficiary is over 7 years old before the end of the taxable year, the credit amount is reduced to $5,000 instead of $6,000. This reduction does not apply if the beneficiary turns 7 before January 1, 2007. The tax credit amount for the \"Kick Start to College Act\" is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. A qualified beneficiary is the designated beneficiary of a Coverdell education savings account who is a qualifying child of the taxpayer. The credit amount allowed under subsection (a) is not affected by other provisions of the title. The tax credit amount for the \"Kick Start to College Act\" is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. A qualified beneficiary is the designated beneficiary of a Coverdell education savings account who is a qualifying child of the taxpayer. Any credit allowed under subsection (a) for contributions to a qualified higher education subaccount is deposited by the Secretary into the account. Coordination with deposits ensures that the total credit amount is reduced by the aggregate amount deposited for each qualified beneficiary. Required information must be provided for each qualified beneficiary to claim the credit. The taxpayer must include specific information on the return of tax for the taxable year to claim the credit for contributions to a Coverdell education savings account. Rules similar to those for certain married individuals living apart apply for marital status determination in this section. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for this section, including modifications to Coverdell education savings account provisions allowing for qualified higher education subaccounts within the account. The Coverdell education savings account can be used exclusively for qualified higher education expenses, with contributions aggregated and certain payments not counted towards the limit. Treatment of distributions from a qualified higher education subaccount is based on whether they exceed the designated beneficiary's qualified education expenses, with only specific expenses considered. Any distribution must be rolled over to another qualified subaccount within a set time frame to be treated as a rollover contribution. Distributions from a qualified higher education subaccount exceeding the beneficiary's qualified expenses are not taxable but must be rolled over to another account within a specified time frame. The taxpayer receiving excess payments or distributions will have the amount increased by 100 percent. Payments are considered to come first from section 36(d)(1) payments. This clause does not apply to certain payments or distributions. Conforming amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking the last item and inserting new items. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006."
