    "content": "Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs receiving federal funds or conducted by executive agencies. It was the basis for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, which covers the private sector and has some differences from Section 504. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 amended the definition of disability in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This report examines Section 504, recent amendments, regulations, and Supreme Court interpretations. It discusses the differences between Section 504 and the ADA, as well as its relationship to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Senator Humphrey highlighted the importance of Section 504 during congressional debate in 1973. The Senator introduced bills to amend Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities. The implementation of Section 504 was delayed, leading to isolation of millions. In 1978, regulations were published after a federal court ruling and demonstrations at HEW offices. Amendments expanded Section 504 nondiscrimination requirements to executive agency programs and added Section 505 for remedies and procedures. Section 504 has been amended multiple times since 1973, with the core requirement in subsection (a) stating that no qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded or denied benefits solely due to their disability. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Regulations must be promulgated by agency heads to enforce these provisions. Subsection (b) defines \"program or activity\" and was added in 1988 to clarify the scope of coverage. The Education Amendments of 1972 clarified that discrimination is prohibited throughout institutions receiving federal financial assistance. Subsection (c) of Section 504 exempts small providers from making significant structural alterations for accessibility. Subsection (d) requires the same standards for employment discrimination complaints as the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 amended the definition of disability in Section 504 to align with the ADA, ensuring uniform definitions for covered entities and protecting the civil rights of individuals with disabilities. The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability to ensure broad coverage and protection of individuals with impairments. The act includes new rules for interpreting disability, such as considering impairments that substantially limit one major life activity without needing to limit others, and disregarding the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures when determining disability. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the definition of disability to include various major life activities and bodily functions. Section 504 regulations were first established in 1978, with subsequent amendments extending nondiscrimination requirements to executive agency programs. Section 504 regulations were established in 1978, tailored to each executive agency and the Postal Service. President Carter's Executive Order 12250 designated the Department of Justice to coordinate nondiscrimination provisions, including Section 504. The Supreme Court has referenced Section 504 in ADA cases since 1990, with Southeastern Community College v. Davis being the first case involving a student with a hearing disability seeking nursing training. The Supreme Court ruled in Southeastern Community College v. Davis that a student with a hearing disability was not \"otherwise qualified\" to be trained as a registered nurse due to her inability to understand speech without lip reading. The Court found that the college did not violate \u00a7504 by denying her admission, as the regulations did not intend to limit educational institutions from setting reasonable physical qualifications for clinical programs. No changes to the program were deemed necessary to accommodate the student. In Alexander v. Choate, the Supreme Court found no violation of Section 504 when a proposed limitation on Medicaid coverage did not discriminate against individuals with disabilities. The Court emphasized the need for even-handed treatment and opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in programs receiving federal funds. The Act does not guarantee equal results for individuals with disabilities in Medicaid provision. Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone addressed employment discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, stating that the Act aims to increase employment for individuals with disabilities. Bowen v. American Hospital Association dealt with Section 504 regulations for providing healthcare to infants with disabilities. The Court struck down regulations under Section 504 that required nourishment and treatment for infants with disabilities, stating that federal officials cannot intervene in treatment decisions traditionally made by parents and physicians. School Board of Nassau County v. Arline examined the qualification of individuals with disabilities for jobs, such as when a person with a contagious disease is considered \"otherwise qualified.\" Gene Arline's employment as an elementary school teacher was terminated after a relapse of tuberculosis. The Supreme Court held that a person with a contagious disease may be considered disabled under Section 504, but if they pose a significant risk of transmitting the disease to others that cannot be reduced by reasonable accommodation, they may not be qualified for a job. The decision should be based on medical judgments about the nature, duration, severity, and likelihood of transmission and harm. Traynor v. Turnage examined the application of Section 504 to the Veterans' Administration, where veterans were denied an extension of educational benefits due to disability. The Supreme Court addressed whether 38 U.S.C. \u00a7211(a) prevented them from reviewing if a VA regulation violated Section 504 regarding veterans denied benefits due to alcoholism. The Court held that suits were not precluded as Section 211(a) only insulates decisions made in interpreting or applying a specific provision of the statute to a set of facts. The Supreme Court examined whether a VA regulation violated Section 504 regarding veterans denied benefits due to alcoholism. The Court found that the regulation did not violate Section 504 and noted that Congress can prioritize resources for veterans' benefits. The Supreme Court in Barnes v. Gorman ruled that punitive damages cannot be awarded under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Jeffrey Gorman, a wheelchair user, sued the Kansas City police for injuries during his arrest, winning compensatory but not punitive damages. The Supreme Court in Barnes v. Gorman unanimously ruled that punitive damages cannot be awarded under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Justice Scalia's opinion stated that the remedies for violations of Section 202 of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are coextensive with those available under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Neither Section 504 nor Title II of the ADA specifically mention punitive damages, instead referencing the remedies of Title VI. Scalia emphasized that Spending Clause legislation is akin to a contract, requiring voluntary acceptance of its terms by the recipient. The Supreme Court ruled in Barnes v. Gorman that punitive damages are not available under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. Justice Scalia emphasized that remedies under the ADA and Section 504 are similar to those under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and likened Spending Clause legislation to a contract that must be voluntarily accepted by the recipient. The ADA and Section 504 have overlapping coverage but also important distinctions, with Section 504 limited to programs receiving federal funds while the ADA broadly covers the private sector. The ADA and Section 504 have overlapping coverage but also important distinctions. The ADA contains specific exemptions for religious entities, while Section 504 does not. Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination, similar to entities covered by Section 504. Enforcement procedures differ, with ADA complaints filed with the EEOC and Section 504 complaints with the Office of Civil Rights. A discrimination complaint can be filed with the Office of Civil Rights or the Department of Justice for agencies providing federal financial assistance. Federal statutes like IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA address the rights of individuals with disabilities to education. The Department of Education interprets Section 504 compliance standards for schools to be the same as IDEA requirements. The Rehabilitation Act is amended by the ADA Amendments Act to reference the ADA's definition of disability. The ADA Amendments Act amended the Rehabilitation Act to align with the ADA's definition of disability. The implications of these changes for children in K-12 schools are unclear, with potential increase in Section 504 plans for students. The ADA Amendments Act aligned the Rehabilitation Act with the ADA's definition of disability, potentially leading to more K-12 students receiving Section 504 plans, especially those with diabetes, asthma, food allergies, dyslexia, and ADD. Concerns were raised about the inclusion of \"reading\" as a major life activity, as it may be difficult to differentiate between students with a disability and those who lack proper instruction."
