Children placed in tribal custody are eligible for foster care funding under the Social Security Act. The responsibility for the placement and care of these children lies with the State agency, a public agency with an agreement with the State agency, or an Indian tribe or intertribal consortium. Indian tribal organizations eligible for foster care funding under the Social Security Act must have a cooperative agreement with a State or submit arrangements for child welfare services to the Secretary.
