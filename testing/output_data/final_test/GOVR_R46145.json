    "content": "NOAA defines natural infrastructure as healthy ecosystems like forests and wetlands that provide benefits such as storm protection and enhanced water services. Nature-based infrastructure combines natural features with engineering approaches. NOAA uses the terms interchangeably and lists various nature-based infrastructure features. Nature-based infrastructure projects, as identified by NOAA, can include natural features like open lands and trees, or incorporate steel and concrete structures like bulkheads. The selection of these features depends on factors such as funding, space constraints, technical feasibility, and community acceptance. These projects offer benefits beyond flood and erosion management, such as improved water quality, wildlife habitat, groundwater recharge, recreation opportunities, and aesthetic appeal. The extent of these benefits depends on the project's location. NOAA's nature-based infrastructure activities, guided by the National Habitat Policy, focus on protecting, maintaining, and restoring ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems. These activities are primarily carried out by three line offices within NOAA: the National Marine Fisheries Service, National Ocean Service, and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. Many of these projects involve restoration and conservation efforts. The NMFS's Restoration Center administers a grant program for nature-based infrastructure activities, including restoration projects in coastal and Great Lakes states. Over 2,000 community-based restoration projects are listed in the NOAA Restoration Atlas, with multiple benefits such as shoreline erosion reduction and improved fish habitat. Several programs and activities under NOS support research and implementation of nature-based infrastructure, such as the Coral Reef Conservation Program, National Coastal Zone Management Program, and National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Coastal scientists estimate the economic value of nature-based infrastructure in stabilizing coastlines. The Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program supports nature-based infrastructure implementation through funds recovered in settlements or litigation. The Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program supports nature-based infrastructure implementation through funds from settlements or litigation, such as the design of a living shoreline in Pensacola, FL funded by the BP Deepwater Horizon spill settlement. The Climate Program Office and Sea Grant also support research and implementation of nature-based infrastructure through grant programs. Alaska Sea Grant and New York Sea Grant support nature-based infrastructure projects through trainings and funding for monitoring shoreline erosion management. NOAA programs review and provide data for decision-making on nature-based infrastructure projects, with the NMFS Office of Protected Resources often involved in projects affecting protected species. NOAA also directs funding to nonfederal organizations like the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to support nature-based infrastructure activities. The Wildlife Foundation receives funds from NOAA for nature-based infrastructure activities, including the National Coastal Resilience Fund. Congress has not defined nature-based infrastructure for NOAA as it has for USACE and EPA. Congress has not defined nature-based infrastructure for NOAA as it has for USACE and EPA. However, some Members of Congress have proposed definitions within the context of new NOAA programs, such as H.R. 1317, H.R. 3115, and S. 1730 in the 116th Congress. A NOAA-specific definition of nature-based infrastructure may help prioritize and manage its activities. Congress has not defined nature-based infrastructure for NOAA as it has for USACE and EPA. A NOAA-specific definition may help prioritize and manage its activities, but it could also limit new designs and conflict with other federal agency definitions. NOAA has interpreted some authorities to include support for nature-based infrastructure activities. NOAA has interpreted some authorities to include support for nature-based infrastructure activities, such as the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program and conservation of coral reefs. These activities aim to protect important coastal and estuarine areas with significant ecological, historical, and aesthetic values. Coral reefs, identified as nature-based infrastructure, provide wave buffering and shoreline erosion protection. Some stakeholders argue that NOAA can already support nature-based infrastructure features through existing statutes, while others in Congress propose legislation to expand NOAA's support for such activities. Bills like H.R. 1317 and H.R. 3115 aim to enhance resilience to natural disasters and climate change by utilizing natural and nonstructural features. However, there is opposition to expanding NOAA's authority in this area. Some in Congress oppose new NOAA grant program for nature-based infrastructure activities, arguing it strays from providing states flexibility. NOAA supports projects like Pensacola Bay Living Shoreline with federal and nonfederal partners. NOAA participates in federal efforts to understand and support nature-based infrastructure. NOAA, as part of federal initiatives, co-chaired a task force with the U.S. Geological Survey post-Hurricane Sandy. The task force led to a 2015 report focusing on coastal green infrastructure metrics, ecosystem-service valuation, and decision-making support. Additionally, NOAA is involved in the interorganizational SAGE working group, which aims to advance nature-based infrastructure practices. Advances in nature-based infrastructure are being made across organizations, with NOAA participating in SAGE pilot projects to address shoreline loss. SAGE facilitates discussions on technical, policy, and financial issues and serves as a resource aggregator. Congress may consider directing NOAA to manage nature-based infrastructure activities within the agency or with other organizations through various mechanisms like intra-agency working groups or advisory boards. Establishing an advisory board or similar group could improve coordination within NOAA and with other agencies. Congress may authorize a working group like SAGE or create a new group for nature-based infrastructure. Some stakeholders believe statutory requirements for coordination could enhance information sharing and funding efficiency. Others argue NOAA should focus on current directives unless specifically authorized for nature-based activities. NOAA is funded by Congress for research, restoration, and conservation of natural resources. NOAA is funded by Congress for research, restoration, and conservation of natural resources. However, nature-based infrastructure activities are not specifically tracked in NOAA's budget reports to Congress. Congress may consider requiring NOAA to track and report spending on nature-based infrastructure activities. Other federal agencies also do not track spending related to nature-based infrastructure activities, and Congress may consider requiring all federal agencies to report their expenditures in this area. Congress may consider requiring federal agencies to report their nature-based infrastructure expenditures, including NOAA. Stakeholders have different views on how Congress should fund these activities, such as appropriating funds for existing or new programs that provide grants for research and implementation of nature-based infrastructure. Several bills in the 116th Congress propose funding for nature-based infrastructure activities, such as creating grant programs for living shorelines and establishing the Carbon Dividend Trust Fund with fund transfers to federal agencies like NOAA. Some Members of Congress argue that new grant programs for nature-based infrastructure, like the living shoreline grant program in H.R. 3115, are redundant and wasteful as NOAA already receives funding for such initiatives."
