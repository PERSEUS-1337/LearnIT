The \"American Unemployed Worker Investment Act of 2013\" offers a credit for employers hiring individuals on unemployment compensation. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code defines a qualified unemployment compensation recipient for small business employers. The term 'qualified unemployment compensation recipient' refers to an individual certified by a local agency as not a student for at least 6 months prior to the hiring date, receiving unemployment compensation, and hired within 2 years of the enactment. The text discusses the eligibility criteria for the employer tax credit, specifying that it applies to employers with 10-25 full-time equivalent employees. It also mentions a maximum credit of $4,000 per employee and the requirement of full-time employment for one year to qualify for the credit.
