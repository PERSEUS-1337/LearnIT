The energy trade between the two countries supports economic growth and thousands of jobs. The U.S.-Canada energy relationship is crucial for energy security, but it is undergoing significant changes, especially in the petroleum and natural gas sectors. Congress is facing important policy questions in this context. The U.S.-Canada energy relationship is crucial for energy security, with important policy questions in areas such as cross-border pipelines, oil sands, natural gas production, and LNG exports. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress could impact these developments, including H.R. 1938 for the Keystone XL pipeline and H.R. 909 for petroleum and natural gas production. S. 304 would support worker training programs. The U.S.-Canada energy trade is influenced by legislative proposals in Congress, such as worker training programs for oil and gas infrastructure in Alaska. Energy policies in both countries are interconnected, with implications for petroleum and natural gas sectors. The report discusses key connections among energy trends and implications for the U.S.-Canada energy relationship. In 2010, Canadian petroleum and natural gas accounted for 9% of total U.S. primary energy consumption, with energy imports from Canada totaling $83.6 billion. The United States imported $83.6 billion worth of Canadian petroleum and natural gas in 2010, accounting for about 3.5% of all U.S. imports of goods and services. The North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has facilitated energy trade between the two countries, with U.S. and Canadian companies integrated in the development, production, transportation, and marketing of energy commodities. The United States and Canada have close connections in the energy sector, with joint ventures on petroleum and natural gas projects. High capacity pipelines connect the two countries, with Canadian energy exports entering the U.S. at 25 points along the border. Major receiving states include Idaho, New York, Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota. The United States and Canada have a strong trade relationship in petroleum and natural gas, with energy exports transported by pipelines, trucks, trains, and marine vessels. Recent transformations include growth in Canadian oil sands, cross-border pipeline projects, Arctic natural gas commercialization efforts, increased U.S. shale gas production, and new LNG facilities. These changes in technology and infrastructure investments may impact energy supply, demand, and trade balance between the two countries. Canada is a significant supplier of petroleum to the United States, with imports steadily increasing since the 1980s. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers projects a 50% increase in crude oil output by 2025, with most destined for the U.S. The U.S. also exports petroleum products to Canada. Canada's petroleum exports to the United States have been steadily increasing since the 1980s. The growth is driven by oil sands production, which accounts for 80% of Canada's petroleum reserves. By 2025, oil sands are projected to make up 80% of total Canadian oil production. However, this growth is controversial due to significant environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions and disturbance of land and wildlife. The environmental impacts of oil sands production, including land disturbance, wildlife impacts, and water quality concerns, have been a subject of conflicting studies. Canadian petroleum exports to the United States have been increasing, with five major pipelines currently linking Canadian producing regions to US markets. Two new pipelines, Alberta Clipper and Keystone, began service last year, adding to the total capacity of 3.3 Mbpd. A sixth pipeline, Keystone XL, with a capacity of 0.8 Mbpd, is in the final stages of review by the U.S. State Department. If approved, Canada's total U.S. petroleum export capacity would exceed 4.1 Mbpd, enough to carry over 34% of U.S. petroleum imports in 2010. Large increases in Canadian supply are possible, with excess pipeline capacity expected for the next decade. Several pipeline projects within the U.S. are proposed to increase movements of Canadian petroleum to key U.S. market hubs. The recent expansion of petroleum pipelines from Canada has sparked controversy in the United States. Proponents argue for increased diversity in the U.S. petroleum supply and economic benefits, while opponents, including environmental groups, raise concerns about negative impacts of Canadian oil sands development. Opponents of Canadian oil sands development argue against new pipelines due to environmental concerns and U.S. dependency on fossil fuels. The Keystone XL pipeline proposal is under review by the State Department, with a decision expected by the end of 2011. H.R. 1938 (Sec. 3) would require a decision by November 1, 2011. The Arctic region holds significant natural gas reserves, with estimates exceeding 100 trillion cubic feet on Alaska's North Slope. The Arctic region contains over 1,600 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered natural gas resources, with a significant portion located in the Mackenzie River Delta region in the Canadian Arctic. Both the United States and Canada have recognized the potential of these resources and have pursued policies to develop them, including promoting the construction of natural gas pipelines from the Arctic to markets in the lower-48 United States. Serious interest in Arctic natural gas pipeline projects revived around 2000 due to increased U.S. natural gas demand, rising prices, and increased importation. The growth in U.S. natural gas demand, rising prices, and increased LNG importation led to a restart in Arctic natural gas pipeline development by U.S. and Canadian officials. Milestones included Alaska awarding TransCanada a license for a pipeline from Prudhoe Bay through Canada, a competing Denali proposal, and a revival of an all-Canada pipeline from the Mackenzie Delta. The proposed Alaska natural gas pipelines would pass through Canadian territory, and Canada has cooperated with the United States on their development. The Mackenzie pipeline is seen as a competitor to the Alaska gas pipeline due to limited construction resources and materials. Despite recent progress, obstacles remain for Arctic natural gas pipelines, such as low natural gas prices in the lower-48 states. The drop in prices from increased U.S. shale gas production may make Arctic natural gas projects economically unviable. In March 2011, Canadian authorities provisionally approved the Mackenzie pipeline. In March 2011, Canadian authorities provisionally approved the Mackenzie pipeline project, but analysts doubt its construction without new subsidies. The Denali pipeline proposal was discontinued in May 2011 due to a lack of commitment from potential Arctic gas producers. TransCanada remains committed to their Alaska pipeline project, which could impact U.S. energy prices and security if completed. Canada is a major supplier of natural gas to the United States. In 2010, Canada supplied 88% of the 3,683 billion cubic feet of natural gas imported by the United States. This accounted for approximately 13% of total U.S. natural gas consumption. Canadian natural gas exports to the U.S. grew rapidly from the mid-1980s to 2002 but have since declined due to increased domestic production and LNG imports. The U.S. has also started exporting natural gas to eastern Canada, displacing Canadian supplies. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a new pipeline from Marcellus shale gas fields in the United States to Canada, potentially increasing northward natural gas exports. The rise in U.S. domestic natural gas supplies has been driven by an unanticipated growth in natural gas production from shale. Energy companies have overcome technical challenges to make large natural gas resources in U.S. shales commercially available. The Energy Information Administration more than doubled its estimate of shale gas resources to 827 Tcf in 2011. U.S. shale gas reserves near major markets have an advantage over traditional supply basins. Canada also has significant shale gas reserves but lags behind the U.S. due to limited infrastructure. Changes in the North American natural gas industry are driven by the reversal of Canada-U.S. gas export trends. TransCanada had to restructure pipeline tariffs due to declining contract volumes. Shale gas plays have impacted Arctic natural gas development. The development of North American natural gas reserves and pipeline infrastructure is uncertain, with reduced U.S. imports of Canadian natural gas expected to continue. LNG imports to the United States were anticipated to increase in response to rising natural gas prices and potential shortages of pipeline natural gas. The expansion of LNG terminals in the United States and Canada was driven by the anticipated increase in LNG imports. Between 2001 and 2011, existing terminals were expanded, new terminals were constructed, and others were approved but not built. Competition between developers in the two countries led to diplomatic tension. However, the building boom in LNG terminals was premature as North American natural gas supplies from shale plays rapidly increased, reducing the need for LNG imports. Despite the initial boom in LNG terminal construction driven by anticipated imports, the surge in gas supplies from shale plays led to underutilized capacity. Now, some terminal owners are considering exporting North American natural gas to foreign markets like China and Japan. Proposed Canadian LNG export terminals in British Columbia aim to tap into Western Canada's shale gas reserves. Analysts see these exports as crucial for economically developing these reserves, which may not be competitive with U.S. supplies otherwise. Additionally, U.S. developers are seeking to modify existing import terminals for LNG exports, with more filings expected. The U.S. Department of Energy issued conditional authorization for LNG exports from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana to non-NAFTA countries in 2011. Potential competition between U.S. and Canadian LNG export projects could impact North American natural gas prices, creating upward price pressures. A large LNG export trade may limit U.S. natural gas exports to Canada in the future due to the integrated market between the two countries. Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy to the United States, providing oil and natural gas. The United States depends on Canada for energy supplies, while Canada relies on the U.S. as a critical supplier of refined petroleum products. Both countries are economically linked through investments in energy resources and assets. The energy relationship between the United States and Canada is mutually beneficial, with a history of steady flow of crude oil and natural gas. Recent developments in oil sands, shale gas production, pipeline capacity expansion, LNG exports, and Arctic natural gas have complicated this relationship, creating new competition and interconnections. Future energy policies in one country may have unforeseen effects on the other. Policies affecting U.S. shale gas production could impact North American natural gas prices, affecting the costs of producing petroleum from oil sands. Changes in oil sands costs could impact Canadian petroleum supplies to the U.S., altering north-south pipeline use and U.S. petroleum import requirements. This interconnected relationship between energy policies in the U.S. and Canada highlights the complexity policymakers face in making future energy, environmental, and transportation decisions. The energy sector in Canada may be influenced by legislative proposals in the U.S., impacting decisions on petroleum exports to Asia. The economic value, energy security, and environmental impacts of energy policies and projects must be considered. Congress has favored a growing U.S.-Canada energy partnership, but ensuring mutual benefits will be a key oversight challenge. Ensuring mutual benefits in the U.S.-Canada energy partnership will be a key oversight challenge for the next decades. Congress may need to reconsider key energy initiatives to meet long-term policy objectives."
