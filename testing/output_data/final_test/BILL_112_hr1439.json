The Act from 1959 is amended to extend prohibitions on net income taxes to other business activity taxes starting in 2012. States are prohibited from imposing any tax that they are restricted from imposing under this section. SEC. 3. MINIMUM JURISDICTIONAL STANDARD FOR STATE AND LOCAL NET INCOME TAXES AND OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITY TAXES. No State taxing authority can impose a net income or business activity tax on a person engaged in interstate commerce without a physical presence in the State. Physical presence includes being in the State personally or through assigned employees, or using an agent to establish or maintain the market. For tax purposes, physical presence in a state includes being there personally, through employees, or using an agent to establish or maintain the market. De minimis physical presence excludes being in a state for less than 15 days or for limited business activity. The Act adjusts requirements for establishing physical presence in days and sets minimum jurisdictional standards. Exceptions include domestic entities and individuals domiciled or residents of the state where the tax is imposed. The Act adjusts requirements for physical presence in days and sets jurisdictional standards. It does not affect State business tax liability of partners or similar entities with physical presence in the State. It also does not supersede State authority to enforce laws against individuals or entities. The Act does not override state laws against illegal activities in business to ensure accurate tax liabilities, nor does it interfere with a state's ability to mandate combined reporting. SEC. 4. GROUP RETURNS. When computing a person's tax liability, the net income or economic results of affiliated persons are considered. The portion subject to state tax is calculated using the methodology applicable to similar businesses. If an apportionment formula is used, it should include factors of all persons in the combined results, with only factors of persons subject to state taxation included in the numerator. The State can tax interstate or foreign commerce under this Act, following legal constraints. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS AND EFFECTIVE DATE. Definitions for the Act include \"net income tax\" and \"other business activity tax,\" excluding sales and use taxes. The Act defines terms such as \"person,\" \"State,\" and \"tangible personal property\" for tax purposes. A person is defined as per the United States Code, a State includes states, territories, and political subdivisions, and tangible personal property refers to leasing or owning such property. The Act excludes the leasing or licensing of computer software from the definition of leasing or owning tangible personal property. Effective January 1, 2012, this Act applies to taxable periods."
