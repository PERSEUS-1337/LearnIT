    "content": "The \"National Capital Region Land Conservation Act of 2009\" authorizes a grant program to preserve resources in the National Capital Region. The Secretary of the Interior can make grants to covered States and local governments for acquiring lands in the National Capital region for various purposes like parks, open space, agriculture, historic preservation, and public recreation. The Secretary requires that land acquired through grants must be used for specified purposes. Grant determinations consider local planning objectives, non-Federal funding, relationship to other public lands, area's need for resources, and threats to resources. The grants under subsection (a) should not exceed 50% of the total acquisition cost, including purchase price, appraisal, survey, title clearance, and closing. Acquisitions must comply with applicable state laws, and the title of acquired lands will be held by the state or local government. The Secretary can delegate management responsibilities for acquired lands to nonprofit organizations. The authority to make grants for acquisitions is in addition to other federal funding sources. Planning grants can be provided to states, local governments, and nonprofits for evaluating acquisitions, with a limit of 5% of funds appropriated for the section. In a fiscal year, not more than 2 percent of funds appropriated for this section can be used for administrative costs. No other requirements of this Act apply to activities under this section. Definitions include covered local government, covered state, and National Capital region. The Washington-Arlington-Alexandria Metropolitan Statistical Area is defined by the Office of Management and Budget. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for implementing this section, with an authorization of $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014."
