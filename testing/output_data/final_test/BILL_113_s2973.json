The Secretary will establish the National Laboratory technology maturation program to make grants to National Laboratories for transferring technologies to small businesses, linking innovative processes to practical applications for commercial success. National Laboratories applying for grants must submit an application describing how they will facilitate technology transfer. The National Laboratory technology maturation program will manage and encourage small businesses to participate in technology maturation. Small businesses and technologies will be selected by a selection board, including venture capitalists. The program will measure results, including the number of technologies licensed to small businesses. The National Laboratory technology maturation program aims to support small businesses by providing grants up to $5,000,000 per fiscal year. The program will track the impact on small business creation, job retention, technology sales, salary changes, and external investments attracted. Additionally, National Laboratories can offer vouchers to small businesses as part of the program. National Laboratories provide grants to small businesses for technology development. The grants fund vouchers for assistance from scientists and engineers until products are market-ready. Vouchers can be used for access to equipment and facilities or to partner with the National Laboratory.

The selection board awards vouchers based on project viability, potential for company growth, and access to experienced business support. Small businesses with technology licenses from National Laboratories can apply for vouchers up to $250,000. The selection board considers factors like a strong team, market-driven milestones, commercialization path, profitable market, regional economic impact, matching funds availability, and alignment with the National Laboratory's mission.
