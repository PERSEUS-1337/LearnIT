    "content": "The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) was passed by Congress in 2002 to address improper payments made by federal agencies. IPIA requires agencies to identify programs at risk for improper payments, estimate the amount of improper payments, and report corrective actions to Congress. Improper payments include payments to ineligible recipients, duplicate payments, payments for goods or services not received, and payments without applicable discounts. Data from FY2004 to FY2009 showed that a small number of programs accounted for the majority of improper payments. President Barack Obama signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13520 in November 2009, requiring agencies to identify high-priority programs with the highest improper payments, set annual reduction targets, and publish data on estimates and targets. OMB created PaymentAccuracy.gov to centralize data for high-priority programs as mandated by the executive order. OMB revised OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C to include new requirements for high-priority programs with more than $750 million in improper payments. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of FY2010 amended IPIA to enhance agency risk assessments, improper payment estimation procedures, and corrective action plans. IPERA requires agencies to establish recovery audit programs to recapture overpayments. The inspector general of each agency must determine compliance with IPERA and report findings to relevant authorities. Compliance includes publishing financial statements, conducting risk assessments, setting improper payment reduction targets, and reporting no improper payment rate exceeding 10%. IPERIA, passed in 2012, codifies these requirements. The IPERIA Act, codifying E.O. 13520, requires OMB to identify high-priority federal programs for increased oversight based on high dollar value or error rates of improper payments. It mandates annual targets and regular actions to reduce improper payments, with agencies submitting annual reports on prevention and recovery efforts to their IG and public website. The IPERIA Act requires agencies to submit reports on improper payment estimates and internal controls to their IG and Congress. It also mandates verifying recipient eligibility before issuing payments and awards. Additionally, the act was amended by the FIPCA and the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act to expand access to federal agency data for payment verification and implement controls related to fraud. Under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA), agencies must implement controls to prevent fraud and improper payments. Programs with improper payments exceeding $10 million or 1.5% of total payments are considered at risk. In FY2017, agencies reported $141 billion in improper payments, totaling $1.3 trillion since FY2004. The total amount of annual improper payments reported from FY2004 through FY2017 showed a relatively flat trend from FY2004 to FY2007, followed by a significant increase of 188% through FY2010. There was a slight decline from FY2011 to FY2013, followed by another increase of 36% through FY2016, and a slight decline in FY2017. The increase in improper payments from FY2007 to FY2010 was partially due to the inclusion of new programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare Part C, which reported $25.4 billion in improper payments in FY2008. Additionally, government expenditures for public assistance increased as the economy weakened. Government expenditures for public assistance increased as the economy weakened, leading to a rise in improper payments under various programs. Expenditures surged for programs like Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicaid, and Medicare Part C between FY2007 and FY2010. The Medicare Fee-for-Service program saw a significant increase in both expenditures and error rate during this period. A similar trend of increased improper payments was observed from FY2014 to FY2016, with new programs like those run by the Department of Veterans' Affairs reporting billions in improper payments. Government expenditures for public assistance increased during economic downturns, leading to a rise in improper payments across various programs. Expenditures grew for programs like Medicare Part C and Medicaid, with error rates also increasing. The Department of Veterans' Affairs reported billions in improper payments in FY2016, contributing to the overall total of $4.8 billion. Twenty high-priority programs are targeted for reducing improper payments annually. The data in Table 2 show that 20 high-priority programs issued more than $1.2 trillion in improper payments since FY2004. Four programs - Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Medicare Fee-for-Service, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) - accounted for a large proportion of the government's total improper payments in FY2017. Four high-priority programs, including Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, Medicare Fee-for-Service, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), were responsible for 73% of the government's $141 billion in improper payments. These programs consistently accounted for 85% to 98% of improper payments annually from FY2004 to FY2017, showing a relatively stable trend over the years. Between FY2009 and FY2017, high-priority programs accounted for 94% to 98% of total improper payments, showing a variance of 4 percentage points. The initial years of reporting displayed greater variance due to agencies developing improper payment estimates. If the current trend continues, high-priority programs could make up 90% of reported improper payments. OMB's guidance aimed to focus on programs with the highest improper payment amounts, but results have been mixed. The government-wide error rate for high-priority programs has shown mixed results, with some programs improving while others have seen an increase in error rates. The error rate increased from 4.4% in FY2004 to 5.4% in FY2009, then decreased to 4.5% in FY2017. Programs like Medicare Fee-for-Service, Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare Part C, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the National School Lunch Program have had a significant impact on the government-wide error rate. During FY2004-FY2009, error rates for all five programs increased, except for Medicare Fee-for-Service. From FY2010-FY2017, error rates decreased for all but Medicare Fee-for-Service. Reduction of improper payments relies on improving error rates of high-priority programs. However, nearly half of these programs show no improvement, with some even experiencing increased error rates despite being subject to requirements for over a decade. Despite being subject to improper payments requirements for over a decade, little progress has been made in reducing error rates for high-priority programs. The government still issues over $100 billion a year in improper payments, with the error rate for EITC remaining virtually unchanged at 23.9% since FY2004. Additionally, the error rate for Unemployment Insurance increased from 10.3% to 12.5% during the same time frame. While the government-wide error rate has decreased from its peak of 5.4%, many programs continue to struggle with high error rates."
