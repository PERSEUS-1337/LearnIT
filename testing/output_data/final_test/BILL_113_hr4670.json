    "content": "The \"Secure Delivery for America Act of 2014\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on delivery-point modernization. The \"Secure Delivery for America Act of 2014\" introduces delivery-point modernization, defining terms like delivery point, primary mode of mail delivery, door delivery, and centralized delivery. The \"Secure Delivery for America Act of 2014\" defines terms like curbside delivery and sidewalk delivery as primary modes of mail delivery, emphasizing the policy of providing secure package delivery receptacles to postal patrons efficiently and cost-effectively. The \"Secure Delivery for America Act of 2014\" aims to provide cost-effective mail delivery options, including phasing out door delivery for new addresses and converting existing business addresses to centralized delivery. Residential address conversion is also a priority within a specified timeframe. The Postal Service district offices will identify residential addresses for potential conversion from door delivery to centralized, curbside, or sidewalk delivery. The Postal Service aims to voluntarily convert delivery points to more cost-effective modes of mail delivery, with established procedures for soliciting and responding to conversions. The Postal Service considers input from various stakeholders and factors when determining the conversion of mail delivery modes. This includes maximizing efficiency, ease of use for patrons, and respecting property rights. Weather conditions and physical barriers are also taken into account. The Postal Service considers factors like weather conditions, physical barriers, historic significance of the address, population density, and poverty concentration when determining mail delivery modes. Additionally, a waiver program for physical hardship will be established and maintained. The Postal Service will establish a waiver program for door delivery in cases where centralized or curbside delivery would be the primary mode, but door delivery is necessary to avoid physical hardship or safety risks. Additionally, the Postal Service is required to convert 1,500,000 door delivery points to centralized, curbside, or sidewalk delivery each fiscal year from 2015 to 2024. The Postal Service will convert delivery points to centralized delivery with secure package lockers. Priority will be given to patrons who voluntarily agree to convert their delivery points. Procedures will be established to solicit input from the public. The Postal Service will convert delivery points to centralized delivery with secure package lockers. Procedures will be established to solicit input from the general public, postal patrons, State and local governments, local associations, and property owners. This includes public community meetings before and during the conversion process, as well as when the District Manager makes changes to delivery methods or locations. The cost or savings of the conversion to the Postal Service and average conversion cost will be calculated and made publicly accessible. The Postal Service will convert delivery points to centralized delivery with secure package lockers, maximizing efficiency and respecting property rights. Written notice will be provided 60 days in advance of any change in mail delivery mode. A voucher program will be implemented according to Postal Service regulations. The Postal Service may defray costs for conversion from door delivery to centralized delivery through a voucher program. Legacy door-delivery service may continue for a fee paid by the addressee. The fee for legacy door-delivery service offsets the additional cost to the Postal Service compared to the primary mail delivery mode. The fee calculation method is regulated by the Postmaster General, and patrons must meet qualifications to receive this service. The fee for legacy door-delivery service is applicable if the postal patron received mail at the address when the primary mode of mail delivery was changed, and the patron registered and paid the initial fee within 6 months of the change. Addresses receiving legacy door-delivery service must have continuous service since its start. If they no longer meet the requirements, they will be converted to the primary mode of mail delivery within 60 days. The Postal Service must submit an annual report to Congress and the Inspector General regarding the implementation of mail delivery services for residential and business addresses. The report should include the number of addresses receiving door delivery at the end of each fiscal year. The Postal Service's annual report to Congress and the Inspector General must include details on conversions from door delivery to centralized or curbside delivery, cost savings from these conversions, progress towards meeting delivery requirements, and any other relevant information. The Inspector General of the Postal Service will conduct an annual audit on the conversion requirement, evaluating data accuracy and procedural implementation. Subchapters IV and V do not apply to Postal Service actions under this section. The table of sections for chapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, is amended by adding a new item after section 3691. The Postal Service will collect data on delivery mode costs and potential savings, submitting a report to relevant committees by October 1, 2015."
