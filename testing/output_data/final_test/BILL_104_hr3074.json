    "content": "The United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 is amended to include a new section granting additional proclamation authority. The President can eliminate or modify duties to exempt articles from duty if they are from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone, imported directly from those areas, and meet specific cost and processing criteria. The 35 percent content requirement for products from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israel, or a qualifying industrial zone entering the United States can include up to 15 percent of materials from the US. Nonqualifying operations cannot be considered for duty exemptions. For products to meet the 35 percent content requirement when entering the US from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israel, or a qualifying industrial zone, they can include up to 15 percent of materials from the US. Operations that do not qualify cannot receive duty exemptions. Subsection (a)(3) outlines exceptions for simple combining, packaging, or dilution that does not materially alter the article. Subsection (a)(1) defines a 'new or different article of commerce' as one substantially transformed with a new name, character, or use. The cost or value of materials from specified regions includes manufacturer's actual cost, freight, insurance, and packing. The cost of materials for manufacturers includes expenses for growth, production, and transportation, as well as taxes or duties imposed by specified regions. If materials are provided at no charge or below market value, their cost is determined by adding expenses, profit, and transportation costs. The Customs Service may estimate the value of materials if necessary. Direct costs of processing operations include labor costs and other expenses related to manufacturing in specified regions. Direct costs of processing operations with respect to an article imported into the United States include labor costs, fringe benefits, on-the-job training, engineering costs, tooling depreciation, research and development costs, inspection and testing costs. Items not included as direct costs are those not directly attributable to the article or not related to manufacturing, such as profit. Direct costs of processing operations for imported articles include labor costs, fringe benefits, on-the-job training, engineering costs, tooling depreciation, research and development costs, inspection and testing costs. Indirect costs not included are those related to profit, general business expenses like administrative salaries, insurance, advertising, and salesmen's expenses. Imported articles are considered direct if shipped from specific regions without passing through intermediate countries. When importing articles, if they pass through an intermediate country and the shipping documents do not specify the United States as the final destination, the articles must remain under customs control in the intermediate country and not enter its commerce except for specific purposes. The articles can only be imported directly to the United States if they are a result of the original commercial transactions between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent. An article is eligible for duty exemption if the importer certifies it meets conditions and provides necessary documentation when requested by Customs Service. This includes a description of the article, quantity, marks of packages, and operations performed. The importer must provide a detailed description of the operations and materials used in the production of the article, including direct costs, origin, and value of materials from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, qualifying industrial zones, Israel, or the United States. Additionally, information on foreign materials processed in the specified regions must be included for duty exemption eligibility. The President is authorized to proclaim that articles of Israel may be treated as though they were directly shipped from Israel for the Agreement, even if shipped from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone. The President can include the cost or value of materials produced in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone as part of materials produced in Israel under the Agreement. A qualifying industrial zone is defined as an area in Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt where merchandise can enter without duty or taxes. A qualifying industrial zone is an area where merchandise can enter without duty or taxes, specified by the President. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
