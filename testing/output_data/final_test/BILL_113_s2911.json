    "content": "The \"Super Pollutants Act of 2014\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to super pollutants. Congress finds that short-lived climate pollutants contribute significantly to global warming, despite their small percentage by weight. Reducing these pollutants could prevent millions of premature deaths, crop losses, and slow down sea level rise and warming. The United States, a major consumer of hydrofluorocarbons, could lead in phasing down production to reduce global warming. The Montreal Protocol has been successful in protecting the ozone layer and achieving climate benefits. The Montreal Protocol has led to a 98 percent reduction in ozone-depleting substances since 1987. The US released a strategy in 2014 to reduce methane emissions across the economy. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"high-GWP HFC\" as high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons and \"short-lived climate pollutant\" as black carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT MITIGATION. The President shall establish the Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation within 90 days of this Act. The Task Force will include heads of relevant Federal agencies and will review policy recommendations related to climate change adaptation and methane emissions reduction. The Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation will incorporate relevant proposals and recommendations from various reports, identify Federal programs addressing these pollutants, streamline overlapping programs, and address deficiencies in current programs. The Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation will develop programs to reduce pollutants through assessment, research, monitoring, and technology. Federal agencies must submit emission reduction plans within 180 days, consulting with industry stakeholders. The Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation will develop programs to reduce pollutants through assessment, research, monitoring, and technology. Federal agencies must submit emission reduction plans within 180 days, consulting with industry stakeholders. Additionally, Executive Order 13514 mandates the reduction of hydrofluorocarbons, methane, and related indirect emissions by the Federal Government, with specific plans to purchase cleaner alternatives and transition to safer alternatives over time. REDUCTION OF BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other relevant departments, will develop a comprehensive plan to reduce black carbon emissions from international shipping through a clean freight partnership, limits on black carbon, and efforts to protect access to critical fuel shipments and emergency needs of coastal communities. The plan will aim to create a roadmap in coordination with the Department of Transportation. The Secretary of State will lead efforts to reduce fine-particle emissions in the shipping sector through advanced emissions controls and sulfur content reduction in fuels. Additionally, there will be a focus on reducing black carbon emissions in the Arctic region and encouraging countries to adopt national black carbon reduction goals. The United States will also participate in the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. The Secretary of State will work with the Coalition to develop financing mechanisms for black carbon mitigation activities and request a report on financing options. The Administrator of USAID will prioritize black carbon mitigation projects, focusing on environmental and public health benefits like clean-burning cookstoves. The Secretary of State, EPA, and DOT collaborate to reduce black carbon emissions from diesel trucks, 2-stroke engines, generators, and industrial processes by providing technical assistance to developing nations for sulfur content reduction in diesel fuels, access to particulate filters, low-emission engine designs, clean cooking solutions, and other mitigation activities. The collaboration aims to reduce black carbon emissions by providing technical assistance for sulfur content reduction in diesel fuels, access to particulate filters, low-emission engine designs, clean cooking solutions, and other mitigation activities, including energy efficiency alternatives for generators and industrial processes. SEC. 6. GLOBAL REDUCTIONS IN HIGH-GWP FLUORINATED GASES. The text chunk discusses Congress's recommendation for the Environmental Protection Agency to amend regulations to include hydrofluorocarbons and expand recovery initiatives. It also suggests cooperation with the Secretary of Energy to modify the Energy Star program to recognize energy-efficient refrigerant systems. Congress recommends the EPA to amend regulations to remove high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons from the Significant New Alternatives Policy Program. It also suggests cooperating with the Secretary of Energy to modify the Energy Star program to recognize energy-efficient refrigerant systems. The EPA and Secretary of Energy are urged to evaluate high-GWP HFC alternatives and address regulatory barriers to their use in the US. The Super Pollutants Act of 2014 prohibits the manufacture of uncharged hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 air conditioning condensing equipment for residential use. The EPA must issue regulations to enforce this prohibition within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The EPA is required to conduct a study on the environmental impact of R-134a automotive air conditioning recharge kits within a year of the Act's enactment. The EPA must submit a report to Congress with the results of the study on the environmental impact of R-134a automotive air conditioning recharge kits. SEC. 7. REDUCTION OF METHANE LEAKAGE. The Secretary of State, Energy, EPA, and Commerce will provide technical guidance on emissions containment from various sources to other countries under the Global Shale Gas Initiative. They will also collaborate with the World Bank and EPA on reduction programs. Additionally, a study on gas pipeline infrastructure will be conducted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a study on methods to reduce leaks and venting in natural gas facilities, including examining reforms to incentivize pipeline operators to recover fugitive methane emissions and coordinating with other agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will collaborate with other agencies to develop rigorous standards for pipeline systems and report the results to Congress within a year. Additionally, they will examine methods to reduce leaks in natural gas facilities and incentivize operators to recover fugitive methane emissions. The EPA will establish an inspection program to focus on high leak rate equipment in the production value chain. Financing for gas and oil projects should be contingent on using the best technology to detect and repair methane leaks. The EPA will establish an inspection program to focus on reducing emissions in the production value chain, including minimizing venting and flaring, deploying best technology for reducing air pollution."
