The Secretary, in consultation with international entities and stakeholders, will develop protocols, procedures, and standards for handling hazardous cargo to ensure safe operations. Deadlines require the committee to be initiated within 180 days and the requirements to take effect within 3 years of the Act.

Validation of compliance with ISPFC standards will be required. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, will develop a voluntary program for foreign ports to certify compliance with International Ship and Port Facility Code standards. Third-party entities will validate foreign ports. The international program developed under subsection (a) certifies third-party entities to validate foreign port compliance with International Ship and Port Facility Code standards, including inspection protocols, minimum validation standards, recognition for exceeding standards, performance metrics, and notification processes for non-compliance. The text chunk discusses the requirements for ports or facilities to comply with International Ship and Port Facility Code standards, including provisional validations, monitoring conditions, appeals process for failed validations, and re-inspection cycles. The Secretary must ensure third-party entities can validate ports or facilities according to standards before certification. The program implemented under subsection (a) must adhere to established standards, protocols, procedures, and requirements. Third-party entities conducting validations will be monitored and audited regularly to ensure compliance with international standards. The Secretary can revoke certification if an entity fails to meet the minimum requirements. Security and proprietary information will be protected.

The technology must be capable of re-establishing communications during emergencies, using equipment like Land Mobile Radio Systems, cellular phones, and satellite equipment. The deployment of interoperable communications technology at interagency operational centers involves contracts for rapid equipment delivery, training for personnel, and utilization during live area exercises by the United States Coast Guard. Portions of the technology may be virtual and donated on an in-kind basis. The subsection allows the Secretary to use funds for Internet Protocol-based interoperable solutions, regardless of compliance with the Project 25 standard. SEC. 12. DEFINITIONS.
