    "content": "The Act titled \"Multi-Hazard School Disaster Planning and Response Act of 2013\" expands the permissible uses of funds under the matching grant program for school security to improve information sharing between law enforcement and schools. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include law enforcement and school information sharing activities. This includes establishing or improving electronic data systems for sharing information between law enforcement and schools. The text chunk discusses the establishment of electronic data management systems to share emergency response plan data with first responders, assisting in collecting, updating, and digitizing emergency response plans for local law enforcement and schools, and enabling collaboration between law enforcement and schools to develop comprehensive emergency plans. The specified emergency response plan data includes floor plans, photographs, and contact information for school personnel and vendors, to be shared only with first responders. Enforcement and school information sharing activities funded under this part must only be disseminated to local dispatch centers for first responders electronically. Any emergency response plan data shared through these activities must be reviewed annually and updated as needed. The Director shall give preferential consideration to applications for grants under this part for information sharing purposes, prioritizing jurisdictions that cover a significant number of schools and use a compatible electronic record management system across multiple jurisdictions. Funding for grants under the program is reauthorized from 2014 through 2017, with an additional $10,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year for new authorized uses."
