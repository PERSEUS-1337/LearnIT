    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2011\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers, especially 16-year-olds, have significantly higher crash rates than drivers aged 30-60. Teen drivers, aged 15-20, have a higher crash rate compared to drivers aged 30-60. Teen drivers account for a disproportionate number of fatalities in motor vehicle crashes, with over 20% of all highway fatalities involving teen drivers. Teen drivers have a higher crash rate compared to older drivers. They are involved in crashes with passengers, other vehicles, and pedestrians. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety states that the risk of a crash doubles with 2 teens in the vehicle and quadruples with 4 teens. States with strict nighttime driving restrictions have lower fatal crash rates. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that distractions from cell phones significantly impact driver performance, especially for inexperienced drivers aged 15 to 20. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that over 50% of nighttime motor vehicle crash fatalities involving teenage drivers occur at night, despite only 20% of teenage driving happening during that time. Teenage drivers in rural areas are at higher risk of crashes due to lack of awareness of driving risks. They are more likely to drive with other teenage passengers, drive late at night, exceed speed limits, use cell phones, and not use seat belts. Despite only 23% of the US population living in rural areas, 57% of all traffic accidents occur there. Teen drivers in rural areas face elevated crash risk due to immature brain development, making them more prone to accidents. States like Michigan and North Carolina saw a decrease in crashes involving 16-year-old drivers after implementing graduated driver licensing systems. According to the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State, teen driving deaths decreased by over 40 percent in Illinois after implementing a stronger graduated driver licensing law in 2007. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that many states have adopted some form of a 3-stage graduated driver licensing system, but not all recommended safety features have been enacted to protect teenage and novice drivers. Parents of teens overwhelmingly support strict graduated driver licensing laws, with 2/3 believing young drivers should start learning at 16 or older. More than half think the minimum licensing age should be 17 or older. 90% back restrictions on unsupervised nighttime driving, with over 75% agreeing it should start at 10 pm or earlier. Additionally, 89% support limits on teen passengers. Parents of teens strongly support strict graduated driver licensing laws, with a majority believing young drivers should start learning at 16 or older. Over 75% agree that restrictions on teen passengers are necessary, with more than 75% of parents believing teen drivers should not have more than 1 teen passenger in their vehicle. State graduated driver licensing laws are supported by parents of teens, who believe young drivers should start learning at 16 or older. Restrictions on teen passengers are deemed necessary, with a majority agreeing that teen drivers should not have more than 1 teen passenger in their vehicle. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage licensing process, starting with a learner's permit stage at 16 years old or older, lasting at least 6 months, and prohibiting the use of cellular phones while driving. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing laws starts after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cell phone use, night driving, and driving with non-familial passengers. The intermediate stage of the graduated driver licensing laws includes restrictions on cell phone use, night driving, and having non-familial passengers under 21 years old in the vehicle without a licensed driver over 21 present. Additional requirements may be imposed by the Secretary of Transportation, such as 40 hours of behind-the-wheel training, a driver training course, and other conditions during the learner's permit stage. In the intermediate stage of graduated driver licensing laws, a licensed driver over 21 must accompany the driver at all times. Additionally, any individual convicted of a driving-related offense during this stage will have their unrestricted driver's license delayed. The Secretary of Transportation will establish regulations for implementing rules related to driving offenses, including driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, and speeding. States meeting minimum requirements will be exempt from certain provisions. The Secretary will consider compliance with regulations regardless of State laws allowing drivers under 18 to operate vehicles on family-owned farms. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant states for the first 3 fiscal years after the enactment of the Act. States must submit an application with required information, including certification of compliance by the Governor. The Secretary will review applications to determine compliance with section 3(a) before granting funds. (c) Grants.--Funds appropriated for this section will be distributed to compliant states based on a formula. States can use the grant for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process and training law enforcement personnel. The section authorizes $25,000,000 from the Highway Trust Fund for implementing the State graduated driver licensing law, including publishing educational materials and conducting administrative activities. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. The Secretary will withhold 3% of funds from non-compliant states in the fourth fiscal year and 5% in the fifth fiscal year under section 104(b) of title 23, United States Code. On the first day of each fiscal year after the fifth fiscal year, the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of funds from any State not in compliance with section 3(a) of title 23, United States Code. Any funds withheld before the end of the sixth fiscal year will be subject to this provision. Funds withheld under subsection (a) from any State after the sixth fiscal year may not be distributed to the State. If a State comes into compliance with section 3(a) before the funds withheld remain available, the Secretary of Transportation will apportion the funds to the State. The Secretary of Transportation will distribute withheld funds to a State upon compliance with section 3(a). The distributed funds will be available for expenditure by the State for three fiscal years, after which any unspent amount will revert back to the Treasury of the United States. If a State does not comply with section 3(a), the withheld funds will not be distributed. If any amount withheld under subsection (a) is not distributed to the State under subsection (b), it will revert back to the Treasury of the United States."
