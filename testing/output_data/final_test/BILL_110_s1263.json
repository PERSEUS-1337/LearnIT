The \"Petroleum Consumer Price Gouging Protection Act\" defines terms like affected area, supplier, price gouging, and unconscionably excessive price in the context of energy emergencies. The \"Petroleum Consumer Price Gouging Protection Act\" defines terms related to price gouging during energy emergencies, including criteria for determining unconscionably excessive prices set by suppliers. The Act also clarifies that the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission. During energy emergencies, suppliers are prohibited from selling crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates at excessively high prices. Factors like market supply and demand are considered to determine violations. Additionally, market manipulation is also prohibited. SEC. 4 prohibits market manipulation in the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates at wholesale. SEC. 5 prohibits the use of false information in these transactions. SEC. 5 prohibits reporting false information related to wholesale prices of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates to the Commission. It is unlawful if the person knew or should have known the information was false, it was required by law to be reported, and the person intended to affect data compiled by the Commission. If the President determines a shortage of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates threatens the US citizens' well-being, a Federal energy emergency can be declared for up to 30 days. The declaration specifies the reason for the emergency. In case of a shortage of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates threatening US citizens' well-being, the President can declare a Federal energy emergency for up to 30 days. The declaration must specify the reason and the affected area, which may extend beyond a single State. The President can extend the declaration for additional 30-day periods multiple times. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The Federal Trade Commission enforces this Act, prioritizing actions against companies with over $500,000,000 in annual sales of oil products. Violations are considered unfair or deceptive practices. During an energy emergency declared by the President, the Commission will take necessary actions. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Act by establishing a toll-free hotline for reporting price gouging incidents and distributing informational materials to help residents detect and avoid price gouging. They consult with relevant authorities to investigate suppliers charging excessive prices for oil products during disasters. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Act by investigating suppliers in affected areas for violations and taking appropriate action to remedy them. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the provisions of the Act or impose civil penalties for violations when the attorney general believes residents' interests are threatened by a supplier of crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillates. The State must notify the Commission before initiating the action. Upon receiving notice from the State, the Commission may intervene in the civil action, allowing them to be heard on all matters and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State retains the power to conduct investigations and compel witnesses or evidence for civil actions under the Act. In a civil action under the Act, venue is determined by where the defendant operates, was authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries, and others involved in the violation can be joined regardless of residence. State actions are limited if a federal action is pending. In a civil action under the Act, venue is determined by where the defendant operates, was authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries, and others involved in the violation can be joined regardless of residence. State actions are limited if a federal action is pending. The Commission or a State attorney general may not bring an action under this section during the pendency of a civil or administrative action for violation of this Act. Authorized State officials can still enforce State statutes in State court. SEC. 9. PENALTIES. Civil Penalty: Suppliers violating sections 3, 4, or 5 of the Act may face civil penalties. The penalty is up to $1,000,000 for violations of sections 4 or 5, and up to $500,000 for independent small business marketers of gasoline or up to $5,000,000 for other suppliers for violations of section 3. Penalties are assessed similarly to civil penalties under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The penalty for violating section 3 of the Act is a fine of up to $5,000,000, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate offense, and the seriousness of the violation and efforts to remedy the harm caused are taken into account when assessing penalties. SEC. 10. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. This Act does not limit the Commission's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other law. State laws are not preempted by this Act."
