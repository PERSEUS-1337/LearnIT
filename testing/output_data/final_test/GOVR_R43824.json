    "content": "The United States has an indirect election system for the President and Vice President through the electoral college, established in the U.S. Constitution. The original system proved unworkable, leading to a constitutional crisis in 1800. The Twelfth Amendment was proposed and ratified to address this issue, allowing for separate electoral vote ballots for the President and Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in time for the 1804 election, established provisions for presidential elections. It granted states the power to appoint electors in various ways, including popular election and joint tickets for presidential and vice presidential candidates. The electoral college system, established by the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, involves a general ticket system where electors vote for both presidential and vice presidential candidates. It utilizes a winner-take-all method, differing nomination procedures for elector candidates, and a tradition of electors voting for their pledged candidates. This system has been used in 54 presidential elections, delivering a majority of electoral votes in 53 instances and the presidency to the popular vote winner in 49 cases. The electoral college system, established by the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, has been the subject of criticism and proposals for reform since the early days of the republic. During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, various methods of presidential election were considered, including election by Congress, direct popular vote, and selection by state governors or electors. Ultimately, the matter was referred to a committee for further discussion. During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the committee devised a mode of election for the chief executive to ensure independence from Congress, involve the states in the federal process, give advantage to less populous states in elector allocation, and grant broad authority to state legislatures in choosing electors. The electoral college was established to temper popular enthusiasms and partisan attachments by giving the actual vote to electors, who were expected to be well-informed and educated individuals. However, over time, the electoral college evolved through constitutional amendments, state laws, and political party practices, deviating from the Founders' original vision. The growth of political parties and the spread of voting rights led to the current compound system that governs U.S. presidential elections. The electoral college, established to temper popular enthusiasms and partisan attachments, has evolved over two centuries through constitutional amendments, state laws, and political party practices. The contemporary arrangement involves electors convening in state capitals to vote for the President and Vice President, with each state allocated electors based on its congressional delegations. The electoral college has no ongoing existence beyond its election duties. The electoral college consists of 538 total electors chosen by state legislatures or through popular vote. Electors cannot be Senators, Representatives, or hold certain offices. Elector candidates are nominated by political parties, and the winning presidential candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win. Presidential candidates need 270 electoral votes to win. If no majority, House elects President, Senate elects Vice President. Electoral college operates before, during, and after election day every four years. Election day is set by federal law for Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Voters cast one vote for various officials on November 3, 2020. On election day, voters cast one vote for the presidential and vice presidential candidates they support, ultimately deciding the election through the electoral vote tally in the states. The goal is to win by carrying states with a majority of electoral votes. Political parties focus on closely contested states with large delegations of electoral votes. Winning a majority of battleground or swing states with large electoral vote delegations is crucial in obtaining the necessary electoral vote majority. In most states, the winning party's entire slate of candidates for elector is elected through a winner-take-all system. Maine and Nebraska use a district system where popular votes are counted statewide and by congressional district. The electoral college system allocates electors based on popular votes in each congressional district, allowing for a division of a state's electoral votes. Electors meet in December to cast votes for the President and Vice President, selected by their political party. Results are then sent to Congress and federal authorities for validation. Historically, public opinion has supported reform for direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Gallup polls show a shift in support, with more Republicans favoring the electoral college system after the 2016 election. Historically, public opinion has supported reform for direct popular election of the President and Vice President. Gallup polls show a shift in support, with more Republicans favoring the electoral college system after the 2016 election. The electoral college has been criticized for alleged failings, with defenders pointing to its track record of delivering Presidents and Vice Presidents in the majority of elections since 1804. Critics argue that the electoral college system is undemocratic, dating back to the 18th century and no longer relevant in today's democratic society. They believe it provides indirect election of the President and Vice President, with biases towards certain groups and jurisdictions. Defenders of the electoral college system argue that it is not undemocratic as electors are chosen by voters in free elections. They believe the system aligns with the federal nature of the United States, where states are distinct entities with authority in governance, including presidential elections. The Founders intended for the President to be chosen by both citizens of the U.S. and members of their state communities. Critics of the electoral college system argue that it is undemocratic and point out various structural flaws in the system, including the possibility of electing Presidents and Vice Presidents who have fewer nationwide popular votes than their opponents. These criticisms are attributed to constitutional provisions, state legislation, and political party practices. The electoral college system, also known as \"wrong winner\" or a \"misfire,\" has occurred four times in US history - in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. In the election of 1824, no candidate received a majority of electoral votes, leading to a contingent election in Congress. Proponents of direct election argue that it violates democratic principles, while supporters defend it as a federal election system. Contingent election is the default setting when no candidate receives the necessary majority of electoral votes. The Twelfth Amendment allows for a contingent election if presidential or vice presidential candidates do not receive a majority of electoral votes. Critics argue that this process removes the choice of President and Vice President further from the voters, as each state and Senator cast a single vote without considering the popular vote results. The Twelfth Amendment allows for a contingent election if presidential or vice presidential candidates do not receive a majority of electoral votes. Critics argue that this process removes the choice of President and Vice President further from the voters, as each state and Senator cast a single vote without considering the popular vote results. However, some critics argue that contingent election fails to account for population differences in states and does not include the District of Columbia in the process, potentially disenfranchising the nation's capital. The Twelfth Amendment allows for a contingent election if presidential or vice presidential candidates do not receive a majority of electoral votes. The electoral college system allocates votes based on decennial census results, leading to adjustments in House seats and state electoral vote allocations. For example, Texas gained four House seats and increased its electoral votes from 34 to 38 after the 2010 census, while New York lost two House seats and saw its electoral votes decrease from 31 to 29. These adjustments are reflected in the first presidential election following each census. The allocation of electoral votes for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 elections is based on the 2010 census data, which may not accurately reflect current population shifts. States with population gains will not see an increase in electors until 2024, while those losing seats will be over-represented. The Twelfth Amendment directs presidential electors to vote for President and Vice President in their respective states. The Founders intended electors to be representatives of their state political communities, free agents able to vote for the best fit for the presidency or vice presidency. However, the growth of partisanship transformed electors into loyal party agents, expected to vote for the party's designated candidates. Although most electors have voted as pledged, occasionally one or more have not. Since the 1948 presidential election, 16 \"faithless\" or \"unfaithful\" electors have voted against their pledge, with some states attempting to bind electors through oaths or pledges. In 1952, the Supreme Court ruled that political parties could require electors to pledge support for their nominees, but did not address the constitutionality of binding electors. In the presidential election of 2016, three faithless electors were prevented from voting for candidates other than those to whom they were pledged. Out of 9,675 electoral votes cast since 1948, only 16 were indisputably cast against voters' instructions, comprising less than 0.001654% of the total and not affecting any election outcome. The electoral college arrangement has also faced distortions from state-added procedures over time. The general ticket system for awarding electoral votes is a key issue in the electoral college system, adopted by 48 states and the District of Columbia. Critics argue that this system discounts the votes of citizens who preferred candidates receiving fewer votes, particularly in closely divided states. This structural failing stems from state laws, not the Constitution. The general ticket system for awarding electoral votes is a key issue in the electoral college system, adopted by 48 states and the District of Columbia. Critics argue that this system discounts the votes of citizens who preferred candidates receiving fewer votes, particularly in closely divided states. Maine and Nebraska provide exceptions to this system with the \"district system\" of awarding electoral votes based on congressional districts and statewide results. Critics of the district system argue that it adds complexity and dilutes the impact of the popular vote. Critics of the district system argue that it disadvantages losing candidates and their supporters, while supporters claim it better reflects geographical differences in candidate support. Opponents of the electoral college also criticize the advantage given to less populous states, which they argue is inconsistent with the \"one person, one vote\" principle. The electoral college system gives an advantage to less populous states, with each state having a minimum of three electoral votes. This composition is seen as favoring smaller states as voters in these states cast more electoral votes per voter compared to larger states. For example, in 2016, Wyoming voters cast one electoral vote for every 85,283 voters, while Californians cast one for every 257,847 voters. This distribution of electoral votes is argued to give small states an advantage over large states. Some argue that small states have an advantage in the electoral college system due to their larger proportion of electoral votes compared to their population. Conversely, large states are said to have a voting power advantage as they control the largest blocs of electoral votes, giving them more influence in presidential elections. For example, a voter in Wyoming in 2016 could influence only three electoral votes, while a voter in California could influence 55 electoral votes. The \"voting power\" theory suggests that the electoral college system favors populous states, giving them an advantage in presidential elections. Another theory highlights the influence of minority voters, such as African Americans, Latinos, and Jews, who are concentrated in states with large electoral college delegations. This concentration allows them to sway election outcomes in their favor. The electoral college system is criticized for bias in allocation of Representatives and electoral votes based on residents, not citizens. States with high numbers of noncitizen residents, like California, Texas, and Nevada, are said to benefit from this bias. Critics argue that counting noncitizens for apportionment gives an unfair advantage to states like California, Texas, and Nevada. In 2010, California gained five electors it wouldn't have received if based on citizen population. Texas gained two, while New York, Florida, and Washington gained one each. Conversely, states like Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania each lost one elector due to the noncitizen population advantage. The electoral college system has been criticized for alleged biases, including the advantage given to states with lower voter participation rates. In the 2016 election, Hawaii had the lowest participation rate, with 42.2% of eligible voters casting 107,234 votes per elector, while Minnesota had the highest participation rate, with 74.2% of voters casting 294,481 votes per elector. These biases have been debated over the years. The electoral college system has been criticized for alleged biases, including the advantage given to states with lower voter participation rates. Various biases have been debated over the years, such as the minority vote advantage and the electoral college lock phenomenon. The lock was claimed to provide a long-term election advantage to a particular party, originally Republicans and later Democrats, at least through the 2016 election. The electoral college lock phenomenon favored one party over another by relying on states with a large number of electoral votes consistently voting for the dominant party. California and Texas were examples of reliably Democratic and Republican states, respectively. These one-word descriptors became common in the 21st century to define a state's political record and voting patterns. The electoral college lock theory, originating in the late 1960s, suggests that political and social shifts led to a partisan realignment favoring the Republican Party. Kevin Philips' thesis in \"The Emerging Republican Majority\" predicted this shift, attributing it to growing conservatism in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party's embrace of progressive agendas. Horace Busby is also credited in this analysis. The electoral college lock theory, attributed to Horace Busby, predicted Republican dominance in presidential elections from 1968 onwards. Republican candidates won five out of six elections during this period, solidifying their hold on the electoral college. In the years following the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, observers noted a shift in the electoral college favoring Democratic candidates. Democratic candidates won four of the previous six elections with convincing margins, averaging 327 electoral votes per election. The \"blue wall\" of 18 states with 242 electoral votes consistently voting Democratic was seen as a structural advantage for Democrats and a hurdle for Republicans. This trend was attributed to growing public favor towards Democrats and a demographic shift favoring the party. The demographic pendulum is shifting towards the Democrats, with young voters, Hispanics, and African-Americans contributing to states like Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Virginia joining President Obama's winning coalition. Some caution against viewing the electoral college lock as inevitable, citing various factors like social and economic conditions, international issues, candidate popularity, and public sentiment for change. The 2016 presidential election confirmed cautions about the electoral college lock and the \"blue wall\" being breached. Congress may consider three options for electoral college reform: repealing sections of the Constitution for direct popular election, reforming the electoral college system, or maintaining the current system. The options for electoral college reform include abolishing it for direct popular election, maintaining the current system, or reforming it to address alleged problem areas. Direct election would involve a single nationwide count of popular votes, with candidates winning a plurality or majority being elected. Some proposals suggest a minimum threshold of votes necessary to win election, while others require a majority to elect. Proponents of direct popular election argue for a simple, national, and democratic process where the President and Vice President are chosen directly by the voters, without intermediaries. They believe this would ensure the \"people's choice\" is always elected, making every vote count. Supporters of direct election argue that it would ensure every vote carries equal weight, eliminating advantages or disadvantages for any state or group of voters. They believe direct election would simplify the process and prevent complications that could arise under the current system. Critics of direct election and defenders of the electoral college seek to refute these arguments, but proponents claim their plan is more democratic. Direct election proponents argue for a more democratic process with majority rule, but critics raise concerns about plurality Presidents, political fragmentation, regionalism, and post-election struggles. Critics of direct election argue that it could lead to prolonged post-election disputes, resembling the contentious 2000 election, and undermine public confidence in the presidency and federal government. Reform proposals to retain the electoral college suggest eliminating presidential electors while awarding electoral votes directly to candidates. Reform proposals to retain the electoral college include the automatic plan, district plan, and proportional plan, which would assign electoral votes directly to candidates based on different systems. Supporters of the electoral college argue that it is not undemocratic as electors are chosen by voters in free elections. They view the electoral college as a key component of federalism, emphasizing the states' role in governance and the founders' intention for voters to act as both citizens of the United States and members of their state communities. Proponents of the electoral college argue that it promotes political stability by requiring parties and candidates to campaign nationally to secure a majority of electoral votes. They dismiss concerns about \"faithless electors\" as few votes have gone against instructions and none have impacted election outcomes. Most electoral college reform plans would eliminate this issue. Supporters of direct election and critics of the electoral college argue that the existing system is cumbersome, potentially anti-democratic, and beyond saving. They believe that the electoral college has thwarted the public will on multiple occasions by electing a President who received fewer popular votes. Most reform plans aim to eliminate the office of elector to prevent such occurrences. Critics of the electoral college find the Twelfth Amendment's contingent election provisions undemocratic, pointing to issues like the decennial Census, \"senatorial\" electors, faithless electors, and the general ticket system. They warn that state legislatures could still choose electors by undemocratic means, as seen in Florida in 2000. This challenges the perception of the electoral college as a democratic feature that could be changed arbitrarily for political reasons. The issue of electoral college reform has been a prominent topic for nearly 30 years, with numerous proposals introduced in Congress between the late 1940s and 1979. These proposals aimed to either eliminate the electoral college system and establish direct popular election or reform its controversial provisions. The question of electoral college reform or replacement was actively considered during this time, with proposed amendments being the subject of hearings in the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on 17 different occasions. Between 1940 and 1979, electoral college reform proposals were debated in Congress multiple times, with some proposals approved by the Senate and House but never the same amendment in the same Congress. After the 1979 defeat of a direct popular election amendment in the Senate, the issue of electoral college reform faded from public attention and Congress's agenda. Despite being a familiar topic, no further floor action was taken on electoral college reform measures. In the 96th Congress alone, 26 amendments were introduced to abolish or reform the electoral college system. In the 96th Congress, 26 amendments were introduced to reform the electoral college system. However, interest in electoral college reform waned in subsequent years, with no related constitutional amendments introduced in the 113th Congress. The outcome of the 2016 election, where a President and Vice President were elected with a majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes, reignited interest in replacing the electoral college with direct popular election. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, proposals for direct popular election were introduced. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, proposals for direct popular election of the President and Vice President by plurality vote were introduced through H.J.Res. 19 and H.J.Res. 65. These resolutions aim to replace the electoral college system and grant Congress authority over election-related policies. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, proposals were introduced to replace the electoral college with direct popular election. Recent trends show a shift towards embracing the \"end it\" option, indicating a decline in support for the electoral college system. Recent proposed amendments aim to enhance federal authority in elections by including provisions for direct popular election, residence standards, citizenship definition, national voter registration, U.S. territories' inclusion in the presidential election process, an election day holiday, and ballot access standards. If ratified, these provisions could grant Congress increased authority over national election standards, potentially superseding state and party practices for federal elections. The potential issues of increased federal involvement in presidential elections include concerns about imposing additional responsibilities and costs on state and local governments. This could be seen as unfunded mandates, leading to calls for federal funding to cover the expenses. Additionally, there are concerns about federal intrusion in traditionally state and local election practices. The debate over potential federal involvement in election administration raises questions about costs, efficiency, and implications for federalism. While some argue for a national structure to ensure voting rights and accuracy, others fear federal intrusion in state and local responsibilities. Congress has not taken significant action on electoral college reform recently. In recent years, there has been significant state-level activity on electoral college reform. States have authority over elector selection and vote allocation systems, with some using different methods like the district system. This showcases states as \"laboratories of democracy\" experimenting within certain limits. In recent years, states have been experimenting with different systems of elector selection and electoral vote allocation. Various proposals, such as proportional and congressional district plans, have been put forward in states like California and Colorado, but none have been successfully adopted so far. In recent years, states have been experimenting with different systems of elector selection and electoral vote allocation. Various proposals, such as proportional and congressional district plans, have been put forward in states like California and Colorado, but none have been successfully adopted so far. Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania have all seen bills introduced to change electoral vote allocation systems, but none have been successful to date. In Virginia, a variant of the district system was introduced in 2012 but was \"bypassed indefinitely\" in 2013. Wisconsin legislators considered implementing the district system between 2011 and 2014, but no such proposal was officially introduced. Other states have also been reported to have similar plans. Other states, such as Ohio and Florida, have considered changes to their electoral vote allocation. However, no measures have been introduced in their legislatures yet. In Minnesota and Virginia, bills to switch to district systems were proposed in 2017 but have not progressed. The National Popular Vote initiative is another ongoing effort for electoral college reform. The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative aims to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact. If all 50 states join, presidential electors committed to the national popular vote winner would be appointed, ensuring a unanimous electoral college decision. Originated by legal scholars, NPV relies on the Constitution's grant of power to states to appoint electors. The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an interstate compact where participating states appoint electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner. State election authorities would certify the popular vote in each state, which would be aggregated and certified nationwide. Participating state legislatures would then choose electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner, potentially resulting in a unanimous electoral college vote of 538 electors for the winning candidate. The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an interstate compact where participating states appoint electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner. The compact would take effect if states controlling a majority of the electoral college, 270 or more votes, were to approve the plan. One novel provision would allow the national popular vote winner to fill any vacancies in the electoral college with their chosen electors. States could withdraw from the compact, but with restrictions on timing. Between 2007 and 2014, 10 states and the District of Columbia joined the National Popular Vote (NPV) Compact, which allocates a total of 165 electoral votes. These states include Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, and New York. The National Popular Vote (NPV) Compact has been introduced in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2017, it is \"pending\" in eight states with 88 electoral votes. Some states have proposed to rescind approval of the NPV Interstate Compact, but none have been approved. Conservative and libertarian groups have defended the electoral college system following California's accession to the NPV compact in 2011. The Heritage Foundation hosted a forum expressing concerns over the National Popular Vote campaign. The electoral college system, a product of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, was designed to ensure independence from Congress, involve states in the election process, and mitigate popular influences. The State Government Leadership Foundation launched a campaign to defend the electoral college against the National Popular Vote campaign. The electoral college system was established in 1787 to ensure independence from Congress and involve states in the election process. It has been modified by various amendments and laws, making it more democratic and party-oriented. Despite criticisms, the system remains largely intact with electors still making the final choice for President indirectly. Since its establishment in 1787, the electoral college system has faced numerous reform proposals in Congress, with over 752 amendments introduced. Despite public support and efforts by congressional leadership, none of these proposals met the stringent requirements of a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. Interest in electoral college reform waned in the 21st century, even after the controversial presidential election of 2000. The electoral college reform efforts at the state level and non-governmental initiatives have faced intense controversy and opposition, with none being successful so far. These proposals aim to change procedures for allocating electoral votes but lack widespread support and may face legal challenges if enacted. The National Popular Vote Initiative, despite being adopted by California and New York, has not gained sustained momentum. Congressional interest in reform for direct popular election of the President and Vice President has revived, with two pending measures in the 115th Congress facing challenges under Article V of the Constitution. The founders established strict procedures for amending the Constitution in Article V, requiring super-majority votes in Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. Congress has further influence by choosing the method of ratification. Despite efforts, no electoral college reform amendment has met these requirements since 1804. The Twelfth Amendment was passed in 1804 in response to a constitutional crisis from the 1800 presidential election deadlock. It was debated and ratified within six months, showing a strong consensus for reform. A contemporary electoral college reform amendment may need a similar catalyst to succeed."
