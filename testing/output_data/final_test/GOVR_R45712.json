These programs provide emergency and nonemergency assistance, such as addressing chronic poverty and hunger. The Food for Peace Act of 1954 established current international food assistance programs, primarily providing in-kind aid through the Agriculture appropriations bill. The Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) was established in 2010 to provide cash-based food assistance through the Agriculture appropriations bill. Congress funds EFSP through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account, which also supports nonfood emergency humanitarian assistance. This report gives an overview of international food aid provisions in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Acts. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds U.S. international food aid programs through discretionary and mandatory funding. The Food for Peace Act of 1954 authorizes four international food assistance programs. Congress sets funding levels for these programs in periodic farm bills. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for international food assistance programs, including three Food for Peace (FFP) programs - FFP Title I, FFP Title II, and FFP Title V. FFP Title I offers concessional sales of U.S. commodities to developing countries and private entities. FFP Title II is a donation program distributing U.S. agricultural commodities to foreign recipients. USDA administers FFP Title I, while the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) administers FFP Title II. The Farmer-to-Farmer Program, part of the Food for Peace (FFP) programs, provides technical assistance to farmers in developing countries through short-term placements for U.S. volunteers. It is administered by USAID and receives a portion of the total funds appropriated for FFP programs. Additionally, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program donates U.S. agricultural commodities to school feeding programs and pregnant or nursing mothers in qualifying countries, funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill. The Food for Progress Program donates U.S. agricultural commodities to governments or organizations to be monetized in recipient countries for economic development projects. Congress has authorized both mandatory and discretionary funding for the program. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a reserve of funds or commodities held by the CCC to supplement international emergency food needs. The USDA did not release funds or commodities from BEHT in FY2017 or FY2018, and Congress did not appropriate any BEHT reimbursement funds to the CCC in FY2018 or FY2019. The Trump Administration's budget requests for FY2018 and FY2019 proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole, FFP Title II, and Food for Progress, but Congress did not adopt these proposals. The Trump Administration requested $149,000 for administrative expenses for U.S. international food aid programs in FY2018. They proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole to reprioritize Federal spending, citing weaknesses in performance monitoring and program evaluations identified by the Government Accountability Office in 2011. USDA has since addressed the recommendations from the audit. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating FFP Title II in order to streamline foreign assistance funding and prioritize funding for emergency food needs within the International Disaster Assistance account. This would shift the majority of U.S. international food assistance funding to the IDA account, which also funds EFSP. FFP Title II and EFSP currently account for 87% of total international food assistance outlays, totaling $2.730 billion in FY2016. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating FFP Title II and EFSP to prioritize funding for emergency food needs within the International Disaster Assistance account. The FY2018 SFOPS budget requested $1.511 billion of IDA funds for international food assistance, 45% less than combined FY2016 outlays. In FY2019, the Administration proposed $1.554 billion for emergency food assistance, 43% less than the combined FY2016 outlays. Additionally, Food for Progress was proposed to be eliminated, with $142,000 requested for administrative expenses. Shifting international food aid funding from FFP Title II to IDA could increase cash-based assistance. This change could alter how the U.S. delivers food aid to recipient countries, allowing for more flexibility in aid distribution methods. Both in-kind aid and cash-based assistance options are being considered for providing food assistance. The Obama and George W. Bush Administrations proposed increasing cash-based food assistance in U.S. international aid. Some argue it could improve efficiency, but opponents fear Trump Administration's funding cuts may reduce aid reach. In-kind aid ensures high-quality food, and some worry cash-based assistance could decrease support for aid programs. The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Acts provided funding for U.S. international food aid programs, including FFP Title II and McGovern-Dole. The FY2019 act also funded the Food for Progress program. Funding trends for international food aid programs from FY2013-FY2019 show an increase in funding. In FY2018, Congress allocated $1.716 billion for food aid programs, a 7% increase from the previous year. This funding included $1.6 billion for FFP Title II, which was a decrease from the total funding of $1.9 billion in FY2017 when IDA funds were transferred. In FY2018, Congress allocated $1.716 billion for food aid programs, including $1.6 billion for FFP Title II. Additional funding for FFP Title II was provided in the General Provisions title, effectively increasing the available funding without increasing the base amount in the Foreign Assistance title. The FY2018 act also included $207.6 million for McGovern-Dole, with $10 million directed towards local and regional procurement, a $5 million increase from the previous year. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act provides $1.942 billion in total funding for international food aid programs, a 1% increase from FY2018. Congress did not adopt the Administration's proposals to eliminate certain food aid programs. $1.716 billion is allocated for FFP Title II, with additional funding in the General Provisions title. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act provides $216 million for General Provisions and $210.3 million for McGovern-Dole, with $15 million directed to LRP. Additionally, $142,000 is allocated for FFP Title I and Food for Progress administrative expenses, and $16 million for Food for Progress in the General Provisions title. The funding increase for Food for Progress is a restoration of prior year reductions and does not indicate support for expanding monetization in food aid programs. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act provides funding for international food aid programs, including $35 million for Food for Progress. This program typically relies on mandatory funding from the CCC, rather than discretionary appropriations. The appropriations bill may also include policy provisions dictating how funds should be spent. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act provides funding for international food aid programs, with policy provisions dictating spending. Bill text has the force of law for the fiscal year, but policy-related provisions do not amend the U.S. Code. Congressional intent is expressed in committee reports and explanatory statements accompanying the appropriations act. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations Act funds international food aid programs with policy provisions dictating spending. Congressional intent is expressed in committee reports and explanatory statements accompanying the appropriations act. Selected policy-related provisions from FY2018 and FY2019 House and Senate committee reports are compared in Table 4."
