    "content": "The \"Buy American Improvement Act of 2007\" is the short title of this Act. It outlines requirements for waivers. The Buy American Act is amended to include special rules for contracts, such as a public interest waiver and preference for domestic bidders. The Buy American Act now includes provisions that give preference to companies manufacturing in the United States when submitting offers for contracts, even if their offer is similar to a non-domestic company's offer. This preference also applies if the US-based company is the sole manufacturer of the requested article, material, or supply. The Act's regulations apply regardless of whether the items are intended for use outside the United States. The Buy American Act gives preference to US manufacturers for contracts, even if items are for use outside the US. A cost analysis is required if items are not urgently needed and are to be acquired from a foreign manufacturer. The Buy American Act requires federal agencies to prioritize US manufacturers for contracts, even for items used outside the US. A cost analysis is needed for non-urgent purchases from foreign manufacturers. The agency head must conduct a study before determining that a product is not available domestically. Federal agencies must report acquisitions of items purchased from foreign manufacturers to Senate and House committees annually. The report should detail the dollar value of items manufactured outside the US. Federal agencies are required to annually report acquisitions of items purchased from foreign manufacturers to Senate and House committees. The report must include a list of waivers granted for such items, details on purchases from entities outside the US, and a summary of total procurement funds spent on items made in the US. Federal agencies must report annually on acquisitions from foreign manufacturers to Congress, including waivers granted, purchases from non-US entities, and total procurement funds spent on US-made items. The reports must be made publicly available, with an exception for the intelligence community. The Buy American Act's definition of \"Federal agency\" is also clarified. The Buy American Act defines a \"Federal agency\" as any executive agency or establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the Federal Government. It also specifies that articles, materials, or supplies are considered to be made substantially from US sources if the cost of domestic components exceeds 75% of the total cost. Amendments to the Act include changing references from \"department or independent establishment\" to \"Federal agency.\" The Buy American Act amendments change references from \"department or independent establishment\" to \"Federal agency\" in various sections of the Act. SEC. 3. GAO REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. The Comptroller General of the United States will provide Congress with recommendations on determining whether acquiring US-mined, produced, or manufactured items would involve unreasonable cost or be against the public interest for Buy American Act waivers. Recommendations will include defining unreasonable cost, standards for public interest inconsistency, and consistent application procedures."
