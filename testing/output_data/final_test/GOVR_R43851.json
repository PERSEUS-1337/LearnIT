    "content": "Congressional interest in air quality issues has been focused on preventing the EPA from implementing new emission control requirements under the Clean Air Act amendments. Efforts to restrain EPA regulatory actions have been prominent in the House, but faced obstacles in the Senate until the 114th Congress. EPA's regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and ambient air quality standards have been of particular interest. In the 114th Congress, with Republicans in control of the Senate, environmental bills faced less opposition. Legislation restraining EPA regulations, such as the REINS Act and Energy Consumers Relief Act, aimed to require congressional approval for major rules and limit costly energy-related regulations. Despite these efforts, few environmental bills were enacted due to potential presidential vetoes. Legislation may prohibit EPA from issuing energy-related regulations costing over $1 billion if deemed harmful to the economy by the Secretary of Energy. Congressional focus under the Clean Air Act has been on EPA's efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion. This has sparked bipartisan interest in addressing climate change. EPA has faced concerns from Congress regarding GHG regulations, with some questioning the need for controls and others calling for delay until authorized by Congress. Despite criticism, EPA believes the Clean Air Act mandates action on GHG emissions without additional congressional approval. EPA has implemented GHG standards for power plants and trucks, and conducted evaluations for light-duty vehicles, providing Congress with opportunities to review its actions. EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act requires it to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles if they endanger public health. The agency made an endangerment finding in 2009 and established GHG emission standards for 2012-2016 vehicles in 2010. This action was not controversial initially, as an agreement was reached in 2009 between President Obama, auto manufacturers, California, and other stakeholders on GHG emission standards. EPA believes it has the mandate to act on GHG emissions without additional congressional approval. The EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation, and California agreed to establish \"One National Program\" for GHG emissions and fuel economy standards. The auto industry supported this national agreement to avoid state-by-state standards. A second round of GHG standards for cars and light trucks was set for model years 2017-2025, with a Mid-term Evaluation planned for MY2022-2025 standards by April 2018. The EPA conducted a Mid-term Evaluation (MTE) to determine the appropriateness of the MY2022-2025 standards for light-duty vehicles. Critics saw this as an opportunity to revisit the standards, suggesting revisions such as harmonizing existing standards or eliminating them. In November 2016, the EPA proposed that the standards remain appropriate based on available data, and no changes were needed. The EPA's proposed determination on the MY2022-2025 standards, based on the MTE, has opened a public comment period until December 30, 2016. Critics have raised concerns about the accelerated timeline and plan to work with the new Administration to revisit the decision. The EPA and Department of Transportation have finalized new greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The Phase 2 standards cover model years 2018-2027 for certain trailers and model years 2021-2027 for semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses, and work trucks. These standards are expected to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons and save vehicle owners $170 billion in fuel costs. The EPA has finalized new greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The standards are projected to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons, save vehicle owners $170 billion in fuel costs, and reduce oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles. The total cost of the rule is estimated at $29-$31 billion over the lifetime of model year 2018-2029 trucks. The standards will increase the cost of a long haul tractor-trailer by up to $13,500 in model year 2027, but the buyer would recoup the investment in fuel-efficient technology in less than two years through fuel savings. The fuel consumption of 2027 model tractor-trailers is expected to decline by 34% as a result of the rule. The American Trucking Associations are cautiously optimistic that the rule will achieve its targets. The EPA has finalized new greenhouse gas emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, projected to lower CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons and save vehicle owners $170 billion in fuel costs. The agency also announced plans to propose GHG emission standards for power plants and refineries, with power plants being the largest anthropogenic source of U.S. GHG emissions. The EPA finalized emission standards for power plants in August 2015 but has not taken action regarding refineries, the second-largest industrial source of GHG emissions in the US. The agency faced delays in finalizing the New Source Performance Standards for power plants due to public comments and concerns about setting a single standard for coal and natural gas sources. The President directed the EPA to propose GHG emission standards for existing power plants by June 2014, with promulgation a year later, still relying heavily on CCS technology to achieve the standards for coal-fired plants. The emission standards for new, existing, and modified power plants were finalized on August 3, 2015. The NSPS is less stringent than proposed versions, with a lower requirement for capturing carbon emissions. EPA states that new fossil-fueled capacity will rely on NGCC technology. NGCC units emit half the CO2 of coal-fired plants and can meet the NSPS without capturing carbon emissions. Modified and reconstructed units must meet emission standards equal to their best yearly performance from 2002. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) sets state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled power plants based on improved efficiency, substitution of NGCC generation, and zero-emission power generation. The rule for existing units was stayed by the Supreme Court in February 2016 pending judicial review. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) establishes state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fueled power plants, focusing on increased renewable or nuclear power generation. States have interim and final emission rate goals for different time periods, with options including efficiency programs, tradeable allowances, and collaboration with other states. States heavily reliant on coal-fired power must reduce emissions by a greater percentage. EPA's Clean Power Plan for Existing Power Plants faced Congressional disapproval through joint resolutions under the Congressional Review Act. The President vetoed the resolutions, requiring a House and Senate vote to override the vetoes for them to become law. The President vetoed Congressional resolutions aimed at preventing EPA from implementing GHG emission requirements for existing power plants. The House passed a bill to delay compliance with emission standards, but the Senate did not consider it. Similar legislation was also considered in previous Congresses. The House passed H.R. 3826 to prohibit EPA from implementing GHG emission standards for fossil-fueled power plants until certain conditions were met. The Senate did not take up the bill, along with other similar legislation in previous Congresses. The House passed bills to prevent EPA action on GHG emissions through appropriations riders. These riders would prohibit the use of funds to implement the Clean Power Plan and other emission standards. The House passed bills to prevent EPA action on GHG emissions through appropriations riders, funded EPA through April 2017. Options to overturn EPA's regulatory actions on GHGs faced obstacles due to President Obama's goals. EPA's GHG regulations have been challenged in court. The Supreme Court reviewed EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggering permitting requirements for stationary sources emitting greenhouse gases. The Court ruled that stationary sources cannot be subject to permitting requirements based solely on their potential to emit GHGs. However, sources requiring permits for other emissions could be subject to CO2 permitting. This ruling had minimal impact as most sources subject to CO2 permit requirements were already classified as \"anyway\" sources. The EPA has required CO2 permits for \"anyway\" sources emitting CO2. Stakeholders petitioned for judicial review of the NSPS and CPP rules, with the Supreme Court granting a stay on the CPP. The D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments for the West Virginia v. EPA case on the Clean Power Plan. The NSPS case is scheduled for oral argument in April 2017. Issues related to emissions other than GHGs from electric power plants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury, have been a focus of interest. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) have taken effect, leading to the retirement of older coal-fired power plants. Critics predicted challenges for the electric utility industry, but so far, there has been little impact on electricity prices or grid reliability. Under the Obama Administration, new regulations were developed to address emissions from power plants. CSAPR, established in 2011, implemented a cap-and-trade system for SO2 and NOx emissions. MATS, set in 2012, imposed technology standards for mercury and other hazardous pollutants. Power plants were significant sources of these emissions, with power plants accounting for a large portion of SO2, mercury, and NOx emissions in the U.S. Power plants also contribute to the formation of fine particles in the atmosphere. The CSAPR rule, established in 2011, aims to control emissions of air pollution from power plants, reducing SO2 emissions by 73% and NOx emissions by 54%. Despite initial controversy and challenges in Congress and court, the rule now appears to be largely resolved in EPA's favor. Opponents of CSAPR challenged the rule in court, initially winning in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision in April 2014, allowing EPA to proceed with implementing federal plans for SO2 and NOx emissions. CSAPR's emission caps took effect in 2015, with further phases planned for 2017. EPA's analysis shows that the benefits of CSAPR outweigh the costs by more than 50-1. The Impact Analysis of CSAPR shows benefits exceeding costs by more than 50-1, with the most significant benefit being 13,000 to 34,000 fewer premature deaths annually. The rule addresses emissions in upwind states affecting downwind states' ability to meet EPA's air quality standards. An update in 2016 addressed emissions contributing to nonattainment of the 2008 NAAQS. Ohio and Pennsylvania benefit the most from CSAPR. The CSAPR update rule, effective in May 2017, imposes new requirements on 22 states to limit NOx pollution contributing to nonattainment of the 2008 ambient ozone standard. The annual cost is estimated at $68 million, with benefits up to $880 million annually, preventing up to 60 premature deaths each year. Compliance can be achieved by optimizing existing pollution control technology, activating idle controls, upgrading to low-NOx combustion controls, and shifting generation to lower-emitting plants. The rule offers flexibility to sources in meeting emission requirements through a trading program. The CSAPR update rule, effective in May 2017, imposes new requirements on 22 states to limit NOx pollution contributing to nonattainment of the 2008 ambient ozone standard. Compliance is measured by whether sources hold enough allowances to cover their emissions. NOx emissions from power plants in the eastern United States will be lowered by 20% in 2017, with three-fourths of the reductions occurring in specific states. The update rule addresses a remand of CSAPR by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, withdrawing and setting new ozone-season NOx emission budgets for states. In 2005, EPA established a cap-and-trade system to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The rules were challenged and vacated in 2008. Instead of appealing, EPA agreed to propose MACT standards under the Clean Air Act by 2011. The standards for existing units were promulgated in 2012. EPA also updated the CSAPR rule in 2017 to limit NOx pollution in 22 states, setting new budgets for 8 states and removing 3 from the ozone-season NOx program. The MATS rule, established in 2012, required coal- and oil-fired electric generating units to reduce mercury and acid gas emissions. 56% of units could meet the standards with existing pollution control equipment, while the remaining 44% needed to install new technology at a cost of $9.6 billion annually. The rule aimed to prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually, with estimated benefits between $37 billion and $90 billion. Power plants had until April 2015 to comply, with a possible one-year extension granted to 98% of plants needing more time. The MATS rule, established in 2012, required coal- and oil-fired electric generating units to reduce mercury and acid gas emissions. Power plants are the largest emitters of pollutants, accounting for a significant percentage of mercury, arsenic, and hydrochloric acid emissions. The rule is projected to reduce fine particulate emissions and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually. Some power plants may be retired by 2015 instead of investing in control technologies, but overall coal-fired generation capacity is expected to decline by less than 2%. The MATS rule, established in 2012, required coal- and oil-fired electric generating units to reduce mercury and acid gas emissions. Power plants are the largest emitters of pollutants, accounting for a significant percentage of mercury, arsenic, and hydrochloric acid emissions. The rule is projected to reduce fine particulate emissions and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually. Some power plants may be retired by 2015 instead of investing in control technologies, but overall coal-fired generation capacity is expected to decline by less than 2%. The cost of natural gas and other regulations may also impact plant retirement decisions. More than 2% of coal-fired generation is being retired, and challenges to the MATS rule have been seen in Congress and the courts. Bills in the 112th Congress aimed to declare the MATS rule \"of no force and effect,\" require the least burdensome regulatory alternative, and delay compliance with any replacement rule. The Senate rejected S.J.Res. 37, a resolution to disapprove the MATS rule, on June 20, 2012. The regulations were challenged in court, focusing on EPA's justification for mercury controls. EPA identified various benefits from controlling emissions but lacked methods to quantify most of them. Monetized benefits mainly came from reduced PM 2.5 emissions. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that EPA's interpretation of the \"appropriate and necessary\" language in regulating power plants was unreasonable as it did not consider costs. The Court found the ratio of benefits to costs troubling and remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. EPA later finalized a supplemental finding in April 2016 after public comment. In April 2016, EPA finalized a supplemental finding after public comment on the MATS rule, considering metrics like revenues, capital expenditures, and retail electricity rates. The rule remains in effect while the circuit court reviews EPA's response to the Supreme Court decision. For more information on CSAPR and MATS rules, refer to CRS Report R42895 and CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG1318. The EPA periodically reviews air quality standards to protect public health and welfare. These standards guide monitoring, planning, and emission controls in nonattainment areas. Despite a 70% decrease in emissions since 1970, achieving clean air remains a challenge in some areas. The EPA periodically reviews air quality standards to protect public health and welfare, tightening standards for pollutants like ozone and fine particles. Studies show a link between air pollution and premature deaths, with emissions causing 210,000 deaths in the US in 2005. EPA conducts Integrated Science Assessments and Risk Analyses to inform NAAQS reviews. The EPA periodically reviews air quality standards to protect public health, identifying areas where pollution exceeds NAAQS. As of September 2016, millions lived in nonattainment areas for ozone and fine particles. Violations of ambient air quality standards for other pollutants are less widespread, but health effects are serious. EPA concluded in 2010 that strengthening the sulfur dioxide standard could prevent thousands of premature deaths annually. The EPA has identified 1.9 million people living in areas that do not meet the revised SO2 NAAQS. Additionally, nearly 10 million people are in areas with unhealthy levels of atmospheric lead. Reviews of air quality standards for various pollutants have been conducted since 2006, with most standards becoming more stringent. EPA's efforts include reviewing NAAQS and implementing revisions for six criteria pollutants. The EPA reviewed and retained the CO standard in 1971 and the lead NAAQS standard in 2016. Controversy arose in 2010 over the ozone NAAQS, leading to a proposed revision in January 2010. The EPA Administrator decided to reconsider the standards set in 2008, resulting in a more stringent standard being proposed. However, in September 2011, the White House requested a review of the final rule before implementation. The White House requested the EPA Administrator to withdraw the more stringent ozone standards in 2011. The President stated that a review of the science was underway for reconsideration in 2013. EPA missed the deadline for the review in March 2013, leading to a court order for proposed revisions by December 2014. The EPA released more stringent ozone standards on October 1, 2015, lowering both primary and secondary standards from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. Most areas are expected to reach compliance due to existing regulations. EPA identified 213 counties in 32 states showing nonattainment with the new standard in 2012-2014. EPA's analysis shows most counties will reach compliance with a 70 ppb ozone standard by 2025 due to existing regulations. Estimated cost of meeting the standard is $1.4 billion annually, except for California which is estimated at $0.8 billion in 2038. These costs are lower than earlier estimates, including one from the National Association of Manufacturers. The EPA's analysis indicates that most counties will comply with a 70 ppb ozone standard by 2025, with estimated annual costs of $1.4 billion, except for California at $0.8 billion in 2038. There is controversy over the methods used to estimate the benefits of the new standards, with the agency preparing cost and benefit estimates for compliance with Executive Order 12866. The Clean Air Act prohibits weighing costs against benefits in setting the standards. The Clean Air Act's Section 109 prohibits the EPA from considering costs when setting National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This interpretation was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2001. The court ruled that cost considerations are barred from the NAAQS-setting process. Cost considerations are not allowed in the NAAQS-setting process according to Section 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. However, cost-effectiveness is considered when selecting emission control options. Congress has shown interest in the recent ozone review, with multiple bills introduced to modify EPA's authority or delay the proposed strengthening of the ozone NAAQS. In the 114th Congress, bills and resolutions were introduced to modify EPA's authority and delay the proposed strengthening of the ozone NAAQS, but none were enacted. Critics accused the agency of overreaching its authority and underestimating the economic impacts of regulations. Numerous bills aimed to overturn specific regulations or limit the agency's authority, some passing the House in previous Congresses. In the 114th Congress, the House passed bills overturning or delaying specific EPA air regulations, including the BRICK Act and the SENSE Act. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriation bill for FY2017 contained riders prohibiting EPA from using funds to implement Clean Air Act authorities. EPA has faced criticism from industry groups and Congress for its actions. The EPA has faced criticism from industry groups and Congress for its actions in implementing Clean Air Act regulations. Despite industry criticism, the agency maintains that it has complied with statutory mandates and that the benefits of new regulations outweigh the costs. Environmental and public health groups often argue that the standards set by the EPA are not stringent enough and do not meet statutory requirements. As a result, EPA Clean Air Act standards are frequently challenged in court by both industry and environmental groups, with various states taking sides. The courts play a significant role in shaping EPA's agenda, often influenced by decisions regarding Clean Air Act regulations. Congress may respond to court rulings with new legislation."
