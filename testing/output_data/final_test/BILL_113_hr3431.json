SEC. 3. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not give expanded discretionary authority to the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security. It is designed to address hardships faced by American families affected by inadmissibility and deportation provisions. Aliens who entered as children and have earned a baccalaureate or higher degree from a US institution of higher education are exempt from certain provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliens who entered the United States as children and have reached the age of 16 are subject to amendments in the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding unlawful presence, previous immigration violations, and false claims. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to address misrepresentation by aliens seeking visas or admission into the United States. Aliens who misrepresent themselves as U.S. citizens for any purpose are inadmissible under Federal or State law. However, there is a special rule where aliens under 18 years of age or lacking mental competence at the time of misrepresentation may not be considered inadmissible. Aliens who misrepresent themselves as U.S. citizens may be considered inadmissible under Federal or State law, but there are exceptions for individuals under 18 years of age or lacking mental competence at the time of misrepresentation. The Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive inadmissibility for an alien if it would result in hardship to the alien or their parent or spouse. In cases of misrepresentation as a U.S. citizen, exceptions exist for individuals under 18 or lacking mental competence. The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may waive inadmissibility if it causes hardship to the alien, their parent, spouse, or family members who are U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for waivers of inadmissibility in cases of misrepresentation as a U.S. citizen, with family separation deemed a hardship. Courts cannot review decisions regarding these waivers. Additionally, falsely claiming citizenship makes an alien deportable. The Immigration and Nationality Act defines a \"conviction\" as a final judgment of guilt entered by a court, excluding certain withheld, deferred, or expunged judgments. pardons from State or Federal entities are also considered. The amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act state that any pardon from a State or Federal authority will nullify a prior conviction for all purposes under the Act. It also clarifies that a reference to a term of imprisonment or sentence only includes the actual period of incarceration ordered by a court, excluding any suspension of the sentence. These amendments will apply to convictions and sentences entered before, on, or after the date of enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY REGARDING REMOVAL, DEPORTATION, INELIGIBILITY, OR INADMISSIBILITY OF CITIZEN AND RESIDENT IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS. The amendment allows immigration judges to use discretion in cases of removal, deportation, ineligibility, or inadmissibility, to prevent hardship to the alien or if removal is against the public interest. The amendment allows immigration judges to use discretion in cases of removal, deportation, ineligibility, or inadmissibility, to prevent hardship to the alien or if removal is against the public interest. This discretion applies to aliens with United States citizen or lawful permanent resident family members, except those deemed inadmissible or deportable under specific sections of the law. The amendment grants immigration judges discretion to prevent hardship or if removal is against the public interest. Family separation is considered a hardship and against the public interest. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive ineligibility, inadmissibility, or deportability for aliens if it is against the public interest or causes hardship, including family separation. Family separation is considered a hardship and against the public interest, except for aliens who are inadmissible or deportable under specific circumstances or have engaged in certain conduct. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow for the reinstatement of removal orders, with exceptions for aliens reentering before the age of 18 or if reinstatement would cause hardship or family separation to a US citizen or permanent resident family member."
