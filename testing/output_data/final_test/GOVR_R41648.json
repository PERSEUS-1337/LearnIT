    "content": "Social Security is a self-financed program funded by payroll taxes from covered workers and their employers. It provides benefits to retired, disabled, and deceased workers' family members. The program also receives tax revenues from beneficiaries and interest income from trust fund investments. Social Security is managed through two trust funds: the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund and the Federal Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund. In March 2010, Congress approved a temporary payroll tax exemption for employers under the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act. Employers were exempt from the 6.2% payroll tax if they hired individuals unemployed for more than 40 hours in the preceding 60 days. The exemption expired on December 31, 2010, with general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds to offset the loss of payroll tax revenues. In December 2010, a temporary 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax rate for employees and the self-employed was approved for 2011. The Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 did not affect the employer's share of the payroll tax. General revenue transfers were provided to the Social Security trust funds to offset the loss of payroll tax revenues. In late 2011, there were several bills considered to extend and expand the payroll tax reduction in 2012, but they failed in the Senate on procedural votes. In late 2011, bills were considered to extend the payroll tax reduction for workers in 2012. H.R. 3630 was passed by the House and Senate, extending the reduction for two months. The House then disagreed with the Senate-passed version and requested a conference to resolve differences. House Republicans introduced H.R. 3765 to extend the payroll tax reduction for workers for two months, which was passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law by President Obama. Subsequently, H.R. 4013 was introduced to extend the tax reduction through 2012. A conference report on H.R. 3630 was agreed upon, extending the payroll tax reduction through 2012, and was signed into law by President Obama on February 22, 2012. The Social Security payroll tax for workers was reduced to 4.2% through December 2012 under P.L. 112-96. The program is primarily funded by FICA and SECA taxes, with employers remitting the taxes to the U.S. Treasury regularly. The FICA tax rate is 7.65% for employers and employees, with 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare. SECA tax rate is 15.3% for self-employed individuals, with 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare. SECA taxes are paid annually as part of filing an individual income tax return. The Social Security program receives income from payroll taxes, taxable Social Security benefits, and interest from investments in U.S. Treasury securities. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to invest Social Security revenues in federal government securities. The trust fund balance consists of federal government securities. The Social Security trust funds hold federal government securities, representing money owed to them by the U.S. Treasury. Funds for benefits come from selling these securities. The trustees project annual deficits from 2012 to 2086, but with interest income, there will be a surplus from 2012 to 2020. The Social Security trust funds are projected to increase until 2020, but reserves will start to be drawn down in 2021 to cover costs. Over the next 75 years, program costs are expected to exceed income by 2.67% of taxable payroll on average. Trust fund assets are projected to be exhausted by 2033, after which only 75% of benefits can be paid under current law. The Social Security payroll tax rate is 6.2% for employers and employees, and 12.4% for the self-employed. In 2011, a temporary 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax rate was implemented. This reduced the rate to 4.2% for employees and 10.4% for the self-employed. The reduction did not affect the rate for employers or the amount of income subject to the tax. The temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax in 2011 aimed to boost the economy by increasing workers' take-home pay. The reduction lowered annual withholdings for workers, with those earning the average wage saving about $894 and those earning the maximum taxable wage saving $2,136. To offset the loss in payroll tax revenues, funds were appropriated to the Social Security trust funds from the general fund. In August 2011, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds due to the temporary payroll tax reduction in 2011 would total $111 billion. Senator Harry Reid announced legislation to extend and expand the payroll tax reduction in 2012, providing a 3.1 percentage point reduction for workers and employers. The proposed legislation, S. 1917, includes a 3.1 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax for employers on the first $5 million of taxable payroll for 2012. It would also eliminate the Social Security payroll tax for employers on increased wages up to $50 million for 2012. The bill would cost $265 billion and impose a 3.25% surtax on high-income earners to offset the cost. On December 1, 2011, S. 1917 failed in the Senate on a 51-49 procedural vote. Senator Dean Heller introduced S. 1931 to extend the temporary 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for workers in 2012. S. 1931 would not provide a payroll tax reduction for employers but would offset the cost by extending the federal employee pay freeze and reducing the federal workforce. The failed Senate bill S. 1931 aimed to eliminate unemployment compensation and SNAP benefits based on income, as well as increase Medicare premiums for certain individuals. Senator Robert Casey introduced a revised proposal, S. 1944, to extend and increase the Social Security payroll tax reduction for workers in 2012, including a 3.1 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax. S. 1944 aimed to extend and increase the Social Security payroll tax reduction for workers in 2012, reducing the worker's share from 6.2% to 3.1%. The bill would offset the loss of payroll tax revenues with general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds. To cover the costs, a temporary 1.9% surtax on high-income earners and increased fees for mortgage lenders were proposed. Additionally, the bill would restrict unemployment compensation and SNAP benefits based on income. On December 8, 2011, S. 1944 failed in the Senate on a procedural vote. The next day, H.R. 3630 was introduced by Representative Dave Camp, aiming to extend the Social Security payroll tax reduction for workers for one year. The bill would not reduce payroll tax for employers but would provide general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds. It would offset costs by extending the federal pay freeze and making changes to civilian federal pension benefits. Additionally, the bill would eliminate unemployment compensation for certain individuals based on income. H.R. 3630, passed by the House and Senate in December 2011, aimed to extend the payroll tax reduction for workers for two months. The bill also included provisions to make certain individuals ineligible for SNAP benefits based on income and require higher Medicare premiums for some individuals. On December 23, 2011, H.R. 3765, the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, was passed by the House and Senate, extending the 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for workers for two months. President Obama signed it into law (P.L. 112-78). On February 13, 2012, Representative Wally Herger introduced H.R. 4013, the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2012, to extend the 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for workers through the end of calendar year 2012. The measure includes general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds to compensate for the loss of payroll tax revenues. H.R. 4013 was passed by the House and Senate, with President Obama signing it into law. P.L. 112-96, signed into law on February 22, 2012, extends the 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for workers through the end of 2012. The tax rate is 4.2% instead of 6.2%, with general revenue transfers to the Social Security trust funds to offset the revenue loss. The law also increases the employee pension contribution for federal employees entering service after December 31, 2012. For more information, refer to the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The temporary reduction in the payroll tax for employees and the self-employed, extended through P.L. 112-96, has drawn mixed reactions from policymakers. Concerns have been raised about the impact on Social Security's long-term finances despite general revenue transfers to protect the trust funds. Observers worry that Congress could continue to extend the payroll tax reduction, posing a risk to Social Security's financial stability. The possibility of extending or making the payroll tax reduction permanent in response to political pressures without general revenue transfers raises concerns about the future funding and financial stability of Social Security. Critics argue that relying on general revenues could jeopardize the program's self-financing mechanism established since its inception in the 1930s. Some argue that using general revenues to fund Social Security benefits weakens the link between payroll tax contributions and benefits, affecting public support. They suggest alternatives like extending the Making Work Pay tax credit for economic stimulus. The Making Work Pay tax credit provided workers with a federal income tax credit of 6.2% of wages, up to a maximum credit of $400 ($800 for married couples filing jointly), in tax years 2009 and 2010. The credit was phased out for workers with incomes above $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples). It was favored over a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax as it was available to all workers, not just those covered by Social Security, and was more beneficial for workers earning less than $20,000. The MWP tax credit is considered more effective for lower-wage workers compared to the payroll tax reduction. Some observers recommend a \"hold harmless\" provision to ensure lower-wage workers are not worse off. The temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax is seen as a stimulus for economic recovery and job creation during high unemployment rates in the United States. The temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes is proposed as a stimulus for economic recovery and job creation during high unemployment rates in the United States. This policy option has been supported by deficit reduction commissions and is seen as an effective way to stimulate economic growth while maintaining fiscal discipline. CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf stated that reducing payroll taxes, especially for employers, would have a significant positive short-term effect on the economy by boosting output and employment. The Bipartisan Policy Center's deficit reduction commission recommended a one-year suspension of Social Security payroll taxes. Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Alice Rivlin proposed a one-year suspension of the Social Security payroll tax for employers and employees in 2011. The commission estimated the cost at $650 billion and projected the creation of 2.5 to 7 million new jobs. In contrast, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended a temporary suspension of one side of the Social Security payroll tax, funded by general revenue transfers, with an estimated cost of $50 to $100 billion in lost revenues. The CBO found that this proposal would lead to significant short-term economic growth and job creation."
