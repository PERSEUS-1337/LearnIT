The \"Secure E-Waste Export and Recycling Act\" defines electronic waste as used items containing electronic components, including computers, data center equipment, mobile computers, televisions, and video display devices. Electronic waste includes video display devices like monitors, digital picture frames, and portable video devices, as well as digital imaging devices such as printers, copiers, and scanners. Consumer electronics like digital cameras, cell phones, audio equipment, and video game systems are also part of electronic waste. Electronic waste includes various electronic items like signal converter boxes, cable and satellite receivers, portable GPS navigation devices, and other electronic items deemed necessary by the Secretary. Exempt items from electronic waste classification include exempted electronic waste items and electronic parts of a motor vehicle. Exempted electronic waste items encompass specific electronic devices as defined by the regulations. The definition of \"waste items\" includes tested, working used electronics, low-risk counterfeit electronics, and recalled electronics. Tested, working used electronics are used items that have been determined to be fully functional for their intended purpose. The term \"low-risk counterfeit electronics\" refers to electronic components that have undergone destruction processes to prevent reuse. The term \"recalled electronics\" refers to electronic items that are unusable for their original purpose and are exported as a feedstock for reclamation processes in foreign countries. The items subject to a recall notice by the Consumer Product Safety Commission or other Federal authority must be repaired by the manufacturer to cure the defect, or recalled by the manufacturer as a condition of the warranty validity. The term \"feedstock\" refers to raw materials used as the main input for an industrial process. A \"counterfeit good\" is any product with a counterfeit mark, while a \"counterfeit military good\" is falsely labeled as meeting certain standards. The term \"counterfeit mark\" is defined in section 2320 of title 18, United States Code. The \"Export Administration Regulations\" refer to regulations in title 15, Code of Federal Regulations. \"Export\" and \"reexport\" have specific meanings under the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Emergency Economic Powers Act prohibits the export of electronic waste unless exempted items are registered with the Secretary of Commerce and export information is filed in the Automated Export System. The Administration Regulations require Electronic Export Information to include a description of the exported electronic waste items, the receiving countries, and the consignee's details for proper management and prevention of misuse. The export of exempted electronic waste items must comply with international agreements and trade laws. Export declarations must include documentation of exporter registration, a signed declaration of compliance, and a description of the items.

Exceptions may be provided by the Secretary.

Recordkeeping requirements may apply, and the components must be intended for the same purpose as in the US. This section will take effect after a 1-year period. The Export Administration Regulations will be modified within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. Violations of this section will result in penalties as per the Export Administration Regulations."
