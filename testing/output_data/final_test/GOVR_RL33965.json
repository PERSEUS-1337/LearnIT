    "content": "The Supreme Court has recognized the constitutionality of using race-based policies to promote diversity in higher education. Recently, the Court considered whether diversity is a permissible goal in elementary and secondary education, agreeing to review cases involving the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools. In Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Supreme Court struck down school plans for violating the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. The cases involved challenges to school assignment and transfer plans in Louisville and Seattle. The Court's decision has implications for future efforts to promote racial diversity in education. In Kentucky, a federal court upheld a Louisville district's voluntary use of race in student assignments for racial integration. Jefferson County Public Schools were ordered to desegregate in 1975, with schools having 15-50% African-American enrollment. In 2000, federal courts ended supervision, but JCPS maintained integration through a \"managed choice\" plan, including race consideration. A lawsuit challenged the plan in 2000, as black parents' children were denied admission to Central High School due to minority enrollment limits. The district court upheld the school plan for racial integration in Louisville, finding it served compelling state interests similar to those upheld by the Supreme Court. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the decree without a detailed opinion. In Seattle, the Ninth Circuit approved a plan to maintain racially diverse schools through a \"controlled choice\" high school student assignment plan. The Seattle school district used a racial tie-breaker for high school admissions to achieve diversity and limit racial isolation. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the district had a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity and avoiding racially isolated schools. The court found the plan to be narrowly tailored and constitutional. The Supreme Court reversed an appellate panel's decision on maintaining racially diverse schools, ruling that school plans violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. This decision impacted cases involving public school districts' efforts to promote racial diversity. The Supreme Court has addressed racial diversity in higher education through cases like Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, Grutter v. Bollinger, and Gratz v. Bollinger. The Bakke ruling in 1978 initiated the debate on affirmative action, emphasizing the importance of diversity for promoting the exchange of ideas in educational settings. In the Bakke case, Justice Powell found the admissions quota unconstitutional but acknowledged that considering race for educational diversity could be justified in certain situations. Justice Powell believed that a diverse student body, defined by a broad array of factors including race, fostered academic freedom and the exchange of ideas. He considered race as a \"plus\" factor along with other qualities, but not the sole or determinative factor in admissions. The \"dual admission program\" in question was ruled unconstitutional by Justice Powell. Justice Powell ruled the \"dual admission program\" unconstitutional, stating that a diverse student body could be a compelling state interest. Colleges and universities relied on Powell's opinion in Bakke to support race-conscious student diversity policies, despite some disagreement among federal appeals courts. The Supreme Court ruled on the University of Michigan's race-based admissions policies in 2002-03. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Court upheld the law school's diversity-based admissions, while in Gratz v. Bollinger, they found the undergraduate admissions program unconstitutional for awarding \"racial bonus points\" to minority applicants. The University of Michigan's admissions policies included a selection index based on LSAT scores and GPA, but also aimed for racial and ethnic diversity by enrolling a critical mass of minority students. Admission officers considered soft variables like talents and experiences, tracking minority admission rates to ensure diversity in the class. The 1992 policy at the University of Michigan aimed to track the racial composition of the developing class, replacing an earlier special admissions program with lower academic requirements for minorities. The Grutter majority opinion echoed the Powell rationale from Bakke, emphasizing the situational nature of constitutional interpretation in reviewing race-conscious admissions policies. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of context in reviewing race-based governmental actions for equal protection purposes. Deference was given to educational decisionmakers in defining the scope of their academic mission, particularly regarding matters of racial diversity. The Court recognized universities' unique role in promoting diversity and presumed institutional good faith in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The dissenters disagreed with the idea that racial discrimination can be justified in certain contexts and criticized any deference to the Law School's racial experimentation. The Court found the Law School's pursuit of a racially diverse student body compelling and approved of the concept of \"critical mass\" to achieve educational benefits through diversity. The Court approved of the Law School's admissions program as a narrowly tailored plan that considers race as a \"plus\" factor in individualized consideration, distinguishing it from forbidden quotas. This approach allows universities to pursue diversity without insulating certain racial groups or setting quotas. The Law School's admissions program aims for diversity through individualized consideration of race as a \"plus\" factor, avoiding quotas. Minority enrollment varied from 13.5 to 20.1 percent between 1993 and 2000, showing no fixed quotas. The notion of a \"critical mass\" was criticized as a sham for racial balancing. The admissions process was deemed narrowly tailored by considering all elements of diversity without racial bonuses. The Court found that the Law School's admissions program considered elements of diversity, both racial and nonracial, through individualized review of each applicant's file. Race-neutral alternatives were deemed sufficiently considered, with no requirement to exhaust every possible alternative. The program did not unduly burden non-minority applicants by not resorting to a lottery or lowering academic benchmarks for all applicants. The Court upheld the University of Michigan's admissions program, emphasizing the need for reasonable durational provisions and periodic reviews. The program awarded points based on academic and non-academic factors, with a maximum of 20 points for underrepresented minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, or athletics. In the admissions program at the University of Michigan, applicants were awarded points based on various factors such as legacy relationships, personal essay, community service, and residency. These factors played a significant role in the selection process for middle-range applicants. The Admissions Review Committee could flag applications for further review, considering factors like race that were not adequately reflected in the selection index score. The racial bonus system for undergraduate admissions was struck down in Gratz, contrasting with the upheld Law School policy. The University of Michigan's automatic award of 20 admission points to minority applicants was deemed unconstitutional as it failed the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny analysis. The policy denied individualized consideration and made race decisive for most underrepresented minority applicants, with additional review only happening after the bulk of admission decisions were made based on the point system. The Court rejected the university's argument of administrative convenience. The court rejected the university's argument of \"administrative convenience\" regarding the volume of freshman applications, stating that implementing a program for individualized consideration is necessary despite administrative challenges. The constitutional holding in Gratz applies to private colleges and universities under federal civil rights laws. The Supreme Court recently considered the constitutionality of using race for diversity in elementary and secondary education. The Supreme Court recently reviewed the voluntary use of race for diversity in elementary and secondary education. Federal appeals courts upheld racial diversity measures in public schools, conflicting with previous rulings. The Court agreed to review school diversity plans in Meredith and Parents Involved in Community Schools for potential violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court's equal protection jurisprudence states that legislation is presumed valid if the classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Laws based on suspect classifications like race require heightened scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is applied to laws based on race, which must further a compelling governmental interest and be narrowly tailored. The Court found that the Louisville and Seattle school plans violated the equal protection clause. The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Roberts, ruled that the Louisville and Seattle school plans were unconstitutional as they did not serve a compelling governmental interest. Justice Kennedy concurred but disagreed on the reasoning, while Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion and Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented. The decision was fractured with five different opinions. Chief Justice Roberts affirmed the Court's jurisdiction and addressed the substantive merits of the case, emphasizing that strict scrutiny must be applied to governmental racial classifications. He evaluated whether the school districts' plans were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest, finding that neither remedying past discrimination nor promoting diversity in education were advanced by the plans. The Chief Justice found that the school plans did not advance interests in remedying past discrimination or promoting diversity in education. Seattle schools were not intentionally segregated, and Louisville schools had successfully remediated past discrimination. The Court argued that the Grutter precedent on diversity in higher education did not apply, as it focused on individual factors beyond just race. The Supreme Court found that the school districts' plans for diversity in student assignments did not meet the strict scrutiny test. The plans were criticized for not considering a broader range of qualifications and for lacking individualized review of applicants. The Court also noted that the plans' limited view of diversity based on race did not justify the use of racial classifications in elementary and secondary education. The decision rejected the precedent set by Grutter in higher education, as the unique considerations of higher education were not present in this context. The Supreme Court found that the school districts' plans for diversity in student assignments did not meet the strict scrutiny test. Chief Justice Roberts highlighted that the minimal impact of racial classifications on school enrollment raised doubts about their necessity, especially when other race-neutral alternatives were not adequately considered. The Court emphasized the lack of narrow tailoring in the plans to meet their goals, ultimately leading to their failure in meeting the second prong of the test. Chief Justice Roberts faulted the school plans for tying diversity goals to specific racial demographics rather than educational benefits, deeming it unconstitutional racial balancing. Chief Justice Roberts criticized the school plans for focusing on racial demographics instead of educational benefits, deeming it unconstitutional racial balancing. He argued that racial proportionality goes against the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. Chief Justice Roberts criticized race-conscious school integration efforts for focusing on racial demographics instead of educational benefits, deeming it unconstitutional racial balancing. He argued that the cases cited as precedents were inapplicable to the current case, as the school districts were not segregated due to state action. The plurality opinion referenced Brown v. Board of Education, stating that deliberate segregation by race was unconstitutional. Before Brown, schoolchildren were segregated based on skin color. Justice Kennedy disagreed with the plurality opinion on diversity in education, stating that discrimination based on race should be stopped to achieve true equality. Justice Kennedy disagreed with the plurality opinion on diversity in education, stating that discrimination based on race should be stopped to achieve true equality. He criticized the plurality opinion for implying that race cannot be a factor in school administration, emphasizing that it is permissible to consider racial makeup and adopt policies to encourage a diverse student body. Kennedy identified ways schools could constitutionally pursue racial diversity, such as strategic site selection of new schools. Justice Kennedy believes that schools can pursue racial diversity through strategic site selection of new schools and other measures without treating individuals differently based on race. He suggests that a more nuanced evaluation of school needs and student characteristics, similar to the plan in Grutter, could allow for permissible racial classifications in education. This unique perspective from Justice Kennedy could impact future legal decisions on the use of racial classifications in schools. Justice Thomas disagreed with the dissent's assertion that school plans were necessary to combat resegregation, arguing that intentional state action to separate races was not present in Seattle or Louisville. He also contested the idea of a less strict standard for racial classifications used for benign purposes, stating that school plans excluding individuals based on race could exacerbate racial tension. Justice Thomas disagreed with the dissent's assertion that school plans were necessary to combat resegregation, arguing that intentional state action to separate races was not present in Seattle or Louisville. He also contested the idea of a less strict standard for racial classifications used for benign purposes, stating that school plans excluding individuals based on race could exacerbate racial tension. Justice Thomas argued that the perception of benign use of race-conscious measures relies too heavily on the good intentions of public officials, cautioning against elites bearing racial theories. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Breyer criticized the Court's decision to strike down school integration efforts, arguing that it distorts precedent and undermines the promise of integrated education. The Parents Involved in Community Schools case will have a significant impact on similar plans at elementary and secondary schools nationwide. The Parents Involved in Community Schools case left open the possibility for school districts to pursue measures to promote racial diversity, but the specific methods remain unclear. Justice Kennedy's suggestions, such as strategic site selection and altering attendance zones, may be more likely to withstand legal challenges. The fate of other race-conscious school plans will depend on future legal developments."
