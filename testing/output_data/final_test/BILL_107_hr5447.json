    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women Discharged From the Military Due to Pregnancy Relief Act of 2002\". Congress enacted the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, allowing women to join the Armed Forces. Executive Order 10240 in 1951 permitted the discharge of pregnant women from the military. The Armed Forces systematically discharged pregnant women, regardless of the circumstances, without offering retention opportunities or required benefits. Up to 7,000 service women were involuntarily discharged due to pregnancy. The systematic discharge of pregnant women from the Armed Forces led some to seek illegal abortions or put their children up for adoption. In some cases, women even committed suicide. Stephanie Crawford challenged this practice in court in 1975, arguing that it violated her constitutional rights. The court ruled in her favor in 1976, declaring the mandatory discharge of pregnant service women unconstitutional. In 1976, regulations allowing discharge of servicewomen from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy were deemed unconstitutional. Congress expresses deep remorse for women in the Armed Forces involuntarily discharged due to pregnancy before February 23, 1976. They were subjected to unnecessary and discriminatory actions, violating their constitutional rights. Congress acknowledges the injustice and pledges to pay any unpaid wages and allowances due to these discharges. The Secretary of Defense will identify women involuntarily discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy between June 12, 1948, and February 23, 1976. They will receive missed pay and allowances equal to what they would have earned if not discharged. The Secretary of Defense will pay women officers who were involuntarily discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy an amount equal to the total pay and allowances they would have received during a period of active duty. This payment will be made for a period of five additional years of service or until the completion of a period equal to their service before separation. The Secretary of Defense will pay women officers who were involuntarily discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy an amount equal to their total pay and allowances adjusted for inflation. SEC. 5. LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR CERTAIN STUDENT LOANS. Definitions for loan forgiveness eligibility:\n- Eligible offspring: Child of a qualifying individual under section 4(a) determined to be their biological child from the pregnancy leading to their discharge from the Armed Forces.\n- Secretary: Refers to the Secretary of Education.\n- Federal student loan: Any loan under part B, D, or E of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will discharge or cancel Federal student loan debt for eligible offspring as required by the Higher Education Act of 1965. Regulations for application filing will be established within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will publicize the availability of discharge or cancellation of Federal student loan indebtedness for eligible offspring under section 553 of title 5, United States Code. Funds available for making payments to lenders for the discharge of indebtedness shall be used as required by this section, with no delay in regulations as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. SEC. 6. Health benefits available under section 1086 of title 10, United States Code, for eligible persons and offspring as defined in section 5(a). SEC. 7. Standard form of discharge for women veterans involuntarily discharged due to pregnancy. The Secretary of Defense will establish a standard discharge code for women veterans involuntarily discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy between 1951 and 1976. This code will indicate that the discharge was due to pregnancy and allow for revision of discharge documents. Congress believes the Secretary of Defense should create policies to support women veterans discharged before 1976 due to pregnancy to continue serving the nation."
