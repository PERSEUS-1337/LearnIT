It saw extensive service in Vietnam and had various versions for different roles. The M-113 infantry carrier was replaced in the 1980s by the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, but other versions remained in service. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program aims to replace the M-113 to address capability gaps in force protection, mobility, and reliability. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program aims to replace the M-113 due to capability gaps in force protection and mobility. The AMPV will have multiple variants tailored to specific mission roles within the Heavy Brigade Combat Team (HBCT), such as General Purpose, Medical Evacuation, and Mission Command. The M-113 lacks the necessary force protection and mobility for operating in complex operational environments, reducing unit combat effectiveness. The majority of the Army's M-113s are in Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), comprising 32% of tracked armored vehicles. The Army plans to replace M-113s with 1,922 AMPVs in Echelons Above Brigade (EAB), potentially increasing program costs by $6.5 billion. The AMPV program was approved in March 2012 by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The Army approved the AMPV program in March 2012 to replace M-113s with 1,922 AMPVs in Echelons Above Brigade (EAB). The program entered the materiel solution analysis phase and skipped the Technology Development Phase due to the decision to use a nondevelopmental vehicle. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in March 2013 outlined a $1.46 billion EMD contract for one industry bidder to develop all five AMPV variants. The Army planned to spend $1.08 billion on 289 low-rate initial production (LRIP) models between 2018 and 2020. The formal RFP was delayed to mid-September 2013 due to a Defense Acquisition Board review delay. The EMD contract award was scheduled for late 2014 with an average unit manufacturing cost of $1.8 million per vehicle. DOD approved the Army's entry into the Milestone B, EMD Phase with a directive for an Average Procurement Unit Cost of $3.2 million and sustainment costs of $400,000 per vehicle per year. The Army planned to award a five-year EMD contract in May 2014 worth $458 million to a single contractor for 29 prototypes. The EMD phase was scheduled to run between FY2015 and FY2019, followed by three years of low-rate initial production (LRIP) starting in 2020. BAE Systems Land and Armaments L.P. was selected as the winner of the EMD contract valued at about $382 million for 29 vehicles. During the EMD phase, BAE was tasked with producing 29 vehicles for rigorous testing. An optional LRIP phase could lead to an additional 289 vehicles, totaling a $1.2 billion contract. The AMPV successfully completed its CDR in June 2016, demonstrating stability and meeting performance standards. The first general purpose AMPV was delivered to the Army in December 2016 for testing, with plans for contractor tests followed by government testing and Limited User Testing. In April 2018, BAE delivered all 29 AMPVs to the Army for testing after contractor tests and government testing. The Army started reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) testing for the AMPV in September 2017. DOD defines RAM as the probability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Maintainability is the ability of an item to be retained in a specified condition during maintenance. The Army planned to upgrade EAB M-113s for units outside the US, but budget constraints may delay full fleet solutions until after FY 2040. The Army indefinitely postponed plans to upgrade EAB M-113s and issue an RFP for upgraded M-113s in May 2018. In October 2018, Army leadership integrated the AMPV into the NGCV program overseen by the Army's Futures Command. In December 2018, the AMPV program received approval to move into the Production and Deployment phase. BAE Systems will produce 551 out of 2,907 AMPVs, with initial delivery in early 2020. The Army plans to field 258 vehicles in FY2020 as part of the European Deterrence Initiative and two brigade sets by the end of 2020. The Army canceled M-113 replacement at echelons above brigade and redirected funding to higher priorities. The Army is facing uncertainty in addressing its previous 1,922 EAB AMPV requirement due to funding cuts for various programs, including the AMPV, to support a new modernization strategy. While the overall top-line requirement for the AMPV may remain unchanged, the Army is likely to slow down the procurement rate. Concerns have been raised about the program meeting entry requirements for initial production and testing due to unresolved vehicle performance and design issues. The AMPV program is facing concerns regarding unresolved vehicle performance and design issues, leading to potential cost increases and schedule delays. The U.S. Army has not adjusted procurement quantities to reflect changes in equipment requirements, resulting in inaccurate cost estimates. The program has experienced a 20% cost growth above target due to challenges meeting logistics, performance, and production requirements, as highlighted in a 2018 GAO assessment. The AMPV program, dependent on other programs for communication capabilities, faces scrutiny due to unresolved issues, cost growth, and delays. Legacy radio platform included in design to accommodate future networking capabilities. The AMPV program has shown superior power, mobility, and reliability compared to the M113 family of vehicles. It offers potential for growth in power demand and improved patient care capabilities. The platform's common parts among variants improve overall availability, with the Mission Command variant facilitating digital mission command. The AMPV program has demonstrated superior power, mobility, and reliability compared to the M113 family of vehicles. It offers potential for growth in power demand and improved patient care capabilities. However, there are some deficiencies that could affect AMPV performance, such as display lock-ups, degraded situational awareness, limitations in sharing operational pictures, and difficulties in using certain vehicle features. Design changes have been identified to address these deficiencies. The Mortar Carrier's ammunition storage is not optimized, with water leakage and roof leaks affecting electronics and patient care. Minor vehicle design vulnerabilities are being addressed to meet survivability requirements. FY2020 budget includes funding for AMPV in Base and OCO budgets, with 66 AMPVs to support USEUCOM's requirement for unit equipment sets. The Army's plans to replace EAB M-113s with AMPVs have been postponed indefinitely, with only selected units outside the US, in South Korea, and Europe receiving AMPVs. Plans to upgrade M-113s have been put on hold, and replacement efforts have been canceled. The Army's unclear strategy for addressing legacy M-113s at EAB raises questions about their future maintenance. The Army's plans to replace EAB M-113s with AMPVs have been postponed indefinitely. Concerns about performance, design, and inaccurate procurement quantities have been raised. Programmatic issues persist, with cost growth and difficulties meeting developmental requirements. A more in-depth examination of AMPV program deficiencies is recommended. Army leadership announced the postponement on March 13, 2019. The Army announced funding cuts for 93 programs, including the AMPV, to prioritize its modernization strategy. While the overall AMPV requirement remains unchanged, the procurement rate may slow down. Policymakers may benefit from a revised AMPV procurement and fielding plan once the Army finalizes its modernization strategy."
