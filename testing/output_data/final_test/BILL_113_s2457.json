    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Highway Runoff Management Act\" and it pertains to Federal-aid highway runoff management. The \"Highway Runoff Management Act\" amends Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code by adding a Federal-aid highway runoff management program. It defines a \"covered project\" as a project on a Federal-aid highway that results in a 10% or greater increase in impervious surface or an increase of 1 acre or more in impervious surface coverage. The term 'erosive force' refers to the flowrate in a stream where material becomes detached, usually less than the flowrate of a 2-year storm event. 'Highway runoff' on a Federal-aid highway exceeds preproject runoff levels. 'Impacted hydrology' is stormwater runoff from all areas within a covered project site. 'Management measure' includes various practices, policies, and procedures for managing runoff. State Highway Stormwater Management Programs require each State to develop a process for analyzing the erosive force of highway runoff and apply management measures to maintain or restore impacted hydrology associated with highway runoff from covered projects. Management measures may include minimizing the erosive force of highway runoff. State Highway Stormwater Management Programs require States to manage highway runoff from covered projects to minimize erosive force, manage impacted hydrology, address downstream erosion impacts, and ensure post-highway runoff compliance. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, will publish guidance within 180 days to assist States in implementing State Highway Stormwater Management Programs. The guidance will include guidelines and technical assistance for establishing State management measures to minimize erosive force and manage highway runoff from covered projects. State management measures will be used to assist in avoiding, minimizing, and managing highway runoff from covered projects. The Secretary will review and approve each State's management measures program, ensuring it meets the requirements. Updates to the program must be made every 5 years. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, will update guidance for highway stormwater management programs every 5 years. States must update their management measures program accordingly. States are required to submit annual reports on activities and reductions in stormwater runoff achieved through covered projects. Reporting requirements are outlined under the permit. The State is not required to submit an annual report if it is operating Federal-aid highways in a post-construction condition under a permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and is subject to an annual reporting requirement for covered projects. The State is not obligated to submit an annual report if it operates Federal-aid highways in a post-construction condition under a permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and is subject to an annual reporting requirement for covered projects. Additionally, a permitting authority receiving an annual report must transmit a copy to the Secretary. Federal-aid highway runoff management program."
