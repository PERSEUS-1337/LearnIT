The governments of low income oil-producing countries often hide billions of dollars in oil revenues, refusing to disclose information when pressured, leading to lack of accountability and reliance on donor assistance for the people. In low income oil-producing countries like Angola, a significant portion of oil revenues is unaccounted for, leading to mismanagement and corruption. This mismanagement results in high child mortality rates and unstable governments that rely on costly emergency assistance from the international community.

Ambassador Norland emphasized the importance of public scrutiny and monitoring for the project's success. The Chad/Cameroon Pipeline Project is under constant scrutiny and monitoring by outside groups to ensure transparency in oil revenue management. This transparency is crucial for directing resources towards poverty reduction, environmental preservation, and human rights advancement, rather than private bank accounts. SEC. 3.
