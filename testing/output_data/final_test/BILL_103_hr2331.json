    "content": "Procedures on default of housing loans. Procedures on default of housing loans are outlined in section 3732(a) of title 38, United States Code. Before foreclosure, the obligation holder must notify the Secretary of the default. The Secretary has the option to pay the unpaid balance of the obligation, accrued interest, and reimburse the holder for costs within 60 days. Forebearance may be granted with approval from the Secretary. Within 10 days of receiving a default notice, the Secretary can notify the mortgagor about the option to purchase the loan. The mortgagor must request the purchase within 20 days. If the loan is purchased, the Secretary can modify the loan terms and grant forbearance for up to 12 months. Upon receiving a request from the mortgagor to purchase the loan to avoid foreclosure, the Secretary may purchase the loan if the default was due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and the holder is unwilling to grant further forbearance. The mortgagor must desire to retain and occupy the property for the purchase to proceed. The Secretary may provide assistance to a mortgagor whose loan has been purchased if the property is maintained in good condition, the net value exceeds the unguaranteed portion of the loan, and there is a reasonable prospect of resuming mortgage payments within 12 months. Assistance may include modifying the loan instruments to lower the interest rate or extend the loan. The Secretary may provide assistance to a mortgagor by modifying the loan instruments to lower the interest rate, extend the loan, or grant forbearance of interest or principal for up to 12 months. If the Secretary decides not to purchase the loan, the mortgagor must be notified within 30 days with the basis of the decision, and veterans have the right to appeal. The Secretary may hold a quit claim deed for the property securing the loan after purchase, returning it to the mortgagor if the loan is current for 12 months. If the loan becomes 6 months delinquent, the Secretary may acquire the property without delays. Foreclosure can be initiated before 6 months if deemed in the best interest of the United States. The Secretary may include non-defaulted loans purchased under certain conditions in pools for mortgage-backed securities. Amendments are made to personnel sections in title 38 of the United States Code. The amendments made to section 3732(c) of title 38, United States Code, involve redesignating subclauses and extending the procedure for liquidation sales by striking out paragraph (11). These changes will apply to housing loans guaranteed under chapter 37 of title 38, United States Code, for which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs receives notice of default after the date of enactment of this Act."
