    "content": "The NTSB was established in 1967 as part of the Department of Transportation, but became completely separate in 1974 through the Independent Safety Board Act. This independence allows the NTSB to conduct unbiased investigations and make safety recommendations without perceived conflicts of interest. The agency has gained a worldwide reputation for its accident investigations and advocacy for transportation safety improvements. The NTSB, known for its accident investigations and safety advocacy, consists of a five-member board and around 400 staff members. They are seeking to increase staff to 475 employees to fulfill their mission of conducting investigations, safety studies, and preparing safety recommendations for all modes of transportation. The National Transportation Safety Board is seeking to increase staff to 475 employees to fulfill their mission of conducting investigations and safety studies. The National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2006 authorized a funding increase of roughly 13.5% in FY2008 compared to FY2007 levels, potentially allowing for an increase in authorized full-time equivalents to about 450. The National Transportation Safety Board may increase authorized FTEs to around 450. Safety Board members serve five-year terms and can continue until a replacement is appointed. Not more than three members can be from the same party, and at least three must have technical qualifications. A recent point of contention is the appointment process for board members' personal staff, with individual members now having full authority to appoint staff. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) appoints individuals for personal staff positions, limited to one senior professional staff position and one administrative staff position. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents, issues safety recommendations, assists victims' families in airline disasters, and serves as a board of appeals for certain transportation regulatory actions. They investigate civil and public aircraft accidents, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, and passenger train accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates transportation accidents, including civil and public aircraft accidents, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, passenger train accidents, pipeline accidents, and major marine casualties. They also participate in investigations of foreign aviation accidents involving U.S. manufactured or registered aircraft, and may lend expertise in foreign investigations upon request. The NTSB is reimbursed for costs when participating in overseas accident investigations, with reimbursements now designated as offsetting collections for NTSB use. This change was included in the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2006. The NTSB investigates transportation mishaps, assists families of passengers in accidents, handles appeals of certificate actions, maintains a database of aviation accidents, and issues safety recommendations to improve transportation safety. The NTSB highlights key safety recommendations for transportation safety improvements, including in-flight icing dangers, flammable vapors in fuel tanks, runway incursions, cockpit technology enhancements, crew training, positive train control systems, recreational boating safety, motor carrier operations, school bus safety, automobile seat-belt laws, drunk driving risks, and school bus safety at railroad crossings. The NTSB issues key safety recommendations for transportation improvements, such as addressing in-flight icing dangers, flammable vapors in fuel tanks, and drunk driving risks. These recommendations often require regulatory changes and are based on thorough investigations, although not all agencies may agree on their necessity. For example, the FAA has resisted NTSB's push for child restraints on airliners for children under two due to cost concerns. The NTSB has recommended child restraints on airliners for children under two, but the FAA has resisted due to cost concerns. Pilot unions have opposed cockpit video recorders, citing limited value and privacy concerns. Some NTSB recommendations were not feasible initially, leading to years of research to address them, like reducing fuel tank flammability after the TWA flight 800 crash in 1996. The NTSB has pushed for technologies to reduce fuel tank flammability in airline fuel tanks, with some progress made in requiring these measures on certain airliners. However, the NTSB wants these requirements to be more widely applied to all commercial airliners. Their safety recommendations have influenced transportation agencies and Congressional decision-making. Since 1967, the NTSB has issued over 12,000 safety recommendations across all modes of transportation, with about 83% leading to safety improvements. Concern remains over the time it takes to implement these recommendations, often due to assessing feasibility, cost, and benefits. The NTSB has been working to improve this process by collaborating more closely with DOT agencies. The NTSB collaborates with DOT agencies to draft safety recommendations under the initiative called SWAT. Critics argue that this approach may dilute the NTSB's safety objectives by aligning too closely with regulatory agencies, potentially compromising impartiality. Balancing necessary safety improvements with achievable recommendations poses an ongoing challenge for the NTSB. The NTSB may deliberate on structuring interactions with recipients of recommendations to communicate safety objectives and operational limitations. The Senate NTSB reauthorization bill included a provision for NTSB to review DOT's annual report on responses to safety recommendations. While not enacted, P.L. 109-443 requires FAA to explain why aviation safety measures have not been implemented. The FAA is required to explain why aviation safety improvements from the NTSB's list have not been implemented. The Senate bill included a provision for NTSB to provide recommendations on transportation safety legislation to Congress, raising concerns about separation of powers. NTSB already participates in congressional oversight on transportation safety issues. The NTSB participates in congressional oversight on transportation safety issues, but involving the agency in the legislative process may raise concerns about separation of powers and partisan debates. Funding for the NTSB includes base authorization, emergency funds for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for complex investigations. The enacted legislation did not include a provision for NTSB to provide recommendations on transportation safety legislation to Congress. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) receives base appropriations authorized by the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2003. The annual authorization level increased by about 6% per year, reaching $87.539 million for FY2006. Additional funding for operating the NTSB Academy was authorized but never appropriated. Appropriations for the NTSB have been slightly below authorized levels since FY2003. In FY2003, the NTSB received $72 million, increasing to $73.5 million in FY2004 with an additional $600,000 for the emergency fund. FY2005 saw a base appropriation of $76.7 million, reduced to $68.7 million after a rescission. In FY2006, the NTSB received just under $75 million after a 1% government-wide rescission. In FY2006, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker stated that the agency's budget could not support its staff size of 416 full-time equivalents, leading to a reduction to 396 full-time equivalents through attrition. The administration proposed $80 million for FY2007, $4 million higher than FY2006, to cover salary and cost increases. For FY2008, a funding authorization of $100 million was proposed, a 22% increase from FY2007, to hire 75 additional investigators and support staff. In FY2009, an authorization of $105 million was requested to sustain the increased staffing level. The NTSB budget for FY2007 was initially proposed at $80 million, with a request for $100 million in FY2008 and $105 million in FY2009 to sustain increased staffing levels. The enacted NTSB reauthorization legislation authorized $82 million for FY2007 and $93 million for FY2008. During the NTSB reauthorization process, key issues included the adequacy of staff size, funding for the NTSB Academy, relief from contracting requirements, reimbursements, and payment for Inspector General investigations. In 2005, NTSB field investigators deployed to only 62% of fatal incidents. In 2005, NTSB field investigators deployed to only 62% of fatal airplane crashes in the United States, compared to 75% in 2001. This trend has raised concerns among aviation safety experts about missed opportunities to improve safety. The NTSB's strategy is to target deployments on crashes with new safety issues, but without on-scene involvement, assessing these issues is challenging. The NTSB plans to request funding for additional investigative staff starting in FY2008, a central issue in the reauthorization debate. The number of NTSB on-site field investigations of aviation accidents has been declining since 2002, with an increase in \"data collection accidents.\" In 2005, NTSB sent investigators to 219 aviation field accidents compared to 322 in 2002. Limited investigations delegated to FAA inspectors have decreased, while data collection investigations completed in the office have increased significantly. This trend has raised concerns about missed safety improvement opportunities. The NTSB's on-site field investigations of aviation accidents decreased significantly from 2002 to 2005, with a shift towards more data collection accidents. This change may be attributed to a strategy to manage limited investigator resources and clear a backlog of cases. The backlog of cases older than six months was reduced from 2,400 in 2001 to 944 in early 2006, leading to investigators spending more time in the office completing old cases. There is a need for more field investigators, especially for smaller aircraft investigations, and expertise in specialty fields to address the complexity of transportation disasters. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) has criticized the NTSB for not thoroughly investigating human factors in airline crashes due to workload and staffing limitations. The NTSB also faces staffing needs in specialized areas like airline operations and air traffic control. Recruiting experts in these fields is challenging. Recruiting and training qualified individuals in specialized disciplines for accident investigation is challenging. Staff attrition could impact the NTSB's ability to fully investigate transportation accidents. Policymakers may need to enhance recruitment and retention efforts for field investigators and specialists. The House bill proposed funding to increase NTSB staffing levels by 19%, but the Senate bill did not include funding. The Senate bill (S. 3679) did not include funding for increasing NTSB staff levels, but it required the NTSB to report on accidents not investigated and ongoing investigations. This information could help assess the impact of staffing levels on meeting statutory obligations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 authorizes a funding increase. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-443) authorizes a funding increase of roughly 13.5% in FY2008 compared to FY2007 levels. If funds are allocated for increasing staffing levels, the NTSB may reach about 450 FTEs in FY2008. The Act also requires the NTSB to maintain at least one full-time employee in states located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office, impacting Hawaii where the NTSB currently lacks a field office. The NTSB has been addressing air safety issues in Hawaii due to the state's reliance on aviation for transportation. The NTSB Academy, located in Virginia, was established in 2003 to provide training in accident investigation theory and practice. Congress is debating whether to fund the NTSB Academy separately or as part of the overall organization. The debate is whether to fund the NTSB Academy separately or as part of the overall NTSB budget. Funding within the overall budget would provide flexibility but could strain resources if costs exceed projections. P.L. 108-168 allows the NTSB to collect fees for Academy services. The NTSB proposes including funding authorization for the Academy in the current reauthorization debate. The NTSB proposes integrating funding for the NTSB Academy into the broader agency authorization, aligning with recent appropriations actions. H.R. 5076 and S. 3679 support this by not specifying separate funding levels for the academy and consolidating reporting with the NTSB's overall operations report to Congress. The NTSB Academy, as supported by bill S. 3679, aims to integrate its operations with the agency's overall role. However, the GAO found that significant progress is needed as the academy lacks a strategic training plan and core competencies. The facility is underutilized, with most staff training coming from external vendors. In FY2004 and FY2005, NTSB staff made up less than 20% of total enrollment at the NTSB Academy. Despite having mostly fee-paying external students, revenues from these sources covered only about 8% of operating expenses. Even with the option to rent out classroom space, reimbursements only covered about 15% of other costs. Policymakers may need to improve staff training and revenue generation initiatives at the academy. The NTSB Academy aims to increase revenue through training programs and courses. Despite plans for improvement, current operations suggest a status quo approach. Opportunities exist for refining and expanding course offerings. Plans are in place to establish an oversight board for training and academic purposes. The NTSB Academy is looking to enhance its curriculum and revenue generation. A Senate bill proposed a plan for the academy to become self-sufficient within two years, including subleasing the facility for revenue. Congressional oversight may scrutinize the NTSB's efforts to improve its training programs. The GAO study on NTSB Academy finances found challenges in increasing revenue or reducing training costs to fully offset expenses. NTSB violated the Anti-Deficiency Act by leasing the facility as an operating lease without budget authority. Remedies suggested include renegotiating the lease, obtaining deficiency appropriation, or vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy. The GAO study found challenges in NTSB Academy finances, suggesting vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the training center. Federal procurement processes can be lengthy and not suitable for timely transportation accident investigations. Unique services needed by NTSB may only be available from a limited number of vendors. The NTSB has faced criticism for its financial management and oversight. P.L. 108-168 clarified the NTSB's authority for exemption from contracting requirements for investigations over $25,000, but this provision expired in FY2006. The NTSB requested to make its special contracting authority permanent. The NTSB's special contracting authority, requested to be made permanent, allows for reporting on contracts awarded under this authority in the annual report to Congress. The NTSB also participates in foreign accident investigations, providing technical expertise and experience, sometimes being reimbursed for expenses incurred. Airlines are required to pay for disaster mortuary services, but the NTSB often covers these costs upfront. The NTSB covers upfront costs for airline disaster services and seeks reimbursement later. Prior to the NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006, only certain reimbursements were credited as offsetting collections. The NTSB expressed concern about facing a funding shortfall if sizable expenses are not directly offset by reimbursements. The NTSB can collect fees and reimbursements for services provided, as authorized by the NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006. The DOT Office of Inspector General has limited oversight of NTSB's financial and property management, established due to concerns over fraud and inefficiencies in the 1990s. The NTSB requested the repeal of statutory language that required them to reimburse the Inspector General for oversight costs, citing potential conflicts of interest and resource impacts on their core mission. They proposed direct funding for the DOT Office of Inspector General for NTSB oversight activities, which was supported by the Inspector General. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 authorizes funding for the DOT Office of Inspector General's oversight costs related to NTSB activities. A reimbursable agreement is required if specific appropriations are not made. The GAO must evaluate and audit NTSB programs and expenditures annually or more frequently if needed. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 authorizes funding for oversight costs related to NTSB activities. Audits and evaluations may be conducted by House and Senate committees in addition to GAO-led audits. Concerns have been raised about industry lobbying of NTSB officials and the agency's heavy reliance on experts. The NTSB's heavy reliance on experts from transportation entities with vested interests in investigations has raised concerns about bias. Experts suggest stronger ties with government labs and academic institutions to mitigate bias. The influence of entities with vested interests on NTSB board members is an ongoing concern not addressed in reauthorization legislation. The NTSB investigation team works closely with experts from transportation entities, but there are concerns about potential influence on the investigative process. Former chairman Ellen Engelman Conners highlighted pressure from airlines and manufacturers to sway NTSB conclusions, causing delays in investigations. In the American Airlines flight 587 investigation, the Safety Board voted to change the order of causal factors, emphasizing design issues over pilot training. Dissenting members argued that downplaying training's role in the accident was a mistake. This decision aligned with new NTSB recommendations, shifting focus from pilot training to design problems with the rudder system. The NTSB voted to change the probable cause statement in the American Airlines flight 587 investigation, emphasizing design issues over pilot training. Dissenting members were concerned that this change could be influenced by lobbying efforts, potentially leading to a loss of public trust in the investigation process. The NTSB has safeguards in place to prevent external influence on accident investigations. The Sunshine Act requires public meetings for transparency, and NTSB staff conduct analysis independently. Parties involved can provide input and petition for reconsideration of findings after the investigation is completed. The NTSB has procedures in place to prevent external influence on accident investigations, including public meetings for transparency and independent analysis by NTSB staff. However, evaluating competing perspectives from involved parties can be challenging and may prolong investigations. Despite safeguards, there is still a risk of parties influencing the process, which could harm the NTSB's reputation and credibility. Balancing input from involved parties while preventing undue influence is crucial for maintaining the agency's impartiality. The challenge of preventing entities from influencing the investigative process and exerting pressure on NTSB board members is significant. Policymakers may need to consider limitations on interactions between investigative parties and the NTSB. Concerns also exist about the NTSB's reliance on entities with a stake in investigations for technical expertise, potentially leading to biased analysis of data. The RAND Corporation Institute for Civil Justice recommended that the NTSB involve more impartial experts from government laboratories and academia in aviation investigations to ensure independence. They also suggested enhancing internal resources through better training and staffing. The RAND Corporation recommended involving impartial experts from government laboratories and academia in NTSB aviation investigations to ensure independence. They proposed a model where consultants and academics play integral roles in the investigative process, rather than just providing support. RAND suggested conducting a nationwide assessment to identify resources and expertise to enhance NTSB capabilities through formal relationships with entities like NASA and DoD laboratories. The NTSB party process involves consulting subject matter experts but may benefit from allowing outside experts to have a more significant role in investigations. This issue has not been addressed by Congress in the current reauthorization process. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 also included other transportation-safety related legislation. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 included provisions for runway safety area alternatives at Juneau International Airport, investigations of criminal activities related to the Boston Central Artery Tunnel project, oversight of safety reviews, and periodic reports to Congress. The National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2006 (H.R. 5076) and the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2006 (S. 3679) were introduced in the House and Senate respectively. Both bills were ordered reported and amended before being agreed upon by unanimous consent. An amended version of H.R. 5076, now titled the National Transportation Safety Board Reauthorization Act of 2006, was passed by the House on December 6, 2006. The Senate passed the bill without amendment on December 7, 2006, and it was signed into law by the President on December 21, 2006 as P.L. 109-443."
