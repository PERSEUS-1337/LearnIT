    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Textiles and Apparel China Safeguard Act\". It includes findings related to the textile and apparel industry. The Congress finds that the United States textiles and apparel industries have lost 345,000 jobs since 2001. Job losses are expected to continue and accelerate after the elimination of quotas on textiles and apparel products, with an estimated 630,000 more jobs to be lost by the end of 2006. Many analysts believe that the People's Republic of China's dominance in the industry is a significant factor. China's dominance in the United States textiles and apparel market is expected to increase after the removal of quotas. President Clinton negotiated a special safeguard allowing the US to impose quotas on Chinese exports if they disrupt the market, but the current Administration has delayed its implementation. The US delayed implementing safeguards on Chinese textiles and apparel for 17 months after joining the World Trade Organization. This led to a significant increase in Chinese exports to the US, causing job losses in the US textile industry. When procedures were finally issued in 2003, they severely restricted the US industry's ability to use the safeguards as outlined in the Accession Agreement. The executive branch has not taken action under the special textiles and apparel safeguard despite increased Chinese exports causing job losses in the US. Bipartisan groups urged the President to support a special WTO session on the impact of quota expiration, but the President did not support it despite studies showing employment loss and trade disruptions. The President did not support a special session at the World Trade Organization to address the expiration of the quota regime. As part of the Doha Round negotiations, the President proposed eliminating textiles and apparel tariffs. Upon enactment of this Act, the President will modify procedures for safeguard actions on imports of textiles and apparel products from China to align with the Accession Agreement to the World Trade Organization. Import relief will be provided if data shows Chinese imports are disrupting or threatening to disrupt trade, including products with US components. A comprehensive agreement on textiles and apparel products will be established. Upon enactment of this Act, the President will initiate consultations with China to reach an agreement on quantitative limitations for textiles and apparel products subject to quotas under the World Trade Organization. SEC. 5. IMPOSITION OF QUANTITATIVE LIMITATIONS: If an agreement is not reached within 90 days after consultations, the President will impose quantitative limitations on imports of textiles and apparel products as per the Accession Agreement."
