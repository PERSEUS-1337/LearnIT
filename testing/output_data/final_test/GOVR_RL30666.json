The early days of Congress saw a lack of formal party leadership, with Representative James Madison of Virginia acting as the first \"minority leader\" opposing Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton's fiscal policies.

The Democratic minority from 1861 to 1875 was disorganized, often not nominating a candidate for Speaker or nominating different individuals each time. Since 1883, the candidate for Speaker nominated by the minority party has typically been the Minority Leader. In 1883, Democrat John G. Carlisle was elected Speaker, while Republican J. Warren Keifer, the previous Speaker, was viewed as a discredited leader due to questionable actions. Keifer received the minority nomination but was deserted by his party associates, leading to the end of his national career. Representative Thomas Reed, R-ME, assumed the role of minority floor leader after J. Warren Keifer's national career ended ingloriously. Reed became the acknowledged leader of the minority party and played a prominent role in the House.
