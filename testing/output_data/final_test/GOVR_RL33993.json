    "content": "This report focuses on major issues in veterans' health care during the 110th Congress, distinguishing between veterans and military retirees. Veterans have served in the armed forces but may not qualify for post-service benefits, while military retirees have completed a full military career or are disabled in the line of duty. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides benefits to military retirees and veterans. A veteran is defined as someone who served in the military and was discharged under honorable conditions. There are two healthcare systems for servicemembers and veterans - the Defense Health Program (DHP) in the DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for discharged servicemembers. The VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) oversees the largest integrated healthcare system for veterans in the country. The VA's Veterans Health Administration oversees the largest integrated healthcare system for veterans in the country, providing benefits to those who have served in the military and their families since early colonial times. The VA's Veterans Health Administration oversees the largest integrated healthcare system for veterans in the country. An annual pension is provided to veterans out of the general treasury for their maintenance. Hospital and medical care for veterans similar to today's standards was not available until World War I. The VA health care system has evolved and expanded since then, with Congress enacting legislation to establish new programs and services for veterans. The VA now provides care for a broader range of veterans, serving as a \"safety net\" for many lower-income individuals. The VA has evolved since World War I to become a safety net for lower-income veterans, offering healthcare services through an integrated system. President Hoover established the Veterans Administration in 1930, and President Reagan replaced it with the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989. The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals. The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals, with the Veterans Health Administration responsible for health care programs, the Veterans Benefits Administration for various benefits, and the National Cemetery Administration for maintaining national cemeteries. The Board of Veterans Appeals makes final decisions on benefits claims, while the VHA operates the largest integrated health care delivery system. Management authority is decentralized to 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. The VA health care system delegates management authority and budget responsibilities to VISNs, with funding allocated based on the VERA system. VHA operates numerous medical centers, nursing homes, clinics, and Vet Centers, providing care directly to veterans. Additionally, VHA pays for care from independent providers on a fee basis. The VA health care system also covers care for veterans' dependents through CHAMPVA, provides grants for nursing homes, collaborates with the Department of Defense, and has been praised for its outstanding performance in healthcare. The VA health care system is known for its comprehensive coverage and efficient organization. In 2005, Health Care Papers dedicated an issue to examining the transformation of VHA and its use of electronic health records. VHA has led private-sector health care in customer satisfaction and uses the integrated health information system VistA. The VHA health care system utilizes the VistA system, which includes the clinical package with applications like CPRS, VistA Imaging, and Bar-Code Medication Administration. CPRS is an integrated system for health care providers, incorporating all aspects of a patient's medical record. It is used in 1,300 VHA facilities nationwide and allows for remote data viewing from other VA facilities. VistA system includes VistA Imaging, which integrates medical chart information with medical images like X-rays and pathology slides. Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) validates medication administration in real time, ensuring correct dosage and timing. BCMA also provides alerts for potential medical errors, prompting nurses to review and correct before administering the drug. The VistA system, costing $87 per patient annually, won an award for its electronic health records system from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 2006. It was praised for saving lives and ensuring continuity of care, even during extreme circumstances like Hurricane Katrina. Medical records for 40,000 veterans were immediately accessible to clinicians nationwide, allowing them to resume treatments and refill prescriptions. The veteran population in the United States was approximately 24 million at the end of FY2006, with 17.8 million being war veterans. The VA expects the total veteran population to decline to 21.7 million by 2011 and 18.1 million by 2020 due to veteran deaths exceeding new separations from the military. California has the largest population of veterans, followed by Florida and Texas. In FY2005, around 7.7 million veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system, with enrollments in most VISNs ranging between 26%-30% of the total eligible veteran population. The total number of veterans enrolled in the VA's health care system is estimated to increase to almost 8.0 million. The VA's health care system is estimated to have almost 8.0 million veterans enrolled in FY2008. In FY2005, VHA provided care to approximately 4.9 million unique patients, with the greatest number in VISNs 4, 8, and 16. By FY2008, VHA is expected to treat about 5.3 million veteran patients, with an increase of approximately 109,000 patients from FY2007. In FY2008, VA is expected to treat about 5.3 million veteran patients, with Priority Groups 1-6 comprising 75% of the total patient population. VA health care is not an entitlement program, and eligibility reform in 1996 changed the provision of care based on available resources. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262, established two eligibility categories for VA healthcare provision based on available resources. Priority is given to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, those exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange, and veterans of World War I. Another category includes veterans with no service-connected disabilities and higher incomes. VA is authorized to manage hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262, established a patient enrollment system for VA healthcare provision based on available resources. The Act directed the Secretary to establish an annual patient enrollment system with specified priorities for veterans. The provision of health care to veterans was dependent on the available resources as stated in the Committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262, required the establishment of a national enrollment system for VA healthcare provision. The new eligibility standard aimed to prioritize medical judgment over legal criteria for care delivery. Veterans can apply for enrollment by completing the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any VA medical center or clinic. Veterans can apply for enrollment in the VA health care system by completing VA Form 10-10EZ online, in person at a VA medical center, or by mailing/faxing it. Once enrolled, veterans do not need to re-apply annually, except for those in Priority Group 5 based on income who must submit updated financial information yearly. Eligibility is based on veteran's status from military service, requiring active-duty status and an honorable discharge. Members of the armed forces and officers must complete two years of active duty for VA health care benefits, unless discharged due to service-connected disabilities. Reservists and National Guard members called to active duty are exempt from the two-year requirement if they completed their term and received an honorable discharge. Reserve components and National Guard members have limited eligibility for VA health care services when not on full-time federal service. Members of the reserve components and National Guard have limited eligibility for VA health care services. Service-connection may be granted for injuries incurred during duty, making them eligible for care from VA. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for injuries during state-ordered duty. VA places veterans into two categories after establishing their status. Veterans eligible for VA health care services are categorized into Priority Groups 1-6 based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. This includes veterans with compensable service-connected conditions, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, and veterans of World War I. Veterans eligible for VA health care services are categorized into Priority Groups 1-6 based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. Priority Group 1 includes veterans with compensable service-connected conditions, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, and veterans of World War I. Priority Group 2 consists of veterans who do not fall into the first six priority groups, primarily those with nonservice-connected medical conditions and higher incomes. VA considers applicants' income, net worth, and health insurance coverage to determine their specific priority category and copayment requirements for nonservice-connected care. The VA provides a standard benefits package to veterans enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8, which includes preventive care, medical treatment, mental health care, prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and prosthetic devices. The National Strategy for Combating Terrorism emphasizes the long-term nature of the \"War on Terror,\" indicating continued military involvement since September 11, 2001. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. Armed Forces have been deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Veterans from these conflicts are putting stress on the VA health care system, with the 110th Congress focusing on a \"seamless transition\" for veterans. Due to advancements in battlefield medicine, a larger proportion of soldiers are surviving their injuries in OEF and OIF operations. Since the onset of OEF and OIF, a larger proportion of injured soldiers are surviving their injuries, with about 10% of those injured in OEF and OIF operations dying. Concerns have been raised about the transition of returning servicemembers from DOD health care to VA health care, as handoffs between inpatient and outpatient care and between the two separate DOD and VA health care systems are problematic. In November 2007, DOD reported that over 30,000 servicemembers have been wounded in action since the beginning of OEF and OIF. Injured servicemembers receiving care in VA health care facilities are not considered veterans until formally discharged from active duty service. Since FY2002, 751,273 OEF and OIF veterans have separated from active duty, with 48% being active duty troops and 52% National Guard and Reserve members. Approximately 35% of these veterans have sought care from the VA, with mental disorders ranking second among major diagnoses for returning OIF and OEF veterans. Mental disorders rank second among major diagnoses for OEF and OIF veterans. Data shows National Guard and Reserve members make up 52% of separated servicemembers but only 34% seek VA health care. Active duty troops make up 48% of separations but only 36% receive VA care. VA expects to treat 263,345 OEF and OIF veterans in FY2008. In FY2008, VA anticipates treating 263,345 OEF and OIF veterans, marking a 26% increase from FY2007 and a 70% increase from FY2006. Funding has seen a 223% increase from FY2005 to the projected amount for FY2008. VA has treated more OIF and OEF veterans than budgeted in FY2005 and FY2006. VA testified that over 6,800 severely injured or ill active duty servicemembers and veterans have transitioned to VHA facilities, with 342 being polytrauma patients. VA has provided services to over 22,000 OEF and OIF veterans, including 187 major amputees. Coordination between VA and DOD has improved since 2003. The sharing of health information between VA and DOD has been problematic, with issues identified by the President's Task Force and the Government Accountability Office. Despite coordination efforts, the two departments still face challenges in sharing medical records. The Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes identified the lack of formal interagency agreements between DOD and VA for transferring case management responsibilities. The President's Commission recommended integrating medical and rehabilitation programming across the two Departments to address problematic handoffs between DOD and VA health care systems. When a soldier is injured on the battlefield, they are stabilized by a combat medic/lifesaver and then moved to a battalion aid station. If serious injuries occur, the servicemember is transferred to a forward surgical team for stabilization before being moved to a combat support. After stabilization at a forward surgical team, injured servicemembers are transferred to a combat support hospital for further stabilization for about two days. If more specialized care is needed, they are evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany within 24 to 72 hours. After 4 to 5 days in Germany, patients are then evacuated to a Military Treatment Facility in the United States such as Walter Reed Army Medical Center or the National Naval Medical Center. Burn patients are flown to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam. All catastrophic burn patients are flown to the Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, which also has a specialized amputee rehabilitation center. Injured servicemembers with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and complex polytrauma cases may be sent to one of the four VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) located in Tampa, Minneapolis, Palo Alto, and Richmond. A fifth Polytrauma Center is set to open in San Antonio, Texas. Injured servicemembers in VA health care facilities are not considered veterans until formally discharged from active duty service. The PRCs offer resources and clinical expertise for comprehensive care. The VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) provide care for complex injuries such as TBI, amputations, nerve damage, burns, fractures, and mental health issues. There are 76 polytrauma clinic teams in the VA that deliver follow-up services and assist in patient management through direct care and tele-rehabilitation technologies. Social work case managers assess patients' psychosocial needs, coordinate services, and oversee discharge planning. The VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) provide care for complex injuries such as TBI, amputations, nerve damage, burns, fractures, and mental health issues. VA/DOD liaisons assist with patient transfers from MTFs to VHA hospitals and clinics. Medical records are obtained through direct access to WRAMC and Bethesda National Naval Medical Center, with some paper records obtained through Nursing Admissions Coordinators. Video teleconferencing between MTFs and PRCs allows families to meet the VA interdisciplinary team. The VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) provide care for complex injuries such as TBI, amputations, nerve damage, burns, fractures, and mental health issues. PRCs offer families the opportunity to meet the VA interdisciplinary team and facilitate the transition-of-care process. The rehabilitation team evaluates each patient within 24 hours of admission and meets three times weekly to adjust the therapeutic plan. Patients undergo three to six hours of therapy daily based on individual needs. VA plans to develop 4 Residential Transitional Rehabilitation Programs by July 2007 to improve veterans' functioning and return them to active duty, work, school, or independent living. The Dole-Shalala Commission recommended the appointment of recovery coordinators to manage individualized recovery plans for servicemembers. These coordinators may come from the U.S. Public Health Service and have authority to access necessary resources. The Army and Senior Oversight Committee are working on case management approaches to improve servicemembers' recovery process. VA, DOD, and HHS have signed a memorandum of understanding to define the role of the Public Health Service in the Recovery Coordinator program. The Recovery Coordinator (RC) program is being established by VA and DOD, with members from the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps detailed to assist. The RC will oversee the clinical and non-clinical care in the Individualized Recovery Plan for eligible servicemembers/veterans, ensuring access to medical care, rehabilitation, education, and disability benefits. RC positions will be located at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Bethesda Naval. The VA has taken steps to assist injured servicemembers transitioning between DOD and VA medical facilities, including conducting briefings and sending information brochures and letters to OEF and OIF veterans. Educational materials on VA services and benefits are also provided to National Guard Adjutants. VA has developed an outreach program for National Guard and Reserve members, signing MOAs with the National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps to increase awareness of VA services. The VA-DOD Joint Executive Committee (JEC) was established to improve coordination between the two departments. The VA-DOD Joint Executive Committee (JEC) was established to improve coordination and sharing of resources between the two departments. P.L. 108-136 requires the JEC to review policies, procedures, and practices to identify changes that would benefit coordination and sharing of resources without affecting the quality of care or services. They also review plans for acquiring additional resources to determine the impact on future opportunities for coordination and sharing. The VA-DOD Joint Executive Committee (JEC) was established to promote coordination and resource sharing between departments. In April 2004, VA signed an MOU with DOD for health care services for servicemembers with specific injuries. VA established the National Veterans Affairs Office of Seamless Transition in January 2005 to ensure continuity of care for transitioning servicemembers. The National Veterans Affairs Office of Seamless Transition ensures continuity of care for transitioning servicemembers by providing additional VA/DOD liaisons at medical centers and placing a certified Rehabilitation Registered Nurse to assess and update patients' medical conditions. Established an OIF/OEF Polytrauma Call Center to assist seriously injured veterans and their families. Trained National Guard Transition Assistance Advisors to provide advice on VA benefits and services. Implemented a seamless transition performance measure for severely injured OEF and OIF servicemembers. The VA has enhanced outreach efforts through the Vet Center program, which was established in 1979 to help Vietnam veterans readjust to civilian life. There are currently 209 community-based centers across the country, with plans to establish 23 new centers in 2007 and 2008. Veterans at military treatment facilities must be assigned a VA case manager before transfer, who will contact them within 7 days. The Vet Center program is expanding with 23 new centers being established in communities across the nation in 2007 and 2008. Funding for the program comes from various sources including personnel costs, leasing costs, Information Technology, and Medical Administration accounts. Each Vet Center is managed by a Team Leader who reports to one of the seven Readjustment Counseling Service Regional Managers. The Chief Readjustment Counseling Officer at the VA Central Office oversees all Vet Center operations and reports to the Under Secretary for Health. Site selection for new Vet Centers is carefully considered. The Vet Center program is expanding with 23 new centers being established in communities across the nation in 2007 and 2008. Site selection for the new Vet Centers is based on demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the DOD Defense Manpower Data Center. Vet Centers utilize permanently leased space and are usually staffed by one or two counselors who provide full-time services to area veterans. Vet Centers also remain open after normal business hours or on weekends to accommodate veterans traveling from greater distances. 100 new outreach workers have been hired and trained from recently separated OIF and OEF veterans, with plans to recruit an additional 100 staff positions to the Vet Center program. VHA plans to recruit 100 staff positions for the Vet Center program in FY2008 and another 100 for FY2009. These positions will be located near military out-processing stations and National Guard facilities to provide information and services to transitioning veterans and their families. VA also aims to add staff to 61 existing facilities to enhance services. Combat veterans are eligible for readjustment counseling services at Vet Centers. The Vet Center program offers readjustment counseling services to veterans and their families, including bereavement counseling and support for those who have experienced sexual trauma while on active duty. The program has served over 183,530 veterans and provided clinical services to 58,504 veterans. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve the exchange of medical information between the VA and DOD for seamless patient transition. In June 2005, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between DOD and VA to define data sharing. The agreement led to the implementation of a bi-directional exchange of medical information (BHIE) including patient allergies, lab results, and pharmacy data. This allows VA providers to access DOD health care information and vice versa. The VA and DOD have implemented a bi-directional exchange of medical information, allowing access to patient data between the two departments. This includes transferring patients from DOD treatment facilities to VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers and testing a new interface for real-time data exchange. The VTA was activated to provide real-time access to medical records for wounded soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan and Iraq. The VA implemented a bi-directional exchange of medical information with the DOD, allowing real-time access to medical records for wounded soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan and Iraq. VA clinicians can track patient referrals from DOD facilities using VTA, reducing training burden and ensuring data availability through VistA by the end of 2007. Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan can enroll in VA services after separation from active duty. Following separation from active duty, veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan can enroll in the VA health care system and receive VA health care without copayment requirements for two years for conditions related to their combat service. After the initial two-year period, they may continue their enrollment but may be subject to copayment requirements. Legislation is being considered to expand eligibility. In response to issues with outpatient medical care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, task forces and study panels were appointed by the President. On April 19, 2007, an interagency task force chaired by VA Secretary Nicholson issued a report with 25 recommendations to improve federal services for returning military personnel from OEF and OIF. Health care recommendations included developing co-management and case management systems, screening for TBI, and enhancing VA enrollment processes for returning servicemembers. The VA is recommended to improve services for returning military personnel from OEF and OIF by standardizing VA Liaison agreements, expanding access to DOD records, enhancing the Computerized Patient Record System, developing a Veterans Tracking Application, creating an \"Embedded Fragment\" surveillance center, and improving dental care access for servicemembers. The VA is working to enhance dental care access for OEF and OIF servicemembers in the private sector while improving capacity at VA facilities. Collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services is being expanded to reach servicemembers in remote areas. Efforts are also underway to improve IT interoperability between VA and Indian Health Service partners. PTSD is a major concern for returning servicemembers, with Congress holding hearings on mental health care services provided by the VA. Demand for mental health services, including PTSD treatment, is expected to increase among new soldiers and veterans experiencing heightened anxiety during wartime. As of June 30, 2007, VHA facilities have examined 56,246 OEF and OIF veterans for potential PTSD, with 48,559 receiving a possible diagnosis. PTSD symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, and hyperarousal, lasting at least a month and causing significant impairment. PTSD often coexists with other anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and substance abuse. Studies show high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Studies have shown high rates of comorbidity between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders, with rates of alcohol abuse ranging from 68% to 82% in individuals with PTSD. The VA's Mental Health Strategic Plan aims to enhance mental health programs for veterans based on the CARES model and recommendations from the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. VA provides PTSD services in various clinical settings, including specialized programs in over 100 medical facilities for veterans suffering from PTSD. Outpatient and inpatient PTSD programs are available for veterans, offering counseling and 24-hour care. The VHA has created Returning Veterans Education and Clinical Teams to help treat veterans with mental health issues. VA anticipates having 90 of these programs operational nationwide by FY2007. The VA has screened over 61,000 veterans for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) symptoms, with 19.26% testing positive. Clinicians are evaluating these cases to confirm TBI diagnoses, separate from PTSD or other combat-related stress. 41 veterans have received a definitive TBI diagnosis out of 127 evaluations. Approximately one-third of veterans who screen positive for TBI have received a definitive diagnosis, indicating physical brain damage and impaired functioning. Common symptoms include headache, memory loss, slow mental processing, poor attention, sound intolerance, sleep disturbances, and irritability. TBI is closely linked to cognitive impairment and emotional issues like PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These psychological issues can worsen overall health and adherence to medical regimens. Impulsivity may also be a result of TBI, as damage can remove brain functions that regulate behavior. Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may overreact to stimuli due to higher brain function limits. TBI can lead to amnesia, causing delusional or reconstructed memories of trauma. Traumatic recall does not need to be accurate for PTSD. VA polytrauma centers in Minneapolis, Palo Alto, Richmond, and Tampa provide care for TBI patients. These centers are experienced in medical and rehabilitative care for TBI and collaborate with national brain injury centers. Veterans' advocates are concerned about the VA's reliance on yearly discretionary appropriations, which leads to unpredictable funding and delays in hiring medical staff and facility maintenance. They are calling for \"assured funding\" or \"mandatory funding\" for veterans' health care. The discussion on VA funding includes mandatory funding proposals for VA programs, which are currently funded through both mandatory and discretionary spending authorities. Mandatory spending programs include cash benefit programs, readjustment benefits, home loan guarantees, and veterans' insurance. These programs are funded through annual appropriations, and the government is required to provide eligible recipients with entitled benefits. The VA is obligated to provide entitled benefits, with Congress funding the necessary amount through annual appropriations. If the funding is insufficient, Congress must make up the difference with a supplemental appropriation. VA entitlement benefits may increase with inflation, while other programs like health care and medical research are funded through discretionary appropriations determined by Congress each year. The amount of funds VHA can spend on discretionary programs is determined by its appropriation, with mandatory funding proposals based on a formula considering enrolled and nonenrolled veterans eligible for VA medical care. Proponents argue mandatory funding will eliminate funding uncertainty, while opponents fear increased spending as enrollment rises, with critics noting a static funding formula may not address changing veteran needs. The current annual appropriation process allows Congress to evaluate the changing needs of veterans and determine the funding level for VA services. Chairman Buyer expressed concerns about the high cost of mandatory funding, citing the responsiveness of discretionary budgets to changing needs. The CBO stated that the bill would primarily affect funding for health care services provided by VHA, resulting in savings for Medicare and Medicaid. However, converting veterans' medical care to mandatory budget authority may not solve the funding gap issue. Congress can limit spending on veterans' health programs through budget reconciliation language, leading to uncertainty in funding amounts. Henry J. Aaron mentioned that converting VHA to mandatory funding would not entirely protect it from budgetary pressures. The Veterans Health Care Full Funding Act, Mandatory Funding for Veterans Act of 2007, and Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act have been introduced in Congress to address funding for VA health care. These bills propose different methods for funding VA health care, including mandatory appropriations and recommendations from an independent review board. Veterans' advocates are pushing for all veterans to have access to VA care, including Priority Group 8 veterans. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 stipulated that medical care for veterans would be provided based on annual appropriations. In 2003, VA temporarily suspended enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans due to funding constraints. Despite funding increases, VA struggled to provide timely care to all enrolled veterans due to a surge in demand. Data from FY2003 to FY2008 shows the number of Priority Group 8 veterans unable to enroll in VA care. The VA estimates that if the suspension on enrollment were lifted in FY2008, almost 1.6 million Priority Group 8 veterans would be eligible to enroll in the VA health care system. The number of Priority Group 8 veterans already enrolled is expected to decline due to projected death rates and continued suspension of new enrollments. Estimates for resuming enrollment would require additional funding, with the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee estimating $1.113 billion needed to restore access for Priority Group 8 veterans. The VA estimates that reopening enrollment for Priority Group 8 veterans in FY2008 would cost $1.113 billion. Legislation has been introduced to lift the suspension, with provisions incorporated into S. 1233. VA provides prescription medications at a nominal charge of $8 for a 30-day supply, with waivers for certain conditions. The VA provides medications to enrolled veterans receiving VA-provided care, prescribed by a VA physician. Exceptions include veterans receiving additional disability compensation or nonservice-connected pensions. The VA implemented the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) in 2003 to provide access to VA prescription drugs for veterans experiencing long waits for their initial primary care appointment. This program allowed VA pharmacies to fill prescriptions written by non-VA physicians until a VA physician could examine the veteran. The VA implemented the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) in 2003 to provide access to VA prescription drugs for veterans experiencing long waits for their initial primary care appointment. Veterans had to be enrolled in the VA health care system prior to July 25, 2003, and waiting more than 30 days for their initial primary care appointment as of September 22, 2003, to qualify for the program. Despite VA anticipating 200,000 eligible veterans, only 41,000 were deemed eligible, with 8,300 participating. The program incurred administrative costs and has since been discontinued. VA has discontinued a pilot program for a prescription-only health care benefit for veterans. There was interest in Congress, but no bills were enacted into law. VA has a substantial inventory of real property and facilities supporting VHA's mission, with a shift to outpatient care. GAO projected high costs for maintaining VA's buildings and land, with over 5 million square feet of vacant space costing up to $35 million a year to maintain. In October 2000, VA established the CARES program to evaluate veterans' health care needs over the next 20 years. The program recommended closing seven VA health care facilities and eliminating duplicative services at over 30 other VHA facilities. The sites slated for closure were in Canandaigua, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Lexington, Kentucky; Cleveland, Ohio; Gulfport, Mississippi; Waco, Texas; and Livermore, California. Patients would be provided care at nearby sites as recommended in the Draft National CARES Plan. The Draft National CARES Plan recommended building new major medical facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, and East Central Florida, along with infrastructure upgrades at various sites. A 16-member independent commission was appointed to study the plan, applying six factors in their review process. The CARES commission conducted public hearings and site visits in 2003, submitting recommendations to the Secretary in February 2004. The final CARES plan, announced in May 2004, included consolidating and realigning various VA facilities across different states. The final CARES plan announced in May 2004 included consolidating and realigning various VA facilities across different states, opening health care access to more veterans, and increasing the percentage of enrolled veterans by 2022. This plan also involved building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas, adding new CBOCs, spinal cord injury centers, and blind rehabilitation centers, and expanding mental health outpatient services nationwide. The CARES plan aims to reduce maintenance costs for vacant space from $3.4 billion to $750 million by 2022, reallocating funds to patient care. Critics argue that closures are being considered without assessing future long-term care and mental health facility needs. Concerns include data inconsistencies in forecasting models, insufficient focus on nursing home needs, potential privatization of healthcare, and closure of \"surplus\" hospitals. Veterans' groups are skeptical of the CARES plan, believing it focuses on closing \"surplus\" hospitals rather than building new facilities. Congress members raised concerns about lack of input in the closure of VA medical facilities. The Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 required VA to notify Congress before any facility closure, consolidation, or reorganization. Implementation issues were identified, leading to further study and stakeholder input. An Advisory Committee for CARES Business Plan Studies was established by the Secretary of VA on September 29, 2004. The Committee for CARES Business Plan Studies, consisting of representatives from various organizations, was established to consult with stakeholders during the implementation of the Secretary's CARES Decision. In 2005, VA awarded a contract to PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct studies at 18 sites, with Local Advisory Panels gathering stakeholder views and making recommendations to the Secretary in 2006. In 2006, VA announced the Secretary's decision for some of the 18 sites, with decisions pending for others. VA has started implementing projects under the CARES decisions, with 32 major capital projects in progress as of February 2007. The beneficiary travel program reimburses veterans for travel costs to VA medical facilities. Congressional acts mandate VA to pay for travel expenses or provide mileage allowances for veterans seeking care. The law authorized VA to pay travel expenses for veterans seeking vocational rehabilitation counseling, examination, treatment, or care. VA's travel reimbursement became discretionary, leading to stricter eligibility criteria in 1987. Payments were limited to specialized transportation needs and travel beyond 100 miles from a VA facility. The VA was authorized to pay for travel expenses for veterans seeking medical care beyond a 100-mile radius from the nearest VA facility. Transportation costs for transferring veterans between health care facilities were also covered, but certain expenses like privately owned vehicle travel costs exceeding public transportation costs were not authorized. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored VA travel reimbursement benefits, requiring payments for travel for health care services for all specified beneficiaries with a $3 one-way deductible to limit program costs. The law imposed a $3 one-way deductible for all travel, except for certain eligible veterans traveling by special modes of transportation. An $18-per-calendar-month cap on the deductible was imposed for veterans needing frequent VA medical care travel. Eligible veterans are reimbursed at 11 cents a mile for routine visits and 17 cents a mile for compensation and pension exams. Congress has shown interest in the rise in gasoline prices affecting travel benefits for veterans. The law imposed a deductible for travel benefits for veterans, with Congress showing interest in changing the mileage reimbursement rate. S. 1233 required the VA to reimburse veterans at the rate authorized for federal government employees. P.L. 110-110 mandated the VA to establish a suicide prevention program for veterans, including designated counselors at each VA facility. The Act mandates counselors to work with various organizations for veteran outreach and research on suicide prevention best practices.
