The current political situation arose after emergency rule was declared by President Iajuddin Ahmed due to protests and strikes by opposition parties before the January 2007 elections. The Awami League protested irregularities in the voter list leading up to the election. The National Democratic Institute (NDI) confirmed irregularities in the new Voters' List in Bangladesh in 2007, with over 93 million names, inconsistent with census data. The military-backed caretaker government plans to hold elections in 2008 after electoral reforms. Concerns exist about potential delays and the army's influence in running the country. The army in Bangladesh is currently in power and shows no signs of giving it up soon. Around 200,000 people, including politicians, have been jailed under the emergency rule. Disillusionment with traditional political parties has led to broad support for the emergency rule. There are concerns that discontent may arise if elections are delayed indefinitely. Despite political turmoil, Bangladesh's economy is expected to grow by 6% in 2008. The caretaker government is cracking down on corruption within political parties, potentially bringing about significant changes. The political landscape of Bangladesh is undergoing significant changes as charges are brought against key leaders of established parties. The caretaker government's anti-corruption efforts have led to the retirement of Hussein Muhamad Ershad and raised questions about its commitment to restoring democracy. There are concerns that the government may unintentionally create a vacuum by targeting corruption within political parties. The Election Commission in Bangladesh is implementing voter identity cards with photographs, a process expected to take a year due to high illiteracy. Political assembly restrictions persist, with hopes of lifting the state of emergency. The split in support for major parties has given Islamist parties a disproportionate voice, some with ties to violent radicals advocating for Sharia law. Islamists in Bangladesh support Sharia law. The military-backed caretaker government is focused on anti-corruption and combating radical Islamists, including executing extremist leaders. The main militant groups are Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen and JMJB, both outlawed under the previous government. Habibur Rahman Bulbuli, a leader of Khelafat Majlish, was captured in 2007 and claimed ties to Osama bin Laden. Mufti Hannan and three others were charged by police in June 2007. In June 2007, Mufti Hannan and three accomplices were charged by Bangladesh police for attempting to assassinate the British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury in 2004. The Rapid Action Battalion captured four suspected members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen with grenades and explosives near Kishoregani in July 2007. A United Nations Counter Terror Assessment Team visited Bangladesh in June 2007 to provide technical assistance recommendations. The political rivalry between the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and the Awami League (AL) continues amidst the presence of radical Islamist parties. The political environment in Bangladesh is defined by the rivalry between the National Party (BNP) and the Awami League (AL), along with the presence of radical Islamist parties. Other challenges include corruption, weak governance, human rights issues, communal conflict, environmental disasters, and poverty. The last election in 2001 saw the BNP, led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and its allies winning 41% of the votes. In the 2001 election in Bangladesh, the BNP and its allies won 41% of the votes. In the following election, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina, won 40% of the vote. The election included various parties such as JI, IOJ, and JP. The UK Parliamentary Human Rights Group expressed concerns about the fairness of the election due to voter list manipulation and political violence. Sources of instability in Bangladesh include political violence such as assassinations, grenade attacks, and bombings. Former Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and the Awami League alliance have been involved in large-scale demonstrations and threats to boycott elections. The Awami League, traditionally more secular, has reportedly signed agreements with groups like the Khelafat Majlis. In the lead-up to the January 2007 polls, the Awami League signed an agreement with the Khelafat Majlis, a pro-Taliban style Islamist group. Former General Hussein Muhamad Ershad, a potential kingmaker, joined the AL but was deemed a fugitive of justice. Observers feared political infighting and corruption leading up to the election. Observers feared that political infighting, corruption, rising Islamist extremism, and violence would erode Bangladesh's ability to govern effectively. There were concerns that the country's status as a secular and moderate state, as well as its democratic process, was at risk due to the actions of the main political parties. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Gastright warned that Bangladesh could become a base for terrorist activity if it became a failed state or fell under the influence of Islamist extremists. The House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia expressed concerns about Bangladesh's democracy, citing issues of money, cronyism, and intimidation in elections. They were initially worried about the new military-backed caretaker government's intentions but later acknowledged its responsiveness to calls for a roadmap to elections and democracy restoration. The United States values its relations with Bangladesh for various reasons including political stability, economic reform, counterterrorism, and environmental issues. The United States aims to support Bangladesh's democracy, address political violence, and provide assistance for social and economic development, environmental issues, and counterterrorism. Bangladesh has received significant international aid, with over $30 billion from foreign donors since independence in 1971. U.S. assistance includes funding for health, economic development, working conditions improvement, and disaster relief. International Military Education and Training programs strengthen Bangladesh's peacekeeping force, a top contributor to U.N. missions. The U.S. is Bangladesh's largest export destination, while India, China, and other countries are key import partners. The U.S. exports wheat, fertilizer, cotton, and medical supplies to Bangladesh. Ready-made garments and jute carpet backing are key exports to the U.S. Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 after a civil war. The country's topography is mainly low-lying alluvial plains drained by rivers. Bangladesh, a densely populated country, faces annual cyclones and flooding. Rising sea levels due to global warming could flood low-lying coastal areas. After two decades of authoritarian rule, democratic elections were held in 1991. Political struggles between the Bangladesh National Party and the Awami League, led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, have characterized Dhaka's politics. Zia is the widow of former president Ziaur Rahman, while Hasina is the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur. Hasina, daughter of Bangladeshi independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, faces political struggles with the AL and BNP parties. Both parties engage in parliamentary boycotts, strikes, and demonstrations to unseat the ruling party. The President's powers are ceremonial, but expand during caretaker governments. Elections in 2001 were deemed generally free and fair, but marred by pre-election violence. AL boycotted parliament, claiming rigged elections, while BNP published a white paper on power misuse. The BNP has accused the AL of mismanagement and corruption during their rule. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party in the former ruling coalition. Political violence has been prevalent in Bangladesh, with attacks on opposition leaders and civil society members. The political violence in Bangladesh escalated with an assassination attempt on opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, killing 22 people at a rally in Dhaka. The Awami League accused Jamaat-e-Islami and Islamiya Okiyya Jote parties of protecting radicals involved in the violence. Corruption is rampant in Bangladesh, with Transparency International ranking it among the most corrupt countries. The economy is deemed \"mostly unfree\" due to widespread corruption, including within the police force and at the Chittagong port. Bangladesh's largest port, Chittagong, handling 90% of trade, faces corruption and piracy issues. U.S. officials cite corruption and poor governance as main obstacles. Various terrorist groups like HuJi, JMJB, and JMB operate in Bangladesh. Presence of Islamist parties in the former ruling coalition government has expanded Islamist influence, creating space for extremist groups. Islami Okiyya Jote has ties to radical groups like Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) and Al Qaeda. Jamaat also has connections to Harkat ul-Jihad-i-Islami. JMB seeks Sharia law in Bangladesh and is linked to the 2005 bombings. HuJI was involved in the 2002 attack on the American Center in Calcutta. Awami League accuses Jamaat-e-Islami of ties to extremists. Sheikh Hasina criticizes the government for allowing extremist forces to operate. International extremists may be using Bangladesh as a base. Some international extremists are reportedly using Bangladeshi passports with the help of sympathetic officials. Members of Islami Okiyya Jote are linked to the reemergence of Harkat ul Jihad under the name \"Conscious Islamic People.\" The political wing of HuJi plans to enter politics as Islami Gono Andolon. The former BNP government initially denied the presence of significant terrorist elements in the country but later moved to suppress terrorist groups like JMB and JMJB. The government in Bangladesh sentenced JMB leaders to death for their involvement in bombings and the murder of judges. They aimed to replace the secular legal system with Sharia law. The government has arrested numerous militants, including senior leaders, on terrorism charges. Opposition leader Sheikh Hassina accused the government of being lenient towards militants and claimed Jamaat has 15,000 guerillas. The government in Bangladesh sentenced JMB leaders to death for their involvement in bombings and the murder of judges, aiming to replace the secular legal system with Sharia law. Opposition leader Sheikh Hassina accused the government of being lenient towards militants and claimed Jamaat has 15,000 guerillas. Foreign guests visit Bangladesh, with allegations of JMB operatives being just the tip of the iceberg in terms of Islamist militancy. Selig Harrison noted a growing Islamic fundamentalist movement linked to al-Qaeda and Pakistani intelligence agencies in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government's coalition alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami Party led to fundamentalist control over the economy, Islamist schools acting as fronts for terrorism, and rigging of elections. The State Department sees Bangladesh working to combat terrorism. The Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Richard Boucher, acknowledged Bangladesh's efforts in fighting terrorism but highlighted the need for further action. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh. In July 2006, coordinated bomb blasts in Bangladesh resulted in the deaths of approximately 200 people and injuries to 500 others. A series of bomb blasts in Bombay (Mumbai), India killed around 200 people and injured 500 on commuter trains. Indian authorities arrested individuals with ties to terrorist groups in Bangladesh and Nepal linked to Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement, while Bangladesh claimed the explosives came from India. Six suspects received training from Lashkar-e-Toiba in Pakistan. BJP President Rajnath Singh urged the Indian government to pressure Bangladesh to dismantle terrorist training centers, citing Bangladesh as a hub for Islamic fundamentalist forces. The anti-terrorism squad investigated individuals in Tripura with links to bombings in Varanasi, India, reportedly connected to HuJi in Bangladesh. Bangladesh, a densely populated country with a low per capita income, relies heavily on agriculture for employment and GDP contribution. Bangladesh's economy relies heavily on agriculture, with the major crop being rice. Industry focuses on textiles, jute manufacturing, and food processing, with ready-made garments and knitwear as important exports. Foreign exchange earnings from remittances by Bangladeshis working abroad also contribute significantly to the economy. Despite being one of the world's poorest countries, Bangladesh has made progress in recent years through economic reforms aimed at promoting budget discipline and export-led growth. Significant progress was made in reducing the budget deficit, increasing foreign reserves, and attracting new foreign investment in Bangladesh. However, bureaucratic delays and labor union resistance have hindered the implementation of economic reforms, including major privatization efforts. Crippling strikes by political parties have led to a loss of foreign investor confidence. The Bangladeshi economy is described as \"mostly unfree\" due to high levels of trade protectionism and regulation. Bangladesh has been a pioneer in micro enterprise lending programs and former Prime Minister Zia called for deeper economic integration within SAARC member states. SAARC discussed a Free Trade Agreement and granted observer status to the United States. Bangladesh faces severe flooding due to population pressure and deforestation. Improved disaster management is reported. Water sharing with India is a key environmental issue. In the early 1990s, Bangladesh and India settled water sharing issues related to the Ganges River. Bangladesh claimed increased salinity and desertification due to river water diversion. A 30-year agreement was signed in 1996, addressing these concerns. However, water management issues like hydroelectric power and arsenic contamination in drinking water remain unresolved in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government's human rights record was poor, with serious abuses including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and torture by security forces. Violations also included violence against journalists, infringement on religious freedoms, government corruption, violence against women and children, and trafficking in persons. The BNP government aligned with extremist groups targeting the Ahmadiyya community, which differs from mainstream Islam on the final prophet. The BNP government coalition partners in Bangladesh do not recognize Ahmadiyyas as Muslims and have been involved in religious violence against them and other minorities. The government has been accused of failing to prosecute attacks on journalists by BNP supporters. The elite anti-crime and anti-terrorist RAB has been responsible for numerous deaths and torture, with the government's failure to punish RAB members indicating consent for their actions. The RAB is known for torture methods such as electric drills, electric shock, and beatings, attributing deaths to crossfire. The case of Bangladesh Weekly Blitz editor Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury highlights these issues. The case of Bangladesh Weekly Blitz editor Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury illustrates how Islamist tendencies have damaged Bangladesh's reputation as a tolerant Muslim state. Choudhury faced charges for praising Jews and Christians, attempting to travel to Israel, and predicting the rise of Islamist militancy. Despite being released after 17 months in prison, the government continues to pursue the case against him, with the possibility of a death sentence. U.S. Representative Mark Kirk played a role in Choudhury's release. Relations between New Delhi and Dhaka have been strained in recent years, with accusations of Bangladesh harboring agents of Pakistan's intelligence service and separatist militants. Border incidents, including exchanges of small arms fire, continue between the two countries. Bangladesh has denied accusations of supporting militants and refused India's request for transit rights to link with its northeastern states. India-Bangladesh relations are strained due to border incidents involving small arms fire. India is constructing a fence along the 4,000 km border to curb illegal immigration and has asked Bangladesh to crack down on separatist militants. Bangladesh denies the existence of insurgent bases alleged by India. Bangladesh's strategic location between South and Southeast Asia, as well as its significant natural gas reserves, make it important to India and China for securing energy resources. Arguments in Bangladesh against exporting gas focus on the need to first secure domestic energy supply for 50 years. Bangladesh's energy needs to 2050 would require 63 trillion cubic feet of gas. Bangladesh and China signed a Defense Co-operation Agreement in December 2002."
