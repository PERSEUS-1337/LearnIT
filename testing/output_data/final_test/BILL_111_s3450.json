Reporting Mine Safety Information: Issuers required to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and operating coal or other mines must include information on violations of health or safety standards in periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The operator must report various mine safety violations, including citations, orders, flagrant violations, unwarrantable failures, and imminent danger orders under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The operator must report mine safety violations, including violations of health and safety standards, proposed assessments, and mining-related fatalities under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Additionally, they must list mines with a pattern of violations that could contribute to health or safety hazards. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, each coal or other mine operator must report imminent danger orders and written notices from the Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K. The Mine Safety and Health Administration may issue written notices to coal or other mine operators for violations of health and safety standards. This Act does not affect obligations to disclose under other laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission enforces violations of this Act. The Securities and Exchange Commission can issue rules and regulations under this Act, treating violations as if they were under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Penalties for violations will be the same. The SEC is authorized to issue necessary rules for investor protection. The Act defines key terms such as \"issuer,\" \"securities laws,\" \"coal or other mine,\" and \"operator.\" It will take effect 30 days after enactment."
