    "content": "The \"Health Services Cost Control Act\" aims to reduce healthcare costs by promoting collaboration among medical facilities to eliminate unnecessary duplication of expensive services and equipment. This includes a Technology and Services Sharing Demonstration Program to achieve a more efficient and effective healthcare delivery system. The Secretary and the Attorney General will jointly carry out a demonstration program to award grants for collaboration among medical facilities for expensive medical technology or services. The program aims to reduce costs, increase access to care, and improve quality of care. The Administrators will determine the service area for a demonstration program to preserve health services availability in proximity to communities served by participating facilities. Eligible medical facilities must submit an application to negotiate and enter into a voluntary agreement to receive a grant under the program. The Administrators will determine the service area for a demonstration program to preserve health services availability in proximity to communities served by participating facilities. Eligible medical facilities must submit an application to negotiate and enter into a voluntary agreement for the sharing of medical technology or services, including details on activities, financial arrangements, geographical area served, anticipated benefits, and any other relevant information determined appropriate. The Administrators will develop evaluation guidelines for applications submitted under the section, evaluating them based on criteria and guidelines to enhance care quality and preserve services in communities traditionally served. The grant funds awarded will be used to facilitate collaboration among entities involved in high-technology services, leading to improvements in cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, provision of unique services, reduction of duplication, cost reduction for individuals, and ensuring no harm to care provided. The grant funds awarded under subsection (a) will facilitate collaboration among entities by reimbursing expenses for specialized personnel, administrative services, support services, transportation, and instructional programs. Funds cannot be used for purchasing expensive medical technology or highly resource-intensive services. Entities applying for grants must specify the desired award amount, which will be determined by the Administrators. Geographic and size diversity will be considered in awarding grants. Agreements under this section aim to share medical technology and services among entities involved, including drugs, devices, equipment, and procedures with high costs. The demonstration program established under this section allows for shared ownership of high-cost services to avoid excess capacity in the community or region. Eligible services must have high capital or operating costs, with mobile services included. The demonstration program established under this section will last for 3 years. Grantees must submit annual reports to the Administrators on funded projects. After 42 months, a report will be submitted to Congress on the results and potential benefits of cooperative agreements in containing costs, increasing access to medical services, and improving healthcare quality. The report will include recommendations for future programs to facilitate cooperative agreements and legislation. It states that entities receiving grants under this section can enter into cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws. The term 'antitrust laws' refers to the Act approved on July 2, 1890. The Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Clayton Act, and State antitrust laws prohibit certain activities. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of appropriations totaling $2,500,000 for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1996 is granted to carry out this section, subject to Congressional Budget Act limits. SEC. 4. CERTIFICATE OF REVIEW PROCESS. The Attorney General may issue a certificate of review with a three-year term to licensed hospitals and medical facilities that enter into cooperative agreements for expensive medical technology or services. These agreements aim to reduce duplication, lower costs, increase access to care, and improve quality without affecting prices in the United States. The Attorney General may issue a certificate of review to hospitals and medical facilities for cooperative agreements on expensive medical technology or services. This certificate provides protection from antitrust actions, with a 90-day deadline for the Attorney General to respond to requests. Any person injured due to conduct under a certificate of review may bring a civil action for relief, damages, interest, and attorney's fees for non-compliance with standards. The action follows procedures similar to the Clayton Act. The exclusive standards and remedies for actions related to non-compliance with subsection (a) must be filed within two years of notice or within 4 years of the cause of action. Conduct complying with a certificate of review is presumed to comply with subsection (a) standards. If the court finds compliance with subsection (a) standards, relief may be awarded. The court shall award the cost of defending against the claim, including attorney's fees, to the hospital or medical facility. The Attorney General may file a suit to enjoin conduct threatening harm to the national interest."
