In response, Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey retaliated with tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products. India also proposed retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. goods, while China placed tariffs on over 800 U.S. agricultural and food products in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. In July and September 2018, retaliatory tariffs were imposed on over 800 U.S. food and agricultural products by five trading partners. These tariffs affected exports totaling $26.9 billion in 2017, representing 18% of global U.S. agricultural and food product exports. Various factors impact agricultural exports, including tariff rates, production, market prices, exchange rates, and economic growth. The USDA predicts a $1.9 billion decrease in total U.S. agricultural exports for FY2019. The USDA forecasts a $1.9 billion decrease in total U.S. agricultural exports for FY2019, mainly due to reduced soybean and cotton exports from retaliatory tariffs and slowing global demand. A study from Purdue University suggests that U.S. agricultural exports could decrease by $8 billion in the near future, leading to lower agricultural land prices and the reallocation of 45,000 workers. Soybean producers are expected to be most affected. The authors suggest that soybean producers will be heavily impacted by tariff retaliation, with exports potentially falling by 21% and land prices declining by about 18%. The retaliating trade partners may have targeted U.S. agricultural and food products due to the large amount exported and the availability of alternative suppliers in other exporting countries. The retaliating countries, including Canada, China, Mexico, the EU, and Japan, are responding to U.S. tariff actions by targeting agricultural and food exports. China is imposing tariffs on most of its agricultural imports from the U.S. in retaliation. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. food and agricultural products, including grains, meat, fruits, vegetables, seafood, and processed foods, totaling about $20.6 billion in imports from the United States in 2017. This action is in response to U.S. Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on over 800 products. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to halt trade tensions for 90 days, delaying U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. China committed to purchasing substantial quantities of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans. USDA reported soybean sales to China, the first since tariffs were implemented. Leading U.S. food and agricultural exports to China in 2017 are listed in Table 2 with tariff rates. In November 2018, USDA forecasted a decline in U.S. agricultural and food exports to China due to trade tensions. Canada imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products, affecting items previously duty-free under NAFTA. The affected products accounted for 10% of total U.S. exports to Canada in 2017. Despite retaliatory tariffs, U.S. agricultural and food exports to Canada are projected to increase by about $1 billion in FY2019 from $20.5 billion in FY2018. Mexico has also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, with U.S. exports subject to tariff retaliation amounting to approximately $2.5 billion in 2017, representing 13% of total U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico that year. In 2017, Mexico was the top export market for U.S. cheese and the second for U.S. pork. Despite retaliatory tariffs, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico are expected to increase by $900 million in FY2019. The EU has imposed a 25% tariff on some U.S. exports, totaling $1 billion out of $13.2 billion in total U.S. agricultural and food exports to the EU. In 2017, the EU imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. exports, affecting products like whiskey, kidney beans, and cranberry juice. Despite the tariffs, USDA projects that overall U.S. agricultural and food exports to the EU will increase to $13.4 billion in FY2019. In response to retaliatory tariffs from Turkey, USDA projected a decline in total U.S. agricultural and food exports to Turkey to $1.5 billion in FY2019, down $200 million from FY2018. Turkey imposed tariffs on various U.S. agricultural products, including tree nuts, rice, prepared foods, whiskey, and unmanufactured tobacco. India has threatened retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products in response to tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The targeted products were valued at $857 million in 2017, with almond exports to India comprising a significant portion. India plans to raise tariffs on U.S. unshelled almonds by 20%. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products, including a 50% tariff on U.S. watermelons despite minimal imports in previous years. Additionally, China has placed a 25% tariff on U.S. soybeans, impacting access to this product. Other countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey have also implemented tariffs on key U.S. exports such as pork, soybeans, sorghum, cheese, apples, cherries, seafood, ginseng, and whiskey. China imposed a 25% tariff on U.S. soybeans, reducing access to the largest U.S. export market for the crop in 2017. U.S. soybean exports to China dropped significantly in 2018, leading to lower prices and increased purchases from Brazil. The price of U.S. soybeans for export dropped due to tariffs, leading to a decline in U.S. soybean exports to China. Despite increased shipments to other markets, total U.S. soybean exports in FY2019 are projected to decrease by $800 million. The USDA projects a decline in soybean prices for the 2018/2019 marketing year, with exports to China expected to decrease due to retaliatory tariffs. U.S. sorghum exports to China are also forecasted to decline, impacting the market that has historically absorbed a significant portion of U.S. sorghum exports. Mexico and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. pork exports, affecting up to 30% of the market by value. The National Pork Producers Council estimates that exports to China are higher due to reexports from Hong Kong. Some U.S. pork products now face a 70% tariff in China, while exports to Mexico, previously duty-free under NAFTA, are now subject to a 20% tariff. U.S. pork exports to Mexico and China have declined due to new tariffs. In 2018, exports to Mexico were 9% lower than the previous year, while exports to China decreased by 13%. China is a significant market for frozen edible pork offal, with U.S. exports totaling $251 million in 2017. However, retaliatory tariffs of 50% in China and 20% in Mexico have impacted these exports. Additionally, both countries have imposed tariffs on U.S. cheese, affecting a large portion of total U.S. cheese exports. Mexico and China have imposed tariffs on U.S. cheese, with Mexico replacing zero duty with tariffs of 20% and 25%, affecting $390 million worth of U.S. cheese exports in 2017. China has applied a 25% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. cheese types, leading to a decline in cheese exports to both countries. The tariffs imposed by Mexico and China have led to a decrease in U.S. cheese exports to both countries. U.S. cheese exports to Mexico declined by 7% between July and October 2018 compared to 2017, while exports to China fell by 51% during the same period. Additionally, U.S. apple exports to Mexico and China are now subject to higher retaliatory tariffs of 20% and 40%, respectively, impacting a significant portion of total U.S. apple exports. In 2015, the U.S. apple industry saw potential growth in China and India as key markets. China imported $18 million worth of U.S. apples in 2017 with a 10% tariff, while India purchased $97 million of U.S. apples. India plans to impose a 30% retaliatory tariff on U.S. apples in 2019. China also imposed a 40% retaliatory tariff on U.S. cherries, leading to a total tariff rate of 50%. U.S. cherry exports to China increased by 68% in 2017, but the steep tariff may drive Chinese importers to seek alternative suppliers. The value of U.S. cherry exports decreased by 19% in FY2018 due to China's retaliatory tariff of 25% on seafood products. China, the leading export market for U.S. seafood since 2011, imposed tariffs on various agricultural products like American Ginseng. The impact of these tariffs on U.S. seafood competitiveness in China remains uncertain. China has imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. American Ginseng, which heavily relies on export sales. In 2017, China bought 60% of U.S. American Ginseng exports worth $22 million. This could harm the industry as China may turn to Canadian suppliers. U.S. whiskey is also facing retaliatory tariffs from multiple trade partners, including the EU. China, Turkey, Canada, and Mexico have imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. whiskey, ranging from 25% to 40%. U.S. whiskey exports to these countries totaled $742 million in 2017. Additionally, U.S. processed food exports, such as juices, candy, and soups, are also being targeted by retaliatory tariffs, with Canada's tariffs potentially impacting U.S. food manufacturers. On July 24, 2018, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced USDA's temporary actions to assist farmers in response to Canada's retaliatory tariffs on processed foods. USDA authorized up to $12 billion in financial assistance for agricultural commodities most impacted by the trade retaliation, including corn, cotton, soybeans, sorghum, wheat, hogs, and dairy. Approximately $9.6 billion would be distributed in Market Facilitation Program (MFP) payments. Approximately $9.6 billion in MFP payments will be distributed for various agricultural commodities, with soybean producers receiving the majority of direct payments. Additionally, $1.2 billion will be used to purchase excess supplies of 29 different commodities, and $200 million will be allocated for trade promotion efforts. Agricultural groups have expressed concerns about retaliatory tariffs impacting U.S. farm income from exports. Farm groups are worried about losing export sales and market access due to retaliatory tariffs and new trade deals. The EU-Canada and EU-Mexico free trade agreements could increase competition for U.S. agricultural exports in Mexico and Canada. The American Soybean Association (ASA) is disappointed with the escalating trade tensions. The ASA, NPPC, and U.S. Dairy Export Council express concerns over retaliatory tariffs from China and Mexico, warning of potential economic losses for U.S. farmers. Farmers for Free Trade advocates against tariffs that harm agriculture and rural communities, running ads to raise awareness about the impact of trade policies. President Trump and his Administration have engaged with officials from retaliating markets. The USDA's trade aid package, a short-term effort by the Trump Administration to ease retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, has been met with criticism from producer groups. Many feel that the $12 billion plan falls short of compensating growers for lost export sales. The American Farm Bureau Federation stated that while the package provides some relief, it may only help farmers for a few months. Farmer and rancher organizations are urging the Administration to resolve trade concerns that have led to these retaliatory tariffs. Rancher organizations are urging the Administration to address trade concerns causing tariff retaliation on U.S. agriculture. Many farmers and ranchers face negative effects like lower prices and lost market opportunities. The USDA's trade aid package is criticized for not addressing potential longer-term consequences, such as lower commodity prices and reduced farm income. Agriculture industry stakeholders warn that the effects of retaliatory tariffs could be long-lasting due to the uncertainty created. The retaliatory tariffs have created uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and questioned the reliability of the U.S. as a trading partner. Proposed legislation aimed to provide assistance to farmers affected by reduced exports due to retaliatory tariffs. 301 tariffs on U.S. imports allocated to programs supporting agricultural sales in domestic and export markets. Members of Congress urged to engage Administration for actions to boost agricultural sales and enhance economic vitality of U.S. food and agricultural interests."
