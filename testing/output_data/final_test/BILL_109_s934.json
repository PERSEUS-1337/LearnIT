The Chair of the Senate Budget Committee, based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, has final approval in the Senate. Bills introduced by the Chairs of the Senate Committees on Finance and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions are referred to their respective committees. If a committee does not report the bill within 60 days, it is automatically discharged and placed on the legislative calendar. The Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader bills are placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business.
