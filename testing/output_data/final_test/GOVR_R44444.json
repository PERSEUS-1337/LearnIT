    "content": "Over the past decade, Congress has increased efforts to engage with foreign military and security forces, leading to concerns about the lack of a clear strategy, legal framework, coordination between State Department and DOD, and program effectiveness. The evolving framework for providing assistance has created a complex system of authorities and arrangements under Title 22 of the U.S. Code. After the attacks on 9/11, Congress has increasingly provided DOD with the means to provide military assistance under its own authority and funding, leading to a rise in U.S. assistance to foreign forces under DOD budgets. U.S. assistance to foreign forces has increased under DOD budgets, raising questions about its effectiveness and the legal framework. Current efforts involve various activities like arms transfers, training, counterterrorism programs, and education. The Obama Administration argues that these efforts are cost-effective in the long run, but some policymakers doubt the justification for billions spent on these programs and suggest reforms for better results. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to foreign military and security forces, focusing on State Department and DOD roles, shared responsibility, historical evolution, current status, authorities, and oversight questions. Congress may raise questions on assessing effectiveness, modifying the framework, resource sufficiency, and improving oversight and transparency. U.S. assistance to foreign military and security forces involves shared responsibility between the State Department and DOD, serving multiple purposes with no standard terminology. Congressional oversight and public transparency could be improved in this area. The U.S. government shares responsibility for security assistance efforts, involving agencies like State Department, DOD, USAID, DOE, DHS, Justice, Treasury, and the intelligence community. State Department handles foreign relations, while DOD defends against foreign threats. This shared responsibility benefits both the U.S. and foreign governments. The United States recognizes the need to act alone or with allies to combat threats. Policymakers emphasize the importance of cultivating foreign allies to enhance long-term security. The State Department and DOD work together to provide allies with necessary equipment and training to counter mutual enemies. This requires military expertise and diplomatic skills to maintain international relations and balance of power. In recent years, concerns have been raised about a growing imbalance between the State Department and the Department of Defense (DOD) in U.S. foreign policy. Some attribute this to the DOD's increasing role and resources, leading to a \"militarization\" of foreign policy. Others argue that the State Department's limited personnel and resources have forced the DOD to seek its own authorities and resources. Foreign military and security assistance serves multiple purposes for the U.S. government and recipient governments, fostering international stability and enhancing U.S. security by spreading defense burdens and deterring aggression. It can also serve as a diplomatic asset, cultivating goodwill and persuading foreign governments to support actions beneficial to U.S. and allied interests. The Department of Defense uses foreign military and security assistance to build institutional ties with foreign militaries, which can be beneficial in future crises and conflicts. This assistance is seen as a key component of defense planning and a way to decrease DOD budgets in the long run. Recipient countries may benefit from the aid in deterring aggression or battling domestic foes, but it can also upset the political balance within a country from a U.S. perspective. The potential benefits of U.S. military assistance to foreign countries may be overshadowed by the risk of upsetting political balance, enabling powerful militaries to influence or suppress democratic movements, and diverting funds from economic development. Without careful monitoring, unintended consequences may impact U.S. interests and relations with recipient countries and the surrounding region. The lack of standardized terminology complicates discussions on military and security assistance. The terms \"security assistance\" and \"security cooperation\" are commonly used for providing weapons, equipment, supplies, and training to foreign military and security forces. These terms are not clearly defined by the State Department, but are frequently used in policy documents and budget justifications. The State Department's security assistance portfolio includes six budget accounts under \"International Security Assistance,\" administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) through the 1961 FAA and AECA programs. This encompasses defense articles, military training, and other related services provided to foreign military and security forces. The State Department's security assistance includes defense articles, military training, and other services for foreign defense establishments to promote U.S. security interests and build allied military capabilities. The legal framework for assistance to foreign militaries originates from congressional documents and executive orders since the late 1940s, defining roles of the Department of State and DOD. The Secretary of State has a lead oversight role, with DOD administering many programs. The State Department has had a significant role in overseeing security assistance programs, evolving over time. Initially focused on helping foreign governments defend against Soviet threats, the oversight was vested in the Secretary of State. The oversight of funds authorized under various acts was initially vested in the Secretary of State, with White House officials and U.S. ambassadors also involved. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 solidified the Secretary of State's leadership role in foreign assistance, including military aid. Congress later expanded this responsibility to include all military assistance, with the Secretary of Defense tasked with administering military aid programs. The President delegated foreign assistance authority to the Secretary of State under the 1961 FAA, with oversight by the State Department and DOD. Congress granted DOD authority in Title 10 for various programs like counternarcotics and humanitarian aid in the 1980s. Nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs were added later. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. government assistance to foreign militaries has been used to counter new threats, especially after 9/11. DOD has received new authorities for crisis and wartime actions, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. Recent statutes have been added for U.S. assistance in African conflicts. DISAM lists around 80 Title 10 security cooperation programs, while RAND identifies 106 core statutes. These Title 10 authorities are not subject to 1961 FAA and AECA conditions. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. government assistance to foreign militaries has been used to counter new threats, especially after 9/11. DOD has received new authorities for crisis and wartime actions, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress provided several authorities for DOD to support partners in those efforts, including broad coalition assistance and support for bilateral security assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The growth of Title 10 security cooperation authorities has raised questions about the division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. About 50 of the 80 security cooperation statutes are not subject to 1961 FAA and AECA conditions. The proliferation of Title 10 authorities has raised concerns about the division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. Some analysts argue that this has blurred the clarity of U.S. programs and policies. There are questions about the extent of State Department oversight over noncombat aid authorized by Title 10 and NDAAs. The interdepartmental coordination process for integrating economic and military aid has evolved since the 1950s, with five levels of collaboration in place as of March 1972. The collaboration between the State Department and DOD involves five levels of coordination, leading to final recommendations for the President. DOD engages in noncombat activities abroad, sometimes supporting State Department programs. The State Department oversees DOD implementation of military aid programs funded through its budget, while DOD also conducts programs under its own authorities. The White House, State Department, and other agencies work together to plan and implement military aid programs. DOD plays a key role in traditional military assistance programs like Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Financing, and International Military Education and Training. Oversight is provided by the State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. The Defense Department plays a key role in military aid programs such as Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Financing, and International Military Education and Training. These programs are overseen by the State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and are administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Security Cooperation Organization in each U.S. embassy is responsible for these programs, with support from civilian agencies like the State Department and Energy Department for initiatives such as counterproliferation and nonproliferation efforts. The Defense Department supports State Department programs for peacekeeping operations, disaster relief, and humanitarian assistance. DOD provides food, shelter, supplies, and medical evacuations under the direction of USAID Administrator. Additionally, DOD conducts activities for purposes like strengthening military relations and legitimizing presence in foreign areas. USAID works with DOD to provide assistance to foreign military and security forces, as well as humanitarian relief. DOD activities require approval from the Secretary of State. The State Department collaborates with DOD on security cooperation programs for foreign forces, utilizing Title 10 and Title 22 resources. COCOMs plan and implement Title 10 activities in alignment with Theater Security Cooperation Strategic Plans, requiring approval from U.S. Embassy SCOs and Chief of Mission. Special cooperative arrangements were initiated in 2005 under the \"Section 1206\" Global Train and Equip authority. The Obama Administration issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23) in April 2013, mandating an overhaul of U.S. security sector assistance policy. This included establishing a new interagency framework for planning, implementing, assessing, and overseeing security sector assistance (SSA) to foreign governments and international organizations. The directive aimed to ensure consistency with broader national security goals, policy coherence, interagency collaboration, comprehensive strategies, and better use of resources. The implementation of PPD-23 is ongoing, with the State Department and DOD sharing responsibility for security assistance in various ways based on statutory authority and executive directives. This section outlines how the two departments collaborate on State Department security assistance programs and Title 10 authority programs, focusing on building partnership capacity through training and equipping foreign military. The State Department and DOD collaborate on security assistance programs, including training and equipping foreign military forces. Programs are authorized under the 1961 FAA and the AECA, with DSCA administering State Department programs. Funding comes from various accounts like INCLE and NADR, with support provided by DSCA, COCOMs, and military services. The State Department and DOD collaborate on security assistance programs funded through foreign operations appropriations. DSCA administers State Department programs, with support from COCOMs and military services. Program descriptions and funding amounts are provided annually in the State Department's congressional budget justification. Many programs are subject to conditions and exclusions, with DOD providing direct or indirect support. State Department input into DOD activities under Title 10 security cooperation authorities varies widely, with about 50 authorities requiring Secretary of State's concurrence. Programs not needing concurrence may still involve State Department input through various coordination mechanisms. DOD activities abroad may also be subject to \"Chief of Mission\" authority, requiring approval from the ambassador at the relevant U.S. embassy. Military personnel involved in DOD activities may also be under COM authority. Military personnel involved in DOD activities abroad may be subject to COM authority, with those under a GCC not being subject to COM authority by law. Table 3 provides a quick reference to selected Title 10 authorities, detailed in Appendixes E through J, including State Department-DOD joint authorities. State Department-DOD joint or \"hybrid\" authorities, authorized by Congress in annual NDAAs, present dilemmas for policymakers. These include assessing effectiveness, modifying statutory framework, reconciling institutional roles and resources, and providing transparency for oversight. These issues have been ongoing for over sixty years, evolving with the growth of security assistance and cooperation since 9/11. In the post-Cold War era, security assistance faces new challenges from transnational terrorist groups, requiring rapid organizational response and flexible funding. Analysts suggest new approaches may be beneficial, but obstacles like organizational prerogatives and funding limitations persist. The effectiveness of military and security assistance remains a long-standing question. Recent disappointments with training and equipping military forces have led to skepticism about security assistance effectiveness. However, success in building counterterrorism capacity in the Philippines shows that carefully designed efforts can be successful. Studies point to various factors influencing the success of large-scale \"train and equip\" programs. Some analysts suggest that security assistance activities can have collateral benefits beyond building partner capacity, such as building goodwill and improving relations. A recent report found varying success in 20 security cooperation programs aimed at building partner capacity, with the most successful programs focusing on building alliances and institutional linkages. Security assistance programs aimed at building international participation in military coalitions were effective but placed operational burdens on U.S. forces. Programs to enable U.S. forces to withdraw by transferring responsibility to domestic security forces were least effective. Programs addressing strategic purposes had mixed success, including managing regional security challenges and mitigating conflict. Effectiveness of security assistance efforts correlates with recipient country characteristics and level of political, economic, and military factors. The effectiveness of building partner capacity efforts depends on recipient country characteristics and commitment levels. Success is seen in well-governed, economically stable countries that can efficiently use provided funds and align with U.S. interests. Specific objectives aligned with partner interests and tailored efforts to partner capabilities and absorptive capacity enhance success. Ministerial capacity is also crucial for effective outcomes. The report highlighted the importance of ministerial capacity in defense institution building and its impact on absorptive capacity. It also emphasized the synergy between relationship building and capacity building in partner countries. An academic study in 2012 analyzed U.S. security assistance to Greece, Vietnam, and Lebanon, finding that success depended on deep involvement in partner state military affairs without direct combat, while external actors played a diminishing role. Counterterrorism efforts showed mixed results with no clear correlation between U.S. security assistance and reduced terrorism levels, highlighting nonmilitary factors influencing terrorism. The overview highlighted nonmilitary factors influencing terrorism levels, such as government discrimination against minority groups, independent judiciary, and social welfare spending. DOD and State Department have assessment mechanisms for some programs, but there is no standardized government-wide process yet. Examples include DOD Section 1206 assessment methodology and State Department's metrics for the Global Peace Operations Initiative. Efforts are being made under PPD-23 to develop evaluation tools. The Administration is leading an effort to develop evaluation and assessment tools for security assistance effectiveness. Congress may consider examining existing evaluation tools, conducting broader assessments of interagency efforts, and ensuring tools meet industry standards. Another approach would be to determine appropriate criteria for success or failure in security assistance. Some analysts debate the criteria for evaluating security assistance programs, suggesting assessments should consider intermediate goals and budget prioritization. Successful programs are seen in developed countries, but the US has focused on less-developed countries since 2006, especially in combating terrorism. Some analysts debate the criteria for evaluating security assistance programs, suggesting assessments should consider intermediate goals and budget prioritization. Concerns about the current State Department-DOD relationship governing security assistance center on the complexity of integrating economic/development and security assistance programs. The expansion of DOD authority has raised questions on reconciling foreign policy concerns with urgent security needs. Some analysts are concerned that the expansion of DOD authority has hindered the State Department's oversight responsibility of security assistance, leading to a perception of DOD acting independently. This has raised questions about the militarization of foreign policy and the potential negative impact on long-term U.S. interests. Some analysts and practitioners suggest rebalancing the State Department-DOD division of labor to strengthen State Department oversight of DOD security cooperation. This could involve streamlining cooperation modes, expanding State Department oversight resources, and reforming the statutory framework. Policymakers debate DOD's role in enhancing U.S. national security through security assistance activities. The current structure of authorities and division of responsibilities constrain DOD's ability to enhance U.S. national security through security cooperation with foreign militaries. Analysts and practitioners argue that the State Department lacks the capacity to oversee necessary security cooperation activities, and existing authorities fall short of meeting national security needs. Congress may need to reform the current framework to address these concerns. Some argue for reforming the current Title 10 security cooperation framework to address perceived problems with State Department oversight. Policymakers differ on how to divide responsibilities between State and DOD, with some advocating for State Department to have authority over providing defense assistance to foreign forces. Some policymakers advocate for State Department authority over defense assistance to foreign forces, arguing that FMF, IMET, and PKO provide sufficient authority for security cooperation programs. Others believe Title 10 assistance serves different purposes than traditional foreign assistance under Title 22, with State Department assistance promoting U.S. relations and interests in foreign countries, while DOD assistance responds to needs identified by the U.S. government. Proponents recognize the need for modifications to expand the use of Title 22 authority for DOD security cooperation. Concerns exist regarding the limitations of FMF funds, which are often used for diplomatic purposes rather than what DOD deems most appropriate. FMF is primarily used for bilateral programs and may not be suitable for multilateral programs. Some analysts question if Title 22 authorities can provide the necessary flexibility for quick responses, as DOD funds may not be suitable for State Department programs. Acquisition and delivery speed depend on program priority, and processing times can be slower than desired even for DOD authorities meant to address emerging threats. Some analysts question the control and appropriation of DOD funds for State Department security cooperation activities due to budgetary constraints. There are suggestions to transfer DOD funds to State Department security assistance accounts for activities under State Department authority, citing precedents for funding transfers between the two agencies. Some policymakers argue that DOD appropriations should only fund activities vital to its mission, amidst budget constraints. A \"joint formulation\" mechanism between DOD and State Department could enhance State Department control over Title 10 security cooperation activities. Two statutes require joint formulation of assistance programs, with DOD leading Section 1206/10 U.S.C. 2282 and State Department leading the GSCF program development. The GSCF program development is led by the State Department, with proposals originating from the State Department and DOD offices in Washington, DC. State Department oversight could be enhanced by extending the joint formulation concept to a broader spectrum of security cooperation missions. DOD described the Section 1206 joint formulation process as the \"gold standard\" for interagency planning and cooperation. The GSCF authority was considered the vanguard of a new mode of State-DOD collaboration in 2011. The GSCF authority, a State-DOD collaboration model, has faced varying opinions on its effectiveness. Some view it as overly complex, while others believe recent programs have been developed efficiently. Analysts suggest that the joint formulation model reduces interagency tensions. There are calls for reforming Title 10 security cooperation legislation to simplify existing processes. Reforming Title 10 security cooperation legislation is recommended to simplify existing processes and fill gaps. Efforts are underway to consolidate authorities and improve interagency collaboration. The goal is to streamline the complex legal and bureaucratic regime for more effective planning. Efforts are underway to reform Title 10 security cooperation legislation to simplify processes and fill gaps in the existing framework. The goal is to streamline the complex legal and bureaucratic regime for more effective planning, including navigating institutional arrangements and securing funds for security cooperation programs. Efforts to reform Title 10 security cooperation legislation aim to simplify processes and fill gaps in the existing framework. Proposals for DOD statutory reform include consolidating existing statutes, expanding authorities, and creating umbrella authorities in various areas such as counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and humanitarian assistance. Some analysts suggest consolidating and expanding DOD security cooperation authorities into a comprehensive Title 10 authority. Some analysts propose consolidating and expanding DOD security cooperation authorities under a comprehensive Title 10 authority. Concerns include potential duplication of existing Title 22 authorities and the strain on monitoring resources. Reform proposals vary widely, from revoking DOD security assistance authorities to creating a new, all-encompassing Title 10 authority. A new, comprehensive Title 10 authority is being proposed to encompass existing authorities and potentially reduce State Department oversight. Reform proposals aim to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and lower costs of programs, but there are concerns about unintended consequences and budgetary impacts. The growth of Title 10 security cooperation authorities responds to evolving perceptions of DOD roles and missions, with unintended budgetary consequences and complications for interagency and Congressional oversight. DOD's shift in concept towards stability operations as a core military mission has not been accompanied by increased personnel and funding for the State Department and DOD to fulfill their respective roles. The core U.S. military mission is now given priority comparable to combat operations, with a focus on stability operations tasks abroad. The Department of Defense has made institutional and policy changes to embrace noncombat missions, including extending the mission of building partner capacity in foreign military forces to general purpose forces. Former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring indigenous security forces as a key mission for the armed forces. The State Department supported the growing DOD security assistance authority, with concerns emerging about appropriate roles and resources. The massive increase in DOD security assistance funding and activities, along with DOD's desire for global maritime security authority, raised concerns about the State Department's capacity to exercise its FAA Section 622(c). The State Department and DOD may lack personnel for oversight functions. Concerns exist about resources for defense analysts as troops are reduced and budgets tightened. Some prioritize combat capability over security cooperation, while others argue it will reduce personnel and funding. Congress may need to consider additional resources for State Department and DOD to handle increased security cooperation responsibilities. Congress may need to consider additional funding for the State Department and DOD to hire, train, and retain qualified personnel for oversight functions related to security cooperation activities. This includes assessing the use of General Purpose Forces (GPF) versus Special Operations Forces (SOF) for training, advising, and mentoring foreign military and security forces. The expansion of DOD activities has raised concerns about insufficient reporting on security assistance funding. DOD has not provided a comprehensive figure for its security cooperation activities, prompting calls for improved oversight and reporting mechanisms. Some analysts see gaps in State Department reporting on security assistance and cooperation activities. The State Department and DOD report separately to Congress, with varying requirements. The State Department provides program descriptions and data for aid recipients in its Congressional Budget Justification, but regional program information is not broken down by country, hindering a full account of assistance to each country. Congressional notifications and reports offer detailed information required by legislation. The State Department and DOD issue a joint annual report on Foreign Military Training and DOD Engagement Activities, covering security assistance training programs funded under various authorities. The report provides detailed information on State Department and DOD training programs, including individual attendance levels. Congressional notifications and reports offer additional detailed information required by legislation. Most programs are documented down to individual attendance levels, but DOD lacks a public document like the State Department's CBJ for security cooperation programs by country. Congress relies on reports and CNs for information on DOD programs and spending, with reporting requirements outlined in the NDAA. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs is responsible for posting required reports on a publicly accessible website. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs has posted congressionally required reports on its website, but they are scattered among other publications. Additional information is available on open.defense.com. Congress receives detailed spending information for some DOD authorities through NDAA-required CNs, which are not available online. Congress may need to assess reporting practices for security assistance to enhance oversight of bilateral relations. Some argue for more transparency, while others express concerns about accountability. Some argue for greater transparency in DOD assistance to improve accountability, while others fear it may harm U.S. relations with foreign entities. Congress faces challenges in maximizing security assistance benefits and oversight. Statutory reform is seen as crucial for enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in security assistance. Advocates propose various options to improve security assistance efficiency and effectiveness. Congress may consider non-statutory fixes, such as Administration measures for interagency cooperation. Key questions for inquiry include the need for changes to the statutory framework in response to the current threat environment, the potential of non-statutory changes to address bottlenecks, the benefits of integrating security assistance with other types of aid, and ways to enhance oversight of security assistance programs. Appendix A discusses definitions for military assistance, security assistance, security cooperation, security sector assistance, security force assistance, and foreign assistance. \"Military Assistance\" is a term used in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for aid to foreign security forces, including defense articles, services, education, and training. The term is not specifically defined, but it likely refers to U.S. support for foreign militaries. The term \"military assistance\" may have evolved to encompass assistance to foreign security forces, including police. \"Security assistance\" is now commonly used for aid to foreign military and security forces, with different definitions by the Department of Defense and State Department. The State Department's security assistance portfolio includes six budget accounts under \"International Security Assistance.\" The State Department's security assistance portfolio includes Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Counternarcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), International Military Education and Training (IMET), Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, and Related Programs (NADR), Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), and the Special Defense Acquisition Fund. DOD defines security assistance as programs authorized by the 1961 FAA and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 that are administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). This includes Foreign Military Sales (FMS), equipment leases, and provision of excess U.S. defense articles. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses the term \"Security Cooperation\" to encompass its noncombat activities and interactions with foreign defense establishments, including providing defense articles and services, humanitarian assistance, exercises, and military-to-military contacts. Despite the formal definition, DOD personnel often use the term \"security assistance\" to include Title 10 assistance and activities. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses the term \"Security Cooperation\" to encompass its noncombat activities and interactions with foreign defense establishments, including providing defense articles and services, humanitarian assistance, exercises, and military-to-military contacts. DOD personnel often use the term \"security assistance\" to include Title 10 assistance and activities, such as the Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA) responsible for implementing Navy assistance. Congressional documents, like Section 1211 of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, refer to these authorities as security assistance. The Obama Administration uses the term \"Security Sector Assistance\" to cover assistance provided by all U.S. government agencies to foreign defense and law enforcement forces. The term \"Security Cooperation\" encompasses State Department and DOD security assistance programs, as well as activities of other agencies. It is closely linked to \"Security Sector Reform\" and \"Security Force Assistance,\" which aim to improve safety, security, and justice in foreign countries through various programs and activities. The DOD contributes to U.S. government efforts to strengthen and reform foreign security forces. Security Force Assistance (SFA) is conducted primarily to assist host countries defend against threats to stability, including internal and transnational threats. SFA may also help defend against external threats, contribute to coalition operations, or advise another country's security forces. SFA does not involve activities with other sectors of a foreign government or population. The question of whether DOD Title 10 security cooperation programs constitute foreign assistance has legal, policy, and practical implications. In the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, military assistance is considered a subset of foreign assistance. The U.S. Army Operational Law Handbook discusses fiscal law limitations on using DOD funds for assisting foreign forces, considering military supplies and training as foreign assistance. DOD avoids labeling programs to support foreign security forces under Title 10 as foreign assistance, instead using the term \"foreign assistance or security assistance related.\" The legislative framework for security assistance has its roots in post-World War II military efforts. The legislative framework for security assistance and cooperation originated from post-World War II military assistance statutes and programs. The Greek-Turkish Aid Act of 1947 marked the beginning of the Secretary of State's primary role in providing security assistance, delegating authority to provide economic and military aid to the Secretary of State. President Truman tied U.S. national security to that of other free peoples in a world of peace. The Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 established the current security assistance legal framework, separating foreign military assistance from the DOD budget and outlining the division of responsibility between the State Department and DOD. The Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 established guidelines for the division of responsibility between the State Department and DOD for military assistance. Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson emphasized the need for transparency in evaluating foreign military assistance costs. The Senate committees recommended that primary authority for the foreign assistance program be with the President and the Secretary of State, with DOD's involvement in policy-making due to the program's military nature. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 shifted responsibility for foreign assistance to the White House, providing military, economic, and technical aid to friendly countries to maintain security and promote US foreign policy. President Truman charged the Secretary of State with directing the MDAA program to increase national security. Section 501 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 authorized the President to appoint a Director for Mutual Security in the Executive Office of the President, responsible for supervising and directing the assistance program to ensure effective integration and administration for building the defensive strength of free nations. Section 503 outlined the Director's role in military assistance, while Section 506(a) listed the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities for administering military assistance and related technical advice. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 authorized the President to appoint a Director for Mutual Security responsible for supervising and directing the assistance program. The State Department was expected to exercise leadership, guidance, and control over all elements of foreign policy, subject to Presidential determination. The Mutual Security Act of 1954 shifted authority for foreign assistance to the President, with the Secretary of Defense overseeing military assistance. President Eisenhower delegated this responsibility to the Secretary of Defense, with coordination by the Foreign Operations Administration Director. In mid-1955, President Eisenhower transferred responsibility for foreign assistance from the White House to the Secretary of State, reestablishing the Secretary of State's authority over foreign assistance through E.O. 10610 of May 1955. The Secretary of Defense was given authority for military assistance, subject to coordination by the Secretary of State. In 1955, President Eisenhower transferred foreign assistance responsibility to the Secretary of State through E.O. 10610. The Draper Committee recommended in 1959 that military assistance be funded in the DOD budget to strengthen coordination with the Department of State. The Draper Committee recommended funding military assistance programs in the DOD budget to ensure coordination with the State Department, emphasizing the need for an effective working relationship between the two departments. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (1961 FAA) granted the Secretary of State authority over military assistance, echoing provisions of the 1951 Mutual Security Act. The Act delegated oversight responsibility to the Department of Defense for planning and execution within policy guidance from the National Security Council and Department of State. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 granted the Secretary of State authority over military assistance, with oversight responsibility delegated to the Department of Defense. The division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense has been modified over time through executive orders. President Kennedy delegated most presidential authority for military assistance to the Secretary of Defense, while President Carter reserved Section 503(a) authority to the President. Congress explicitly provided the Secretary of State with certain authorizations. Congress granted the Secretary of State oversight responsibility for military assistance under the 1961 FAA, with the responsibility for determining military assistance programs for countries. The intention was to effectively integrate these programs at home and abroad to serve the best interests of U.S. foreign policy. During the 1960s and 1970s, the 1961 FAA and related State Department accounts became the primary vehicle for U.S. military assistance, with significant aid provided for the Vietnam War effort. Congress later expanded Secretary of State oversight by amending the 1961 FAA to remove restrictions on supervision and direction. Congress expanded the Secretary of State's oversight responsibility for all military assistance, regardless of authority or budget. Initially delegated to the U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, the responsibility was later divided between two State Department officials before being re-delegated to State's Director for supervision and general direction of military assistance programs. In 1963, the Secretary of Defense divided implementation responsibilities among several DOD positions. In 1971, the Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) was created to administer programs. Congress has amended the 1961 FAA multiple times to incorporate additional security assistance authority. Expansion of security assistance authority included new sources of Title 22 and Title 10 (as well as Title 50) assistance laws enacted by Congress. Key authorities added over the years include International Narcotics Control, International Military Education and Training, Peacekeeping Operations, Antiterrorism Assistance, and Nonproliferation and Export Control Assistance. Additional security assistance authority was also provided through other laws. The AECA, a new Title 22 authority added in 1968, provided cash arms sales authority through FMS program and assistance in purchasing arms through FMF credit and grant authority. AECA overlaps with 1961 FAA security assistance provisions and vests responsibility in the Secretary of State for oversight. Congress legislated separate but related authorities for nonproliferation under Titles 22, 10, and 50. The division of responsibility for security assistance between the Secretaries of State and Defense has become more complex over the years due to new authorities added by Congress. Title 22 legislation generally grants security assistance authority to the President, who delegates most authority to the Secretaries of State and Defense through executive orders. E.O. 12163, issued by President Carter in 1979, delegates presidential authority for security assistance contained in the 1961 FAA and other acts. The division of responsibility for security assistance between the Secretaries of State and Defense is supplemented by various executive orders, delegating authority for foreign military sales and financing. Additional authorities for security assistance added post-1961 are delegated to the Secretary of State. The division of responsibility for security assistance between the Secretaries of State and Defense is supplemented by various executive orders. For example, E.O. 12163 delegates the President's authority for counternarcotics to the Secretary of Defense, but the Secretary of State also plays a coordinating role. Additionally, the 1961 FAA charges the Secretary of State with overseeing all counternarcotics efforts. Beginning in the 1980s, Congress expanded the statutory framework to authorize the Department of Defense (DOD) to directly assist foreign military and security forces in combating illicit narcotics production and trafficking. Unlike Title 22 provisions, which grant assistance authority to the President, most National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) and Title 10 security cooperation authorities are assigned to the Secretary of Defense. These authorities have enabled the use of military assets to curb narcotics production abroad and prevent exports to the United States. Post 9/11, Congress has approved additional Title 10 statutes in response to perceived threats. Post 9/11, Congress approved new Title 10 statutes to provide DOD with flexible tools to address the changing international security environment. These statutes allow DOD to build foreign forces' capacity to work with the US to deter and counter threats, especially from terrorists and violent groups. Additionally, Title 22 Department of State statutes are detailed in Appendix C. The curr_chunk provides information on Title 22, Department of State statutes related to security assistance programs such as Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Financing, and International Military Education and Training. These programs are administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency and include excess defense articles program, equipment leasing program, and Special Defense Acquisition Fund. Other State Department authorities and programs discussed include drawdown authorities, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, Peacekeeping Operations, and Special Authorities. The DOD supports State Department programs such as Excess Defense Articles transfers, which involve the President transferring excess defense equipment for military assistance, narcotics control, or other approved activities. The equipment must come from DOD existing stocks, and transfers must not impact military readiness or national technology and industrial base. Grant transfers are preferred over sales. Transfers on a grant basis are preferred over sales, taking into account potential proceeds and foreign policy benefits.
