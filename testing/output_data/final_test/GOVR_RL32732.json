    "content": "In FY2002, Congress created the Health Services Improvement Fund to collect increases in pharmacy co-payments. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 granted VA the authority to consolidate the fund with MCCF and recover copayments for outpatient medications. The Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act provided VA authority to collect long-term care copayments for extended care services. The Compensation and Pension Living Expenses Program, established by the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992, provides monthly pension reductions for veterans without spouses or children. The Compensated Work Therapy Program, created by the Veterans' Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976, offers rehabilitative services through goods and services produced by patients in VA healthcare facilities. After the third month of a veteran's admission for nursing home care, those with a spouse or child may see their monthly pension reduced to $90. The difference is used for the operation of VA medical facilities through the Parking Program, which funds construction and acquisition of parking garages. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allows collections from the Parking Program to be used for medical services. The Sale of Assets fund supports construction, alteration, and acquisition of nursing home facilities. The revolving fund supports the construction and acquisition of nursing home facilities through collections from real property transfers. It also funds medical services for veterans and eligible beneficiaries in VA medical centers, outpatient clinics, and contract hospitals. Additionally, funds are used for training medical personnel and supporting medical programs. The account funds medical administration, facilities maintenance, and prosthetic research for VA's health care system. It covers costs for operation, utilities, engineering, research, and property transactions. The VA research program receives funds from various sources including the Department of Defense, NIH grants, and private sources. Medical research supports basic and clinical studies to improve disease prevention and care. The prosthetic research program develops aids for disabled veterans. Health services research focuses on improving healthcare delivery for veterans. Medical Administration funds operation costs for medical centers and information technology. The VA funds medical information technology, infrastructure maintenance, and major construction projects for VHA facilities. This includes patient records, computer equipment, facility operations, and capital projects costing $7 million or more. The VA funds major construction projects for VHA facilities, including new hospitals or nursing homes, minor projects costing $500,000 to $7 million, and grants for state extended care facilities. Grants may cover up to 65% of the total project cost."
