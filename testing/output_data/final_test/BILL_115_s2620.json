    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Cyber Joint Duty Program Act of 2018\" and includes definitions for various terms. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"cyber position,\" \"Director,\" \"employee,\" and \"joint cyber position.\" These definitions clarify the meanings of these terms within the context of the Act. A rotational cyber position is a joint cyber position filled as part of rotational service under section 4, requiring experience in information technology, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related functions across multiple agencies. SEC. 3. JOINT CYBER POSITIONS. The Director, in consultation with agency heads, develops a list of joint cyber positions. Agency heads can designate rotational cyber positions. An updated list is distributed annually, including position details. Competitive appointments are made by agency heads. The head of an agency must appoint joint cyber positions in an open and competitive manner, following merit system principles. The Director has the authority to waive these requirements. SEC. 4. ROTATIONAL SERVICE. An employee in a cyber position can apply for a rotational cyber position within the same agency or a different one. The appointment for a rotational cyber position is typically 1 to 3 years, but the Chief Human Capital Officer can waive this limitation. Service in a rotational cyber position in a different agency constitutes a nonreimbursable detail for the employee. An employee in a rotational cyber position can return to their prior position in the agency employing them after the service period. Personnel law rights are maintained when working in a rotational cyber position in a different agency. The Director must provide an annual report to specific committees on the program's effectiveness, including statistics on joint and rotational cyber positions in different agencies."
