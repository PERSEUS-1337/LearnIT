    "content": "The Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London allowed the use of eminent domain to transfer private property for economic development. The Court ruled 5-4 that the City's redevelopment plan met the public use requirement, despite the private nature of the transferees. The decision was based on the City's good-faith purpose to reverse economic decline. The Kelo v. City of New London decision allowed eminent domain for economic development, sparking debate on public use. It highlighted private-to-private condemnation for tax base growth and job creation, leading to public outcry and media attention. Following the controversial Kelo v. City of New London decision, there was a widespread public outcry and media coverage. Many state legislatures introduced bills to limit the use of eminent domain, while Congress also proposed bills to discourage its use for economic development. The main focus of this report is on H.R. 4128, known as the Private Property Protection Act of 2005, which addresses the concerns raised by the Kelo decision. The Kelo bill in Congress, H.R. 4128, imposes restrictions on eminent domain for federal money grants. It was passed by the House 376-38 on November 3, 2005. Senator Bond introduced a similar amendment to H.R. 3058, which was enacted on November 30, 2005. Other bills and resolutions also responded to the Kelo decision. The Kelo bill in Congress, H.R. 4128, imposes restrictions on eminent domain for federal money grants. Other bills and resolutions responding to the Kelo decision include S. 1313, S. 1704, S. 1883, S. 1895, H.J.Res. 60, H.Res. 340, H.R. 3083, H.R. 3087, H.R. 3315, H.R. 3631, H.R. 3405, and H.R. 4088. Key provisions in H.R. 4128 are Sections 2(a) and 2(b). Section 2(a) of H.R. 4128 prohibits states from using eminent domain for economic development if they received federal funds. Section 2(b) states that violating this provision makes the state ineligible for federal funds for 2 fiscal years. Section 3 of the bill prohibits federal agencies from using eminent domain for economic development, but it is less significant than Section 2. Section 8 defines which government condemnations are prohibited by Sections 2(a) and 3 through its definition of \"economic development.\" The Kelo bill in Congress defines economic development as the taking of private property without the owner's consent for commercial purposes or to benefit the public. Seven exemption categories are outlined, including public ownership, road construction, and public health and safety concerns. The bill also prohibits federal agencies from using eminent domain for economic development. The bill defines \"economic development\" in a second context in Section 2(b), specifying which federal funds are to be suspended in case of prohibited condemnations. The Attorney General is tasked with compiling a list of federal laws to determine the funds to be suspended. Additionally, the bill includes a private right to sue as an enforcement mechanism in Section 4. The bill includes a private right to sue in Section 4, allowing property owners to enforce provisions of the Act in court. The burden of proof is shifted to the government to show that takings are not for economic development. Suits must be filed within a specific time frame after condemnation and before seven years of economic development use. Prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees. The bill includes a private right to sue in Section 4, allowing property owners to enforce provisions of the Act in court. Prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees. Section 13 addresses condemnation of property belonging to religious and nonprofit organizations, triggering a funds cut-off if done due to their tax-exempt status. Section 11 commands that the bill be construed in favor of a broad interpretation. The bill aims to increase tax revenue and protect private property rights. It encourages private ownership of property and restricts the use of eminent domain for economic development. The bill applies prospectively and prohibits condemnations for economic development by states or entities delegated eminent domain power. The bill restricts the use of eminent domain for economic development by states or delegated entities, with no time limit specified for the use of condemned property. This could result in the loss of federal funds if the property is later used for economic development. The bill restricts the use of eminent domain for economic development by states or delegated entities, with no time limit specified for the use of condemned property. The broad-construction mandate of Section 11 favors private property rights, requiring the condemnor government to return the property to avoid a funds cut-off. The suspended federal economic development funds under Section 2(b) do not need to be connected to the project where the condemnation occurred, triggering a two-year funds cut-off regardless of the scale or significance of the condemnations. H.R. 4128 limits eminent domain for economic development by attaching conditions to federal funds. Unlike other Kelo bills, this bill blocks other federal monies if violative condemnations occur in the same fiscal year as the funds are received. The constitutional basis of H.R.4128 is not just the Spending Clause but also the Necessary and Proper Clause, allowing Congress to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent for the general welfare. One limit on funding conditions is that they must be related to the federal interest for which the funds are used. The Supreme Court has suggested that the financial inducement created by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point where \"pressure turns into compulsion.\" The threat of a two-year cut-off of millions of dollars under federal programs triggered by condemnation for economic development could potentially be viewed as crossing this line. The Supreme Court has suggested that financial inducements by Congress could be viewed as crossing the line into compulsion. H.R.4128 contrasts sharply with other Kelo bills by terminating funds only for the specific project where condemnation occurred. Section 2(c) allows the condemnor to return the property to end the funds cut-off. The funds cut-off in H.R.4128 does not explicitly require the condemnee to return the money received for the property, but it is implied to prevent unjust enrichment. However, some condemnees may not want their property back, which could pose a challenge for the condemnor under Section 2(c). The interpretation of \"returning all real property\" may need to be flexible to accommodate such situations. The bill defines \"economic development\" as a prohibited condemnation purpose but exempts entities open to the public \"as of right,\" such as railroads or public facilities. There was debate in committee markup about whether this exemption includes sports stadiums and shopping centers. Another exemption is for \"removing harmful uses of land\" that pose an immediate threat to public health and safety. The bill exempts entities open to the public \"as of right\" from the prohibition on economic development condemnation. Justice O'Connor's dissent in Kelo upheld precedents allowing private-to-private condemnation for blight removal and concentrated land ownership issues. The bill exempts public entities from economic development condemnation. Critics argue that the term \"blight\" is often broadly interpreted to justify redevelopment, even in cases without immediate threats. This could lead to private-to-private condemnations being punished under H.R. 4128. The bill may deter condemnations in areas of moderate blight due to the vague term \"immediate threat\" and potential suspension of federal funds. Mixed-purpose condemnations raise questions about whether they qualify as \"economic development\" under the bill. Section 4 only applies to property owners, not renters. Displaced owners and lessees can receive compensation under the Takings Clause and Uniform Relocation Act. Third parties may have a right of action for property value loss due to prohibited condemnation for economic development. The conclusion of condemnation proceedings allows for remedies, but Section 4 does not allow courts to enjoin improper condemnation before or during the proceedings. The dual-remedy reading is not entirely discounted, as an action may be brought if the property is used for economic development after condemnation. Section 4(b) suggests a different private right of action following condemnation for economic development, while Section 4(a) allows injunctive actions before, during, or soon after condemnation. The bill favors broad property rights protection and does not authorize a damages remedy. Section 2(c) gives states and localities the opportunity to return real property, but it is a choice at their discretion and cannot be compelled. The Section 4 action for non-federal condemnations may only result in a court ordering a two-year cut-off and return of any mistakenly granted federal funds. There is a constitutional question regarding standing to sue for blocking federal funds and reimbursement of improperly disbursed funds, requiring the plaintiff to show concrete and particularized injury traceable to the jurisdiction. The Section 4 plaintiffs seeking funds termination meet the \"injury in fact\" and traceability requirements, but the redressability is uncertain. The Eleventh Amendment bars private actions against unconsenting states. The Eleventh Amendment prohibits private actions against unconsenting states, with exceptions for congressional abrogation under the Fourteenth Amendment Section 5 and prospective injunctions against state officials. It does not apply to political subdivisions of states, so it is not usually relevant in economic-development condemnations. Section 4 states that states cannot claim immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment prohibits private actions against states, but Section 4 states that states cannot claim immunity under it. The language in the bill seems to waive state sovereign immunity if they accept federal economic development funds. Section 3 prohibits federal condemnations for economic development, which is different from the state/political subdivision sections of the bill. Section 3 of the bill prohibits federal condemnations for economic development, with a narrower vision compared to Section 2's prohibition on states and political subdivisions. This raises questions about remedies for federal agency violations and the potential conveyance of property to private owners after federal use. The Bond Amendment to the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2006 (P.L. 109-115, Section 726) prohibits the use of funds for federal, state, or local projects that employ eminent domain for economic development benefiting private entities. This raises questions about remedies for federal violations and property conveyance after federal use. The Bond Amendment prohibits the use of funds for projects that employ eminent domain for economic development benefiting private entities. Funds for mass transit, railroad, airport, seaport, or highway projects, utility projects, and projects for public health and safety are considered public use for eminent domain purposes. The Government Accountability Office will conduct a study on this issue. The Bond Amendment restricts the use of federal funds for eminent domain projects benefiting private entities. The Government Accountability Office will conduct a study on the nationwide use of eminent domain, focusing on procedures, results, and impacts on property owners and communities. The Bond Amendment restricts federal funds for eminent domain projects benefiting private entities. Supreme Court decisions suggest a broad view of public use, stating condemnation must be for a public purpose. The Amendment's third paragraph aligns with Takings Clause jurisprudence on what constitutes a public use. It emphasizes projects benefiting or serving the general public. The Bond Amendment aligns with the Supreme Court's interpretation of public use, emphasizing projects benefiting the general public. It includes facilities with public access, removal of threats to public health and safety, and brownfield cleanup. The phrase \"immediate threat to public health and safety\" was added to match H.R. 4128's exceptions for \"economic development.\" The Bond Amendment aligns with the Supreme Court's interpretation of public use, emphasizing projects benefiting the general public, including facilities with public access, removal of threats to public health and safety, and brownfield cleanup. The addition of the phrase \"immediate threat to public health and safety\" in H.R. 4128 reflects congressional concerns about overuse of blight-removal justifications for local redevelopment involving condemnations. The criteria for non-listed condemnation purposes may be based on Takings Clause case law or statutory language. The Bond Amendment adds a funding prohibition for non-public use condemnations, changing the law by requiring a cut-off of federal funding for projects deemed not for public use. It may trigger a funds cut-off for eminent domain used for purposes other than public use. The final paragraph calls for a GAO study on the matter. The Bond Amendment includes a funding prohibition for non-public use condemnations and calls for a GAO study on the nationwide use of eminent domain, with a focus on Kelo and similar circumstances. The scope of the study is expansive, covering federal, state, and local condemnations."
