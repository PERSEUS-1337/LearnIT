    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (P.L. 108-199) authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia, providing vouchers for students to attend private schools. The program was enacted under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 and received appropriations through FY2008. Funding was also provided in FY2009 and FY2010 under subsequent legislation. The Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia received funding in FY2009 and FY2010 under the Appropriations Act, 2009 and Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2010. The latter eliminated restrictions on funding and provided appropriations for DCPS, public charter schools, and Opportunity Scholarships. The program received $42.2 million for DCPS, $20 million for public charter schools, and $13.2 million for Opportunity Scholarships, with vouchers only available to students from the 2009-2010 school year. The 112th Congress introduced bills to reauthorize the program. The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act of 2011 (S. 206) and the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act (H.R. 471) were introduced to reauthorize the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. H.R. 471 passed in the House without amendment, while S. 206 was referred to the Senate Committee. The report discusses school choice, vouchers for private schools, and the DC School Choice Incentive Act. No further legislative action has occurred regarding S. 206. The report examines the School Choice Incentive Act, including eligibility requirements for students to receive vouchers and for private schools to participate. It also discusses current research on the program's effectiveness, appropriations for the Opportunity Scholarship program, and issues related to its continuation. Disputes over public education and school choice often revolve around whether education is a public or private good. Education is considered both a public and private good, with benefits for individuals and society. The distinction between the two can be blurred as individuals benefit from a stable and democratic society. Schooling involves balancing the rights of families and society. The debate over publicly funded school choice programs, including support for private schools, has been ongoing in Congress. The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship program is an example of federal support for private school enrollment. Concerns revolve around the use of public funds for private (especially religiously affiliated) schools and the effectiveness of improving educational outcomes for students. The Supreme Court has addressed these issues in cases like Aleman v. The Supreme Court ruling in Aleman v. Simmons-Harris allows public funding for school vouchers at religiously affiliated schools. School choice programs like public charter schools and Title I-A of ESEA also aim to improve educational outcomes. Supporters argue that offering the choice to attend private schools can help address resistance to change in public schools. The federal government can improve academic performance by enhancing students' opportunities to choose from a broader range of schools, including private sectarian and non-sectarian schools. Choice proponents believe that allowing students from low-income families to leave underperforming public schools provides immediate benefits and promotes competition for better performance. Choice supporters believe that public funding for private schools can be accompanied by limited government regulation, especially if aid is provided indirectly through vouchers to individual students. Opponents of federal school choice proposals involving private schools focus on limitations and negative effects on public schools, such as diverting attention and resources from reform efforts. Private school choice proposals typically target a limited portion of eligible students. Opponents of federal school choice programs argue that vouchers or scholarships may only cover a portion of private school costs, leading to concerns about increased government regulation of private schools and negative effects on public school funding and enrollment. The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget included a $75 million Choice Incentive Fund to provide grants for parents to choose higher-performing schools, including charter and private schools. This aimed to address concerns about unequal constraints on public schools and loss of students to other educational options. The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget included a $75 million Choice Incentive Fund for school choice programs in DC. Mayor Anthony Williams and Peggy Cooper Cafritz endorsed private school vouchers to improve education. Supporters insisted on federal funding without reducing funds for public schools. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton criticized the proposal as an affront to home rule. Opponents feared the program would reduce funding for public schools. Opponents of the voucher program argued that it would reduce funding for public education and have minimal benefits for most students. In July 2003, the House Committee on Government Reform passed the DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating a federally funded scholarship program for low-income students in the District of Columbia. Grantees would award scholarships of up to $7,500 per academic year to eligible students to attend private schools. The DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003 proposed a voucher program for low-income students in the District of Columbia to attend private schools. The program would have been authorized at $15 million for FY2004 and at such sums as may be necessary through FY2008. Amendments were offered during floor debate, including one to eliminate the voucher program, which failed to pass. The DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003 proposed a voucher program for low-income students in the District of Columbia to attend private schools. The amendment passed by a vote of 209 to 206, establishing eligibility criteria for students to receive a voucher and capping the maximum funding amount for a school year. The Senate's version of the FY2004 District of Columbia appropriations bill included a similar bill, but it was never considered on the Senate floor. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2765 did not include funding for a scholarship program for low-income students, but did include funding for school improvement in public schools. The House-passed version of H.R. 2765 did not include funding for these specific purposes. The DC School Choice Incentive Act, funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, included specific funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program under \"Federal Payment for School Improvement.\" This three-prong approach to funding education in DC was suggested by Mayor Williams and supported by the Administration and Congress. The DC School Choice Incentive Act (P.L. 108-199, Title III) authorized a scholarship program for low-income students in DC to enroll in schools of choice. The program was supported by the Administration and Congress, providing opportunities for families of students in schools identified for improvement under the ESEA. The DC School Choice Incentive Act authorized a scholarship program for low-income students in DC to attend schools of choice. The program had an initial appropriation of $14 million for FY2004 and allowed the Secretary of Education to award grants to eligible entities to provide opportunity scholarships. Eligible entities included educational entities of the DC government, nonprofit organizations, or consortiums of nonprofits. Priority was given to entities that effectively served eligible students. The DC School Choice Incentive Act established a scholarship program for low-income students in DC to attend schools of choice. The program was administered by the Washington Scholarship Fund until May 2010 when it was taken over by The DC Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation. Student eligibility is open to children from families with incomes not exceeding 185% of the poverty line. Eligible students from low-income families in DC can receive an Opportunity Scholarship valued at up to $7,500 to cover tuition, fees, and transportation expenses for private schools. Recipients must reapply annually and can continue as long as family income stays below 300% of the poverty level. Since its inception, the Opportunity Scholarship program in DC has provided scholarships to eligible students from low-income families, with 3,738 students awarded scholarships out of 5,547 deemed eligible. A total of 3,023 individual students have participated in the program from 2004-2011, with 22% of students offered scholarships not using them. Out of 1,293 students offered scholarships in the Opportunity Scholarship program, 282 (22%) never used them. Reasons for not using the scholarships included lack of space at preferred private schools, lack of special needs services, and gaining admission to preferred public charter schools. Some students who initially used scholarships later left the program, citing similar reasons such as attending preferred public charter schools, lack of space at preferred private schools, moving out of the District of Columbia, transportation issues, and lack of special needs services. Private schools accepting Opportunity Scholarship program are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, or gender. Single sex schools connected to a religious organization can discriminate based on gender. Schools cannot alter provisions of IDEA. Sectarian schools can hire based on religious beliefs and maintain their mission. Private schools participating in the Opportunity Scholarship program must comply with program evaluations and additional requirements, including maintaining a valid certificate of occupancy. 52 out of 90 private schools in DC participated in the program during the 2008-2009 school year, with the majority being faith-based schools, including Catholic parochial schools. 50% of participating schools charged tuition above the voucher cap of $7,500. Private schools participating in the Opportunity Scholarship program in DC must have a valid certificate of occupancy. Teachers of scholarship recipients must hold bachelor's degrees. The program was extended by P.L. 111-8, requiring a new program administrator. Participating schools must comply with accreditation and attendance laws. The School Choice Incentive Act required the Secretary of Education to submit a report to Congress on the academic rigor and quality of participating schools in the Opportunity Scholarship Program. The report needed to include data from academic performance assessments for eligible voucher recipients and ensure annual site inspections at each school. The program also required annual evaluations. The School Choice Incentive Act mandated annual evaluations of the scholarship program by an independent entity, Westat, in collaboration with subcontractors. Up to 3% of the annual appropriation could be allocated for evaluation purposes overseen by the NCEE at IES. The evaluations focused on measuring academic achievement of participating students using the same standards as DCPS and involved collaboration with the Washington Scholarship Fund. The Washington Scholarship Fund collaborates with an independent evaluator to measure academic achievement of scholarship recipients compared to students in DC public schools. The evaluation also assesses parental choice options, retention rates, graduation rates, and the program's impact on students and public schools. The final report on the DC Opportunity Scholarship program evaluated the impact of the program on students in public schools. The evaluation used a randomized control trial to compare students who received a scholarship versus those who did not. The analysis compared students who used a scholarship versus those who did not, across different subgroups in the DC Opportunity Scholarship program. The impact study of the DC Opportunity Scholarship program found no significant effects on reading or mathematics performance for students offered scholarships after at least four years. However, subgroup analyses showed some positive effects on reading performance for certain groups, such as students from schools not identified for improvement and higher-performing students who were offered scholarships. The DC Opportunity Scholarship program had a positive impact on students' educational attainment, with those offered a scholarship showing higher high school graduation rates compared to those not offered a scholarship. Subgroup analyses revealed that students from schools not identified for improvement and higher-performing students benefited the most from the program. Higher performers who received a scholarship had a higher high school graduation rate compared to those who did not (93% vs. 79%). Females with a scholarship also had a higher graduation rate than those without (95% vs. 75%). The program did not significantly impact students from schools not identified for improvement, lower performers, or male students. Parents of scholarship recipients reported higher school safety and satisfaction levels compared to parents of non-recipients. After analyzing the impact of scholarship use, it was found that students who were offered a scholarship did not rate their school as significantly safer or report increased satisfaction compared to those who were not offered a scholarship. Some students chose to use the scholarship to enroll in a private school, while others did not. Follow-up analyses were conducted on the subgroups, showing that the impact of scholarship use mirrored that of a scholarship offer. After at least four years, the DC Opportunity Scholarship program did not have statistically significant effects on reading or other outcomes. The Opportunity Scholarship program had a positive impact on high school graduation rates for students who used a scholarship, with a 20% increase for students from SINI. However, there were no significant effects on reading or math performance. Subgroup analyses showed that the impact on graduation rates was greater for scholarship users compared to those offered a scholarship. The Opportunity Scholarship program increased graduation rates for students from SINI by 20%, with no significant effects on reading or math performance. Using a scholarship also boosted graduation rates for higher-performing and female students. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report did not evaluate student outcomes but highlighted reasons for parental participation in the program. The GAO reported incomplete and incorrect information provided to parents about the scholarship program, leading to some declining participation due to various reasons. The impact evaluation did not address the program's impact on expanding choice options or college admission rates. Funding for the Opportunity Scholarship Program is included in federal funding for the District of Columbia. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided funding for school improvement in the District of Columbia, allocated among three entities: District of Columbia Public Schools, State Education Office for public charter schools, and ED for the DC School Choice Incentive program. Appropriations were provided from FY2004 to FY2010. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 added requirements for schools to participate in the Opportunity Scholarships program. The FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided funding for school improvement in the District of Columbia until FY2010. P.L. 111-8 added requirements for schools participating in the Opportunity Scholarships program, including the need for a valid certificate of occupancy and a core subject teacher with a bachelor's degree. Funds for the program after 2009-2010 are contingent on reauthorization and approval by the District of Columbia. Senator Ensign (NV) offered an amendment to remove the requirement for reauthorization and approval by Congress and the District of Columbia for additional funding for the Opportunity Scholarships program. He argued that other federal education programs receive funding without current authorizations and that ending the program would disrupt students' education. The amendment failed to pass by a vote of 39-58. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated funds for Opportunity Scholarships to current program participants only, not for program expansion. The Act also directed the Chancellor of DCPS to ensure a smooth transition for voucher recipients transitioning to public schools. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2010 eliminated the requirement for reauthorization of Opportunity Scholarship funds and provided funding to improve public school education in DC and expand quality public charter schools. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated funds for Opportunity Scholarships to current program participants only, not for program expansion. The Act also directed the Chancellor of DCPS to ensure a smooth transition for voucher recipients transitioning to public schools. In addition, $20 million was allocated to the State Education Office to expand quality public charter schools in the District of Columbia, and $13.2 million was provided for Opportunity Scholarships by P.L. 111-117. This funding could only be used for students who received scholarships in the 2009-2010 school year, with additional requirements for participating schools to comply with accreditation and other standards under DC compulsory school attendance laws. The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 1) made changes to the Opportunity Scholarship program, including prohibiting the use of funds for student testing. The Act required site inspections at participating schools and a report on academic quality to be submitted to Congress. H.R. 1 proposed changes to the Opportunity Scholarship program, allowing funds to be used for scholarships regardless of prior receipt, eliminating the requirement for academic performance assessments, and removing the need for site inspections at participating schools. The Opportunity Scholarship program has undergone changes, with new requirements added for participating schools. The future of the program is uncertain, and potential issues may arise as a result. It is unclear if schools will have to leave the program due to the new requirements, and the impact on voucher recipients is also uncertain. The future of the Opportunity Scholarship program is uncertain, with potential budgetary impacts on the DC government if voucher recipients return to public schools. The costs to the city could be substantial if all students currently receiving vouchers were to switch back to public schools. The District's Uniform Per Student Funding Formula is the basis for funding the public school system, adjusted for factors like grade levels. The current per pupil expenditure for the District of Columbia includes various categories but excludes capital outlay or interest. The District's Uniform Per Student Funding Formula is used to fund the public school system, excluding capital outlay or interest. The current per pupil expenditures include different types of expenses, with a foundation level payment of $8,945 per student. If 1,322 students return to public schools, it would cost about $11.8 million using the foundation level estimate. Alternatively, the current expenditures per student were $16,353 in FY2008. If the Opportunity Scholarship program is discontinued, private schools may convert to public charter schools. Voucher recipients are concentrated in a few schools, with some schools having at least 60% of total enrollment from voucher recipients. In 2008-2009, seven former Catholic schools reopened as public charter schools. In the District of Columbia, private schools may convert to public charter schools if financially unable to remain open. This could increase public costs for education. Funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program is included in school improvement funding for the District of Columbia. Prior to this program, the federal government did not provide specific funding for school improvement in DC. Since the introduction of the program, funding for school improvement in DCPS and public charter schools has increased. Funding for school improvement in DCPS and public charter schools has increased since the introduction of the Opportunity Scholarship program. If the program were to be discontinued, the loss of funding for public education in the District of Columbia could be substantial due to a budget shortfall."
