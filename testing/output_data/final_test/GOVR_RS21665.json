    "content": "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) originated in 1921 as the Bureau of the Budget (BOB) within the Treasury Department. It was later transferred to the Executive Office of the President in 1939 and renamed OMB in 1970. In 1974, Congress made the director and deputy director subject to Senate confirmation and established four statutory offices within OMB. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), while the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 established the Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM). The E-Government Act of 2002 established the Office of Electronic Government (E-Gov Office). OMB's leadership and organizational structure can be found on the agency's website, with three major types of offices: resource management offices, statutory offices, and OMB-wide support offices. Each resource management office focuses on related agencies and issues to examine budget requests and make funding recommendations. Resource Management Offices (RMOs) are responsible for integrating management, budget, and policy perspectives following OMB's 1994 reorganization. Politically appointed program associate directors lead the RMOs, with career civil servants below them organized into divisions and branches. Each RMO branch covers a cabinet department or smaller agencies and is led by a career member of the Senior Executive Service (SES). OMB's program examiners staff each RMO branch, with three statutory offices focusing on financial management, procurement policy, and information technology. The fourth office, OIRA, has a broad portfolio including regulation, information policy, technology, paperwork reduction, statistical policy, and privacy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) consists of various offices that play key roles in developing policy, coordinating implementation, and working on agency-specific issues. The Budget Review Division (BRD) coordinates the President's annual budget proposal, the Legislative Reference Division (LRD) ensures compliance with the President's policy agenda, and the Economic Policy Office works on economic assumptions. OMB has around 484 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and typically has 20-25 political appointees. OMB typically has around 20-25 political appointees and staff, with the majority being career civil servants. Key positions such as the director, deputy director, and deputy director for management are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation. The budget is mainly driven by personnel costs, with compensation and benefits making up 88% of total obligations in FY2005. Funding distribution among OMB's offices shows that 51% went to the RMOs, 31% to OMB-wide support offices, and 18% to statutory offices. The budget has fluctuated in recent years due to reallocations of funding within the EOP. In FY2003, Congress reallocated $8.3 million from OMB to the EOP's Office of Administration for central procurement, reducing OMB's appropriation. The President requested similar funding shifts for FY2004 and FY2005, but Congress continued the reallocation. For FY2006, Congress shifted $7 million from OA back to OMB for rent and health unit costs. In FY2007, the President proposed $68.8 million for OMB and $7.9 million for OA, with the total including costs that might otherwise be in OMB's budget. The FY2007 OMB proposal includes $7.9 million for OA, representing a 0.6% increase in nominal dollars compared to FY2006. OMB has important responsibilities as a primary support agency for the President, with various operational authorities. OMB's major functions include formulating the President's budget proposal, providing budget guidance to agencies, and receiving formal budget requests from agency heads. The OMB forwards formal budget requests to the White House after assembling options and analysis. The Antideficiency Act requires OMB to apportion funds to prevent overspending. OMB coordinates the President's legislative activities and reviews congressional testimony and draft bills. The Legislative Reference Division (LRD) and Budget Review Division (BRD) play key roles in ensuring compliance with the President's policy agenda and coordinating the Administration's views on legislation. OMB has significant influence over agency regulations, working with OIRA to review rules and cost-benefit analyses. OIRA also oversees statistical policy, paperwork reduction, and government use of personal information. OMB, along with OIRA, oversees management in the executive branch, including approving executive orders and proclamations. OMB's deputy director for management is responsible for general management policies, including financial management, procurement policy, and information policy and technology. OMB's RMOs integrate budget, policy, and management issues for specific agencies. Observers have differing opinions on OMB's management effectiveness. OMB plays a key role in overseeing management in the executive branch, with differing opinions on its effectiveness. It leads initiatives like the Program Assessment Rating Tool and President's Management Agenda, which evaluate programs and agencies based on set standards. OMB's scorecard ratings in 2005 showed mixed results. OMB's scorecard ratings for December 31, 2005, were two yellow and three red for \"status\" and four green and one yellow for \"progress.\""
