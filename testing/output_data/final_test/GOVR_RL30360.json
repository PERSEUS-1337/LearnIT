    "content": "The filibuster in the Senate is a tactic used to block measures by preventing them from coming to a vote. Senate rules lack specific limits on debate length or motions to end it, except for the cloture rule requiring a super-majority vote. The cloture rule in the Senate requires a super-majority vote to impose a time limit and restrict delaying tactics. It has been increasingly used to overcome filibusters, although supporters may not always seek cloture. Senate leadership has made use of cloture as a normal tool in recent times. The Senate leadership has been using cloture as a regular tool to manage business flow, even without evident filibusters. Filibusters are not solely indicated by cloture attempts, as their presence is subjective and can vary in intensity. Constructing a definitive list of filibusters is challenging due to the diverse ways they can be conducted. The focus is on filibusters through extended debate and cloture as a way to address them, with recent modifications to the rule highlighted. The core rule of the Senate governing floor debate is found in Rule XIX of Riddick's Senate Procedure. Senators and staff can consult the Senate Parliamentarian for questions on procedural rules. Senators must be recognized by the Presiding Officer before speaking and cannot interrupt each other without consent. Senators are limited to speaking twice on the same question in a legislative day without Senate approval. The Senate's Rule XIX governs floor debate, with Senators needing recognition from the Presiding Officer before speaking. There are no time limits on debate, allowing for filibusters by debate. The presiding officer must recognize a Senator seeking recognition, without discretion, even if it hinders reaching a vote on the pending matter. The Senate's Rule XIX governs floor debate, with Senators needing recognition from the Presiding Officer before speaking. There are no time limits on debate, allowing for filibusters by debate. The presiding officer must recognize a Senator seeking recognition, without discretion, even if it hinders reaching a vote on the pending matter. Despite the debatable question, any Senator can eventually be recognized for debate, with party leaders receiving preference in practice. In Senate floor debate, party leaders receive preference in recognition for arranging agendas, schedules, and making motions. The presiding officer prioritizes majority and minority leaders, followed by floor managers of legislation being debated. Rule XIX in the Senate allows Senators to speak for as long as they wish, with some exceptions. There is no limit on the length of speeches or the number of Senators who can speak on a topic, but the two-speech rule restricts Senators from speaking more than twice on the same question in a legislative day without Senate approval. The two-speech rule in the Senate limits each Senator to two speeches per day on a debatable question, with a legislative day ending only with an adjournment. The Senate's two-speech rule limits Senators to two speeches per day on a debatable question, with exceptions for executive business. Senators may try to overcome filibusters by enforcing this rule, but can circumvent it by introducing new debatable questions. The Senate's two-speech rule limits Senators to two speeches per day on a debatable question, with exceptions for executive business. The Senate considers being recognized and engaging in debate as constituting a speech, but certain procedural motions and requests do not count as speeches. A Senator can end debate by moving to table the pending question, which is not debatable. In the Senate, to table something is to kill it by disposing of the matter permanently and adversely with a simple majority vote. Senators can prevent a debate by using the motion to table, which is not debatable and can be offered when time for debate is limited. The motion to table in the Senate allows Senators to end a debate and prevent a filibuster, but it also means the matter being debated is defeated. It is a way to dispose of a matter permanently with a simple majority vote. The filibuster in the Senate can be conducted through offering dilatory amendments and motions. Senators can continue debate on the underlying bill by tabling such amendments, allowing for extended debate that can be physically demanding. This process involves Senators seeking recognition to speak at length, with debate continuing until all participating Senators have made their two speeches on the pending question. Senators can offer dilatory amendments and motions to prolong debate in the Senate. The purpose of a filibuster is to delay proceedings, and any Senator can speak regardless of their stance on the issue. Debate does not always have to be relevant, except during the first three hours of each calendar day. During filibusters in the Senate, Senators must comply with a germaneness requirement on debate, which is usually not enforced. They must speak continuously while standing, putting a strain on them as time passes. Relief for speaking colleagues must be carefully given. Senators must be cautious when providing relief to colleagues speaking during a filibuster. Senate rules prohibit yielding the floor to another Senator, except for yielding for a question. This tactic allows a colleague to give the filibustering Senator a break by asking a question, ensuring the Senator retains control of the floor. Senators can extend debates by asking long questions followed by short answers, rather than giving long speeches. They can also delay Senate voting by calling for quorum checks to consume time. The presence of a quorum is often questioned to stall proceedings. The Senate often uses quorum calls to temporarily suspend floor proceedings, allowing time to discuss issues or wait for a Senator to arrive. The clerk calls the roll slowly during these calls, but they can be quickly dispensed with by unanimous consent. Quorum calls can be time-consuming and benefit filibustering Senators. When a quorum call is initiated in the Senate, the clerk may be directed to speed up the roll call process to save time. However, this can reveal if a quorum is not present, leading to the need to secure enough absent Senators to establish a quorum. Typically, a motion is made for the Sergeant at Arms to bring back absent Senators, followed by a roll call vote. This usually results in a quorum being present, allowing the Senate to continue without the need for the Sergeant at Arms to take action. The Senate's directive may require the Sergeant at Arms to execute it, which can be time-consuming due to the roll call vote process. Proponents of a filibustered bill may prefer a quick roll call to avoid a quorum call, as it requires unanimous consent to stop. If a quorum is suggested to be absent, a motion can be made to secure attendance and prompt a roll call vote with support from at least 10 Senators. It is in the bill's proponents' interest to have this motion agreed to quickly. However, Senators lose the floor when suggesting a quorum absence. The Senate's rules limit the use of quorum calls for filibusters. Roll call votes can also cause delays, requiring at least 11 Senators for a vote, consuming 15 minutes each unless time is reduced. The Constitution allows for \"yeas and nays\" votes at the request of one-fifth of Senators present. The Senate requires at least 11 Senators to request a roll call vote on a pending question. Supporters of a bill may discourage time-consuming roll call votes during a filibuster. The number of Senators needed for a roll call vote can increase to a maximum of 20. During filibusters, the number of Senators required for a roll call vote can increase to a maximum of 20. The time allowed for voting is typically 15 minutes but can be extended to accommodate Senators arriving late. The Senate leadership aims to minimize disruptions from filibusters by scheduling sessions late into the night, making filibustering more challenging. During filibusters, Senators may speak all night, with cots brought in for rest. However, all-night sessions are now rare due to filibusters being less common and Senators unwilling to endure prolonged sessions. Leadership may also delay debate to avoid late-night sessions, which can burden proponents more than opponents. The burden of filibustering falls more on the proponents of the question being debated than on its opponents. Senators participating in a filibuster only need to ensure one of them is always present to speak, while proponents must ensure a majority of the Senate is available to respond to a quorum call. If a quorum is not present, the Senate must adjourn or suspend proceedings. This places the burden on opponents to ensure the quorum requirement is met. The procedures for invoking cloture are governed by specific rules. The cloture process begins when a Senator presents a motion signed by 16 Senators to end debate on a pending question. The motion must be presented while the question is pending, and the Senator does not need to be recognized by the chair to present it. The Senator who has the floor may be interrupted but retains the floor to continue speaking. The cloture process in the Senate allows for ending debate on a pending question. The motion is presented by a Senator and the Senate typically acts on it on the second day after it is submitted. One hour after convening on that day, the cloture motion is presented for a vote. The cloture process in the Senate requires a quorum call and a vote on the motion to end debate. A three-fifths vote of the entire Senate is needed to invoke cloture, while most other votes require a simple majority. The cloture process in the Senate requires a three-fifths vote to end debate. An affirmative vote of two-thirds of Senators present and voting is needed to invoke cloture on a measure or motion to amend Senate rules. The Senate agreed to change the cloture rule from two-thirds to three-fifths of Senators for most matters. Cloture on a nomination now requires a majority vote, which cannot be reconsidered, while a vote against cloture can be reconsidered. Supporters of cloture can arrange for a second vote on cloture by entering a motion to reconsider a previous vote. The Senate must agree to proceed to the motion to reconsider and then vote on cloture again, requiring a simple majority. If three-fifths of the Senate votes for cloture, it is invoked. The Senate may also agree by unanimous consent to alter cloture rule requirements for specific matters. The Senate can permit cloture motions on matters not pending, waive quorum calls, adjust cloture vote times by unanimous consent, and even vote on cloture without a formal motion. Any debatable question can be filibustered and subject to a cloture motion, including bills, resolutions, nominations, treaties, and other motions. The Senate's standing rules allow for filibusters on motions to proceed to a bill's consideration and on the bill itself. The majority leader can make a motion for the Senate to proceed to consider a measure, which is subject to a filibuster. Cloture may need to be invoked on this motion before a vote can be taken. Once the Senate begins consideration of the measure, a filibuster on the measure itself may occur, requiring a new cloture vote. The Senate's standing rules allow for filibusters on motions to proceed to a bill's consideration and on the bill itself. Threatened filibusters on motions to proceed have become more common. The majority leader can move to proceed to consider a measure, submit a cloture motion, and then withdraw it to allow other business. If cloture is invoked, the motion to proceed becomes pending business under cloture restrictions. The Senate's standing rules allow filibusters on motions to proceed and on the bill itself. If cloture is invoked on an amendment, once disposed of, debate on the bill continues under Senate rules. Cloture can be separately invoked on multiple amendments or on the bill itself. Non-germane amendments are out of order under cloture. After the Senate has passed a measure, additional action may be necessary for the Senate to go to conference with the House on the legislation. Conference reports are not subject to a double filibuster and motions to proceed to their consideration are not debatable. Cloture may be necessary on a conference report or other debatable questions. Cloture motions are sought on various debatable questions, such as overriding a presidential veto or motions to recommit a measure. The timing of cloture motions in relation to filibusters has evolved over the years, with more recent trends showing cloture being sought earlier in the consideration process. In some cases, cloture motions have been filed before the matter in question has even been called up, requiring unanimous consent. When cloture is sought before any dilatory action occurs, it may indicate a filibuster threat. Multiple cloture votes can be taken on the same question, with the possibility of filing a second motion if the first one fails. This process can lead to several cloture votes on the same question. During the 100th Congress, there were eight unsuccessful cloture votes on a campaign finance bill. The Senate may need to attempt cloture on multiple questions to complete consideration of a single measure, such as when considering a bill with a pending amendment. Once cloture is invoked on a question, Rule XXII requires amendments to be germane. When the Senate invokes cloture on a bill with non-germane provisions, further consideration of the substitute is out of order. The majority leader may move for cloture on the underlying bill immediately after cloture on the substitute, fulfilling the two-day layover for both motions simultaneously. If cloture is invoked on the substitute and adopted, the Senate then votes on cloture for the underlying bill. After invoking cloture on a bill, there is a 30-hour cap for the Senate to consider the question, including debate, quorum calls, and other proceedings. This time limit can be extended with a non-debatable motion requiring a three-fifths vote. The cloture rule in the Senate allows for a 30-hour cap on post-cloture consideration, with each Senator entitled to speak for up to one hour. Senators can yield their time to others, but there is a limit of two hours for each designated Senator. This time limit was introduced in a 1985 amendment to the cloture rule, prior to which there was no cap on post-cloture consideration. In 1979, the Senate imposed a 100-hour cap on post-cloture consideration to prevent post-cloture filibusters. This was later reduced to 30 hours in 1985, allowing each Senator only limited time to speak. Rule XXII provides a limited protection for Senators during post-cloture consideration, allowing those who have not spoken for at least ten minutes to have up to ten minutes to speak. This extension may not significantly prolong the 30-hour time limit imposed by cloture. Opponents may choose to forgo using the full 30 hours and agree to a final vote before the time expires. After cloture is invoked in the Senate, debate must be germane, and Senators can enforce this requirement by making points of order from the floor. The presiding officer does not typically initiate enforcement of germane debate. After cloture is invoked in the Senate, only germane amendments are eligible for floor consideration. Senators can enforce this requirement by making points of order from the floor, which also applies to other motions or actions under cloture. Amendments that are not germane may be ruled out immediately after a successful cloture vote. The Senate may have to invoke cloture on an amendment to a bill and then on the bill itself due to a germaneness requirement. A Senate committee often reports a bill with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, which may render it non-germane to the bill. If cloture is invoked on the bill before voting on the committee substitute, the substitute becomes out of order as non-germane. The Senate can invoke cloture on a non-germane amendment to limit consideration to 30 hours. If the amendment is adopted, Senators can filibuster the bill as amended. The Senate can then vote to invoke cloture on the bill as amended, but overturning a ruling on non-germane amendments is unlikely to maintain the integrity of the cloture procedure. The cloture procedure in the Senate is crucial for maintaining integrity and utility. Senators may hesitate to vote for cloture if they fear unrelated amendments could be introduced. Sometimes cloture is used to ensure amendments are germane, even if not to end a filibuster. This can be a strategy to bring a bill to the floor for consideration when the majority party is hesitant. The cloture procedure in the Senate is important for maintaining integrity and utility. Supporters of a bill may offer it as a non-germane amendment to another bill to be considered on the floor. Opponents can move for cloture to prolong debate and prevent a vote on the amendment until the cloture motion is voted on. If cloture is invoked, the non-germane amendment is subject to a point of order, allowing opponents to dispose of it without a direct vote, if they can mobilize three-fifths of the Senate to support cloture. This illustrates that not every cloture vote is to overcome a filibuster already in progress. Amendments must be in order after cloture has been invoked under the general cloture procedures. After cloture is invoked in the Senate, amendments must be submitted in writing before the cloture vote. Different requirements apply to first-degree and second-degree amendments. Rule XXII states that no amendment can be proposed after the cloture vote unless submitted in writing by specific deadlines. Senators often submit numerous amendments for printing in the Congressional Record before the cloture vote. After cloture is invoked in the Senate, amendments must be submitted in writing before the cloture vote. Senators often submit a large number of amendments to a bill for printing in the Congressional Record even before a cloture motion is presented, which may signal a filibuster. Rule XXII allows Senators time to draft and review amendments before voting on cloture. There is no separate deadline for submitting amendments in the nature of a substitute. The Senate establishes no separate deadline for submitting amendments in the nature of a substitute, which are amendable in two degrees. This lack of a deadline can result in Senators having little time to prepare amendments to the substitute before the deadline for first-degree amendments. Senators must decide whether to prepare and submit amendments to a measure whenever cloture is proposed. Once cloture is invoked on a bill, it is too late for a Senator to think about proposing amendments. When a cloture motion is filed in the Senate, Senators often prepare amendments for printing in the Record, anticipating approval of the motion two days later. Amendments cannot be modified under cloture to ensure transparency and clarity for Senators. If an amendment is modified after a cloture motion is filed and still pending when cloture is invoked, it becomes out of order and falls. Rule XXII allows Senators to change their offered amendments under cloture only in limited circumstances. If a measure is reprinted after cloture has been invoked and the reprinting changes page and line numbers, amendments can be reprinted to make conforming changes. The rule also limits Senators to calling up only two amendments until every other Senator has had the opportunity to do the same, aiming to prevent domination of Senate proceedings under cloture. This restriction has rarely been enforced and does not pose a significant issue. Rule XXII under cloture allows for limited changes to offered amendments. The Senate has established precedents empowering the presiding officer to rule out dilatory motions and amendments without Senators needing to make points of order. This authority has been rarely exercised, but motions such as adjournment, postponement, and reconsideration have been deemed dilatory and not in order under cloture. Under Senate rules, dilatory motions like adjournment, postponement, and reconsideration have been deemed out of order under cloture. The presiding officer has the authority to rule out such motions without the need for Senators to make points of order. Appeals from rulings of the chair are usually debatable, but not under cloture. Amendments must be read before debate, but this can be waived by unanimous consent or a non-debatable motion if the amendment has been available for at least twenty-four hours. Under cloture, the presiding officer gains additional powers not present in regular Senate procedures, such as the ability to count quorum and prevent dilatory motions like adjournment. Amendments can be divided under normal Senate rules, but not during cloture. Under cloture, the presiding officer can count quorum and rule out amendments and motions without waiting for Senators to make a point of order. Non-germane and dilatory amendments are typically challenged by the majority leader after cloture. Cloture also prioritizes the pending business over all other matters until resolved. The Senate rule of cloture prioritizes unfinished business until resolved, preventing consideration of other matters. Filibusters can delay not only the current issue but also other urgent or less contentious matters. However, the Senate can still address routine business or other issues by unanimous consent. A filibuster in the Senate can significantly impact legislative proceedings, even if cloture is invoked. It can delay votes on bills for up to two weeks, shaping the way the Senate conducts its business. The Senate passes a bill with majority support. A hypothetical example shows the process from motion to proceed to cloture vote. The 30-hour post-cloture period can extend over almost 4 days. Filibustering can further delay the bill's progress. The opponents of the bill may filibuster, requiring multiple cloture motions and votes, leading to a final passage vote on the 11th day of consideration. The duration of the filibuster depends on various factors such as timing of cloture motions and securing the necessary votes. After multiple cloture motions and votes, the Senate may need to consider the bill for 11 days before a final passage vote. Various factors, such as timing of cloture motions and securing votes, can affect the duration of the filibuster. The process may involve late-night or weekend sessions to expedite the 30-hour post-cloture consideration periods. Filibusters can cause significant delays in the Senate, even with 60-vote majorities to invoke cloture. The duration of a filibuster depends on the Senate's willingness to devote time to the bill and the importance of the legislation. The timing of a filibuster during the annual session or Congress can also impact its length. During the Senate session, filibusters can lead to delays, especially as time becomes scarce towards the end of the session. The costs of filibusters increase as they consume floor time that could be used for other legislation. Cloture motions may be filed to prevent filibusters, impacting the legislative prospects of bills. The practice of placing holds on measures in the Senate has developed informally as a way for Senators to object in advance without having to do so in person on the floor. Senators may file cloture motions to preempt anticipated filibusters, impacting when or whether a measure will be considered on the floor. This practice is not addressed in the Senate's standing rules. When a Senator places a hold on a measure, it signals their intention to object to unanimous consent requests for its consideration. Majority leaders tend to honor holds to avoid potential filibusters, as the threat of filibuster can prevent a measure from reaching the Senate floor. When a Senator places a hold on a measure, it signals their intention to object to unanimous consent requests for its consideration. Majority leaders tend to honor holds to avoid potential filibusters, as the threat of filibuster can prevent a measure from reaching the Senate floor. Supporters of a bill may discuss with Senators making threats of filibuster to amend the bill and avoid a filibuster. The majority leader may be hesitant to schedule a bill if there is a risk of delay in Senate action due to filibuster threats. filibusters can impact the Senate's ability to address other important measures by consuming time. Senators can use Rule XXII to delay action on a bill as leverage. If a Senator lacks support to filibuster a bill effectively, they may delay consideration of other bills to increase their bargaining power. This tactic can strengthen their position and show that more is at stake. Senators can use Rule XXII to delay action on a bill as leverage, strengthening their bargaining position by showing that more is at stake than just the bill itself. The possibility of filibusters incentivizes Senators to strive for legislative consensus, as it may require the votes of 60 Senators to overcome a filibuster. This dynamic encourages bill supporters to write legislation that can attract the support of at least three-fifths of all Senators. Additionally, there are often more bills ready for consideration on the Senate floor than there is time available, leading the majority leader to prioritize certain bills for action. The threat of a filibuster can deter the majority leader from calling up a bill, even if it is unlikely to succeed. Supporters may seek to accommodate all Senators to avoid a filibuster, turning opponents into supporters or preventing them from filibustering. The Senate's legislative process promotes efforts to reach consensus among Senators, even though true consensus on major issues may be difficult to achieve."
