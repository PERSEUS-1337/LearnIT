    "content": "Since the late 1970s, Congress has authorized federal agencies to research climate science through legislation like the National Climate Program Act (NCPA). This act created the National Climate Program to assess climate change effects, improve understanding of climate science, and collect climate data. Additional legislation has allowed for federal climate change research and collaboration, but did not mandate GHG emissions reduction. Executive orders and environmental statutes also address climate change, with the EPA working to reduce GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA has sought to reduce GHG emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The Department of Energy has established efficiency standards for certain consumer products to reduce energy consumption. Federal authority to regulate GHGs under existing law and policies has been challenged in court, with a focus on EPA's authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA. In 1998, EPA General Counsel Jonathan Cannon concluded that GHGs could be regulated under the CAA. On October 20, 1999, a group of organizations petitioned EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under the CAA. In 2003, EPA denied a petition to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. This decision was challenged in court and ultimately reached the Supreme Court in 2007. The Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that EPA has the authority to regulate GHGs as \"air pollutants\" under the CAA. The Supreme Court ruled that EPA has the authority to regulate GHGs as \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act, allowing for the regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. EPA's obligation to protect public health and welfare under the CAA is independent of DOT's mandate for energy efficiency. EPA must regulate GHG emissions if they contribute to air pollution that endangers public health. The Court identified three ways EPA could respond to the rulemaking petition regarding motor vehicle GHG emissions and public health endangerment. EPA's denial of the petition was deemed arbitrary and capricious as it failed to provide a reasoned explanation. The case was remanded for further proceedings. EPA later found that GHG emissions from motor vehicles do endanger public health and welfare. EPA found that GHG emissions from motor vehicles endanger public health and welfare, leading to regulations under the CAA to reduce emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. EPA has regulated GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and various stationary sources, including power plants and landfills, under different CAA sections. Court challenges mainly focus on the scope of EPA's authority and methods for regulating GHG emissions, not its overall authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA. The report focuses on GHG regulations under the CAA, including laws to reduce emissions from stationary and mobile sources and laws requiring consideration of climate change effects. EPA explored controlling GHGs under the Clean Air Act after the Massachusetts v. EPA decision. In 2009, EPA found that GHGs endanger public health and welfare, leading to regulations on motor vehicle emissions. The endangerment finding by EPA in 2009 determined that new motor vehicle emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, leading to the regulation of GHG emissions from on-road vehicles. EPA also has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from aircraft and nonroad mobile sources and engines. The Obama Administration coordinated with NHTSA to develop GHG emission standards for new cars and light trucks, aligning with California's standards. EPA and NHTSA issued Phase 1 standards in 2010 for Model Year 2012-2016 light-duty vehicles, setting a combined average emissions standard of 250 grams/mile of CO2. The EPA and NHTSA issued Phase 2 standards in 2012 for MY2017-2025 vehicles, aiming to reduce emissions to 163 grams/mile of CO2 by MY2025 and achieve a fuel economy of 40.3 to 41 mpg by MY2021. The regulations included a Midterm Evaluation in 2018, where EPA decided to maintain the standards for MY2022-2025. The EPA's decision to maintain the standards for MY2022-2025 has been criticized for being finalized before the deadline and separate from NHTSA's rulemaking on CAFE standards. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers filed a petition for review, claiming the determination is in excess of EPA's authority. Supporters argue that the GHG standards are economically feasible and technologically achievable. CARB voted unanimously to retain the standards. On March 24, 2017, CARB voted to retain California's vehicle GHG standards for MY2022-2025 for light-duty vehicles. EPA is reconsidering its MTE determination and plans to issue a new one by April 1, 2018. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers has moved to dismiss its lawsuit. EPA's endangerment finding identified medium- and heavy-duty vehicles as contributors to air pollution. EPA identified medium- and heavy-duty trucks as contributing to endangerment from GHG emissions. Phase 1 and Phase 2 standards were issued for MY2014-2027 trucks and engines. Petitions for review of Phase 2 standards were filed, questioning EPA and NHTSA's authority to regulate trailers. The Racing Enthusiasts & Suppliers Coalition challenged EPA's prohibition on tampering and defeat devices for trailers, arguing it is beyond the scope of the CAA. The court granted motions to intervene from environmental groups and states. California was the first state to adopt auto emission standards in 1966. In 2004, California adopted regulations to reduce GHG emissions in new motor vehicles starting in 2009. The CAA allows states with standards before 1966 to obtain a waiver from EPA. California is the only state with this waiver, but other states can adopt California standards if certain conditions are met. 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted California standards. Based on EPA's records, 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted California standards. CAA Section 209(b) directs EPA to grant waivers unless certain factors warrant denial, providing that EPA \"shall ... waive\" the prohibition on state emission standards \"if the State determines that the State standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.\" If California determines that its standards will be at least as protective as applicable federal standards, EPA can deny the waiver request only if EPA finds that California's determination is arbitrary and capricious or the California standards and enforcement procedures are inconsistent with CAA Section 202(a). In 1977, Congress amended the waiver provision to give California broad discretion in protecting public health. EPA has granted numerous waiver requests to California, including for regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles. In 2017, the Obama Administration granted waiver requests for non-GHG emission standards. If EPA revises its determination, it could affect GHG standards for MY2022-2025. If EPA revises its determination and reduces GHG standards for MY2022-2025 light-duty vehicles, California and states following its standards may have different standards, creating a national patchwork. EPA found that GHG emissions from commercial aircraft contribute to climate change and endanger Americans' health under Section 231 of the CAA, paving the way for setting emission standards. Aircraft manufacturers and airlines have not contested this finding. International negotiations have led to agreements on emission standards for new aircraft and a voluntary offset system. The Clean Air Act (CAA) mandates the EPA to consult with FAA and DOT when developing emission standards for new aircraft. The President can disapprove standards if they pose safety hazards. EPA can set emission standards for nonroad engines if an endangerment finding is made. Section 213 of the Clean Air Act allows petitioners to sue the EPA for unreasonable delays in setting GHG standards for nonroad engines and vehicles. Petitions have been filed for regulation of GHGs from various mobile sources including aircraft, ocean-going ships, motor fuels, locomotives, and construction equipment. In 2010, a lawsuit was filed against the EPA for failing to respond to petitions submitted in 2007 for GHG emissions rulemaking for marine vessels, nonroad vehicles, and aircraft. In 2011, a federal district court ruled that EPA has discretion under Section 213 to issue endangerment findings for GHG emissions from marine vessels and nonroad vehicles. The court clarified that EPA may make endangerment findings if an affirmative finding is made. In 2012, EPA denied petitions to regulate GHG and black carbon emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles, including marine vessels. The executive order in 2017 did not address mobile source GHG emission regulations or EPA's aircraft. The Supreme Court's decision on GHG emissions in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP) affirmed EPA's authority to regulate GHGs from stationary sources under CAA Section 111(b). Stationary sources account for about 73% of the nation's GHG emissions, with electricity production being the largest contributor at 30% of 2014 domestic GHG emissions. EPA and NHTSA would need to initiate a rulemaking to revise or rescind regulations burdening the \"development or use\" of energy resources related to mobile sources. The Court held that the Clean Air Act (CAA) displaced federal common law public nuisance claims regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, as Congress delegated the regulation of GHG emissions to the EPA under CAA Section 111. This section directs the EPA to establish standards of performance for new, modified, or reconstructed stationary sources that significantly contribute to air pollution endangering public health or welfare. These standards, known as new source performance standards (NSPSs), reflect the best system of emission reduction (BSER) that has been adequately demonstrated. EPA considers cost, non-air quality health impacts, and energy in determining the BSER. EPA must consider factors like emission reductions, health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements when establishing standards for new, modified, reconstructed, and existing sources under CAA Section 111(d). This section directs EPA to establish state plan procedures similar to CAA Section 110 guidelines to help states achieve national ambient air quality standards. EPA's Section 111(d) emission guidelines impose binding requirements on states. EPA's Section 111(d) emission guidelines set requirements for states to implement standards for existing sources. In 2011, EPA finalized NSPSs for GHG emissions from new power plants and emission guidelines for existing power plants. The rules have been challenged in court, with the Clean Power Plan (CPP) stayed during litigation. The en banc court heard oral arguments for the CPP in 2016 but has not issued a decision yet. The three-judge panel has scheduled oral argument for April 17, 2017, to resolve litigation challenging the Section 111(b) NSPSs for new power plants. President Trump's executive order directs EPA to review the CPP and GHG standards for new power plants, and to initiate a rulemaking if inconsistent with promoting coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy. The order also requires EPA to review its proposed plan for states not implementing the CPP, and notify the Attorney General of related actions for possible litigation. The Department of Justice filed motions in power plant cases to hold them in abeyance until EPA completes its review of rules. EPA may revise its interpretation of a 1990 amendment to CAA Section 111(d) and reconsider its 2009 endangerment finding. EPA could also rescind the NSPS for new power plants, which is necessary for regulating existing power plants under Section 111(d). EPA may reconsider its 2009 endangerment finding, potentially removing its authority to implement the CPP or issue emission guidelines for existing power plants. Options include revising GHG standards for new power plants and focusing on fenceline GHG reductions for existing plants, impacting ongoing litigation over EPA's authority and regulations. Retaining some version of the GHG power plant rules would demonstrate EPA's fulfillment of its duty to regulate GHG emissions from power plants. The EPA has fulfilled its duty to regulate GHG emissions from power plants through the promulgation of rules. Petroleum refineries have been subject to regulations for various pollutants since 1970, with GHG regulations being addressed through a judicial settlement in 2010. The deadline for final refinery rules was extended multiple times as EPA worked on finalizing NSPSs and emission guidelines for CO2. EPA is finalizing rules to address CO2 emissions from power plants and methane emissions from oil and gas sources. The agency is working diligently to meet its obligations under a settlement agreement, which includes a GHG rule for refineries. Environmental groups and states can sue EPA if obligations are not met. The Obama Administration's CAP focused on controlling methane emissions, a potent climate pollutant. EPA and other agencies developed a \"Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions\" outlining voluntary actions and potential rulemakings. The EPA focused on updating NSPSs and emissions guidelines to reduce methane emissions from landfills and oil/gas sources. The BLM released a rule to address methane venting and flaring on federal lands. EPA proposed updates to landfill NSPSs and guidelines in response to a lawsuit and Obama Administration's goal. EPA published updated NSPSs in 2016 to reduce landfill gas emissions. On August 29, 2016, EPA updated NSPSs to reduce landfill gas emissions from MSW landfills built after July 17, 2014. The rules became effective on October 28, 2016. Industry groups have challenged EPA's 2016 revised emission guidelines for existing MSW landfills in court, questioning EPA's authority to make these revisions under CAA Section 111(d). EPA may potentially revise or rescind these regulations in response to an executive order. EPA's authority to review and revise emission guidelines for existing MSW landfills under CAA Section 111(d) is being challenged in court. A ruling in favor of EPA's authority would allow for future revisions to require additional emission reductions based on new analyses. A new analysis of emission reduction strategies is being considered by the EPA, including potential revisions to the Clean Power Plan in 2023. The EPA issued rules in 2012 and 2016 to limit VOC and methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. A 2017 executive order requires the EPA to review and potentially revise these rules. The March 28, 2017 executive order mandates EPA to review and potentially revise emission reduction rules to align with promoting coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy production. Various states, agencies, and environmental groups have filed petitions and motions regarding the rule, claiming EPA exceeded its authority and failed to make required findings. The EPA is facing legal challenges for exceeding its authority and failing to make required findings regarding methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The Department of Justice has filed a motion to hold the cases in abeyance until EPA completes its review of the rules. In 2016, EPA sent an Information Collection Request to oil and gas companies to regulate methane emissions, but later withdrew it to assess the need for the information. The EPA withdrew an Information Collection Request (ICR) to assess methane emissions from oil and gas companies. This decision came after pressure from state attorneys general and governors. New regulations by BLM aim to reduce methane loss during oil and gas production on federal and Indian leases, requiring comprehensive leak detection and repair programs. The BLM introduced new regulations to reduce methane emissions during oil and gas production on federal and Indian leases. Lessees must recover or flare 85% of methane by 2018, increasing to 95% in 2020 and 98% in 2026. The rule was challenged in court by various industry groups and states, arguing that BLM exceeded its authority. Texas filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit regarding BLM's venting and flaring rule, which took effect on January 27, 2017. Environmental groups and states have intervened in support of the rule, arguing that BLM has the authority to consider environmental impacts on federal lands. Congress is working to repeal the rule, with the House already approving a resolution to disapprove it. The resolution is now being considered in the Senate. The Senate is considering a resolution to disapprove the BLM's venting and flaring rule, which aims to reduce methane pollution and increase natural gas production. Opponents argue that the rule hinders the industry, affects employment, and could raise gas prices. Industry groups claim the rule duplicates existing regulations and voluntary efforts. The executive order requires BLM to review the rule and potentially suspend, revise, or rescind it to align with the Administration's energy production policy. EPA is also interpreting GHG regulations under CAA Section 202. The EPA interpreted mobile source GHG regulations under CAA Section 202 as triggering regulations under the PSD and Title V permitting programs. The PSD program imposes additional requirements for new or modified stationary emission sources in areas that have met or exceeded NAAQSs. It requires preconstruction permits for new major emitting facilities with emission limits based on BACT. The Title V program requires major sources of air pollutants to obtain and operate in compliance with an operating permit. The Supreme Court's decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA rejected EPA's argument that regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions required regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the PSD and Title V programs. The Court clarified that EPA's authority to regulate vehicle GHG emissions does not automatically extend to stationary source GHG emissions under these programs. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court ruled that GHGs are not necessarily included as \"air pollutants\" in all CAA provisions, such as PSD and Title V programs, due to the administrative burden of issuing permits for numerous sources with low emission thresholds. The Court rejected EPA's attempt to raise emission thresholds through the \"Tailoring Rule\" but allowed EPA to implement certain aspects of the PSD program. The Court in UARG allowed EPA to impose the BACT requirement of the PSD program on sources emitting a de minimis amount of GHG emissions when permitting is required for non-GHG pollutants. The decision did not directly impact EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles or fossil-fuel-fired power plants. EPA proposed revisions to PSD and title V regulations in response to the UARG decision. The EPA proposed revisions to existing PSD and title V regulations to prevent sources from needing a permit solely based on GHG emissions above certain thresholds. The proposal included a de minimis threshold of 75,000 tpy CO2-e for GHG emissions under the PSD program. The Trump Administration's finalization of the rule is uncertain, with the comment period closing in December 2016. EPA will continue using the 75,000 tpy CO2-e threshold from the Tailoring Rule to determine BACT requirements for sources. Various environmental statutes mandate federal agencies to consider climate change in their actions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires federal agencies to consider climate change impacts when listing species as endangered or threatened. Lawsuits often challenge how agencies incorporate climate change in their decisions regarding species protection and critical habitat designation. The ESA is primarily administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for terrestrial and freshwater species, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for certain marine species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires federal agencies to consider climate change impacts when listing species as endangered or threatened. Climate change evaluations have long been part of ESA decision making, relying on climate change projections to make determinations related to listing a species or designating critical habitat. Agencies must base their decisions on the best scientific and commercial data available. Various groups have challenged the listing of species and critical habitat in the Arctic region, questioning the use of model-based climate predictions as the \"best scientific and commercial data available\" for ESA decisions. Court reviews of ESA listing decisions are narrow and deferential, but agencies have been faulted for not adequately considering climate change in their decisions. The legal challenges to FWS's listing of the polar bear and its critical habitat show courts applying a narrow standard of review in the climate change context. In Safari Club International v. Salazar, the court upheld the listing based on projected climate change impacts on the species and its habitat, concluding that the polar bear's survival depends on sea ice, which is declining due to climate change. The court upheld the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species based on climate change impacts on its habitat. FWS's reliance on climate projections was deemed justifiable, and the Supreme Court declined to review the case. FWS then moved forward with designating critical habitat for the polar bear. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the designation of 187,000 square miles as critical habitat for the polar bear, based on long-term projections of habitat destruction from climate change. Three areas in Alaska were designated as critical habitat, including a sea ice habitat, a terrestrial denning habitat, and a barrier island habitat. The Ninth Circuit upheld the designation of 187,000 square miles as critical habitat for polar bears, rejecting a narrow interpretation of ESA requirements. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the future of the species and the use of climate science in designating habitat that may become critical due to climate change. The State of Alaska, oil and gas groups, regional organizations, and Alaska Native groups are seeking Supreme Court review of the Ninth Circuit's standards for designating critical habitat for polar bears. Conservation groups oppose the petition, arguing that the Ninth Circuit applied appropriate standards. The Court has not yet decided on reviewing the case. In a separate case, the Ninth Circuit upheld ESA protections for Arctic bearded seals based on climate change projections. The Ninth Circuit upheld ESA protections for Arctic bearded seals in Alaska Oil & Gas Association v. Pritzker, based on climate change models predicting sea ice loss by 2095. Plaintiffs argued the models were unreliable beyond 2050, but the court ruled NMFS can use long-term projections with a reasonable explanation and acknowledgment of limitations. The ESA does not require ironclad evidence for listing decisions. The U.S. District Court of Alaska questions listing decisions based on long-term climate projections, rejecting determinations for the Beringia and ringed seals due to speculative climate change predictions. The court's decision on the ringed seal is being appealed by the FWS and environmental groups. The FWS and environmental groups are appealing the court's decision on the ringed seal to the Ninth Circuit, citing the need to consider climate change projections in ESA decisions. Other courts have criticized federal agencies for not using the best available data on climate change impacts in their ESA rulings. In a separate case, the FWS was found to have acted arbitrarily in withdrawing the proposed listing of the wolverine as threatened. The court found that the FWS acted arbitrarily in withdrawing the proposed listing of the wolverine as threatened due to climate change uncertainties. The court emphasized that the ESA does not require absolute certainty in decision-making and remanded the proposal for further consideration. The court ruled that federal agencies must ensure actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat. NMFS's biological opinion was challenged by environmental groups and found lacking in November 2016. In November 2016, a federal court ruled that NMFS's biological opinion was inadequate due to a lack of consideration for climate change effects on hatchery operations and water use. The court emphasized the importance of addressing climate change impacts in the Northwest region and remanded the matter for further consultation. The federal court ruled NMFS's biological opinion inadequate for not considering climate change effects on hatchery operations and water use in the Northwest region, remanding the matter for further consultation. Uncertainty exists on how decisions on listing and critical habitat in the Arctic region will impact species outside it, with fewer studies to predict climate change impacts on their habitats. Debate over climate change's role in ESA application may be limited by judicial decisions requiring agencies to consider it in their analyses. The March 28, 2017 executive order did not address the Endangered Species Act (ESA) specifically, but agencies may recommend revising or rescinding regulations that burden energy development. The Ninth Circuit cases may lead to potential amendments to the ESA, with discussions on raising the threshold for listing species. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider climate change impacts in their actions and decisions. Courts have ruled that federal agencies must consider climate change impacts in their NEPA analyses if they are serious and connected to the project. The lack of clear guidance led to inconsistent environmental reviews and lawsuits challenging the adequacy of NEPA reviews. In response, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issued final guidance in August 2016 for federal agencies to assess climate change impacts. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued final guidance in August 2016 for federal agencies to assess the impact of their decisions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change when conducting NEPA reviews. Agencies were advised to consider the effects of proposed actions on GHG emissions and the impact of climate change on environmental impacts. Agencies began updating their NEPA procedures to align with the CEQ recommendations, with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issuing guidance in February 2017. In 2017, FERC issued guidance on considering GHG and climate change impacts in NEPA reviews for gas projects. The court may use this guidance in pending litigation over FERC's approval of a gas pipeline. The D.C. Circuit ruled that DOE, not FERC, is responsible for assessing broader climate impacts in gas export NEPA reviews. Environmental groups are challenging DOE's NEPA review for gas export approvals. President Trump's executive order rescinds CEQ's NEPA GHG guidance, but federal agencies still need to consider GHG and climate change impacts. Courts have criticized agencies for not adequately addressing climate change in NEPA reviews. The Social Cost of Carbon estimates economic damages from CO2 emissions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates economic damages from CO2 emissions, including changes in agricultural productivity, human health, property damages, and ecosystem services due to climate change. Federal agencies have used SCC in rulemakings and environmental reviews, with courts focusing on agencies' justification for its use. In Zero Zone, Inc. v. Department of Energy, a federal court upheld the use of SCC in a cost-benefit analysis. In Zero Zone, Inc. v. Department of Energy (DOE), the court upheld the use of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in a cost-benefit analysis for energy efficiency standards. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 directs the DOE to develop mandatory energy conservation standards, which must be technologically feasible and economically justified. In 2014, new energy efficiency standards for commercial refrigeration equipment were established, with petitioners claiming DOE abused its discretion by considering environmental factors in the decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the use of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in DOE's cost-benefit analysis for energy efficiency standards. The court emphasized the importance of considering environmental costs and ruled that DOE had the authority to use the SCC. Previous judicial decisions have criticized agencies for not accounting for carbon emissions costs in their analyses. In 2008, the Ninth Circuit ruled that agencies must consider the impacts of GHG emissions in cost-benefit analysis, even with uncertainty. The court emphasized the importance of valuing carbon emission reduction and stated that it is possible to monetize this benefit. Some courts have also reviewed the use of the Social Cost of Carbon in environmental reviews of proposed agency actions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) has been used by agencies to evaluate GHG impacts in environmental reviews for federal actions under NEPA. A court decision in 2014 criticized the failure to justify why the SCC was not used to quantify costs in a coal exploration plan, stating it was arbitrary and capricious. The court emphasized the importance of considering SCC estimates in environmental assessments. The court criticized the failure to consider the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in environmental reviews, stating it was unacceptable to treat the cost as zero when SCC estimates did not include that possibility. BLM's environmental reviews are being challenged in court for not assessing climate impacts using economic or scientific tools. WildEarth Guardians and Physicians for Social Responsibility filed a complaint to vacate authorizations for oil and gas leases on public lands, alleging violations of NEPA. The D.C. Circuit upheld an agency's environmental review that did not use SCC. The D.C. Circuit upheld an agency's environmental review under NEPA that did not use the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to quantify potential GHG impacts from a project. FERC acknowledged the availability of the SCC tool but explained that it would not be \"appropriate\" or \"informative\" due to significant variation in output and lack of incremental impact measurement. The court concluded that FERC acted reasonably in finding that the SCC was \"inadequately accurate\" for its environmental review of a liquid natural gas facility conversion project. The D.C. Circuit upheld an agency's environmental review under NEPA that did not use the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to quantify potential GHG impacts from a project. The courts faulted agencies for not articulating why the SCC was not used, and the EPA's regulatory impact analysis in the CPP litigation is being questioned for assessing domestic costs against global benefits and relying on the SCC. EPA argues that it reasonably explained its benefit-cost analysis accounting for global benefits, citing a previous case. The EPCA allows DOE to consider international factors for global benefits, unlike the CAA. The Trump Administration withdrew SCC guidance and disbanded the Interagency Workgroup on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases. Federal agencies may still need to consider carbon costs in rulemakings. The executive order directs agencies to follow OMB Circular A-4 for monetizing GHG emissions changes. OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on conducting cost-benefit analysis, mentioning climate change costs once. Federal courts face procedural barriers in climate change suits, requiring plaintiffs to establish standing based on constitutional requirements. To establish standing in climate change suits, courts require plaintiffs to meet three constitutional requirements: alleging a personal injury-in-fact, showing injury traceable to the defendant's conduct, and demonstrating likelihood of redress. State standing in climate change cases was pivotal in landmark decisions like Massachusetts v. EPA and American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut. The parens patriae doctrine allows states to sue on behalf of their citizens to protect them. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court focused on whether the state had standing to sue and found that it met all three factors for standing: injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability. The Court determined that the loss of Massachusetts shore land from sea level rise was an injury-in-fact, even if shared with other coastal states. The Court found that the loss of Massachusetts shore land from sea level rise was a particular and concrete injury, and that there was a causal relationship between GHG emissions and climate change. Even a small reduction in worldwide GHG emissions through litigation was deemed sufficient for standing purposes. Massachusetts sought a remedy of regulating GHG emissions. The Court found that Massachusetts had standing due to the concrete injury of shore land loss from sea level rise caused by GHG emissions. Massachusetts sought a remedy of regulating GHG emissions to slow or reduce climate change. In a subsequent case, American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court addressed standing in climate change suits without directly ruling on non-state parties' standing. The AEP decision left unresolved whether non-state petitioners have standing under Article III in climate change suits. The issue of tribal parens patriae standing was rejected in the case of Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp, where an Alaskan native village sought damages for coastal erosion caused by GHG emissions. The court dismissed the village's lawsuit for lack of standing, as they failed to prove a direct connection between their coastal erosion problem and the specific greenhouse gas emissions of the defendants. The claim was also deemed nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine, which reserves policy questions for the political branches of government. Non-state plaintiffs have struggled to establish standing in climate change-related litigation, with the precedent set in Massachusetts not necessarily extending to them. Non-state plaintiffs seeking standing in nonstatutory causes of action have faced challenges, with the precedent set in Massachusetts not necessarily extending to them. While most climate change litigation focuses on government regulation of GHG emissions, private plaintiffs have also tried to force emitting sources to reduce emissions or claim damages for their contributions to climate change. Threshold barriers to litigation often involve federal court jurisdiction over the claim brought. Efforts to hold emitters accountable for climate change through common law nuisance claims have been largely unsuccessful due to jurisdictional barriers. These cases have been dismissed based on the court's lack of jurisdiction and the political question doctrine, which limits courts from interfering in policy decisions. Standing and justiciability are key factors in determining the outcome of these cases. The Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr in 1962 established that some cases are nonjusticiable due to being constitutionally committed to other branches of government or requiring initial policy determinations. This doctrine has been a focal point in climate change litigation, with courts rejecting nuisance claims like in Comer v. Murphy Oil USA where property owners sought damages for GHG emissions contributing to Hurricane Katrina. The court deemed the claims nonjusticiable political questions due to lack of judicially discoverable standards and the need for policy determinations. The Supreme Court has established that some cases are nonjusticiable due to being constitutionally committed to other branches of government or requiring initial policy determinations. This has been a focal point in climate change litigation, with courts rejecting nuisance claims for money damages for alleged contribution to climate change. The courts have dismissed these cases as nonjusticiable political questions, stating that the allocation of fault and cost of global warming should be determined by the executive or legislative branch. Some cases were also dismissed because the claims were displaced by the Clean Air Act. Federal common law may be displaced where Congress addresses a question previously governed by federal common law. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act displaces federal common law claims, such as nuisance, against entities for alleged injuries from GHG emissions. This decision applies to both injunctive relief and monetary damages. The availability of state common law claims for reducing GHG emissions remains uncertain. The Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the Clean Air Act displaces federal common law claims related to GHG emissions. Congress is considering amending the CAA to remove EPA's authority, potentially allowing a resurgence of common law nuisance claims. The House is reviewing H.R. 637 to exclude GHGs from CAA regulation. The AEP decision currently displaces common-law-based climate change claims, but jurisdictional issues are being raised in a recent case. In November 2016, an Oregon federal district court judge denied the U.S. government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a group of individuals, including minors, seeking to compel the government to reduce CO2 emissions. The case, Juliana v. United States, is part of a campaign coordinated by Our Children's Trust related to climate change litigation. The plaintiffs allege that federal officials promoted policies contributing to climate change despite knowing the dangers. This lawsuit may potentially lead to further actions to address climate change through litigation. The federal government is being sued to phase out fossil fuel emissions and stabilize the climate system. The lawsuit includes claims of violations of due process rights and the public trust doctrine. The court has jurisdiction over the case and may grant relief if the plaintiffs' facts are proven true. The court's treatment of the plaintiffs' public trust claim in the context of climate change litigation may represent a unique ruling. The public trust doctrine, a common law principle, involves the government's duty to safeguard natural resources for the public's benefit. While the court did not decide if the atmosphere is part of the public trust, it left open the possibility of a future ruling that the doctrine creates a federal duty to protect the atmosphere. No court has ruled on the merits of an \"atmospheric public trust\" claim against the federal government. The court has not ruled on the merits of an \"atmospheric public trust\" claim against the federal government. State courts have differing views on similar claims against state governments. Litigation is progressing with discovery, despite efforts to depose Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The Trump Administration and industry groups are seeking appeals to delay the trial. Congress is facing questions on climate change regulation and policy. Congress is facing questions on climate change regulation and policy, with the Administration seeking additional time during litigation to consider next steps. Agency actions resulting from compliance with an executive order may impact ongoing litigation and reshape GHG regulation in the United States."
