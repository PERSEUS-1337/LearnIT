    "content": "In this paper, the authors propose enhancements to the VAE framework for learning powerful global representations of complex data, specifically natural images. By incorporating spatial information in the stochastic layers, they achieve significant improvements in performance on various image datasets. The combination of feature map parameterization of stochastic variables with the autoregressive PixelCNN approach yields state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. Surprisingly, high-quality image generation is possible with just one forward-pass, even without the autoregressive component. Representation learning aims to learn a latent distribution that explains data well, crucial for tasks like generative modeling and semi-supervised learning. Variational auto-encoders (VAE) offer a way to disentangle internal data representations through stochastic latent variables. However, VAEs make simplifying assumptions that limit their ability to capture local structures in complex data distributions with temporal dependencies. The limitations of VAE in capturing local structures and learning complex data distributions have led to efforts to improve its performance. These include using a more expressive variational distribution and incorporating a deeper hierarchy of latent variables. However, challenges remain in modeling data distributions without conditional independence. The limitations of VAE have sparked interest in other generative models like GANs and Pixel-CNN/RNN models. Combining VAEs with PixelCNNs has shown promise in learning good generative models. The decoding architecture of VAE with recurrent neural networks can lead to unused latent stochastic variables. The Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoder (FAME) combines top-down variational approximation with a hierarchical structure, utilizing stochastic latent variables for global and local structure learning. Despite its complexity, FAME does not outperform a simple autoregressive model. The Feature Map Variational Auto-Encoder (FAME) utilizes a top-down variational approximation with a spatial representation of stochastic latent variables and an autoregressive decoder. FAME outperforms previous state-of-the-art loglikelihood on various datasets and learns a deep hierarchy of stochastic latent variables without inactivated units. Removing the autoregressive decoder still allows FAME to perform well, suggesting good generation quality with just one forward pass. The Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) uses a variational approximation to model the posterior distribution, optimizing an evidence lower-bound (ELBO) to the log-likelihood. The hierarchical structure allows the VAE to learn different representations of data through its stochastic variables, from local to global features. The VAE is regularized by down-weighting the KL-divergence with a temperature term to prevent collapse towards not using the full hierarchy of latent variables. This approach is applied during the initial phase of optimization to scale down the regularizing effect. In the context of VAEs, inactive latent variables can result from overly powerful decoder parameterization. To address this, the Variational Lossy AutoEncoder (VLAE) introduces an architecture that captures global and local structures. Utilizing inverse autoregressive flows allows for more expressive posterior approximations. PixelVAE simplifies the generative model with a factorizing decomposition in the variational approximation, resulting in a less flexible model. FAME extends VAEs with a top-down variational approximation similar to LVAE, incorporating spatial stochastic latent layers and an autoregressive decoder for expressive latent variables in a deep hierarchy. The variational distribution in FAME shares parameters with the generative model, combining information from the prior and data distribution. The variational approximation in FAME combines information from the prior and data distribution using fully factorized Gaussian distributions for stochastic latent variables. The model parameterizes mean and variance functions based on the data and generative model, yielding excellent results for densely connected networks. Previous contributions have used convolutions in deterministic layers connecting the stochastic latent variables. In FAME, the stochastic latent layers are extended to be convolutional, increasing model expressiveness by capturing spatial composition of data. The top layer is a fully-connected dense layer for conditioning on a prior and sampling from a generative model. The architecture includes convolutional neural networks and layers for the stochastic latent variables. In FAME, the PixelCNN architecture is introduced in the generative model for image generation. During training, input is concatenated with reconstruction data and passed through PixelCNN. When generating samples, images are generated pixel by pixel autoregressively from fixed stochastic latent variables. FAME is tested on images to compare with other generative models. The study evaluates generative models on various image datasets, including gray-scaled and natural images. Different distributions are assumed for modeling the images, such as Bernoulli for gray-scaled and Categorical for natural images. The evaluation includes negative log-likelihood performance on MNIST datasets and the use of the PixelCNN architecture in the generative model. The study evaluates generative models on gray-scaled and natural images using different distributions. It applies the 256-way Softmax approach for evaluation and uses a hierarchy of 5 stochastic latent variables. Batchnormalization and ReLU activation functions are used, along with a PixelCNN architecture with 4 residual blocks for generation. The process scales linearly with the input image size.

The parameterization FAME No Concatenation is defined to remove input concatenation dependency, allowing for one forward-pass through the generative model. The Adam optimizer with a constant learning rate of 0.0003 is applied for optimization, along with importance weighted sampling and temperature scaling during training epochs. The MNIST dataset is used for benchmarking, showing faster convergence rates with FAME compared to a regular LVAE. The architecture of the FAME model includes a convolutional layer with specific parameters for gray-scaled and natural images. Significant improvement is observed on the dynamically binarized MNIST dataset, but not on the statically binarized MNIST dataset. The FAME model showed improved performance compared to the VLAE model, without the need for autoregressive generation. There was no significant difference in KL divergence between FAME and FAME No Concatenation. FAME used 10.85 nats on average to encode images, while FAME No Concatenation used 12.29 nats. Negative log-likelihood performance of various models is shown in Figure 3. The study by Gregor et al. (2016) demonstrated significant improvements in negative log-likelihood performance on OMNIGLOT using the FAME model compared to previous state-of-the-art models. The LVAE showed tighter ELBO compared to VAE, with L 1 ELBO values of 80.11 nats for MNIST and 86.62 nats for OMNIGLOT. The study by Gregor et al. (2016) showed significant improvements in negative log-likelihood using the FAME model on OMNIGLOT. The top latent stochastic layer is not collapsing into its prior, with KL values of 5.04 nats for MNIST and 3.67 nats for OMNIGLOT. Experimentation was done on masking the contribution from the concatenated image or FAME decoder output before feeding into PixelCNN layers. Performance of FAME was investigated on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. The study by Gregor et al. (2016) demonstrated improvements in negative log-likelihood using the FAME model on OMNIGLOT. The top latent stochastic layer avoids collapsing into its prior. Experimentation included masking the contribution from the concatenated image or FAME decoder output before feeding into PixelCNN layers. Performance of FAME was evaluated on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, showing superior results on both. The FAME model shows promising results on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, capturing spatial correlations in images and generating sharp samples without additional autoregressive runtime complexity. The 32x32 ImageNet dataset outperformed the 64x64 models, while FAME No Concatenation performed close to state-of-the-art results. FAME, an extension to VAE, improves performance on benchmark datasets by incorporating feature map representations in latent variables. Results without input image concatenation show comparable performance without autoregressive generation. Future directions include testing on larger image datasets with higher resolution. Future directions for FAME include testing on larger image datasets with higher resolution, expanding the model to capture other data modalities like audio and text, and combining the model in a semi-supervised framework."
