    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medical Technology, Public Health, and Innovation Act of 1997\". References in the Act are considered to be made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Act includes findings and a mission statement. The Congress finds that the United States is losing its leadership role in producing innovative medical devices due to the lengthy regulatory process by the FDA, impacting patient care. Delayed patient access to new medical technology in the United States results in lost opportunities to save lives, reduce hospitalization and recovery time, and improve patient quality of life. The slow and unpredictable regulatory process at the FDA threatens the economic benefits provided by the US medical device industry, leading companies to shift research and manufacturing offshore. This legislation aims to improve the medical device approval process in the United States by using recognized performance standards, enhancing communication between companies and the FDA, and focusing resources on devices with serious health consequences. The legislation aims to improve the medical device approval process by focusing on recognized performance standards, enhancing communication with the FDA, and prioritizing devices with serious health consequences. It also requires the FDA to determine the most cost-effective approach to ensuring device safety and effectiveness. SEC. 3. DEVICE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. Amended Section 514 to include recognition of a performance standard. The Secretary can issue notices listing recognized performance standards for device certification. Individuals can use alternative data to meet Act requirements. The Secretary can remove standards no longer suitable. Certification of device conformity to standards is allowed. The Secretary can request data from individuals who submit certifications for device conformity. Certifications must be maintained for 2 years or the device's expected design life. Falsification of certifications or failure to provide requested data is prohibited under Section 301. Section 501(e) (21 U.S.C. 351(e)) is amended by adding \"listed\" to \"established\" as requested by the Secretary. SEC. 4. PREMARKET APPROVAL. In amending Section 515(c) (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)), the Secretary may accept historical clinical data as a control for determining device safety and effectiveness. The sponsor of an application cannot be required by the Secretary. The Secretary may not require sponsors to conduct randomized controlled clinical trials for devices unless necessary, feasible, and no other less burdensome controls are available. In making approval decisions, the Secretary relies on proposed labeling conditions. The Secretary relies on proposed labeling conditions for determining safety and effectiveness of devices. Applications must be reviewed within 180 days, with no alterations allowed without applicant consent. The Secretary must meet with the applicant within 100 days of receiving an application that meets content requirements to disclose any deficiencies. The applicant has the right to written information about the meeting. The Secretary will expedite the review of devices for life-threatening conditions if they represent breakthrough technologies, offer significant advantages over existing alternatives, or if accelerated availability is in the best interest of public health. The Secretary must complete the review of supplemental applicants within 90 days if they do not contain clinical data. A supplemental application is required for any change that affects safety or effectiveness, except for manufacturing modifications. Incremental changes to device design affecting safety or effectiveness will be approved by the Secretary. The Secretary approves device supplements based on nonclinical and clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness. Additional clinical data may be required if necessary. Promotional materials for approved devices do not require premarket approval unless new conditions of use are established. Promotional materials for approved devices must be supported by data to substantiate representations. Section 5155(e)(1) is amended to include withdrawal or temporary suspension of approval. SEC. 5. PREMARKET NOTIFICATION. Exemption of certain devices from premarket notification requirements under section 510 (21 U.S.C. 360) is amended to include devices classified into class I or II under section 513 or 520. The Secretary must review notifications within 90 days and develop guidelines within 30 days of enactment. The Secretary will publish a list of class II devices exempt from reporting requirements. Anyone can petition for exemption within 120 days of publication. Class I devices exempt from notification requirements under section 510(k) do not include life-sustaining, life-saving, or devices intended for implantation in the human body. SEC. 6. INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION. The text chunk discusses amendments to regulations regarding the approval of clinical studies under section 520(g) of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary is required to make changes to the procedures for the approval of clinical studies, including allowing sponsors to meet with the Secretary before submitting an application and requiring written agreement on the study protocol. The Secretary is allowed to make changes to devices during investigations without additional approval if the changes do not significantly alter the design or operation principles and do not compromise patient safety. Each change must be documented with reasoning for not constituting a significant design change. The Secretary can make changes to devices during investigations without extra approval if they do not significantly alter design or operation principles and do not compromise patient safety. Amendments are made to specific sections to reflect these changes. SEC. 7 PRODUCT REVIEW. Section 513 (21 U.S.C. 360c) is amended to include considerations for postmarket controls in evaluating device effectiveness for approval under section 515, aiming to expedite effectiveness determinations without increasing regulatory burdens. The Secretary will meet with applicants to determine the scientific evidence needed to demonstrate device effectiveness for approval under section 515. Within 30 days of the meeting, the Secretary will specify the required evidence, including clinical data, to establish device effectiveness. The Secretary will determine the necessary data to establish device effectiveness for approval under section 515. The determination will be binding unless it goes against public health. Additionally, the Secretary will consider postmarket controls to expedite device classification and request information to differentiate devices with varying technological characteristics. The Secretary will request necessary information for substantial equivalence determinations based on intended uses proposed in labeling. Representations in promotional materials may not require a report under section 510(k) unless they establish new intended uses for a device."
