    "content": "Designation of Salt Pond Visitor Center at Cape Cod National Seashore. Tip O'Neill, born in 1912 in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, was nicknamed \"Tip\" and attended Boston College. He ran for a Cambridge City Council seat during his senior year and was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1936 as a New Deal Democrat. Tip O'Neill's political philosophy was influenced by his upbringing in working-class Boston and his strong Catholic faith, leading him to see government as a way to help the disadvantaged. In 1949, he became the first Democratic Speaker in the Massachusetts State Legislature and later successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives. In 1958, he introduced legislation with Representative Edward Boland to protect land on Cape Cod as a national seashore. The legislation introduced by Tip O'Neill in the 85th Congress established a 40-mile National Park along the outer beach of Cape Cod, including lighthouses, cultural landscapes, and wild cranberry bogs. Henry David Thoreau described the area as a unique, cherished jewel of nature. Representative O'Neill strongly advocated for the establishment of the Cape Cod National Seashore, cosponsoring bills and testifying at hearings. The legislation aimed to preserve the natural marvels of the area, including beaches, moors, marshes, forests, and ponds. President Kennedy signed the bill into law in 1961, and the Seashore was formally established in 1966, with O'Neill attending the inauguration ceremony. In 1966, the Salt Pond Visitor Center was inaugurated at the Cape Cod National Seashore, which has become a national treasure enjoyed by millions of visitors. Tip O'Neill, a former Member of Congress, maintained a home in Harwich Port and frequented the National Seashore. O'Neill's political skills and leadership led him to become Majority Whip in 1971 and House Majority Leader in 1973. Tip O'Neill's significant achievements include brokering a peace accord in Northern Ireland with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, retiring from Congress in 1987 after 50 years of public service, and holding the longest continuous term as Speaker of the House. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush awarded Tip O'Neill the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his accomplishments and dedication to his constituents. The Salt Pond Visitor Center at Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts was designated as the \"Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center\" in recognition of O'Neill's support for the protection of natural resources. Any reference to the center in official documents will now be to the new name. The Secretary of the Interior may post an interpretive sign at the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center, including information on O'Neill's contributions as a Member of the United States House of Representatives and his efforts in preserving the Cape Cod National Seashore and other National Parks in Massachusetts."
