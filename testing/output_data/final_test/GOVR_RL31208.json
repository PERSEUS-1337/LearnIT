L. 107-56, 15 Stat. 272 (2001), became law on October 26, 2001, including Title III, the \"International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001.\" This legislation aims to prevent terrorists from using the U.S. financial system to move funds obtained from illegal activities. The USA PATRIOT ACT aims to prevent terrorists from using the U.S. financial system for illegal activities by imposing new requirements on banks and other financial institutions to prevent international money laundering and financing of terrorism. The USA PATRIOT ACT aims to prevent terrorists from using the U.S. financial system for illegal activities by imposing new requirements on banks and other financial institutions to prevent international money laundering and financing of terrorism. The legislation contains over forty sections, addressing criminal and civil proceedings, enhancing penalties for financial crimes, and granting the Secretary of the Treasury authority to impose special measures on financial institutions deemed of \"primary money laundering concern.\" The USA PATRIOT ACT imposes new requirements on financial institutions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. It includes provisions for increased due diligence, cooperation with government requests, and anti-money laundering programs. The full impact will be seen over time as implementing regulations are developed. The legislation builds on existing laws prohibiting money laundering and financial transactions involving illegal activity. 18 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1956 prohibits engaging in such transactions, with penalties for violations. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970, along with its major component, the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, require reports and records of transactions involving cash, negotiable instruments, or foreign currency to prevent money laundering. The regulations require banks to maintain records of transactions with a high degree of usefulness in investigations. Banks must submit Suspicious Activity Reports for transactions involving at least $5,000 that are suspected to involve illegal funds or have no lawful purpose. Violation of these regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties. Under the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, the Secretary of the Treasury must establish a system to register money transmitting businesses by December 31, 2001. Some immediate provisions include the prohibition on U.S. correspondent accounts with shell banks and the requirement for covered financial institutions to provide records within 120 hours of a regulator's request. Banks holding correspondent accounts for foreign banks must maintain records identifying owners and authorized agents for legal process. Due diligence standards are required to detect and report money laundering by financial institutions with private banking or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. Enhanced standards apply to certain correspondent accounts, while minimum standards are specified for private banking accounts with minimum deposits of $1 million. Private banking accounts with minimum deposits of $1 million are managed by a liaison between the bank and the beneficial owner, held for foreign owners. Special measures can be imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury upon finding a jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account to be of primary money laundering concern. Factors considered include involvement with organized crime or terrorists, bank secrecy laws, and the existence of a mutual legal assistance treaty. Special measures may be imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury on jurisdictions or financial institutions deemed to be of primary money laundering concern. Factors considered include organized crime, terrorism, bank secrecy laws, and corruption. These measures involve detailed record-keeping and reporting requirements related to transactions and account ownership. Prohibitions may include maintaining payable-through or correspondent accounts, with consultation required with various federal agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury can impose special measures on financial institutions, including banks, to combat money laundering. These measures require detailed record-keeping and reporting on transactions and account ownership. Financial institutions must establish policies to detect and report money laundering through private banking or correspondent accounts for foreign entities. The Secretary must define \"beneficial ownership\" and issue regulations within 120 days for these measures to remain in effect. Enhanced due diligence policies are required for correspondent accounts for foreign banks operating under offshore licenses or designated for special measures. U.S. banks must secure ownership information, maintain enhanced scrutiny, and ascertain due diligence information for foreign banks providing correspondent banking services. For foreign private banking clients with aggregated deposits of $1,000,000, information on account owners must be secured. Sec. 313 prohibits U.S. banks from maintaining correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks with no physical presence in any country. Covered institutions must take steps to prevent providing services to such shell banks through other banks. Sec. 314 mandates regulations to enhance cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement to share information on individuals involved in terrorist acts or money laundering. Financial institutions must designate persons to receive and monitor information, with strict procedures to protect shared data for identifying and reporting suspicious activities. Financial institutions using this information for these purposes are not liable for unauthorized disclosure under any law or regulation. The Secretary must provide a semiannual report on analyzing suspicious activity reports. Sec. 315 adds foreign corruption offenses to the list of money laundering predicates, including crimes of violence, bribery of public officials, theft of public funds, smuggling violations, and certain U.S. criminal code offenses. The right to raise an innocent property or innocent owner defense in terrorist-related confiscations or forfeitures is also included. Prior to the USAPATRIOT Act, the President could order the vesting of seized foreign assets under the Trading With the Enemy Act. The new law now allows the President to confiscate property of foreign entities when the US is engaged in armed hostilities or attacked by foreign entities. Sec. 316 of the USAPATRIOT Act allows for judicial review of confiscation of terrorist-related assets and provides defenses for property owners. It also permits the government to use otherwise inadmissible evidence in court if national security is at risk. Additionally, it grants the right to raise Constitutional and Administrative Procedure Act claims, and preserves other legal remedies. Sec. 317 provides jurisdiction over foreign persons for money laundering offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 1956 and 1957, with the district courts authorized to appoint a receiver. Sec. 318 covers money laundering through a foreign bank, while Sec. 319 allows forfeiture of funds in U.S. interbank accounts held by foreign banks. Sec. 319, effective within 60 days of enactment, amends the Currency and Transaction Reporting Act to require U.S. financial institutions to provide information on compliance with anti-money laundering requirements within 120 hours. It also allows the Attorney General to suspend or terminate forfeiture actions on conflict-of-law grounds or in the interest of justice. The Sec. 319 amendment requires U.S. financial institutions to provide information on anti-money laundering compliance within 120 hours. It also allows the Secretary of the Treasury or the Attorney General to subpoena records from foreign banks with correspondent accounts in the U.S. and mandates U.S. institutions to maintain records identifying foreign bank owners and authorized U.S. residents for legal process. Financial institutions must provide names and addresses to law enforcement within 7 days and terminate correspondent accounts within 10 days if a foreign bank fails to comply with a subpoena.

Sec. 321 expands the list of financial institutions subject to the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act to include credit unions and CFTC-regulated entities. Sec. 322 prohibits corporations with fugitive majority stockholders from making innocent owner claims in forfeiture cases. Sec. 323 allows U.S. district courts to enforce foreign confiscations for any offense under foreign law. U.S. district courts can enforce foreign confiscations for offenses under foreign law that would result in forfeiture under U.S. law. Sec. 324 mandates a report on international counter-money laundering measures within 30 months. Sec. 325 allows the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate concentration accounts at financial institutions. Regulations may include prohibiting clients from directing transactions through these accounts and requiring written documentation of all transactions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in conjunction with financial regulators, must establish procedures for identifying customers opening accounts at financial institutions, including verifying customer identity and checking against government lists of terrorists. Additionally, a report must be submitted to Congress within six months recommending a system for accurately identifying foreign nationals opening accounts. Sec. 327 and Sec. 328 of the bill focus on combating money laundering by requiring financial institutions to review information held by government agencies to verify identities of foreign nationals opening accounts and encouraging foreign governments to include the name of the originator in wire transfer instructions. The Secretary must report annually on progress towards disbursement. Sec. 329 criminalizes bribery in connection with the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001. Sec. 330 emphasizes international cooperation in money laundering investigations. Sec. 351 amends the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act to extend safe harbor provisions for financial institutions and their employees who provide information on possible law violations to any federal government agency. Immunity is provided for disclosures of possible law violations made voluntarily, including those required by employees or agents of institutions. Previously, immunity only covered disclosures of law or regulation violations, with no specific immunity for those requiring disclosures, and only extended to liability under U.S. laws or regulations. Sec. 352 requires financial institutions to develop anti-money laundering programs, including internal policies, compliance officer designation, employee training, and independent audits. The Secretary of the Treasury can set minimum standards and exempt certain institutions. Sec. 353 extends penalties under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act to include violations of geographic targeting orders and willful violations of regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. It considers the size, location, and activities of financial institutions in prescribing regulations. Before the enactment of USA-PATRIOT, violations of regulations issued under various sections of the U.S. Code carried civil penalties ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, with criminal penalties including fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. The prohibitions on structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements were also extended. The USA-PATRIOT Act extends the prohibitions on structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements to cover geographic targeting orders and recordkeeping requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. It also extends the length of geographic targeting orders and includes data on funding international terrorism in the annual anti-money laundering strategy. Additionally, it authorizes depository institutions to disclose suspicions of illegal activity in written employment references. The USA-PATRIOT Act extends prohibitions on structuring transactions to cover geographic targeting orders and recordkeeping requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.

Regulations are also prescribed for futures commission merchants, commodity trading advisors, and commodity pool operators. Recommendations for effective regulations under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act for investment companies are required within one year of enactment. Trusts and personal holding companies may be required to disclose beneficial owners when opening accounts. Sec. 357 of the USA-PATRIOT Act requires trusts and personal holding companies to disclose beneficial owners when opening accounts at depository institutions. Sec. 358 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to refer suspicious activity reports to U.S. intelligence agencies for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. The USA-PATRIOT Act authorizes the release of information to U.S. intelligence agencies for intelligence or counterintelligence activities to protect against international terrorism. It includes reporting of suspicious activities by underground banking systems. The USA-PATRIOT Act subjects underground banking systems to financial regulations and reporting requirements under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act. It also mandates a report on whether further legislation is needed for these systems, including potentially lowering the threshold for reporting suspicious activities. Sec. 360 authorizes the President to direct U.S. executive directors of international financial institutions to support countries contributing to U.S. anti-terrorism efforts and prevent funds from going to terrorism supporters. International financial institutions listed include the IMF, World Bank, and regional development banks. Sec. 361 enacts 31 U.S.C. to empower the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Sec. 361 enacts 31 U.S.C. to transform FinCEN into a statutory bureau within the Treasury Department, headed by a Director appointed by the Secretary. It is tasked with maintaining a data access service for anti-money laundering information, analyzing and disseminating data to law enforcement and regulatory officials to identify criminal activity and violations. FinCEN is responsible for establishing a financial crimes communications center to provide intelligence information to law enforcement authorities, financial institutions, and regulatory agencies to combat terrorism, organized crime, money laundering, and other financial crimes. It also assists in tracking and controlling foreign assets for compliance with criminal and tax laws. The Secretary of the Treasury delegates anti-money laundering reporting requirements to FinCEN. Procedures are prescribed for efficient data access and dissemination, including Internet report submission and prompt review of suspicious activity reports. Access procedures must comply with the Privacy Act and the Right to Financial Privacy Act. The Secretary of the Treasury authorizes appropriations for improving compliance with reporting requirements related to foreign currency transactions. A highly secure network in FinCEN is to be established for financial institutions to electronically file reports and receive alerts on suspicious activities. Civil and criminal penalties for money laundering are increased. Sec. 363 amends 31 U.S.C. to allow for increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of suspicious activity reporting requirements. Sec. 364 authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations for personnel to act as law enforcement officers to protect Federal Reserve facilities. Sec. 365 adds a new section to the anti-money laundering reporting requirements, requiring anyone in a trade or business who receives $10,000 in coins or currency to file a report to FinCEN. The report must include details of the transaction and exemptions are made for reports filed by financial institutions. Sec. 366 requires the Secretary to study expanding the statutory exemption system to currency transaction reporting requirements, authorizing exemptions for transactions with various entities and qualified business customers from domestic currency and coin reporting requirements. The study aims to improve financial institutions' use of these exemptions. The study aims to improve financial institutions' use of exemptions to reduce unnecessary reports for law enforcement purposes. A new criminal offense involves knowingly concealing and transporting over $10,000 in or out of the United States, with potential imprisonment and forfeiture of property. The Supreme Court ruled against forfeiture in a case involving carrying a large sum of cash legitimately. The Supreme Court found the penalty for carrying a large sum of cash disproportionate and a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The offense was deemed a reporting offense, not illegal, leading to the decision against forfeiture. Criminal and civil forfeiture procedures apply to violations of reporting requirements for monetary instruments.

It carries federal penalties of up to five years' imprisonment, fines, and property forfeiture. Sec. 374 addresses counterfeiting domestic currency and obligations.
