    "content": "Debate over the creation of a federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) position has been ongoing for the past five years as Congress addresses government IT organizational and management issues. The idea of a federal CIO located in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was initially considered in the Clinger-Cohen Act in 1995, but was dropped in favor of creating CIO positions within executive agencies. The growing interest in better managing government technology resources led to renewed attention on creating a national CIO position during the 106th Congress. Some observers called for a federal CIO to coordinate online governmental functions and services. The success of CIOs in the private sector and the experience of local and state governments with CIOs influenced the push for establishing a federal CIO. The idea of a federal CIO was dropped in favor of agency-level CIOs following a Senate hearing in July 1995. Critics argued that the operational nature of the CIO position did not align with the traditional policy role of OMB and that creating a federal CIO would add another layer of bureaucracy. Critics argued against creating a federal CIO, stating it would add bureaucracy and centralize decision-making, contrary to the Clinger-Cohen Act's goal of decentralization. They believed the role was too large for one person or agency to handle effectively. As a result, Congress opted for agency-level CIOs instead. The Chief Information Officers Council was established by President Clinton following the passage of P.L. 104-106. It provides advice and assistance to ensure information technology is acquired and managed in line with federal regulations and agency priorities. The CIO Council, established in 1996 under Order 13011, serves as the main interagency forum for improving agency information resource practices. Comprised of CIOs and Deputy CIOs from federal departments and agencies, it meets monthly with committees focusing on IT management concerns like interoperability, security, and e-government to promote government standards and compliance with reform legislation. The CIO Council, established in 1996 under Order 13011, serves as the main interagency forum for improving agency information resource practices. The Council's materials are used by the General Accounting Office (GAO) to inform its methodology for evaluating IT management progress. It has also collaborated with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to develop special pay rates for hard-to-hire IT professionals. Policymakers made proposals for a federal CIO during the 106th Congress, with new bills introduced in the 107th Congress. Key provisions of relevant bills are summarized in S. 1993 (Thompson), Government Information Security Act. The Chief Information Officer of the United States Act of 2000 outlines policies for managing programs that support cost-effective security of Federal information systems. It requires continuous risk management, implementation of controls, awareness of security risks, monitoring of security policy, and evaluation of security practices. Each agency is responsible for developing and implementing an agency-wide security plan. Additionally, the Act establishes an Office of Information Technology in the Executive Office of the President. The Chief Information Officer of the United States Act of 2000 establishes an Office of Information Technology in the Executive Office of the President to provide technical, policy, and management analysis for the development and management of information technology by the federal government. It also creates a Chief Information Officers Council to assist in the development and implementation of federal policies related to information technology. The Chief Information Officer of the United States Act of 2000 establishes the Office of the President to be headed by a Chief Information Officer (CIO) who advises the President on information technology matters. The Officer's duties include developing government-wide security policies and addressing risk management. During the 2000 Presidential campaign, both major party candidates expressed support for establishing a federal CIO to coordinate e-government initiatives and facilitate federal information technology management. The Bush Administration designated the Deputy Director of OMB as the federal CIO, while Senator Lieberman also supported the idea of a federal CIO or \"IT Czar\" to work on e-government efforts and coordinate interagency projects. Since the Bush Administration took office, there has been a push for the appointment of a federal CIO at the subcabinet level or lower. OMB opposed creating a separate federal CIO position, opting instead to appoint a deputy director of management responsible for overseeing agency-level CIOs and coordinating e-government initiatives. Mark Forman was appointed as the Associate Director for Information Technology and E-Government to lead federal e-government efforts. The new Associate Director will oversee the e-government fund, lead federal IT policy development, and advise on agency CIO appointments. Reporting to the Deputy Director of Management at OMB, the position will support government e-government initiatives. Norman Lorentz, the Chief Technology Officer at OMB, is tasked with coordinating efforts to develop the necessary technological architecture. Representative Davis may reintroduce H.R. 5024 to further the debate on e-government initiatives. On May 1, 2001, Senator Lieberman introduced S. 803 (The E-Government Act of 2001), which was later renamed the E-Government Act of 2002. The bill was passed by the Senate on June 27, 2002, and sent to the House of Representatives for consideration. H.R. 2458 (Turner) was introduced as a companion bill, establishing an Office of Information Policy in OMB with a federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) to provide leadership to the executive branch on e-government initiatives. The E-Government Act of 2002 established the CIO to provide leadership on information policy and federal e-government issues. It created the CIO Council to collaborate on multi-agency IT initiatives, federal IT standards, and recruitment of IT expertise. Additionally, it set up a $200 million E-Government Fund for interagency IT projects and a Federal IT Training Center. The E-Government Act of 2002 established an Office of Electronic Government in OMB to provide leadership on electronic government issues. It also created the CIO Council to collaborate on multi-agency IT initiatives, federal IT standards, and recruitment of IT expertise. The E-Government Act of 2002 established an E-Government Fund for interagency IT projects and a Federal IT Training Center. Policy options propose creating a federal CIO position with bipartisan support, but dissenting voices raise unresolved issues on its establishment, organizational placement, and scope of authority. Centralizing management of decentralized technologies poses challenges. Support for a federal CIO position has grown due to the need for government-wide cybersecurity measures, budgetary support for IT projects, and coordination of e-government initiatives. Centralized leadership is crucial as more government functions move online. Centralized leadership is essential for improving federal IT performance and service delivery by establishing government IT standards for a secure infrastructure. The role of a strategic leader is crucial in ensuring that technology investments lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Some argue that CIOs can replicate the success seen in the private sector, while opponents believe the responsibilities of a federal CIO are too complex for one person to handle. Some critics argue against centralizing management of government information technology, suggesting smaller interagency groups for specific tasks due to organizational obstacles and budget process challenges. Some critics are concerned about centralized management by a federal CIO, fearing it may lead agencies to rely on the federal CIO for tough IT issues. They believe efforts to transition to an information age government should come from agencies, not a top-down approach. The placement of the federal CIO is a contentious issue, with debate over whether they should be in the OMB or a new office within the White House focused on IT issues. In September 2000, a hearing was held regarding proposed bills on federal CIO oversight of information technology management. Arguments were made for OMB's role in budgeting and execution, while critics advocated for autonomous management by specialists. Lessons were suggested to be learned from the debate. The GAO has highlighted the challenges faced by agency-level CIOs with multiple responsibilities hindering information technology management reforms. The Bush administration prefers delegating some federal CIO responsibilities to the Deputy Director of Management at OMB. Various bills proposed creating a separate CIO position within the White House or OMB, with Senator Lieberman supporting the idea of a new CIO position with deputy director status. The federal CIO position is debated to be at cabinet-level or deputy director status within OMB. Proponents differ on the necessary authority, with some advocating for cabinet-level status while others, like President Bush and Senator Lieberman, argue against it. The Council of Excellence suggests creating multiple positions at both cabinet and sub-cabinet levels. The Council of Excellence recommends creating multiple positions at both cabinet and sub-cabinet levels to address oversight of government information security. Proponents argue that the federal CIO should have the authority to develop and implement a comprehensive response to information security threats, as current efforts are uncoordinated and potentially incompatible. The GAO made three primary recommendations in September 2000 to improve federal information security. The GAO made recommendations for centralizing responsibilities and implementing stronger leadership in government information security oversight. This would address the lack of coordination among agencies and ensure clearer roles and responsibilities. The GAO witness highlighted a lack of central coordination and information sharing on information security vulnerabilities. Critics argue against centralized federal information security management, fearing a decrease in agency responsibility. Budgetary authority is also a concern for the success of a federal CIO. Supporters argue that giving a federal CIO budgetary authority is crucial for the success of IT projects. Currently, funding for interagency projects is done through a voluntary process, leading to instability in planning. Little opposition exists towards granting the federal CIO budget authority, with suggestions for them to control a portion of agencies' IT budgets. President Bush proposed an \"E-Government Fund\" to support interagency e-government projects, starting with $10 million in 2002 and increasing to $100 million over three years. However, only $5 million was allocated in the fiscal 2002 budget. For fiscal 2003, Bush proposed $45 million for the fund. The E-Government Fund received $45 million in funding. Senate bill S. 1993 proposed centralizing federal information security oversight in OMB, with responsibilities assigned to the Director of OMB and the Deputy Director of Management. The bill mirrored other proposals for a federal CIO role within OMB. The bill proposed giving the OMB responsibility for establishing government-wide information security policies and conducting annual independent evaluations. H.R. 4670 aimed to improve federal government's use of information technology, enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation, and promote coordination among agencies for IT projects. H.R. 4670 aimed to establish the Office of Information Technology in the Executive Office of the President, headed by the Chief Information Officer of the United States. The CIO would advise the President on technical policy issues related to information technology and submit annual reports to the President and Congress on IT initiatives. The bill also proposed appointing the federal CIO as the Chair of the Chief Information Officers Council and establishing the CIO Council by law to assist with multi-agency initiatives. H.R. 5024, introduced by Representative Davis, aimed to improve federal government information technology practices by creating opportunities for innovation, harmonizing existing laws, and enhancing management and oversight of information security risks. H.R. 5024 aimed to establish the Office of Information Policy (OIP) in the Executive Office of the President, appoint a federal CIO and deputy CIO, and create the CIO Council by law. The federal CIO would advise the President on IT matters and direct executive agencies on information issues. The federal CIO, under H.R. 5024, would have been responsible for coordinating statistical activities, appointing a chief statistician, establishing an Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, developing procedures for electronic signatures, and conducting ongoing studies with the NTIA on electronic document progress. H.R. 5024 aimed to support electronic documents by creating the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) to identify major information holdings and enhance public access. It also proposed amendments to reauthorize parts of the Paperwork Reduction Act and establish an Office of Information Security and Technical Protection (OISTP) within the federal CIO's office. The Office of Information Security and Technical Protection (OISTP) was established within the Office of Information Policy (OIP) to advise the federal CIO on information security matters. Chapter 37 directed the federal CIO to enhance information security through various activities, while chapter 38 focused on the federal CIO's general role. Each agency was responsible for developing, assessing, and implementing their own information security measures, with annual independent evaluations required to be submitted to the federal CIO. Proposed amendments to chapter 38 of H.R. 5024 emphasized the federal CIO's role. Proposed amendments to chapter 38 of H.R. 5024 focus on the federal CIO's role in general information technology management concerns, including performance-based procurement, accountability enforcement, and developing federal information system standards. H.R. 5024 is seen as a detailed version of H.R. 4670, combined with elements of S. 1993 and PRA reauthorization language. Representative Turner introduced H.R. 2458 as a companion bill to S. 803, aiming to establish effective leadership in federal IT projects and promote electronic government services. Title I of H.R. 2458 establishes new organizational structures and amends portions of Title 44 of the United States Code. It would create the federal CIO position appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The federal CIO would be responsible for implementing guidelines and regulations for agency compliance with various acts related to information technology and government processes. The General Services Administration (GSA) would also consult with the federal CIO on certain matters. Section 103 of H.R. 2458 would amend Title 44 by adding Chapter 36, focusing on the functions of the federal CIO, CIO Council, and E-Government Fund. The federal CIO would be responsible for various information resources management functions, including reviewing agency budget requests for IT capital planning, advising on IRM resources and strategies, and promoting innovative use of information. The executive branch focuses on information policy, promoting effective use of information technology by agencies through collaborative projects, administering funds from the E-Government Fund, consulting with GSA on IT Fund use, establishing CIO Council, setting IT standards, promoting electronic procurement, and implementing accessibility standards. Section 103 establishes the CIO Council by law and a $200 million E-Government Fund for interagency IT projects. The E-Government Fund is administered by the federal CIO in consultation with the CIO Council. Funds are available without fiscal year limitation, and annual reports are submitted to the President and Congress. Title II enhances e-government services, with the federal CIO as the leader.

Section 219 of the bill requires compliance with accessibility standards for people with disabilities, while Section 220 mandates notifying Congress of any outdated provisions. The bill, introduced by Senator Lieberman in 2001, authorizes appropriations through fiscal 2006 and takes effect 120 days after enactment. The Governmental Affairs Committee reported the bill, renamed the E-Government Act of 2002, with amendments in 2002, focusing on electronic government services management and promotion. The amended version of S. 803, passed by the Senate in 2002, establishes the Office of Electronic Government in OMB, headed by an Administrator appointed by the President. The Administrator's role includes assisting the Director of OMB and promoting interagency collaboration for e-government processes.
