    "content": "The use of military commissions to try suspected terrorists has been a topic of debate and litigation since President Bush's 2001 Military Order. The Supreme Court invalidated the provision denying recourse to the U.S. court system in 2004. In response, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which amended U.S. Code to revoke judicial jurisdiction over habeas claims by \"enemy combatants\" and created jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for appeals of military commission decisions. The Supreme Court invalidated the military commission system established by presidential order in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, ruling that military commissions must follow procedural rules similar to courts-martial proceedings. Congress responded by passing the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to authorize military commissions with procedural rules modeled after the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Act also amended the Detainee Treatment Act to strip the judiciary of habeas jurisdiction, but this provision was later deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. President Bush reconstituted military commissions under the MCA 2006 after the Supreme Court deemed the previous system unconstitutional. The Department of Defense issued regulations for the commissions, resulting in three convictions under the Bush Administration. David Hicks and Salim Hamdan were convicted of material support for terrorism, with Hamdan being credited with time served. Ali al Bahlul was found guilty of multiple charges and providing material support for terrorism. Ali al Bahlul was convicted of war crimes and providing material support for terrorism as Al Qaeda's \"propaganda chief.\" He boycotted most of his trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his convictions were later reversed on appeal. The government sought a rehearing to appeal the decisions, and the D.C. Circuit invalidated some convictions but upheld the conspiracy charge. President Obama halted the proceedings in 2009 to review their use. The President issued an Executive Order to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility within a year. Officials were tasked with reviewing detainee cases for potential release, transfer, or prosecution. The Secretary of Defense halted military commission proceedings, with some cases moving to federal court. The Obama Administration considered restarting military commissions with procedural changes. Modifications to the Manual for Military Commissions were announced to take effect in July 2009. The Senate passed the Military Commissions Act of 2009 (MCA 2009) as part of the Department of Defense Authorization Act for FY2010, to provide reforms supported by the Administration. The bill enacted in October 2009 contained some proposals submitted by the Obama Administration. President Obama's Detention Policy Task Force reaffirmed that military commissions are appropriate for some cases involving suspected violations of the laws of war. The disposition of cases involving Guant\u00e1namo detainees was assigned to a team of DOJ and DOD personnel, including prosecutors from the Office of Military Commissions. Criteria were established to govern the disposition, considering factors like the nature of offenses, identity of victims, location of offense, and efficiency in terms of intelligence protection and legal concerns. Other considerations included the ability of the forum to fully present the wrongful conduct. Federal prosecutors evaluate cases under traditional principles of federal prosecution. Attorney General Holder decided to transfer 9/11 conspirators to the Southern District of New York for trial. Other detainees, including Omar Khadr and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, were to be tried by military commission. Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza al Darbi was accused of participating in wrongful conduct. The Obama Administration completed its assessment on Guantanamo detainees, with about 50 to be held without trial, 40 to be prosecuted, and 110 to be released once a suitable country agrees to take them. Transfer of 30 Yemeni detainees was stalled due to Al Qaeda involvement in a failed airliner attack. Military commissions are being used to try certain offenses. Military commissions are set up by military commanders to try persons accused of offenses during war or martial law. They apply international law of war and procedural rules similar to courts-martial. These commissions have been used in various historical conflicts and occupations. During historical conflicts and occupations, military commissions were established to try individuals accused of offenses. President Bush's Military Order aimed to replicate military commission orders from World War II, which were held in Washington, DC, during a time when civilian courts were open. The Supreme Court's ruling in Ex parte Milligan emphasized that military trials of individuals who were not part of the Armed Forces on friendly territory without martial law declared and functioning civilian courts were unconstitutional. The Bush Administration established rules for tribunals to try enemy belligerents for violations of the law of war, with some critics arguing that the procedural safeguards did not go far enough and did not address the issue of indefinite detention without charge. The Military Commissions Act grants the Secretary of Defense authority to convene military commissions to prosecute \"alien unprivileged enemy belligerents.\" The Pentagon's Inspector General investigated allegations of rigged proceedings but did not substantiate the charges. The Military Commissions Act grants the Secretary of Defense authority to convene military commissions for prosecuting \"alien unprivileged enemy belligerents.\" The Act eliminates the requirement for military commissions to conform to certain uniformity requirements and establishes chapter 47A in Title 10, U.S. Code for military commissions. The Military Commissions Act exempts military commissions from certain UCMJ articles and amends others to establish jurisdiction more narrowly than President Bush's M.O. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, as amended in 2009, allows military commissions to try non-citizens involved in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including those who supported such hostilities or were part of Al Qaeda. This expanded the jurisdiction for military tribunals established by President Bush's Military Order. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, as amended in 2009, allows military commissions to try non-citizens involved in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including those who supported such hostilities or were part of Al Qaeda. The Act defines \"hostilities\" as any conflict subject to the laws of war, but does not clearly define what constitutes \"supporting hostilities.\" This lack of clarity raises concerns about trying civilians before military tribunals when other courts are available. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 allows military commissions to try non-citizens involved in hostilities against the United States. The Act does not exempt permanent resident aliens captured in the US from military jurisdiction. It is generally accepted that aliens in the US are entitled to the same protections in criminal trials as US citizens. Charging resident aliens before a military commission under the MCA would likely raise significant constitutional questions. No resident aliens have been charged for trial before a military commission under the MCA. The government sought jurisdiction over defendants as \"unlawful enemy combatants\" based on Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) determinations. Two military commission judges found CSRT determinations inadequate for jurisdiction, but the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) disagreed. CMCR ruled that while CSRT determinations alone are insufficient, a competent tribunal other than the military commission is not required for status determination. The CMCR interpreted the MCA to require more than just establishing membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban for jurisdiction over accused individuals. They found no support for the government's claim that all prior CSRT determinations automatically label individuals as \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" Additionally, the CMCR disagreed with the government's interpretation of the MCA's language regarding individuals associated with the Taliban, Al Qaeda, or associated forces. The CMCR disagreed with the government's interpretation of the MCA, stating that membership in Al Qaeda or the Taliban alone is not sufficient to establish jurisdiction over accused individuals. The prosecution now has the burden of proving jurisdiction over each person charged for trial by a military commission. The 2009 MCA amended 10 U.S.C. Section 948d to task the military commission with establishing its own jurisdiction. Membership in Al Qaeda is highlighted as a factor in determining unlawful enemy combatant status. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) amended the law to establish jurisdiction over individuals accused of crimes related to Al Qaeda membership. The MCA allows military commissions to try alien unprivileged belligerents for offenses such as aiding the enemy and spying, regardless of when the offense was committed. The defined offenses include murder of protected persons, attacking civilians, pillaging, and using poison weapons. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) expanded jurisdiction to try individuals for various offenses related to Al Qaeda membership, including murder, pillaging, using poison weapons, terrorism, and providing material support for terrorism. The list of offenses was not exhaustive but meant to illustrate acts punishable under the law of war or triable by military commissions. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) expanded jurisdiction to try individuals for offenses related to Al Qaeda membership, including murder, pillaging, using poison weapons, terrorism, and providing material support for terrorism. The regulations expressly prohibited trials for ex post facto crimes. Some crimes listed in the MCA may be new, such as \"murder in violation of the law of war,\" which punishes those who commit hostile acts resulting in death. The Department of Defense argued that the element \"in violation of the law of war\" is established by showing the perpetrator is an unprivileged belligerent. The Manual for Military Commissions allows for trials by military commission even if the offense does not violate international law of war. It is unclear if killing a combatant constitutes a violation of the law of war in non-international armed conflicts. The ICTY has found that killing a combatant may not necessarily be a war crime. Detention camps found guilty of \"murder, as a violation of the laws or customs of war\" for causing prisoner deaths. International Criminal Court defines murder in non-international armed conflict as killing a protected person. Guant\u00e1namo military commission judges differ on definition of murder in violation of the law of war. One judge sees it as killings by an unlawful enemy combatant that violate the law of war. The historical use of military commissions during the U.S. Civil War and the Philippine Insurrection to try charges of murder in violation of the laws of war is discussed, with a focus on the distinction between privileged and unprivileged belligerents and the circumstances under which the charge was brought. The distinction between privileged and unprivileged belligerents in charges of murder in violation of the laws of war is discussed. The conviction for murder in violation of the laws of war was overturned in a case involving insurgents killing U.S. soldiers during a firefight. The definition of \"material support for terrorism\" as a war crime lacks historical precedent. The Court of Military Commission Review affirmed the determination that \"material support for terrorism\" is not a pre-existing war crime. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit invalidated a conviction for this offense on ex post facto grounds. The issue may be taken to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's decision in Ex parte Milligan may have limited the extent to which crimes can be tried by military commissions without martial law. Charges related to aiding guerrillas were often tied to violating martial law rather than international law of war. Military commissions during the Philippine Insurrection tried individuals for consorting with insurgents after a public proclamation by the commanding general. The commanding general issued a proclamation explaining the obligation to refrain from illegal activities under military occupation law. The Obama Administration had concerns about the \"material support for terrorism\" charge in the Military Commissions Act (MCA) and recommended its removal. Despite this, the charge was not eliminated by Congress in 2009. Newer cases have avoided this charge, opting for charges like \"aiding the enemy\" under UCMJ article 904. The law of war traditionally applies within armed conflicts between belligerents, not on neutral territory or before hostilities. The conflict related to the September 11 attacks lacks clear boundaries in time and space, making it unclear who the belligerents are. President Bush's military commissions faced criticism for exceeding customary law of armed conflict. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) provides jurisdiction to military commissions over offenses committed by alien unprivileged enemy belligerents before or after September 11, 2001. It codifies traditional offenses triable by military commission and does not introduce new crimes. Congress enacted the MCA to address challenges to subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) addresses challenges to subject matter jurisdiction of military commissions. In the Hamdan case, a nexus with hostilities was deemed necessary for conduct to be triable by military commission. The MCA provides for a qualified military judge to preside over panels of military officers, with specific requirements for death penalty cases. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for a minimum of 5 panel members, or 9 if necessary. The Secretary of Defense prescribes procedures for assigning military judges, who have authority over evidence admissibility but cannot compel the government to produce classified information. Military commissions are empowered to maintain decorum during proceedings. The Military Commissions Act authorizes military commissions to punish individuals for contempt, including those who disrupt proceedings. It is unclear if this extends to non-enemy witnesses or civilians, but military judges can impose fines and confinement on civilians convicted under the UCMJ. Military commissions under the UCMJ can punish contempt with a fine of $100, up to 30 days of confinement, or both. The MCA limits confinement to 30 days and fines to $1000. Military commissions have the power to compel witnesses similar to US courts, but the defense only has a \"reasonable opportunity\" to obtain witnesses and evidence. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows trial counsel to produce witnesses for the defense, with the defense counsel able to appeal if necessary. A subpoenaed witness who refuses to appear before a military commission may be prosecuted in federal court. The military judge or designated person can issue subpoenas to compel witness testimony or document production. The Military Commissions Act allows trial counsel to produce witnesses for the defense, with the defense counsel able to appeal if necessary. A warrant of attachment may be issued to compel a witness who refuses to comply with a subpoena. Subpoena authority under the UCMJ may not compel civilian witnesses to travel abroad, so video transmission testimony may be permitted. President Bush's M.O. had shortcomings regarding command influence over commission personnel. M.C.O. No. 1 lacked specific safeguards for impartiality, giving the President authority over charges, panel selection, and final outcomes. The Military Commissions Act grants authority to the President or his designees to write, interpret, enforce, and amend procedural rules. Justice Kennedy noted in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that this concentration of authority deviates from Congress's structural safeguards in the military justice system. The Act aims to prevent command influence in military commissions, with discretion given to the Secretary of Defense for procedural rules. Rule 104 of the Rules for Military Commissions prohibits command influence. The Rules for Military Commissions prohibit command influence to prevent unfairness in the military justice system. The convening authority's multiple roles create a risk of bias, especially when deciding on charges and approving findings. This contrasts with the role of convening authority in courts-martial, where functions serve to enforce discipline among subordinates. Allegations of improper influence by legal advisors have been raised in some military cases. Allegations of influence by legal advisors and executive branch control over military judges have raised concerns about fairness in military commission proceedings. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) outlines the rights of the accused and allows for appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on matters of law. The accused must be informed of charges promptly after they are filed. The accused must be informed of charges promptly after they are filed and is presumed innocent until proven guilty. They have the right to refuse to testify, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. The extent of public access to military commission trials may be challenged by media representatives, as the First Amendment right of public access is not absolute. The First Amendment right of public access to military commission trials is not absolute. Trials may be closed only if certain conditions are met, such as demonstrating an overriding interest likely to be prejudiced, narrowly tailoring the closure, considering alternatives, and making adequate findings to support the closure. The Military Commissions Act allows closure only to protect national security or ensure physical safety. The Military Commissions Act allows closure of trials only to protect national security or ensure physical safety, with the military judge having discretion to limit spectators or exclude specific persons for good cause. This may implicate First Amendment rights of the press and public. The Military Commissions Act allows closure of trials to protect national security or ensure physical safety, with the military judge having discretion to limit spectators or exclude specific persons for good cause. One method used to protect classified information is to employ a time-delay on the audio feed of the proceedings to the public in the gallery. This measure allows for the judge to halt proceedings if classified information is disclosed, as the accused's statements are presumptively classified. The MCA of 2009 provides procedures for handling classified information, including the closure of evidentiary hearings when necessary. The Military Commissions Act allows closure of trials to protect national security or ensure physical safety, with procedures for handling classified information, including sealing records and protective orders. The trial counsel can object to questions requiring disclosure of classified information, with the military judge tasked to determine admissibility to safeguard against compromise. The ACLU and media groups challenged a protective order in a case against alleged September 11 conspirators. The CMCR denied issuing a writ in the case against alleged September 11 conspirators, citing jurisdictional issues and finding the controversy unripe for decision. The accused's right to be present at all court-martial proceedings is protected under UCMJ art. 39, but the MCA does not allow exclusion of the accused from trial proceedings or presentation of classified information to panel members without disclosure to the accused. The accused in military commissions under the MCA has the right to be present at trial proceedings, but may be excluded for disruptive behavior. They have the right to military counsel assigned free of charge, with the right to request an attorney before interrogation. The accused in military commissions under the MCA has the right to be present at trial proceedings and may hire a civilian attorney who meets specific qualifications. The detailed military counsel serves as associate counsel, and the accused has the right to self-representation. The accused can request a specific JAG officer to act as counsel if available. The accused in military commissions under the MCA has the right to request a specific military attorney or a replacement counsel if dissatisfied. Civilian attorneys defending an accused must meet strict qualifications, including U.S. citizenship, SECRET clearance, and membership in a state or territorial bar with no disciplinary record. The MCA does not provide detailed rules for civilian defense counsel eligibility and monitoring of communications between the accused and attorney. The Chief Defense Counsel determines eligibility and may revoke or suspend qualifications based on certain criteria. Attorney-client privilege is not addressed, but Rule 502 of the Military Commission Rules of Evidence allows for certain provisions. Rule 502 of the Military Commission Rules of Evidence provides a lawyer-client privilege similar to courts-martial. Initially, civilian counsel had to agree to monitoring of communications, but this was later changed to require notification. While the government couldn't use monitored information at trial, some argued that the lack of attorney-client privilege could hinder communication effectiveness. The revelation of hidden listening devices in rooms where attorneys meet with clients has raised concerns among defense attorneys at military commission proceedings. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to confront witnesses and obtain witnesses in favor of the accused in criminal prosecutions. The Confrontation Clause aims to ensure the reliability of evidence against a defendant through rigorous testing in an adversary proceeding. In courts-martial, relevant evidence is admissible unless outweighed by other factors. The accused has the right to view prosecution documents and evidence that could negate guilt or reduce punishment. Military commissions for suspected terrorists may have different evidentiary standards than federal or military courts. The Supreme Court criticized the previous DOD rules for military commissions, stating they did not adhere to international law. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) ensures the accused's rights to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and respond to evidence against them. It is unclear what evidence could be excluded as irrelevant. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows defense counsel a reasonable opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, but does not guarantee equal opportunity with the prosecution. The accused must be provided with all information admitted into evidence at trial, including exculpatory and mitigating information known to the prosecution. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for the protection of national security information during the trial phase, similar to the Classified Information Procedures Act. Classified information is privileged and can be withheld by the government if deemed necessary for national security reasons. The trial counsel must submit a declaration signed by an official with classification authority to invoke the classified information privilege. The Military Commissions Act allows for the protection of classified information during trials, with the military judge able to authorize the production of such information if it is relevant to the defense or sentencing. Trial counsel can request protective measures for classified information, and defense counsel does not have automatic access to it. The Military Commissions Act allows for protective measures on an ex parte basis for classified information, with the military judge determining if substitutes provide the accused with a defense. The Secretary of Defense may prescribe rules for authenticating evidence in trials. The Military Commissions Act allows for protective measures for classified information, with the military judge determining the admissibility of evidence. The Act prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence, except to prove torture by the defendant. Different standards for admissibility apply to statements obtained through coercion before or after the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. The Military Commissions Act prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence, except to prove torture by the defendant. Before the Detainee Treatment Act, admissible methods were based on reliability and probative value. After the DTA, interrogation methods must not violate human rights. The MCA 2009 removed the distinction, making cruel methods inadmissible. The Obama Administration amended regulations to align with this change. Out-of-court statements by the accused may be admitted if the military judge finds them reliable and possessing probative value, and if they were voluntarily given or made incident to lawful conduct during military operations. Voluntariness is determined by various factors, including the details of taking the statement, the characteristics of the accused, and the circumstances surrounding the statement. The defense must object to the use of any statements by the accused before entering a plea, with the burden on the government to prove their admissibility. The defense can present evidence on the voluntariness of the statement, and the military judge must consider this when weighing the evidence. Accused testimony denying a statement cannot be used against them for any other purpose. The current version of Mil. Comm. R. Evid. 304, based on Mil. R. Evid. 304, outlines rules for admitting confessions and admissions in court-martial cases. Statements must be voluntary to be admissible, and involuntary statements obtained through coercion are not admissible. Confessions or admissions at court martial require corroboration, but military commissions do not have this requirement. The military judge may consider corroborating evidence in determining the probative value of statements at military commissions. In a specific case, a detainee's statements to Afghan officials were suppressed due to death threats, considered torture under the Military Commission Rules of Evidence. Subsequent statements to U.S. interrogators were also suppressed for being coercively obtained. The government dropped charges against the detainee after he won a habeas petition. Hearsay evidence is an out-of-court statement. The MCA allows for the admission of hearsay evidence with notification to the adverse party. Changes in regulations now require the proponent of the evidence to demonstrate reliability. The MCA 2009 allows for hearsay evidence to be admitted with notification to the adverse party. Hearsay is admissible in military commissions on the same basis as any other form of evidence, with exceptions provided by rules or an act of Congress. Hearsay may be admitted if it would be admissible under the rules applicable at courts-martial, or if the party proffering it notifies the adverse party in advance. The MCA 2009 allows hearsay evidence to be admitted with notification to the adverse party, under specific conditions. The military judge must consider various factors before admitting the statement into evidence, including its relevance, probative value, and the unavailability of direct testimony. Under previous rules, hearsay evidence was inadmissible if shown to be unreliable. The MCA 2009 allows hearsay evidence to be admitted with notification to the adverse party, under specific conditions. The rules do not specify the burden of proof for the reliability of hearsay evidence, but it is presumed to fall on the proponent. The MCA also adopted rules for protecting classified information similar to the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), with modifications reflecting experience in federal terrorism trials. Military judges are directed to consider CIPA case law as authoritative unless it conflicts with the MCA provisions, ensuring classified information is privileged from disclosure for national security purposes at military commissions. The MCA 2009 allows hearsay evidence with notification to the adverse party under specific conditions. Rules for protecting classified information are similar to CIPA, ensuring privileged information for national security purposes in military commissions. The prosecution must submit a declaration invoking privilege and setting forth the damage to national security without protective measures. The military judge may authorize the discovery of relevant information for the defense's case. The military judge must consider a claim of privilege and review supporting materials in camera if requested by the government. The accused cannot move for reconsideration of protective measures granted to the government. The government can appeal if the judge orders disclosure of classified information or imposes sanctions for refusal to disclose. The judge must protect intelligence sources and methods relevant to specific evidence. The Military Commissions Act allows trial counsel to introduce evidence without disclosing sources or methods if deemed admissible and reliable by the judge. However, the accused may not have sufficient opportunity to contest substitute evidence, potentially raising Sixth Amendment concerns if constitutional standards apply to military commissions. Classified evidence is privileged. The accused may have an insufficient opportunity to contest evidence in military commissions due to the privileged nature of classified information. Trial counsel can object to questions that may reveal classified information, and the judge can take various actions to protect this information. Defense counsel must notify trial counsel and the judge if they plan to disclose classified information, and cannot do so until the government has had a chance to request an in camera determination. The Military Commissions Act allows for various actions to protect classified information during trials, including dismissal of the case, specified charges, or witness testimony. Military commissions can impose any punishment not forbidden by the Act, except for cruel or unusual punishments. The Military Commissions Act allows for various actions to protect classified information during trials. Military commissions can impose any punishment not forbidden by the Act, except for cruel or unusual punishments like tattooing or the use of irons. Sentences of up to 10 years require a two-thirds vote, longer sentences need three-fourths concurrence, and the death penalty must be approved unanimously by all members present. In cases seeking the death penalty, a panel of 12 members is required, with all members present for the vote agreeing on the sentence. The death penalty must be expressly authorized for the offense, and the charges referred to the commission must have expressly sought the penalty of death. The death penalty in military commissions requires final adjudication, approval by the President, and may be commuted or adjusted. Aggravating factors can be presented, but there is no opportunity to present evidence of rehabilitative potential. The accused can present mitigating statements. The rules allow the accused to make a sworn or unsworn statement to present mitigating circumstances or rebut aggravating evidence. The death penalty can only be imposed if authorized for the offense or under the law of war, and requires a unanimous vote by the commission based on aggravating factors outweighing mitigating circumstances. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for the death penalty in cases where aggravating circumstances such as torture, mistreatment, or other capital crimes are present, especially if the victim is under 15 or a protected person. The MCA also outlines post-trial procedures and appeals, including an administrative review by the convening authority and a review panel. The appellate structure remained largely unchanged between the 2006 and 2009 versions of the MCA, with the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) composed of judges meeting specific qualifications. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) allows for the death penalty in certain cases. The accused can appeal to the CMCR and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Post-trial procedures can be conducted to correct errors without prejudicing the accused. The accused in military commissions can submit matters relevant to sentence approval within 20 days. The convening authority must consider written submissions and may not disapprove a finding of not guilty. In cases of not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility, the accused may be committed for treatment pending a hearing. The accused in military commissions can be committed to a facility for treatment pending a hearing to determine release or detention under less stringent circumstances. Rehearings of guilty findings may be ordered at the discretion of the convening authority. Any sentence served counts towards resentencing. The record is forwarded to the CMCR for review, unless the accused waives it. The CMCR can only grant relief if an error of law prejudiced a substantial trial right of the accused. The accused has 20 days to submit a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals after a decision by the CMCR. Within two years of a military commission conviction becoming final, the accused can request a new trial based on newly discovered evidence or fraud. The MCA prevents double jeopardy and allows for revisions of a verdict before it becomes final. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) prevents double jeopardy by not allowing a person to be tried a second time for the same offense without consent. Once a guilty finding is final, jeopardy attaches, and the verdict cannot be reversed or reviewed. The severity of a sentence can only be increased on rehearing if mandatory. These protections are outlined in Chapter XI of the Rules for Military Commission. The Military Commissions Act (MCA) prohibits double jeopardy and requires charges to be specific and signed under oath. Failure to adjudge a proper sentence may raise concerns, and the charge must state the punitive article or offense as defined in the Rules for Military Commission. The charge in a military commission must specify the offense and be served in English and another language understood by the accused. Minor changes to charges can be made before findings are announced, but major changes require a new referral. President Bush's 2001 Military Order allowed for transfer to another authority for trial. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 and 2009 allow for the transfer of individuals for trial by military commission, potentially raising issues of double jeopardy. The Act does not explicitly address transfers to other forums, but the Rules for Military Commissions provide the accused with the right to move to dismiss charges if they have already been tried in a federal civilian court for the same offense. Comparisons between general courts-martial and military tribunals under the Act are outlined in charts. The curr_chunk discusses legal authorities for military tribunals, jurisdiction, and tribunal structures. It includes a chart comparing procedural safeguards in different courts."
