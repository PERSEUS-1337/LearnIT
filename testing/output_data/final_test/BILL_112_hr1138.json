    "content": "The Act is titled the \"School Social Workers Improving Student Success Act.\" It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new section for grants for school social workers. The Secretary may award grants to high-need local educational agencies to retain or hire school social workers for up to 4 years. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other sources. Grant funds must be used to retain or hire school social workers providing specific services. A high-need local educational agency can use grant funds to reimburse school social workers for travel and additional expenses related to providing specific services. To be eligible for the grant, the agency must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Each application for a grant under this section must describe the duties of school social workers providing services to students. School social workers funded by the grant must identify and target services to high-need students, providing counseling and crisis intervention services to all students in the school. The duties of school social workers funded by the grant include counseling, crisis intervention, case management, addressing social, emotional, and mental health needs, providing assistance to teachers with behavioral interventions, promoting attendance, and conducting home visits to meet students' families. The grant-funded school social workers provide services such as home visits, connecting families to resources, and other necessary services as determined by the Secretary. Grants awarded under this section can be renewed for the same duration as the original grant period, contingent on the high-need local educational agency submitting a report on retaining and hiring school social workers. The Secretary provides technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies applying for grants under this section. The application period for a grant can be extended for agencies without adequate staff. The Secretary offers technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies applying for grants under this section. The term 'high-need local educational agency' is defined in section 2102(3)(A), and 'school social worker' is defined in section 5421(e). $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 for this section."
