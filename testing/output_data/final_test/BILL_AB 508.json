    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that maternal deaths and severe complications have doubled in California and the US between 2002 and 2006. Severe complications occur in nearly 2 percent of all California births, with significant costs to the state and private payers. A study estimates that conditions like maternal hemorrhage and preeclampsia/hypertension cost Medi-Cal $200 million annually. Information and data on maternal mortality and morbidity are crucial for understanding the causes and guiding quality improvement projects to reduce deaths and complications. Analysis using death certificates alone is insufficient, and additional sources like coroner's reports and medical records are needed. The CDC, ACOG, and HRSA-MCHB recommend that every state establish a multi-disciplinary committee to review maternal deaths annually, with 33 states already having such committees in place. California's high number of annual births, accounting for one-eighth of all US births, is crucial for understanding and reversing rising rates of maternal mortality and morbidity. Prior reviews have been instrumental in launching statewide projects to reduce maternal deaths. This act establishes a multi-disciplinary panel for ongoing maternal mortality and severe morbidity reviews. Section 123237 of the Health and Safety Code defines maternal mortality as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of delivering, related to medical causes. Severe maternal morbidity refers to major complications during birth or within 42 days of delivery, as defined by the CDC. The state aims to review 70-90 maternal deaths annually, with potential inclusion of additional deaths up to 1 year post-delivery if resources allow. A maternal mortality review panel is established in California to review maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity, chaired by a maternity care provider. Panel members, appointed by the director, include obstetricians, maternal fetal medicine specialists, neonatologists, nurse-midwives, labor and delivery nurses, anesthesiologists, and other professionals as needed. The maternal mortality review panel in California conducts reviews of maternal deaths and severe morbidity. Information and documents related to the panel are confidential and not subject to public inspection or civil action. (2) Members of the maternal mortality review panel are prohibited from testifying in civil actions about the panel's proceedings or information, but can testify on facts they know independently or that are public. (3) Individuals who participate in the panel in good faith are protected from civil damages resulting from their involvement. The maternal mortality review panel may conduct confidential meetings and retain identifiable information for trending and analysis purposes. The department has the authority to review available data to identify maternal deaths and determine if they were related to pregnancy or preventable. The department can request and receive data on specific maternal deaths, including medical records, autopsy reports, and social service records, from various healthcare providers and facilities as needed. Health care entities must provide the requested information upon the department's request. The panel will review severe maternal morbidity data from the department or CMQCC, aggregated and deidentified, showing major causes and time trends. The department will submit a biennial report on maternal mortality to the Legislature, protecting confidentiality and promoting performance improvement. The panel reviews maternal deaths data, statistics, and causes while protecting confidentiality. Recommendations for system changes and policy improvements to reduce maternal deaths in California are included in the report. Funding sources for these efforts are also mentioned. The Legislature adds Section 123237 to the Health and Safety Code to limit public access to confidential information of the maternity mortality review panel for protection. The State Department of Public Health is required to submit an annual report on maternal mortality and morbidity in California, including analysis of deaths and severe morbidity cases, patient demographics, contributing factors, underlying causes, and suggestions for improvement in care. Suggestions for improving care to reduce maternal death and severe morbidity include considering existing resources such as data sources, partnerships with entities in maternal care quality, and the use of physician volunteers or committees. Reports must be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code."
