    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that nutrient pollution from point and nonpoint sources is the most significant water quality issue in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Chesapeake 2000 agreement aims to correct these nutrient-related problems by 2010 to potentially remove the Bay from the list of impaired bodies of water designated by the EPA. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act aims to reduce nitrogen discharge into the Chesapeake Bay from sewage treatment plants. Nutrient removal technology is a cost-effective method for achieving this goal. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act aims to reduce nitrogen discharge into the Chesapeake Bay to restore water quality for human health and aquatic resources. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a Sewage Control Technology Grant Program under Title VII. The Sewage Control Technology Grant Program under Title VII defines eligible facilities as municipal wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day in the Chesapeake Bay watershed states. The program provides grants for upgrading these facilities with nutrient removal technologies. The Administrator shall consult with the Chesapeake Bay Program Office and prioritize eligible facilities for grants based on nutrient load reductions and environmental benefits to local bodies of water. Geographic distribution is also considered in grant allocation. Application for grants can be made by States or municipalities. The Administrator approves grant requests from States or municipalities for upgrading eligible facilities with nutrient removal technologies to reduce nitrogen levels in wastewater. Grants must be used for this specific purpose, with a requirement for a federal cost-sharing component. The Federal share of upgrading eligible facilities under this section is capped at 55%, while the non-Federal share can be provided through various funding sources. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations totaling $132,000,000 for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is granted for the implementation of this section, with up to 4 percent allocated for administrative costs."
