    "content": "Congress has long supported efforts to identify, detain, and remove noncitizens convicted of crimes in the United States. Interior enforcement is a key aspect of immigration control, targeting a complex criminal alien population. The Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement operates programs like the Criminal Alien Program to identify and remove criminal and removable aliens. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) is a key program that marshals resources to identify and remove criminal and removable aliens. It is guided by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) which sets enforcement priorities for removal of foreign nationals. PEP includes data sharing between DHS and the Department of Justice, screening for immigration violations when individuals are booked into jails. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program delegates immigration enforcement functions to state and local law enforcement officers, while the National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) targets known criminal and fugitive aliens outside of controlled settings. These programs have contributed to the removal of large numbers of aliens in the past. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP), Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), and the \u00a7287(g) program have led to the removal of many aliens in the past decade. However, these programs have faced criticism for targeting individuals with minor offenses or no criminal record besides being in the US unlawfully. Concerns about state and local law enforcement involvement in immigration enforcement have also been raised, leading to revisions and expiration of certain agreements. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP), Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), and the \u00a7287(g) program have faced criticism for targeting individuals with minor offenses or no criminal record. Congress may be interested in enforcement levels, appropriations, and the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. The report defines the criminal alien population, presents ICE enforcement priorities, describes major immigration enforcement programs, and discusses policy considerations for programs targeting criminal aliens. The report discusses the identification of criminal aliens based on certain crimes that make them ineligible for admission to the United States or subject to removal. The term \"criminal alien\" is broadly defined as any noncitizen convicted of a crime in the US, with distinctions based on legal status affecting removability. Unauthorized aliens, including those with quasi-legal status, make up about half of all noncitizens in the US. While most unauthorized aliens are removable, not all are subject to removal. Criminal aliens can be categorized into three groups, including unauthorized and legal aliens who may or may not be removable. The population of criminal aliens in the US includes unauthorized aliens, legal aliens convicted of specific crimes, and aggravated felons. These individuals are subject to removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, with aggravated felons being ineligible for most forms of relief from removal. The criminal alien population in the US includes a mix of legally present noncitizens and unauthorized aliens, with some currently incarcerated and others who have served their sentences and been released. Quantifying the size of this population is challenging due to a lack of data and estimates. DHS has produced its own estimates of the removable criminal alien population. In 2013, ICE estimated that 900,000 aliens were arrested for crimes annually, with 550,000 criminal aliens exiting law enforcement custody each year. There were 1.9 million removable criminal aliens in the US. This report focuses on noncitizen population incarcerated in federal, state, and local facilities from 2002 to 2013, providing consistent annual data on this subset of the criminal alien population. The section presents incarceration data from 2002 to 2013, discussing the quality and limitations of publicly available data on the criminal alien population. Table 1 shows total U.S. citizen and noncitizen populations in federal and state prisons and local jails from 2002 to 2013. This includes various criminal alien populations and both lawful and unauthorized aliens. Federal prison data is sourced from annual BJS reports compiling data from the Bureau of Prisons. As of December 31, 2013, a total of 2,308,158 prisoners (U.S. citizens and noncitizens) were incarcerated: 215,866 in federal prisons; 1,361,084 in state prisons; and 731,208 in local jails. The 142,463 noncitizens were reported in federal and state prisons. Noncitizen inmates accounted for 6.2% of the total incarcerated population in 2013, with 23.5% in federal prisons, 3.5% in state prisons, and 6.0% in local jails. The high noncitizen proportion in federal prisons is due to the prosecution of immigration offenses at the federal level. Data on noncitizens in federal prisons are more accurately collected compared to state prisons and local jails. The noncitizen percentage of the incarcerated population between 2002 and 2012 closely mirrored the noncitizen percentage of the U.S. population overall. However, in 2013, some states, including California, did not report their noncitizen incarcerated populations, leading to understated data for that year. This made it challenging to compare with previous years. Noncitizens comprised 7.0% of the total U.S. population in 2013. Several obstacles limit researchers' ability to accurately enumerate the criminal alien population in the U.S. Data inconsistencies exist between federal BOP and state/local jurisdictions, hindering a national enumeration similar to the census. Estimation techniques are used to quantify the criminal alien population. Inaccuracies in quantifying the criminal alien population arise from data limitations in incarceration measurements. Local jails may hold individuals not yet charged or convicted, while parolees and those on probation are excluded from incarceration data. For example, in 2013, 56% were on probation, 12% on parole, and 32% incarcerated. Changes in incarceration numbers do not always reflect criminality accurately. Inaccuracies in quantifying the criminal alien population arise from data limitations in incarceration measurements. Changes in incarceration numbers do not always accurately reflect criminal activity levels due to factors like enforcement policy changes and unreported crimes. Data availability and reliability pose obstacles in quantifying the national criminal alien population's criminality level. The analysis in the report is limited to incarcerations due to the lack of recent and complete data on arrests and convictions at the state and local levels distinguishing between U.S. citizens and noncitizens. The report focuses on analyzing incarcerations of noncitizens, as data on criminal alien populations is limited and inconsistent due to varying state and local reporting practices. The Government Accountability Office noted the lack of reliable data on foreign-born criminal populations in 2005. ICE identifies potential removable aliens, including criminal aliens, by screening individuals passing through law enforcement jurisdictions. DHS has prioritized certain aliens for removal based on enforcement priorities and criteria for prosecutorial discretion. The current enforcement priorities are guided by the President's 2014 Immigration Accountability Executive Action. On November 20, 2014, the DHS Secretary published a memorandum announcing new department-wide policies for enforcement priorities of unauthorized aliens. The memorandum announced new enforcement priorities for unauthorized aliens, focusing on removals through various programs. It outlined three priority levels for removal, superseding previous policies set by former ICE director John Morton in 2011. Priority 1 includes threats to national security, border security, and public safety, Priority 2 covers misdemeanants and new immigration violators, and Priority 3 targets aliens with final removal orders issued after January 1, 2014. ICE's enforcement priorities have changed, with a focus on criminal aliens and those attempting to illegally enter the country. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) and Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) target these individuals, while the \u00a7287(g) program allows partnerships with local law enforcement agencies to enhance enforcement capabilities. ICE delegates enforcement authority through agreements with state and local law enforcement officers to handle certain immigration functions under federal supervision. The National Fugitive Operations Program targets criminal and fugitive aliens for removal, while the Criminal Alien Program identifies and initiates removal proceedings for priority criminal aliens in custody. ICE officers in NFOP are field-based, while CAP operates within custody settings to prevent the release of criminal aliens. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) aims to prevent the release of criminal aliens into U.S. communities by securing removal orders before the end of their sentences or post-release. CAP officers screen and prioritize potentially removable aliens in jails and prisons, reducing time in ICE custody and overall costs. They use databases to identify matches and interview individuals for processing. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) uses biographic databases to identify potentially removable aliens in jails and prisons. CAP officers issue requests for notification to law enforcement agencies and may issue immigration detainers for individuals subject to removal orders. Approximately 1,300 CAP officers monitor federal and state prisons, totaling over 4,300 facilities. ICE officers are deployed onsite, and video technology is also utilized. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) utilizes video technology and a call center to connect jails and prisons to ICE's DEPORT Center in Chicago. It also works with correctional departments to compare inmate roster data with immigration databases. CAP manages the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) and specialized programs targeting high-priority criminal aliens, such as Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) and the Institutional Hearing and Removal Program (IHRP). The Institutional Hearing and Removal Program (IHRP) coordinates attorneys, immigration judges, and incarcerated aliens to expedite removals by completing proceedings before inmates enter ICE custody for removal from the United States. Other programs like VCAS, REPAT, and CAPRSO target criminal aliens for immediate removal. PEP enforces priorities and uses interoperability for immigration enforcement. ICE enforces immigration priorities through PEP, which includes interoperability with DOJ and DHS for biometric information sharing. Individuals prioritized for removal must pose a threat to national security, public safety, or have criminal convictions. CAP ensures that fingerprints of arrestees are checked against DHS's IDENT database. ICE agents use biometric information to identify potential removable aliens. Matches are confirmed at the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) and if deemed removable, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is notified for further action based on criminal history and enforcement priorities. ICE issues requests for notification to be alerted within 48 hours of an alien's release from law enforcement custody. They may also issue immigration detainers to request that state and local agencies detain individuals for removal. ICE uses a Request for Voluntary Transfer for cases outside of priority categorization, including aliens apprehended while attempting to illegally enter the country, unlawfully present aliens not continuously residing in the US since 2014, those who have abused visa programs, and aliens with final removal orders. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions under federal supervision. As of January 2016, ICE had agreements with 32 agencies in 16 states, with 1,675 officers trained for immigration duties. The program is expected to expand in 2016. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program underwent changes in 2013 to align with current policies, focusing on \"jail enforcement\" agreements. Specially trained officers in state and local corrections facilities can identify criminal aliens by screening their information against DHS databases. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program involves officers using ICE's database to enter information about aliens in custody, generate paperwork for detainers and NTAs. The National Fugitive Operations Program pursues criminal and fugitive aliens outside of controlled settings, separate from the CAP program. NFOP officers access DHS databases to target criminal aliens for removal. ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) was established in 2003 to locate, arrest, and remove fugitive aliens. In 2009, NFOP expanded its focus to include at-large convicted criminal aliens, national security threats, gang members, child sex offenders, and violent criminals with removal orders issued after January 1, 2014. As of April 2016, NFOP had 129 fugitive operations teams across all ERO field offices, working with various law enforcement partners to pursue priority cases using data from the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) focuses on locating and arresting fugitive aliens, including criminal aliens and national security threats. NFOP teams conduct enforcement actions at worksites and residential areas based on leads, resulting in a reduction of the fugitive alien backlog. However, the scope of NFOP operations has narrowed due to revised enforcement priorities under PEP, with criminal aliens now accounting for the majority of arrests. Policy issues include enforcement levels, costs, and the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement. Data on primary enforcement actions by various immigration programs from 2004 to 2015, including administrative arrests, alien identifications, removals, and returns. Interpret data cautiously due to potential over-counting and individuals being counted multiple times across programs. Some removable aliens are arrested or placed in removal proceedings outside of these programs. The data from various immigration programs show consistent increases in the number of aliens identified and arrested. CAP made over 1.3 million administrative arrests between FY2004 and FY2012, while the \u00a7287(g) program and NFOP made about 240,000 and 243,000 administrative arrests, respectively. Secure Communities submitted about 47.1 million sets of biometric data from FY2009 to FY2015, leading to the identification of 2.4 million potentially removable aliens. This resulted in 324,811 administrative arrests by FY2012 and 406,441 aliens removed or returned by the first five months of FY2015. Funding for immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior has increased substantially since FY2004. Congress substantially increased funding levels for various programs such as CAP, PEP/Secure Communities, \u00a7287(g), and NFOP from FY2004 through FY2006. In FY2006, ICE was directed to study how CAP could be expanded nationwide. In 2008, appropriators expressed concern about ICE's focus on identifying the most significant threats among removable aliens. ICE was criticized for losing perspective on the most significant threats among removable aliens and for releasing illegal aliens from custody without deportation efforts. Funding for the Criminal Alien Program and Secure Communities increased significantly from FY2004 to FY2011, reaching $392.5 million before dropping to $317.2 million. Additional funding was allocated to improve efforts to identify and remove aliens convicted of crimes. The funding for the Criminal Alien Program and Secure Communities increased from $6.6 million in FY2004 to $392.5 million in FY2010 and FY2011, before dropping to $317.2 million in FY2016. The \u00a7287(g) program has raised concerns about police-community relations and civil rights, but proponents argue it enhances ICE's enforcement capacity by leveraging state and local law enforcement agencies. Detractors of closer links between ICE and local communities argue that programs like \u00a7287(g) lack federal oversight and divert resources from local crime prevention. They fear that associating law enforcement with immigration enforcement will deter foreign-born individuals from reporting crimes or cooperating with police, especially those without legal status. Critics argue that involving state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration law enforcement, such as through the \u00a7287(g) program, could lead to biased officers engaging in racial profiling. Concerns about the program delegating federal responsibility and allowing undue discretion to shape policing activities have been raised. ICE made changes to the \u00a7287(g) program in response to criticism, including increased training requirements, supervision, record-keeping, and tools to prevent racial profiling. Other changes included new training materials, detainer forms, and the establishment of an Internal Advisory Committee. ICE implemented changes to the \u00a7287(g) program, including increased training requirements and the establishment of an Internal Advisory Committee. As a result, the number of \u00a7287(g) agreements decreased from 64 in 2012 to 32 in 2015. The remaining agreements are jail enforcement agreements with limited powers for jail officers. Some Members have questioned ICE's reduction in the use of these agreements. Members have questioned ICE's reduction in the use of \u00a7287(g) agreements due to resistance and legal action. The program's revisions, such as meeting physical infrastructure requirements and extensive training, have deterred smaller jurisdictions from participating. The Obama Administration has made modifications to address concerns from both immigrant advocacy groups and immigration enforcement advocates. The Obama Administration has made modifications to immigration enforcement programs like Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program to address concerns raised by immigrant advocacy groups. Secure Communities was replaced with the Priority Enforcement Program after criticism for removing noncitizens with minor crimes or no criminal records. The \u00a7287(g) program raised concerns about local law enforcement's involvement in immigration enforcement and possible racial profiling. The Obama Administration made changes to immigration enforcement programs to address community policing concerns. The \u00a7287(g) program was revised for consistency, but advocates question why it was limited. Glossary terms include \"aggravated felon\" and \"absconder.\" A felony is a serious crime under the Immigration and Nationality Act, including offenses like murder and theft. At-large criminal aliens are noncitizens convicted of crimes not currently in prison. Civil immigration offenses involve violating immigration laws, leading to deportation but not imprisonment. Criminal aliens are noncitizens who have committed crimes. In the United States, criminal aliens are noncitizens who have been convicted of a crime. The term \"criminal alien\" lacks a consistent definition, but in this report, it refers to any noncitizen with a criminal record in the U.S. Certain criminal offenses can lead to immigration-related consequences, such as removal. Common violations include reentry of a deported alien and bringing in and harboring certain individuals. The U.S. criminal offenses related to aliens include reentry of a deported alien, bringing in and harboring certain aliens, fraud and misuse of visas, and entry of alien at improper time or place. Fugitive aliens are those who fail to leave the U.S. after a removal order, while removable aliens are subject to deportation. Removable criminal aliens are those convicted of a removable criminal offense. An alien convicted of a removable criminal offense is subject to removal from the United States. This includes crimes like moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, high-speed flight from an immigration checkpoint, failure to register as a sex offender, drug offenses, firearm offenses, and immigration-related document fraud. In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act made deporting aliens convicted of certain crimes a formal enforcement priority. The former INS established the Institutional Removal Program (IRP) and the Alien Criminal Apprehension Program (ACAP) in 1988 to identify deportable aliens convicted of crimes before their release from prison. These programs worked with corrections facilities and the Department of Justice to initiate deportation proceedings against aliens serving sentences for deportable offenses during their incarceration, focusing initially on aggravated felons. Between 1990 and 1996, Congress expanded the definition of aggravated felons to include aliens convicted of serious crimes like murder and drug trafficking. The INS prioritized the removal of criminal aliens and minimizing recidivism, dedicating more resources to this than any other enforcement priority between 1998 and 2002. After the September 11 attacks, the focus shifted to suspected terrorists and homeland security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shifted its enforcement focus from suspected terrorists to criminal aliens due to the growth of the foreign-born population after 2000. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) programs IRP and ACAP were combined into the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) within Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in 2010. The Secure Communities program was replaced by the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) in 2014, fully implemented in 2015."
