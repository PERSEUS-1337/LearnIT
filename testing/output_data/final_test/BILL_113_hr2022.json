    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Internal Revenue Service administers tax provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with increased access to taxpayer information for enforcement. The IRS has significant authority in enforcing the Act, and the employer mandate could jeopardize millions of jobs. Employers in some Districts are citing the unknown effects of the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff. Reports from the Government Accountability Office and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration highlight the Internal Revenue Service's lack of adequate processes to review and account for taxpayer dollars spent on implementing the law. The IRS has been criticized for fraud and abuse, failing to protect the constitutional rights of American citizens. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration also raised concerns about the IRS's Determinations. The Internal Revenue Service's Determinations Unit searched for exemption requests involving political sounding names like Tea Party and Patriots back to 2010. Lois Lerner was informed of discriminatory practices in 2011, and a hearing in 2012 addressed IRS operations and reports of misconduct. Shulman denies reports of the IRS targeting Tea Party groups, stating there is no targeting. Prohibition on implementing or enforcing any requirement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act until certification that taxpayer information will not be used for political targeting. The Internal Revenue Service is prohibited from enforcing any requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that taxpayer information will not be used for political targeting. The Internal Revenue Service is prohibited from using taxpayer information for political targeting, including actions before the enactment of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This includes violations of constitutional rights and targeting based on political views. The Internal Revenue Service is prohibited from enforcing any requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 if a violation occurs by any employee, until the employee is terminated in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. The Reform Act of 1998 prohibits the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing certain requirements if an employee violates a taxpayer's constitutional rights. Implementation or enforcement of these requirements can only resume after a 90-day waiting period, unless a joint resolution disapproving the certification is enacted. The term \"department or agency concerned\" refers to the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service and other centralized agencies are subject to termination of employment authority as per the Reform Act of 1998. The responsibility of the secretary cannot be delegated. The Secretary of the Treasury's responsibility cannot be delegated under the Reform Act of 1998. The head of the department must submit certifications to Congress."
