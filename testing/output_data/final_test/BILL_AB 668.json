    "title": "AB 668",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to consider enforceable restrictions on land value, including zoning, contracts with governmental agencies, permit authority, and development controls by local governments. The curr_chunk discusses various types of land use restrictions, including development controls by local governments, environmental constraints, hazardous waste restrictions, conservation easements, and solar-use easements. A contract with a nonprofit corporation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code for properties sold to low-income families. Land use restricted to owner-occupied affordable housing for 30 years with a deed of trust to ensure compliance. The long-term deed restrictions in the contract must serve a public purpose, be recorded, and provided to the assessor. There is a presumption that the restrictions will not be removed or modified in the near future, ensuring the land's value aligns with its legally permissible use. Grounds for rebutting the presumption of long-term deed restrictions include past history of similar use restrictions and comparable sales prices. The expiration of a restriction at a certain time is not conclusive evidence of its future removal unless there is no opportunity for continuation or renewal. Assessors should not consider sales of unrestricted land when valuing restricted land unless the restrictions minimally affect its value. In valuing land with enforceable use restrictions, assessors may consider sales of comparable lands with similar natural limitations. Comparable lands are similar in permissible uses and physical attributes, and representative sales information provides an accurate indication of the land's value. The Legislature enacted this section to ensure accurate assessment of land under use restriction by determining the availability of representative sales information. It aims to avoid assessing land for uses not legally available to the owner and not contemplated by the government, promoting effective land use planning. This statute does not require undervaluing land or prohibit using comparable sales information for similar restricted lands. The section aims to ensure accurate assessment of land under use restrictions by using comparable sales information when available. Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to consider enforceable restrictions on land assessment, including zoning, contracts with governmental agencies, permit authority, and development controls by local governments. The curr_chunk discusses various environmental constraints and land use restrictions, including development controls by local governments, hazardous waste restrictions, and recorded conservation easements for preservation purposes. The curr_chunk outlines different types of easements, including greenway easements for public agencies or nonprofit corporations, solar-use easements, and contracts with nonprofit corporations for affordable housing development. The contract for affordable housing development includes a deed of trust on the property, recorded with the assessor, and with long-term deed restrictions serving a public purpose. There is a presumption that restrictions will not be removed or modified in the near future, equating the land value to its legally permissible use. Grounds for rebutting the presumption of restrictions on land value include past history of similar use restrictions and comparison of sales prices for restricted and unrestricted land. The expiration of a restriction at a certain time is not conclusive evidence of its future removal unless there is no opportunity for continuation or renewal. Assessors should not consider sales of comparable unrestricted land when valuing restricted land unless the restrictions minimally affect its value. In assessing land with enforceable use restrictions, the assessor may consider sales of comparable lands with similar natural limitations. Comparable lands are similar in permissible uses and physical attributes, and representative sales information is needed for accurate valuation. The Legislature enacted this section to ensure accurate assessment of land under use restriction by providing a method to determine representative sales information. It aims to avoid assessing land for uses not legally available to the owner and to encourage effective land use planning. This statute does not require land to be assessed below a certain value or prohibit the use of comparable sales information for similar restricted lands. The statute aims to ensure accurate assessment of land under use restrictions by providing a method to determine comparable sales information when available. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Revenue and Taxation Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1251. If both bills are enacted by January 1, 2016, and amend the same section, this section will take effect. Reimbursement for mandated costs in the bill will be provided to local agencies and school districts as determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
