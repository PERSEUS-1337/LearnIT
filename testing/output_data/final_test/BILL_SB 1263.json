    "title": "SB 1263",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the challenges faced by failing public water systems in California, affecting disadvantaged communities the most. These systems lack the necessary capacity to provide safe drinking water due to various factors like water quality issues and climate change. The state aims to discourage new unsustainable public water systems to uphold the human right to water policy. Before applying for a permit, a preliminary technical report on water-related improvements must be submitted to the state board. In order to expedite the permitting process for a proposed new public water system, it is encouraged to submit a preliminary technical report within seven days of applying for a building permit. The report must include the names of nearby public water systems within three miles of the proposed system's service area. Additionally, the report should be submitted to the state board if the system would be regulated by a local primacy agency. The applicant must provide a report on the feasibility of annexing, connecting, or supplying water from adjacent public water systems, actions taken to secure water supply, all water sources, and cost estimates for constructing and operating the proposed new public water system. (6) Compare costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining the new public water system to annexation or connection to an existing system.\n(7) Detail efforts to secure managerial oversight from an existing water system.\n(8) Analyze if projected water supplies will meet demand during normal and dry years over a 20-year period. The applicant may submit documents to the state board instead of a preliminary technical report if they include required information and consultation with adjacent public water systems and the local agency formation commission. If documents submitted for public agency approval regarding providing drinking water to a new public water system lack some required information, including consultation with adjacent systems and the local agency formation commission, the applicant must also submit these documents and a preliminary technical report to the state board. This combined submission will be considered equivalent to the preliminary technical report requirements. The state board may take actions upon reviewing a preliminary technical report submitted as required. If a public water system has not sought annexation or an extension of services agreement, the applicant must negotiate with the local agency formation commission and existing water systems. The state board may intervene if negotiations are unlikely to succeed. The state board may intervene if negotiations for annexation or extension of services are unlikely to succeed, based on documentation such as previous denials or refusals by existing water systems. The applicant must report results of negotiations to the state board and follow a time schedule for directives. Compliance with directives is required before submitting a permit application for a new public water system. Review of a technical report does not constitute project approval. These requirements do not apply in certain situations. The requirements of this section do not apply to a new public water system permit application deemed complete before January 1, 2017, or to an extension of an existing system. Additionally, the section does not apply to a service area where the applicant certifies in writing that they will not rely on a new public water system for their water supply. The state board must acknowledge receipt of the certification promptly. An applicant certifying that the service area won't rely on a new public water system but later applies for one must comply with the section's provisions and assume all risks. The section applies to new public water systems consolidating existing systems or providing water service instead of individual wells. Applicants must notify the state board at least six months before constructing water-related improvements. The state board must acknowledge receipt of a notice requesting exemption from new public water system requirements within 30 days. Compliance with the section's requirements is necessary for a complete permit application, and the state board's determination is final and not subject to review. Following completion of the investigation and satisfaction of requirements, the state board shall issue or deny the permit, imposing necessary conditions to ensure a reliable water supply. If a project applicant provides a written notice meeting criteria, the project is exempt from requirements after 35 days unless a notice to comply is issued. A public water system established after January 1, 1998, must demonstrate financial, managerial, and technical capability to provide safe drinking water. Permits cannot be issued to certain associations, and local agencies need state board approval for permits under this article. When approving a new public water system, the state board must consider its sustainability, water supply, potential contamination risks, and other factors that could impact its capacity in the future. The state board may deny a permit for a new public water system if it determines that the system will not be able to provide affordable, safe drinking water in the future. Applicants can appeal decisions to the state board. Section 106.4 of the Water Code prohibits cities and counties from issuing building permits for new residential developments that rely on water sources from water haulers, bottled water, water-vending machines, or retail water facilities. This restriction does not apply to residences being rebuilt due to natural disasters. The Legislature declares that Section 106.4 of the Water Code is a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair. This section does not apply to residences being rebuilt after a natural disaster. No reimbursement required by this act under California Constitution as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services or program costs. This act may create, eliminate, or change penalties for crimes or infractions."
