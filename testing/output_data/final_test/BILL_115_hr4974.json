    "content": "VISA OVERSTAYS CRIMINALIZED. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include a new section 274E on visa overstays. Any alien who remains in the US after their visa has expired may face fines or imprisonment. Exceptions can be made for medical necessity, public safety, or national security reasons. Reentry for first offenders is limited. Any alien convicted of violating immigration laws may face penalties such as a 5-year ban on admission to the US and a 10-year visa restriction for first offenders. Subsequent offenses can result in permanent inadmissibility. The Secretary of State or Homeland Security must inform aliens of these penalties when applying for admission. The alien must be informed of penalties for violating immigration laws upon application or admission, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to automatically cancel any valid visa upon revocation, effective immediately. Additionally, there is a clarification regarding taxpayer-provided counsel. SEC. 3 clarifies that the government will not bear any expense for counsel in immigration proceedings. SEC. 4 involves sharing visa records with foreign governments. Sharing visa records with foreign governments is amended to allow the Secretary of State to provide copies of visa issuance or refusal records if it is in the national interests of the United States. SEC. 5. Access to National Crime Information Center files for visa adjudications related to diplomats and government officials is granted by amending Section 222 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Attorney General and the Director of the FBI will provide the Secretary of State with access to criminal history records for certain aliens applying for visas."
