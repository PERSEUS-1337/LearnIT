    "title": "SB 300",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends to allow pawnbrokers to conduct electronic business transactions, except for original loans, in accordance with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Amendments to the Financial Code require pawnbrokers to provide a written contract for loans secured by pledged goods, with a minimum loan period of four months and clear information on the pledgor's right to redeem the pledge. Every loan contract must include a notice in bold type above the pledgor's signature space. \"You may redeem the property pledged by paying the loan amount and charges accrued until the redemption date, which must be at least four months from the loan start date.\" Every pawnbroker must keep pledged items for the loan period. The pledgor can redeem the items by paying the loan amount and charges. If agreed in writing, pawned property can be stored off premises and must be returned within two business days upon redemption request. If a pledged article is not redeemed within the loan period, the pawnbroker must notify the pledgor within one month. Failure to do so means no interest can be charged after one month. The notification must be sent to the pledgor's last known address, allowing a 10-day redemption period. Electronic notice is also valid. Upon initiation of a new loan, the pledgor must confirm their current valid electronic address with the pawnbroker. A 10-day notice of termination will be sent electronically, extending to the next open day if the tenth day falls on a closed day. The pawnbroker must provide a schedule of charges and offer to send a termination notice by registered mail upon prepayment of costs. If a pledged item is not redeemed within 10 days, the pawnbroker gains ownership and can sell it. Selling pledged property without ownership is a misdemeanor. During the loan period, a pledgor can request a replacement loan from a pawnbroker before the 10-day grace period. The sale of pledged property without ownership is a misdemeanor. A replacement loan issued by a pawnbroker is processed as a new loan with all applicable fees and charges. Before issuing a replacement loan, the pledgor must pay off all outstanding charges from the prior loan, including interest and fees, in cash or an acceptable form. If payment is insufficient or not in an acceptable form, the pawnbroker will return it within five business days. The pawnbroker is not obligated to issue a replacement loan if the amount is not paid in full. The pawnbroker is not obligated to provide a replacement loan if the amount is insufficient or the method of payment is not cash or acceptable. The replacement loan contract must disclose the amount of the prior loan debited and comply with Section 21201. Pledgor's consent to the replacement loan terms is deemed given when signing the contract in person or electronically. For mail or representative requests, consent is given when prior loan charges are paid, and the replacement loan principal cannot exceed the prior loan amount. The replacement loan terms must align with the regulations in this chapter when issued. A written agreement or electronic record must be provided to the pledgor within five business days. Electronic signatures are acceptable if specific conditions are met. The pawnbroker must ensure that the contract and transaction adhere to the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Written disclosures must be presented in a specified type size before the pledgor signs the electronic contract. The pawnbroker must disclose the maximum compensation if the loan amount is below $2,500. If the loan amount is $2,500 or more, the pawnbroker must disclose specific provisions before the pledgor signs the electronic contract."
