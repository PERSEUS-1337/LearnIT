In the United States, electricity generation accounts for about 40% of carbon dioxide emissions, while the transportation sector contributes roughly one-third of the six major greenhouse gases. Aircraft emissions make up about 10% of the U.S. transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions. Worldwide aviation has been a fast-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, with emissions increasing by almost 70% between 1990 and 2002. The United Nations IPCC projected that aircraft emissions could be 2.6 to 11 times larger by 2050 compared to 1992. To meet emission reduction targets, aviation emissions would need significant reductions. In the U.S., aircraft emissions have decreased since 1990, contrary to global trends. In the U.S., aircraft emissions have decreased since 1990, with a 54% decline in emissions from domestic military operations offsetting increases in domestic commercial and general aviation emissions. Emissions from domestic operation of commercial aircraft grew 13% between 1990 and 2007, but efficiency improvements in load factors and fuel efficiency helped slow the growth in emissions. American Airlines is retiring less efficient aircraft in favor of newer, more fuel-efficient models like the Boeing 737-800. This switch is estimated to save a substantial amount of fuel. Domestic flights in the U.S. accounted for about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector in 2006. However, international transportation emissions are not currently included in U.S. emission totals, which would increase the overall impact of aviation on climate change. The aviation sector's emissions, accounting for 3.4% of U.S. GHG total, occur high in the atmosphere, with a potential impact twice that of carbon dioxide alone. Emissions from jet aircraft contribute to cirrus cloud formation, adding to the greenhouse effect. Scientists are uncertain about measuring the impact of these clouds, but they likely substantially contribute to aircraft emissions' impact on climate change. The aviation sector is a significant contributor to U.S. and world greenhouse gas emissions, with jet fuel costs representing a substantial portion of total expenses for air carriers. Airlines have a strong incentive to invest in fuel-efficient aircraft, leading to notable efficiency gains in passenger and cargo traffic. U.S. airlines achieved significant efficiency gains by carrying 20.4% more passenger and cargo traffic in 2007 using nearly 3% less fuel compared to 2000. This led to a reduction of 5.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. The industry aims for a further 30% increase in fuel efficiency by 2025. Modernizing the FAA's air traffic control system to NextGen is expected to further reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. NextGen is expected to reduce GHG emissions of aircraft by 10-15% through direct routing and other features. Some aircraft equipped with NextGen have reduced emissions by 34%. There is debate on whether the federal government should regulate aircraft GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, with EPA receiving petitions but not taking action yet. In 2003, the EPA stated it did not have authority to regulate GHGs from cars and trucks under the Clean Air Act. However, in a 2007 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that GHGs are air pollutants within the Act's definition, giving EPA the authority to regulate them if they endanger public health or welfare. EPA can propose emission standards for aircraft engines under Section 231 after consulting with the FAA Administrator and holding public hearings. The December 2007 petitions request EPA to find that aircraft GHG emissions endanger public health or welfare and adopt regulations allowing various compliance approaches, such as emission limits, operational practices, fees, and cap-and-trade systems. These petitions are part of a larger effort by EPA to regulate GHG emissions from various sectors, including cars, trucks, ships, and nonroad engines and vehicles. The President may disapprove of these standards if they pose a hazard to aircraft safety. The EPA has not taken action on aircraft petitions to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, focusing instead on cars and trucks. The agency's decision on one sector can impact others and a large portion of the economy. New stationary sources will need to install GHG control technology under the act's provisions. The President announced EPA's plan to set greenhouse gas emission standards for new motor vehicles, in coordination with fuel efficiency standards by NHTSA. Proposed standards were published in a joint EPA-NHTSA notice. Both EPA and the President prefer Congress to enact legislation addressing GHG emissions specifically, rather than EPA using its current authority. New legislation could be more efficient and avoid legal challenges. The current language of the act regarding GHG emissions is vague, leading to potential legal challenges for the EPA. Options include using existing Clean Air Act authority as a temporary solution while new legislation is considered. Congress is focused on H.R. 2454, which aims to cap GHG emissions and establish an allowance trading system for major emitters. The aviation sector has not been directly targeted by climate change bills in Congress, except for a provision in H.R. 2454 that required EPA to set emissions standards for new aircraft and engines. This requirement was later removed from the bill that passed the House. The bill aims to regulate GHG emissions from civil aircraft indirectly by including the refining sector in its emissions cap. This approach would incentivize refiners to produce lower-carbon fuels, increase fuel prices, promote fuel-efficient aircraft, and impact consumers of aviation services. The cost of air travel and air freight has decreased significantly over the years due to increased efficiency and cost-cutting measures by airlines. However, controlling GHG emissions could potentially increase prices and reduce demand for air transportation. Unlike U.S. cap-and-trade bills, the EU has chosen to regulate GHG emissions from civil aircraft indirectly by targeting the refining sector. The EU regulates aviation emissions directly through its Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), which includes the aviation sector starting in 2012. This scheme covers various energy-intensive industries and will now include CO2 emissions from aircraft operators landing in or departing from the EU. The EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) regulates aviation emissions, starting in 2012. The scheme sets emission limits for aircraft operators, with allowances equivalent to a percentage of past emissions. Operators can receive free allowances initially, but the percentage of free allowances will decrease over time, with a goal of auctioning all allowances by 2020. Operators exceeding their cap must buy additional allowances on the carbon market. A reserve fund will allocate allowances to new operators and ensure market access. The EU Emission Trading Scheme sets emission limits for aircraft operators, with allowances decreasing over time. Sanctions are in place for non-compliance, including possible bans for airlines. The US has threatened trade sanctions in response to the EU's attempt to enforce compliance on foreign airlines. This highlights the challenge of regulating emissions in sectors like aviation without international agreement. Regulating upstream of the aviation industry, as most U.S. climate change bills would do, may avoid challenges through international institutions. The EU and ICAO are also addressing aircraft emissions, but the effectiveness of legislation in resolving disputes remains uncertain. The United States supports ICAO as the venue for regulating aviation emissions, opposing the EU's approach. The House-passed H.R. 2454 encourages a global regulatory framework through ICAO to minimize duplicative requirements and complications in emissions reduction programs. Greenhouse gas emission controls may impact U.S. aviation soon, with potential measures including engine emissions controls, sector-wide emission caps, upstream caps on fuel refiners, or carbon taxes. These measures could lead to improved aircraft fuel efficiency, increased air travel costs, and pressure to enhance the air traffic control system. U.S. airlines and air freight companies prefer voluntary measures to address the GHG issue, citing past fuel economy improvements. In the current recession, U.S. commercial aviation's greenhouse gas emissions are at roughly their 1990 levels, showing better performance compared to other transportation sectors. Despite increasing demand, emissions from aviation have increased less than other transportation segments. However, the sector remains a significant source of emissions, with projected growth potentially outpacing the overall economy's emission growth. This suggests that aviation emissions may need to be addressed in any mandatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Reducing emissions from aviation is complex due to the sector's numerous mobile emission sources, making direct controls challenging. Monitoring emissions is also difficult, and controlling only CO2 emissions may not address all impacts on climate. Further research is needed on effects like contrails on cloud formation. The sector's recent energy efficiency improvements face obstacles as load factors near their limits. The aviation industry faces challenges in reducing emissions, with some factors beyond its control such as air traffic control modernization and aeronautical research. Government agencies like the FAA and NASA play a role in emission reduction efforts. Funding for aviation environmental R&D programs has been cut, and international negotiations may lead to emission limits in other countries. Congress and the Administration have various options, including legislation and EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act. The existing Clean Air Act could be a crucial tool for the Administration to engage stakeholders and set the stage for potential legislation by Congress. EPA regulation is also a possible avenue for addressing emissions in the aviation industry."
