    "content": "The \"Workplace Integrity Act\" limits the use of official time by federal employees. Section 7131 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to restrict the granting of official time to federal employees, allowing it only for specific purposes related to representing exclusive representatives or processing grievances. Official time may be granted to employees for specific purposes such as representing exclusive representatives, participating in grievance proceedings, or attending consultations or meetings with management officials. The amount of official time granted is subject to agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative. The agency and exclusive representative must agree on the reasonable, necessary, and public interest amount of official time granted to employees. The total official time granted to an employee should not exceed 50% of their normal duty status time during a specified period. The Authority will regulate the duration of this period, not exceeding 12 months, uniformly applied by all agencies. The Authority determines if employees representing a labor organization are granted official time during proceedings. Official time cannot be used for negotiating collective bargaining agreements or internal labor organization activities. The Office of Personnel Management must report to the President and Congress annually on the use of official time, including the total number of employees granted official time, total employee-hours granted, and total costs. Agencies must provide data as required by the Office for these reports. The effective date for the reporting requirements on official time usage by federal agencies is specified in Section 3. The Act and its amendment will take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year starting at least 6 months after enactment. Reports must comply with section 7131(f) of title 5, US Code, starting with the report due before March 1st at least 5 months after enactment. Section 7131(f) of title 5, US Code, will be treated as in effect from the date of enactment of the Act. References to \"this section\" in 7131(f) will now refer to section 7131 before the Act's effective date."
