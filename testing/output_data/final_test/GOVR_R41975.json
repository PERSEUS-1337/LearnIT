    "content": "Technological developments related to the Internet benefit consumers by providing convenient ways to access information and entertainment on various electronic devices. New technologies help copyright holders promote their works but also increase the risk of infringement due to easier unauthorized reproduction and distribution. Internet streaming is a recent development that allows for content delivery. Internet streaming allows users to access creative content without downloading files onto their devices. Rogue websites illegally stream copyrighted material, reducing legitimate providers' viewership. Rogue websites streaming copyrighted material harm legitimate providers and the U.S. economy. Copyright holders can take legal action against those who illegally stream or distribute their works. The U.S. Department of Justice can also prosecute severe copyright infringements. The Department of Justice (DOJ) can criminally prosecute repeat and large-scale copyright infringers to impose harsher penalties and deter others. There is a disparity in criminal penalties for willful copyright infringement through reproduction and distribution (felony) versus public performance (misdemeanor). In the digital realm, DOJ prosecutors can seek felony charges for unauthorized copying and distributing of copyrighted material online, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. The U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator recommended amending laws to allow felony penalties for copyright infringement through streaming and new technologies. Existing laws only provide felony penalties for reproduction and distribution, raising questions about whether streaming should be considered a felony offense. The U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator recommended amending laws to allow felony penalties for copyright infringement through streaming and new technologies, to combat infringement involving new technology effectively. This report describes streaming technology, analyzes legislation in the 112th Congress to harmonize penalties for illegal streaming, and summarizes arguments for and against such a legislative change. Copyright is a federal grant of legal protection for creative works like books, movies, music, and artwork. The copyright holder has exclusive rights to control reproduction, distribution, public performance, and display of the material. Infringement occurs when a third party uses the work without permission, leading to civil and criminal consequences. The copyright holder can seek remedies like injunctive relief and damages for infringement. Criminal copyright infringement includes various offenses such as copyright infringement for profit, infringement without a profit motive, pre-release distribution of copyrighted work, circumvention of copyright protection systems, trafficking in counterfeit labels, bootleg recordings of live performances, and unauthorized recording. Internet technologies like instant messaging, email, peer-to-peer file sharing, and streaming enable electronic transmission of data files, which can be misused for online copyright infringement. This includes unauthorized distribution of copyrighted content through rogue websites and peer-to-peer file sharing. Technological advances have enabled the public performance of copyrighted works over the Internet, including live events and pre-recorded content. Streaming technology allows for the transmission of copyrighted material to various devices. Consumers can access entertainment content through legitimate video streaming websites like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube. Video streaming websites like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, HBO GO, MLB.com, and Crackle are popular and contribute significantly to broadband Internet traffic. There are also illegal streaming websites and cyberlockers that distribute copyrighted content without permission. Illegal streaming websites encourage users to upload copyrighted content for sharing through streaming or downloading. Copyright holders can sue these websites for infringement, but criminal prosecution is limited due to unclear laws on whether streaming constitutes distribution or public performance of copyrighted works. The lack of clarity over felony penalties for unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content has made federal prosecutors hesitant to pursue cases against illegal Internet streaming services. The Register of Copyrights testified that streaming is considered a lesser crime and may never be punished at all. Congress passed laws in 1997 and 2005 providing criminal penalties for Internet activity that infringes copyrights. The defendant in LaMacchia, an MIT graduate student, operated a bulletin board system for uploading and downloading infringing software and videogames. He did not profit from it, so the DOJ charged him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud instead of copyright infringement. The indictment was dismissed due to a Supreme Court ruling that wire fraud statute couldn't be used for copyright enforcement. The LaMacchia case involved a MIT student accused of distributing copyrighted software without profit. The NET Act was created to address loopholes in criminal copyright law by expanding definitions and penalties for infringement. The Copyright Act now defines \"financial gain\" broadly to include receiving anything of value, such as other copyrighted works. A new criminal copyright offense was created that does not require willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain, making reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works over $1,000 in value within 180 days eligible for prosecution. The NET Act amended the criminal code to include punishments for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works for commercial advantage or financial gain, specifically addressing online infringing activities. The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 included the Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act. The ART Act of 2005 created a new statute prohibiting unauthorized recording of movies in theaters and unauthorized distribution of pre-release copyrighted works to combat online piracy. The ART Act of 2005 introduced new criminal copyright infringement statutes, including willful infringement for commercial gain, reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works over a 180-day period, and making works available on a public computer network. Senator Klobuchar introduced a bill in 2011 to amend criminal penalties for copyright infringement. Senator Klobuchar introduced S. 978, also known as the Commercial Felony Streaming Act, which aims to authorize felony penalties for unauthorized streaming of copyrighted material for commercial gain. This bill expands the current felony offense of unauthorized distribution to include public performance of pre-release commercial copyrighted works. The Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced by Congressman Lamar Smith, includes provisions for criminal penalties related to streaming copyrighted works. It authorizes misdemeanor and felony penalties for non-commercial public performance of copyrighted works exceeding $1,000 in value within a 180-day period. H.R. 3261 and S. 978 propose criminal penalties for streaming copyrighted works with a retail value exceeding $1,000. The bills would allow imprisonment and fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations involved in 10 or more public performances within 180 days. The proposed amendments to the Copyright Act and related criminal provisions would require federal prosecutors to prove several elements to convict individuals for illegal commercial streaming. This includes demonstrating the existence of a valid copyright, willful infringement, infringement for commercial advantage or financial gain, and exceeding specific thresholds for public performances by electronic means. The proposed amendments to the Copyright Act would establish new thresholds for illegal commercial streaming, including 10 or more public performances of copyrighted works within 180 days and financial thresholds exceeding $2,500 or $5,000. The ART Act would amend the criminal offense provision to include public performances in the offense of willfully distributing works intended for commercial distribution. The bill would establish criminal liability for willful public performance of pre-release commercial copyrighted works, expanding current law. The offense includes infringing on a valid copyright, willfully committing infringement by publicly performing the work, and knowing the work was intended for commercial distribution. Section 201(a) of H.R. 3261 would establish criminal liability for willfully publicly performing a pre-release commercial copyrighted work by making it available on a computer network. This would result in a maximum of five years imprisonment and/or a criminal fine of up to $250,000 for an individual perpetrator. The amendment in H.R. 3261 establishes criminal liability for publicly performing copyrighted works through digital transmission, with a financial threshold of $2,500 for total retail value. The bill also allows evidence of fair market value of licenses to prove retail value, with no requirement for the market value to exceed $5,000. Additionally, a unique provision in the House bill includes criminal liability for willful public performance of copyrighted works through digital transmission. The amendment in H.R. 3261 establishes criminal liability for publicly performing copyrighted works through digital transmission, with a financial threshold of $2,500 for total retail value. The offense does not require proof of commercial advantage or private financial gain, but does require willful streaming of copyrighted works. The term \"willfully\" is interpreted as a voluntary violation of a known legal duty. Section 201(c) of H.R. 3261 includes a \"rule of construction\" regarding willfulness, stating that a person acting in good faith belief that their conduct is lawful shall not be considered willful. Section 201(b)(2) of H.R. 3261 would amend 18 U.S.C. Section 2319(c) to establish criminal penalties for willful infringement of copyrighted works through digital transmission, with a maximum of three years in prison and/or a criminal fine of up to $250,000 for an individual perpetrator. The offense of copyright infringement through digital transmission can result in criminal penalties, with varying punishments based on the value and number of public performances. S. 978 does not address criminal liability for unauthorized streaming, leading to debates on the need to update laws to address technological advancements facilitating illegal activities. The current criminal copyright infringement statute needs to be updated to address the rise of illegal Internet streaming of copyrighted content. The disparity in penalties for different types of copyright violations creates challenges in prosecuting unauthorized streaming websites. The Register of Copyrights supports creating felony penalties for unauthorized streaming to provide the same level of protection as other copyright violations. The organization representing copyright holders advocates for making illegal streaming a felony crime to protect the public performance right. This legislative change aims to address the battle between creators and unlawful distributors, who harm communities by depriving them of jobs and benefits. Some observers express concerns about potential unintended consequences of legislation that could harm communities by depriving them of jobs and tax revenues. Critics worry about the extension of criminal copyright law to include public performance, fearing misuse and uncertainty about how monetary thresholds will be interpreted by courts. It is difficult to determine the fair market value of licenses for public performances, especially for streaming activities. There is uncertainty about who is considered the public performer and liable for prosecution under the legislation. Critics question whether the threshold of \"10 or more public performances\" refers to unique views or separate postings. In the cable and satellite TV industry, disputes have arisen over retransmission agreements. A business dispute has emerged regarding retransmission agreements between cable and satellite companies and copyright holders, specifically concerning the streaming of copyrighted content to subscribers. Concerns have been raised about potential felony penalties under S. 978 for such streaming. The sponsor of S. 978 emphasizes that parties should not face criminal prosecution for contractual disagreements. There are speculations that copyright holders might use prosecution threats as leverage in disputes. Section 201(c) of H.R. 3261 aims to address concerns about willfulness. Critics argue against using limited government resources to prosecute operators of unauthorized streaming websites. Critics argue that government resources should not be used to prosecute operators of unauthorized streaming websites, as illegal public performance can be managed through existing civil remedies."
