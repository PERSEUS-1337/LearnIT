    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Go to High School, Go to College Act\" and includes provisions for an Early College Federal Pell Grant. Section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include Early College Federal Pell Grants for eligible students enrolled in early college high schools from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2020. Eligible students can receive grants to support their enrollment in postsecondary courses. The Early College Federal Pell Grant covers up to 4 full-time postsecondary semesters at an early college high school. Grants count towards the maximum period for receiving Federal Pell Grants, with the option for waivers on a case-by-case basis. The Early College Federal Pell Grant allows students to receive additional time for completing a postsecondary degree or credential. The grant follows the same terms and conditions as regular Federal Pell Grants. Eligible students must complete a full-time postsecondary semester to qualify for the grant. The Early College Federal Pell Grant provides funding for eligible students in partnership with early college high schools to cover tuition, fees, and books for postsecondary courses completed. Each early college high school must submit an annual report to the Secretary on the program of postsecondary courses offered to eligible students. The annual report from early college high schools includes data on eligible students' enrollment and completion rates, postsecondary credits earned, concurrent diploma and degree attainment, and postsecondary institution enrollment. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for Early College Federal Pell Grants awarded to eligible students in early college high schools, which are partnerships between public secondary schools and postsecondary institutions allowing students to earn both a high school diploma and transferable postsecondary credits. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for Early College Federal Pell Grants, which cover the cost of postsecondary education for eligible students in early college high schools. These schools offer postsecondary courses leading to a degree or certificate, with students earning at least 12 credit hours. Support services like tutoring are also provided. The curr_chunk explains that an eligible student at an early college high school would receive a Federal Pell Grant if they meet the requirements."
