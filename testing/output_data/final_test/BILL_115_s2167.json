Under the JCPOA, the Obama administration agreed to license the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism. Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew emphasized the use of sanctions to counter Iran's threatening behavior. Under the JCPOA, the United States lifted nuclear sanctions on Iran but maintained sanctions related to terrorism, regional destabilization, and human rights violations. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran despite the nuclear deal. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued licenses for the export of aircraft to Iran Air, the state-owned air carrier of Iran. These licenses allowed US financial institutions to provide financing for the sales. In addition, OFAC licensed more aircraft for purchase by Iran Air in November 2016. The Department of the Treasury had previously sanctioned Iran Air in 2011 for transporting military cargo. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics were designated under Executive Order 13382 for weapons proliferation. The IRGC was later designated under Executive Order 13224 for supporting terrorist groups like Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban. Iran Air, a state-owned carrier, delivered missile components to the Assad regime in Syria, classified as a state sponsor of terrorism, responsible for a conflict causing 400,000 deaths. Iran Air, despite being delisted in 2016, continued flying weapons resupply routes to government-controlled areas of Syria. Research showed that between January 2016 and May 2017, Iran Air operated 134 flights to Syria, with stops in Abadan, Iran, a suspected IRGC logistical hub for airlifts to the Assad regime. The Department of the Treasury confirmed that delisting Iran Air under the JCPOA does not affect their ability to designate or re-designate any Iranian airline. The United States can designate Iranian airlines engaging in sanctionable activities, including support for terrorism and human rights abuses. In April 2017, Aseman Airlines announced a deal to purchase commercial aircraft, requiring OFAC authorization. Aseman Airlines' CEO has ties to the IRGC. SEC. 3.
