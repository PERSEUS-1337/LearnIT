Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is through consuming mercury-contaminated fish. The ultimate solution to mercury pollution is to reduce global mercury use and releases to lower contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption, as uncontaminated fish is a crucial and healthy food source. Mercury pollution from industrial sources affects bodies of water globally, including the Great Lakes and the Arctic Circle. Only a few chlorine plants in the US still use the outdated mercury cell process, contributing to global mercury use. Less than 10% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US is produced using mercury. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States primarily relies on the mercury cell process for chlorine and caustic soda production, despite cost-effective alternatives being available and used in 90% of production. Other countries like Japan have already banned this process due to mercury contamination risks. The industry acknowledges the potential for mercury contamination in products and subsequent release into the environment. Despite this knowledge, neither the industry nor the EPA has effectively addressed the issue. The Environmental Protection Agency needs to improve its ability to track mercury use and emissions at facilities to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, as well as exposures to mercury, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, an amendment is proposed to regulate the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Effective January 1, 2012, the manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and State identifying hazardous waste and solid waste. The report identifies types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous and nonhazardous waste generated by a chlor-alkali facility, the mercury content of the wastes, how each waste was managed, the volume of mercury released into the air or water, and the estimated accumulation of mercury in pipes and plant equipment. The report for a chlor-alkali facility includes details on the accumulation of mercury in pipes and plant equipment, the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale, and the option to combine this report with others required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. For chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after January 1, 2009, the Administrator will conduct a mercury inventory within 1 year of closure, covering mercury quantities purchased, remaining in equipment, and generated as waste. The Administrator will obtain records and information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine mercury releases into the environment. This is a conforming amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Administrator will obtain records and information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine mercury releases into the environment, as a conforming amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act. Sec. 6A addresses the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
