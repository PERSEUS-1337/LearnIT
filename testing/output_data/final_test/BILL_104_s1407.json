Energy crops provide soil and water conservation, wildlife habitat benefits, and can be harvested without compromising conservation efforts. They can enhance farm income, supply a significant portion of US energy needs, trap carbon, and improve air quality. Harvesting energy crops on conservation reserve land is addressed in Section 3. Section 1232 of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include provisions for energy crops, defining them as plants used for energy production. The Secretary, in consultation with State technical committees, may designate demonstration areas for harvesting energy crops on up to 1,000,000 acres of land. The Secretary may allow landowners in designated demonstration project areas to harvest energy crops on their land under certain conditions, including implementing conservation measures, harvesting on a limited portion of the land, and maintaining grasses or trees if energy crop harvesting is discontinued. The Secretary may establish a bid system for landowners to reduce rental payments in exchange for harvesting energy crops. The Secretary will also provide cost-sharing for converting land to produce energy crops. The Secretary allows landowners to extend energy crop contracts for up to 5 years and provides priority for reenrollment at a fair rental rate upon contract expiration. SEC. 4.
