    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biliteracy Education Seal and Teaching Act\" or the \"BEST Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of celebrating cultural diversity and promoting language skills for students to succeed in the 21st century. It commends students proficient in multiple languages and encourages others to follow suit. The study of world languages in schools is vital for cognitive development, national economy, and security. Recognizing student language proficiency will benefit higher education and employers. California has led in implementing a State system for language education. California pioneered the first State system in the Nation to award a Seal of Biliteracy to over 10,000 graduating high school seniors in 2012. Students in every State should have access to a Seal of Biliteracy program. The State Seal of Biliteracy Program was established in California in 2012 to award graduating high school seniors. It is a program that should be accessible to students in every state. The Secretary of Education awards grants to States to establish or improve a Seal of Biliteracy program recognizing student proficiency in English and a second language. States must submit an application detailing proficiency criteria and ensuring students receive a seal on their diploma. The Seal of Biliteracy program requires students to submit an application to the State, demonstrating proficiency in a second language and meeting criteria set by the State. Students must also ensure they will receive a secondary school diploma or its equivalent without being charged a fee for the application. The Seal of Biliteracy program allows students proficient in a second language to apply under specific eligibility criteria. Grant funds are used for program administration, outreach, and education. Grants are awarded for 2 years and can be renewed, with limitations on the number of grants a recipient can have at one time. The Seal of Biliteracy program allows students proficient in a second language to apply for grants. Recipients must return any unspent funds within 6 months of the grant term ending. A report on program implementation is due 9 months after receiving the grant. Definitions for terms like \"secondary school\" and \"second language\" are provided in the section. The Seal of Biliteracy program allows students proficient in a second language to apply for grants. The program is authorized to receive $10,000,000 annually from 2019 to 2023."
