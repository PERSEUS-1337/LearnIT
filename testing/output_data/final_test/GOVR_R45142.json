    "content": "Information warfare (IW) is a term used in recent hearings, news articles, and government documents. While there is no official U.S. government definition, it is generally seen as the use of information for a competitive advantage, including offensive and defensive efforts. Some associate \"warfare\" with armed conflict, but political warfare involves using political means to achieve goals. George Kennan defined political warfare as using all means short of war to achieve national objectives. Information warfare (IW) involves employing all means, overt and covert, short of war to achieve national objectives. It includes political alliances, economic measures, propaganda, and clandestine support of foreign elements. IW targets a nation state's government, military, private sector, and population, operating below armed conflict to protect and exploit the information environment through offensive and defensive operations. Information warfare is conducted in crisis, conflict, and peacetime to influence public opinion and decision-makers by targeting human cognition. It may involve persuasion, influence operations, or psychological operations, creating confusion to paralyze decision-making. Decision-makers face contradictory reports, hindering their ability to discern the truth. Information warfare, akin to the \"fog and friction\" of war, creates uncertainty and hinders decision-making. It involves civilians acting as proxies for governments, such as in Russian and Chinese IW strategies utilizing all elements of society to achieve political goals. Information warfare involves the use of various actors and techniques by authoritarian regimes to influence policymakers and gain an advantage. It can involve compelling citizens to participate through rewards, patriotism, or coercion. This can be a prelude to armed conflict or a way to gain competitive advantages without force. Information warfare is a term used to describe the strategic use of information as a weapon. Modern military theory divides warfare into strategic, operational, and tactical levels, with strategy involving planning to achieve national objectives. The Department of Defense defines the strategic level as determining national security objectives and using resources to achieve them. Information warfare occurs at the strategic level, while information operations (IO) involve using information-related capabilities to implement the strategy. Operations at the tactical level involve combat elements maneuvering to achieve objectives. Current U.S. government definitions view information operations as a military activity involving tactics. Information operations were initially seen as a military activity with tactics like computer network operations, psychological operations, electronic warfare, operations security, and military deception. Psychological operations aim to influence foreign entities through information to support U.S. goals. PSYOPs, now known as military information support operations (MISO), aim to influence foreign target audiences in support of U.S. goals. Electronic warfare involves using electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack the enemy. Operations security identifies critical information and analyzes friendly actions, while military deception deliberately misleads. Military deception, closely related to PSYOP, focuses on misleading adversary decisionmakers to influence their actions. The Secretary of Defense defines Information Operations as the integrated use of information-related capabilities to influence adversaries' decision-making while protecting friendly forces. This definition emphasizes achieving desired effects rather than specific tactics. Information Operations (IO) encompass various tools and activities in the information environment to create desired effects. Strategic communication, public diplomacy, public affairs, and cyberspace operations are supporting capabilities. MISO, a key component of IO, focuses on conveying information to influence foreign audiences' behavior and emotions. It targets not only adversaries but also friendly and neutral populations. Some entities in the U.S. military are reverting to the PSYOP title to boost morale. The Army plans to rename its units from MISO to PSYOP. National security strategists may use different terms for information warfare, focusing on military or government applications. Related terms like active measures and hybrid warfare are also used in conjunction with IW. Active measures involve state-sponsored influence operations, while hybrid warfare combines conventional, irregular, and information warfare. Hybrid warfare combines conventional, irregular, and information warfare, including economic competition. Gray zone warfare involves achieving goals while denying rivals' by using non-traditional military forces. Irregular warfare is a violent struggle for influence among state and non-state actors. Unconventional warfare supports foreign insurgencies against governments. Asymmetric warfare involves belligerents with differing military power or tactics. Information warfare can help overcome this disparity. Soft power is the ability to attract rather than coerce, according to Joseph Nye. Public diplomacy uses various tools to influence opinions in other countries. Disinformation campaigns are commonly used in this context. Disinformation campaigns are a key tool in information warfare, where propaganda and factual information are used to influence opinions and strategic decisions. This includes the dissemination of misleading but true information to shape perceptions and steer decision-makers towards specific actions. Misinformation and disinformation are tactics used in information warfare to influence opinions and decisions. Misinformation spreads false information unintentionally, while disinformation intentionally spreads false information. These activities occur within the information environment, which includes command and control systems. The information environment encompasses the physical, informational, and cognitive layers where national power can be projected. Cyberspace, as defined by William Gibson, is a consensual hallucination experienced by billions, emphasizing the human element. In JP 3-12, DOD defines cyberspace as the global domain within the information environment. Cyberspace is defined as the global domain within the information environment, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, and computer systems. It is criticized for lacking the human element, impacting military organization for Information Operations (IO). Cyberspace serves as a force multiplier for Information Warfare (IW) activities, with social media and botnets amplifying messages to create discord. While many associate IO with cybersecurity, within the DOD, IO and cyberspace operations are distinct doctrinal activities. Offensive cyberattacks can be used to achieve strategic information warfare goals. Offensive cyberattacks can be used for strategic information warfare goals, such as creating psychological effects in a target population or influencing decisionmaking. Cyber operations may also disable adversary's communication lines or degrade critical infrastructure. Information Operations (IO) can be overt, with government sponsorship known, or covert, where sponsorship is denied if exposed. Cyberspace provides an ideal battleground for covert IO due to anonymity. The United States lacks a formal government definition of Information Warfare (IW), with the Department of Defense (DOD) focusing on military operations in its definition of information operations. Cyberwarfare is not clearly defined, but offensive and defensive cyberspace operations are recognized as part of warfighting. Cyber-enabled information operations involve conducting IO in cyberspace, utilizing information-related capabilities for strategic objectives. Cyberspace operations are conducted by the United States Cyber Command, which is building a national cyber mission force with three teams. One team assists combatant commanders in planning and operations, such as targeting extremist websites. This cyber force is separate from troops conducting information operations, operating under different doctrine and located in different physical locations. The U.S. Information Agency (USIA) was responsible for supporting U.S. national interests abroad through information dissemination during the Cold War. It later merged into the State Department's Bureau of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs before being disbanded in 1999. Today, the Department of State-led Global Engagement Center (GEC) continues many of the former USIA activities, including a new $40 million initiative to combat state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda targeting the United States. The U.S. government's information warfare capabilities are primarily within the military, with the Department of Defense (DOD) being well-funded and potentially the epicenter for such activities. There are concerns about the militarization of cyberspace and the weaponization of information, especially regarding DOD's leadership in this sphere. The CIA has a history of conducting information warfare, particularly against guerilla organizations, and it is unclear how DOD's activities relate to the prohibition on domestic \"publicity or propaganda\" outlined in Title 10 U.S.C 2241. The Active Measures Working Group was established in 1981 to coordinate disinformation activities within the U.S. government during the Cold War. It collected and analyzed information to detect and expose Soviet propaganda efforts. The final report in 1992 warned that despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union, active measures remained a threat to U.S. interests. The United States Information Agency needs to monitor, analyze, and counter threats. Suggestions include convening a version of the Active Measures Working Group or resurrecting the U.S. Information Agency with added responsibilities. Information warfare has historical roots and can be effective in guerilla warfare. Information operations, including PSYOP and MILDEC, were crucial in guerilla warfare such as the Hukbalahap Rebellion in the Philippines and the CIA's manual for the contras in Nicaragua during the 1980s. These operations involved promoting narratives, using military deception tactics, and selectively using violence for propagandistic effects. The manual for the Contras in Nicaragua during the 1980s recommended the selective use of violence for propaganda and to neutralize government officials. Scholars cite the American Revolutionary War as an example of PSYOP and guerrilla warfare tactics, where leaflets were used to demoralize British troops and lure them to defect. Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" is traced as the origin of using information for decision superiority in warfare. Both nation states and terrorist organizations use information warfare for strategic purposes. Both nation states and terrorist organizations engage in information warfare to achieve strategic objectives. Russia is actively involved in information warfare activities as outlined in their doctrine. The National Defense Strategy prioritizes these threats, emphasizing how competitors and adversaries target battle networks and operational concepts through IW. Russia engages in information warfare activities, using social media tools to spread propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. This includes data breaches and manipulation of sensitive documents to influence political decisions and shape international responses. The ODNI released a report on Russian manipulation in the 2016 US presidential election, stating that Putin ordered an influence campaign to undermine public faith in the democratic process and harm Clinton's electability. The report highlighted cyber activities like network intrusions and data releases as tactical weapons used by Russia. The series of network intrusions, reconnaissance, and data releases were tactical weapons in a broader information warfare campaign around the U.S. presidential election. Russian government gained insight into negotiating strategies, foreign policy goals, and platforms of the incoming administration. Cyber tools were used to create psychological effects in the American population, compromising information fidelity and sowing discord. Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals for their involvement in the election. The indictment alleges that Russian operatives from the Internet Research Agency conducted \"information warfare\" on the U.S. population through social media, widening social divides and exploiting existing fractures in American society. Over 3,000 Russian-bought Facebook ads heightened tensions among racial, religious, and political groups. Russia is expected to continue its election-related information warfare, using propaganda, social media, and false personas to influence and exacerbate social and political divisions in the United States. The nature of these activities raises questions about whether they constitute an act of war or espionage. Information warfare is a tactic used to weaken adversaries without direct conflict, involving activities like propaganda, deploying soldiers for propaganda purposes, and using cyber operations to achieve information dominance. China's strategy focuses on using \"strategems\" to maintain information superiority and influence adversaries' thinking. The Chinese concept of \"Unrestricted Warfare\" combines information operations, cyberspace operations, irregular warfare, lawfare, and foreign relations to overcome the U.S. military superiority through strategy and information operations. China exploits U.S. technological vulnerabilities and theoretical blind spots in cyberspace, using computer network espionage for competitive advantage. China's industrial espionage, including stealing design data for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's C-17 military transport aircraft, provides economic, military, and national security advantages. This undermines the technical superiority of the United States and raises concerns about potential cyber attacks on aircraft command and control systems. China's network intrusion capabilities could plant undetectable cyber weapons for future use. China's \"Golden Shield\" program, known as the Great Firewall, combines legal policies and technology for censorship and surveillance. The concept of \"cyber sovereignty\" allows China to control internet borders to limit free-flow of information. The CIA has documented China's information warfare activities in the US, targeting academic institutions and think tanks to prevent negative research on China. In a February 2018 hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray raised concerns about Chinese Confucius Institutes at universities being used for espionage and to limit academic freedom. China invests in the film industry for cultural and economic influence, but its relationship with Hollywood is cooling. China portrays itself as a peaceful nation focused on internal development, denying any pursuit of international power. President Xi Jinping's statements emphasize China's non-threatening stance. Chinese information warfare tactics aim to shape perceptions. Chinese information warfare tactics aim to shape perceptions by encouraging complacency in potential adversaries. The Islamic State targets U.S. computer systems for defacement, denial of service, data theft, disabling websites, and data breaches. The \"Cyber Caliphate\" group conducts operations within the information environment. In December 2014, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI warned the U.S. military about ISIS using social media to create \"kill lists\" and recruit sympathizers. In 2015, U.S. Central Command's social media accounts were briefly hacked by individuals claiming affiliation with ISIS to show vulnerability. In April 2017, a pro-ISIS group hacked the State Department's website, stole data, and released a kill list of U.S. government officials. The Islamic State uses websites and redirects web traffic to project power online through propaganda spread on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. They release videos of brutal acts to convey strength and legitimacy, aiming to appear as a formalized organization. This includes videos showing attacks on U.S. soldiers in Niger, creating the perception of winning against a weakened U.S. military. North Korea has conducted information warfare activities since its founding in 1949, targeting South Korea and Japan to influence politics and outside powers like the United States. These activities have included propaganda units described as legitimate military targets by then-FBI Director James B. Comey. In addition to traditional IW tactics, North Korea has also developed a capable cyber program, as seen in the run-up to the release of The Interview in 2014. Following the release of the film \"The Interview\" in 2014, North Korea's Foreign Ministry condemned it as an act of terrorism and war. A cyberattack on Sony followed, attributed to North Korea by the FBI, causing data loss and internal email leaks. Threats of terrorist attacks on theaters showing the film led to cancellations, despite no specific intelligence of such a plot. The incident highlighted North Korea's history of information warfare and cyber capabilities. The cyberattacks on Sony by North Korea demonstrated the use of Information Warfare (IW) for political ends, raising concerns about North Korea's cyber capabilities. Whether conducted directly by the government or through proxies, the attacks affected decision-making, exploited fear, imposed censorship, and triggered a response from the U.S. government. North Korea's hostile cyber activities are escalating. North Korea's cyber activities are increasingly hostile, including theft, website vandalism, and denial of service attacks. Some analysts doubt their capability for large-scale destructive attacks on critical infrastructure. The international community's fears of unknown threats from North Korea may be exaggerated. While they can engage in global cyber nuisance or theft, they lack the ability for complex or devastating operations like the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear program. The ambiguous threat of North Korean cyberattack ability creates a psychological effect that could deter some countries from conducting operations on North Korean networks. North Korea's use of the information environment includes propaganda efforts to portray itself in a favorable light. Recent propaganda posters and stamps celebrate the 70th anniversary of the country's founding with declarations of victory on all fronts. The North Korean government and Iranian information operations target dissenters and adversaries, using propaganda tools to discredit them. Iran has disrupted internet access during protests and may have capabilities to attack critical infrastructure through cyber means. In 2011, cyberattacks targeted U.S. financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, disrupting banking operations for over a year. Speculated retaliation for the Stuxnet worm, attacks were linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards. A cyber intrusion at Bowman Dam in NY aimed to take over controls but failed due to the dam being offline. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, including the Iranian Cyber Army, are involved in cyber operations such as website attacks and cyber espionage. Some policymakers question if such actions could be considered acts of war triggering a military response. A cyberattack in an IW campaign could be seen as an act of war, potentially leading to a military response. Questions arise about whether certain cyber activities constitute armed attacks or aggression under international law. Congress may need to assess if the US is equipped to match competitors' IW strategies and deter foreign information operations. Currently, the Department of Defense's structures for cyberspace and information operations are divided, with a focus on computer network attacks. Congress may need to evaluate the integration of cyberspace operations to maximize their effects and address ongoing conceptual confusion hindering the Department of Defense's response to Information Warfare challenges. Considerations include the need for authorities for DOD to conduct counter-IO against foreign IW activities and the efficacy of IW as a military function or a whole-of-government responsibility."
