    "content": "Meta-learning is a technique that leverages data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive to prevent the meta-learner from learning a single model that performs all tasks zero-shot. This necessitates careful task design, such as shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from inputs. In this paper, a meta-regularization objective using information theory is designed to enable data-driven adaptation in meta-learning. This approach allows the meta-learner to determine what to learn from task training data and what to infer from task testing input, facilitating efficient adaptation to new tasks. The algorithm outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in scenarios where traditional meta-learning struggles. Meta-learning is crucial for quickly learning new tasks based on previous experience. It optimizes for few-shot generalization across meta-training tasks, allowing accurate predictions on test data. Current methods require careful task design to prevent task overfitting. In meta-learning, the memorization problem arises when the model generalizes on meta-training tasks but struggles to adapt to new tasks. Existing algorithms prevent this by designing tasks that no single model can solve zero-shot. In meta-learning, tasks are designed to be mutually-exclusive, requiring clever setup to ensure task-specific class-to-label assignments cannot be inferred from test inputs alone. Shuffling labels is a common method to achieve this with few-shot image classification datasets like MiniImageNet, but it may not be applicable to all domains where meta-learning is utilized. The primary contributions of this work are to identify and formalize the memorization problem in meta-learning and propose a meta-regularizer (MR) using information theory to mitigate this issue without restricting the task distribution. Standard regularization techniques do not effectively address the memorization problem in meta-learning. The metaregularization approach addresses the memorization problem in meta-learning by regularizing the information complexity of the model. This is motivated by previous work and can be rigorously justified by a PAC-Bayes bound on generalization. In experiments on task distributions involving few-shot regression and classification, memorization challenges were observed in gradient-based and contextual meta-learning methods. A meta-regularization approach improved adaptation and generalization, leading to performance gains on non-mutually-exclusive tasks. The focus was on the supervised meta-learning problem, where tasks are sampled from a distribution during meta-training. During meta-training, the goal is to learn a model for a new task by leveraging previous knowledge and a small amount of new task data. Meta-learning algorithms maximize conditional likelihood by learning distributions on meta-parameters and task-specific parameters. This approach improves adaptation and generalization in few-shot regression and classification tasks. Meta-learning algorithms aim to learn distributions on meta-parameters and task-specific parameters to improve adaptation and generalization in few-shot regression and classification tasks. These algorithms include MAML, which uses predictor network weights \u03b8 and task-specific parameters \u03c6, and contextual methods like CNP, which map task training data D to a summary statistic \u03c6 parameterized by \u03b8. Meta-learning algorithms like MAML and CNP aim to prevent overfitting by learning in a way that generalizes to novel tasks. However, without careful task design, these algorithms can end up ignoring task training data, leading to poor generalization. This memorization phenomenon is illustrated through examples like a 3D object pose prediction problem. In a 3D object pose prediction problem, a network can memorize training object poses, leading to low training error but poor generalization to unseen objects. This issue highlights the importance of preventing overfitting in meta-learning algorithms like MAML and CNP. In a meta-learning framework, adapting prescriptions based on patient symptoms and medical history can be challenging. Standard systems may memorize patient identities, leading to poor adaptation to new patients despite high accuracy on training data. This highlights the need to prevent overfitting in meta-learning algorithms like MAML and CNP. Memorization in meta-learning occurs when the model ignores task training data, leading to issues with generalization to new tasks. This problem distinguishes itself from typical overfitting in supervised learning. In meta-learning, memorization can occur when the model fails to adapt to task training data, impacting its ability to generalize to new tasks. This differs from overfitting in supervised learning. Initialization of \u03b8 can impact the model's generalization from limited data. Memorization in CNP happens when the network achieves low training error without using task training statistics \u03c6. Constructing tasks carefully, like N-way classification with randomly sampled classes, can prevent memorization issues. This approach ensures that task-specific information cannot be inferred from test inputs alone, leading to better generalization. The text discusses the challenge of preventing memorization in meta-learning tasks by using mutually-exclusive tasks. It highlights the burden on users to design the meta-training setup cleverly and explains the difference between mutually-exclusive and non-mutually-exclusive tasks. The text also mentions the graphical model for meta-learning and the importance of complete information for solving tasks. The text discusses preventing memorization in meta-learning tasks by minimizing training error and maximizing information from the task training dataset. It suggests restricting information flow from input and meta-parameters to improve prediction accuracy. The text describes controlling information flow between input and output in meta-learning tasks to prevent memorization. It suggests using task training data to make predictions and introduces an intermediate stochastic bottleneck variable to maximize information and reduce memorization. The text discusses using a regularized training objective to prevent memorization in meta-learning tasks by maximizing information flow between input and output. This involves minimizing the training loss and introducing a meta-regularization (MR) on the activations. In meta-learning tasks, a regularizer is used to prevent memorization by penalizing task information stored in meta-parameters. Stochasticity over parameters is modeled with a Gaussian distribution to limit information about training tasks. By penalizing task information stored in meta-parameters, meta-regularization limits the network's reliance on task training data for accurate predictions. This approach controls the complexity of the network that predicts test labels without using task training data. Meta-regularization is applied to uninvolved parameters in MAML and encoder parameters in CNP. Meta regularization approaches are derived to mitigate the memorization problem by analyzing whether they lead to better generalization. Specifically, meta regularization on the weights of MAML, known as MR-MAML (W), uses a Gaussian distribution to model stochasticity in the weights. The expected error on novel tasks is minimized by forming an empirical estimate due to the intractability of computing er(Q). The challenge lies in deriving \u03b8 \u00b5 and \u03b8 \u03c3. The text discusses the challenges of deriving \u03b8 \u00b5 and \u03b8 \u03c3 for meta regularization approaches in machine learning. It applies a PAC-Bayes bound to analyze generalization errors and presents a theorem with a probability inequality. The key difference from previous work is leveraging the task training data split. The text discusses leveraging task training data split for meta-regularization in machine learning. By setting P(\u03b8) = r(\u03b8) = N(\u03b8; 0, I), a low bound value indicates low test error probability. The meta-regularization on weights improves generalization on the meta-test set, optimizing negative log-likelihood for 0-1 loss. Previous works have addressed overfitting in metalearning. Approaches for mitigating overfitting in metalearning include reducing parameters in MAML, compressing task embedding, data augmentation from a GAN, using auxiliary objectives on task gradients, and entropy regularization. Prior methods focus on mutually-exclusive task distributions, while a new approach addresses the memorization problem with non-mutually-exclusive tasks. This solution is applicable to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning methods and is more effective than prior regularization approaches like TAML. Regularization approaches like TAML are ineffective for addressing overfitting in meta-learning. Our approach penalizes information from inputs and parameters to encourage task-specific variables to contain more information driven by per-task data, using PAC-Bayes theory to study generalization error. Our analysis focuses on using PAC-Bayes theory to study the generalization error of meta-learning and meta-regularization. Unlike prior works, we only consider preupdate meta parameters in the generalization bound and explicitly account for the splitting of data into task training and validation sets. This approach aims to address the memorization problem in a practical setting. Memorization in meta-learning differs from overfitting in supervised learning. It occurs at the task level, where the model memorizes functions rather than labels. Generalization is based on both meta-training and new task data. Regularization methods aim to balance network complexity. Meta-regularization aims to govern model complexity in meta-learning to prevent one complex model from solving all tasks, while still allowing the model's dependency on task data to be complex. Standard regularization techniques do not effectively solve the memorization problem. Experimental evaluation seeks to determine the prevalence of memorization across different algorithms and domains, its impact on algorithm performance on non-mutually-exclusive task distributions, the effectiveness of meta-regularization in mitigating the problem with various meta-learning algorithms, and whether the memorization problem is distinct from standard overfitting. The study explores meta-learning problems with non-mutually-exclusive task distributions using MAML and CNP algorithms. A toy sinusoid regression problem is considered, where the amplitude and other parameters are sampled uniformly. The study investigates meta-learning with MAML and CNP algorithms on a sinusoid regression problem. Data is sampled from a set of points, with u and amplitude A as input. Adding the amplitude input leads to memorization solutions for MAML and CNP, while meta-regularized versions adapt to the data. The study compares MAML and CNP algorithms on a sinusoid regression problem. Meta-regularized versions (MR-MAML and MR-CNP) outperform unregularized methods by adapting to the data. Additionally, a multi-task regression dataset based on Pascal 3D data is created for meta-training and testing. The meta-learning algorithm uses a 128 \u00d7 128 gray-scale image as input and predicts orientation relative to a fixed canonical pose. While achieving low meta-training error, it struggles with novel objects at test time due to lack of exposure. Hyperparameters like learning rate and \u03b2 are chosen carefully for optimization. The meta-learning algorithm's convergence point is influenced by the optimization landscape and training dynamics, leading to two modes of the objective: memorization and adaptation. Models converging to memorization solutions have lower training error, highlighting the need for meta-regularization. Meta-regularization on activations depends on the learning rate, while on weights consistently converges to adaptation solutions. This suggests that activations may not always prevent memorization. Our hypothesis suggests a solution where bottlenecked activations encode only the prediction y* to achieve low training MSE and regularization loss without task training data. However, this solution does not work well with meta-regularization on weights due to the complexity of the function producing the predicted label. Therefore, regularization on weights is proposed as a methodology in experiments. Comparisons between MAML and CNP are made in quantitative results. In experiments, meta-regularization on weights is proposed as a methodology to improve performance. Comparisons between MAML and CNP with their meta-regularized versions show that meta-learning with meta-regularization outperforms other methods significantly. The test error is shown to be influenced by the meta-regularization coefficient \u03b2, which allows for tuning the model's adaptation versus reliance on prior information. Meta-regularization is effective in inducing adaptation for good generalization. Comparison with standard regularization techniques shows that standard methods do not solve the memorization problem. Memorization is studied in few-shot classification tasks using Omniglot and MiniImagenet benchmarks. In the non-mutually-exclusive N-way K-shot classification problem, MR-MAML outperforms previous methods on all tasks, including MAML, TAML, and fine-tuning. The study evaluates different algorithms on non-mutually-exclusive classification tasks and finds that MR-MAML shows significant improvement in performance. In the study, MR-MAML outperforms MAML and TAML by controlling pre-update accuracy and encouraging the use of task training data. Meta-regularization does not degrade performance on standard tasks and leads to improvements in non-mutually-exclusive settings. Meta-regularization improves performance in non-mutually-exclusive settings without degrading performance in other settings. Meta-learning has been successful in few-shot learning but current algorithms require mutually exclusive task distributions, limiting its application. Failure mode is identified as a memorization problem resulting from training on non-mutually-exclusive tasks, different from label-level overfitting in supervised learning. Various meta-learning algorithms illustrate this issue across domains. The proposed algorithm-agnostic meta-regularization (MR) approach addresses the memorization issue in meta-learning by controlling model complexity and encouraging the use of task training data. This approach is applicable to various real-world applications such as personalized speech recognition systems and learning robots. The proposed meta-regularization approach aims to tackle memorization challenges in meta-learning by controlling model complexity and promoting the utilization of task training data. This work introduces detailed algorithms for meta-regularization on weights with conditional neural processes (CNP) and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). For CNP, regularization is applied to encoder weights, while for MAML, weights from input to an intermediate hidden layer are regularized. This helps restrict the complexity of the pre-adaptation model without affecting the post-adaptation model. The proposed meta-regularization approach aims to address memorization challenges in meta-learning by controlling model complexity and leveraging task training data. Detailed algorithms for meta-regularization on weights with conditional neural processes (CNP) and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) are introduced. For CNP, regularization is applied to encoder weights, while for MAML, weights from input to an intermediate hidden layer are regularized to restrict pre-adaptation model complexity. The Meta-Regularized Methods in Meta-testing input aim to control model complexity and address memorization challenges in meta-learning. The approach involves regularization on weights for conditional neural processes (CNP) and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The meta-training loss serves as an upper bound for cross entropy, with a focus on preventing memorization by the meta-parameters. The meta-regularized methods aim to control model complexity and prevent memorization challenges in meta-learning by applying regularization on weights for conditional neural processes (CNP) and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The goal is for the meta-learner to extract information from meta-training tasks and test task data to serve as a prior for novel task examples, represented by a distribution Q over possible models. The meta-learner minimizes error on novel tasks by learning Q to perform well on them. The text discusses minimizing error on novel tasks in meta-learning by estimating generalization error using a PAC-Bayes bound. The goal is to relate the error to the learning algorithm and derive generalization bounds on tasks and examples. The text introduces a classical PAC-Bayes bound to derive generalization bounds on task and datapoint level generalization. It discusses relating error to the learning algorithm and establishing bounds for task-level and within-task generalization. The text introduces a PAC-Bayes bound for deriving generalization bounds on task and datapoint level generalization, focusing on error in the learning algorithm and establishing bounds for task-level and within-task generalization. The bound is applied to meta-learner generalization, with a focus on pose prediction in a multi-task regression dataset based on Pascal 3D data. The dataset for pose prediction includes 10 classes of 3D objects with 65 total objects. 50 objects are used for meta-training and 15 for meta-testing. Each object has 100 images rendered with random orientations. The input is a 128x128 grayscale image, and the label is the orientation within [0, 10]. The meta-learning algorithm uses a convolutional encoder to map the input image to a 20-dimensional latent representation for task training and testing. The network uses a convolutional encoder to map input images to a latent representation for task training and testing. The feature extractor and aggregator map the concatenated (z, y) pairs to a 200-dimensional task summary statistics \u03c6. The decoder then maps (\u03c6, z*) to the prediction \u0177*. The model is trained with 5 gradient steps in the inner loop and evaluated with 20 gradient steps at test-time on the Omniglot dataset. The MiniImagenet dataset contains 100 classes of images with 64 training classes, 12 validation classes, and 24 test classes. The meta-training classes are partitioned into sets for 5-way classification. The model uses a convolutional encoder for task training and testing, with a meta batch-size of 16 for 20-way Omniglot classification and 4 for 5-way MiniImagenet classification. The metalearning rate is chosen from {0.001, 0.005} and the \u03b2 for meta-regularized methods are chosen from {10^-7, 10^-6}. The optimal hyperparameters for meta-learning methods are chosen via cross-validation. Meta-learning algorithms converge to the memorization solution, requiring test tasks to be similar to train tasks for low test error. CNP generalizes only to points seen in training, while MAML uses task training data for performance improvement. MR-MAML and MR-CNP achieve excellent test performance on sinusoid task by avoiding converging to a memorization solution. Meta-regularization in CNP and MAML restricts weights connected to A close to 0, preventing memorization issues. Pre-update accuracy for non-mutually-exclusive classification experiment is reported in Table 5. The pre-update accuracy for MAML and MR-MAML reflects the memorization problem. In the 20-way 1-shot Omniglot example, MAML has a pre-update accuracy of 99.2%, while MR-MAML has a pre-update accuracy of 5%. This difference explains why MR-MAML has higher test accuracy than MAML at test-time, as MR-MAML uses task training data for fast adaptation. MR-MAML controls meta-training pre-update accuracy close to random guess and achieves low training error after adaptation. Meta-regularization does not degrade performance on mutually-exclusive tasks. The accuracy numbers are not directly comparable to previous work due to the absence of data augmentation."
