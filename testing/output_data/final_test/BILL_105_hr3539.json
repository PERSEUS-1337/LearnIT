The term 'other medical condition associated with uranium mining or milling' includes conditions related to exposure to radiation, heavy metals, chemicals, or toxic substances in mining and milling. This involves high resolution CT scans, pathology reports, pulmonary function tests showing a 20% or more lung function reduction, and arterial blood gas studies. SEC. 5.
