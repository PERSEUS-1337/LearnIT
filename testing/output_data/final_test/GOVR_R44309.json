    "content": "Numerous federal, state, and local agencies, including the FDA and FSIS, regulate the safety of the U.S. food supply. FDA oversees most food products, while FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Appropriations for FDA and FSIS are determined by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation, part of an omnibus bill (P.L. 114-113), provided funding for these agencies. In FY2016, combined appropriations and fees for food safety activities at FDA and USDA will total around $2.5 billion, split between the two agencies. Funding and staffing levels between FDA and FSIS are disproportionate to the food supply each regulates. Congressional appropriators have increased funding for FDA food programs in response to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) authorized increased inspections at food facilities, tightened record-keeping requirements, extended oversight to certain farms, mandated product recalls, and required food facilities to conduct safety plans. It also mandated improvements to illness surveillance systems and increased scrutiny of food imports. FSMA did not address meat and poultry products under USDA's jurisdiction but provided additional funding and staff for FDA's food safety activities. Funding for FSIS has remained mostly unchanged, with staffing levels differing substantially between the two agencies. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) authorized increased inspections at food facilities, tightened record-keeping requirements, extended oversight to certain farms, mandated product recalls, and required food facilities to conduct safety plans. It also mandated improvements to illness surveillance systems and increased scrutiny of food imports. FSMA did not address meat and poultry products under USDA's jurisdiction but provided additional funding and staff for FDA's food safety activities. Funding for FSIS has remained mostly unchanged, with staffing levels differing substantially between the two agencies. Congress authorized funds for FSMA but did not provide full funding for FDA to perform expanded activities. Concerns were raised about the budgetary climate and whether there would be enough money to overhaul the U.S. food safety system. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that fully implementing FSMA could increase net federal spending by about $1.4 billion over a five-year period. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) did not include revenue from new user fees to offset costs. Congress considered facility registration fees but did not enact them. CBO estimated $240 million in new fees from FY2011-FY2015. FDA received $162 million in funding increases for food safety programs from FY2011-FY2015. FDA continues to implement FSMA regulations. FDA's budget authority for food safety and FSMA implementation has totaled $168.4 million, with a reported staffing level of 3,700 FTEs in FY2015. Additional funding is needed to fully implement FSMA, as there is a significant funding gap without it. State agriculture officials, NASDA representatives, food industry groups, public health organizations, and victims of food-borne illness are all advocating for increased funding for FDA's food safety activities, including FSMA implementation. The enacted FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides a $104.5 million increase in budget authority, close to the Administration's request of $109.5 million, which is more than double the amount proposed in the House and Senate FY2016 committee bills. The House and Senate FY2016 committee bills proposed increased funding for FSMA, with the House bill allocating $41.5 million and the Senate bill allocating $45.0 million. Both committees noted that these increases would help the FDA prepare for FSMA implementation. The enacted FY2016 appropriations provide $987.3 million for FDA's Foods program, the same amount requested. Key program areas include Inspection Modernization, Education for Industry, Import Safety, and Risk Evaluation. FDA's Foods program, with a budget of $987.3 million in FY2016, focuses on food safety activities and plays a major role in assuring the safety, quality, and labeling of the nation's food supply. The program has adapted to the increasing complexity of the U.S. food supply, including emerging pathogens and technological innovations in production and processing. The FDA's budget for food safety activities totaled $1.2 billion in FY2015 and could increase to over $1.3 billion annually with the enacted FY2016 appropriation. This budget includes funding for various FDA program areas related to food safety, such as food additives, antimicrobial resistance, nutrition labeling, and dietary supplements. The FDA's budget for food safety activities was $1.2 billion in FY2015 and could increase to over $1.3 billion annually with the enacted FY2016 appropriation. Congressional appropriations would be supplemented by existing user fees authorized under FSMA, generating less than $18 million per year. The Administration proposed new user fees totaling $167.7 million, but they were not included in enacted appropriations from FY2012 through FY2015. Both the House and Senate reported bills did not include the proposed new fees, despite calls from Representatives DeLauro and Farr to stop requesting additional user fees. Industry representatives and Representatives DeLauro and Farr have opposed the Administration's request for additional user fees for FDA implementation of FSMA. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation prohibits funds from being used for FSMA requirements related to dried spent grain byproducts for animal feed. It also allocates $5 million for state agency grants for educational programs. The House and Senate committee reports allocate funds for state agencies to purchase equipment for healthier meals and food safety. They also include provisions for FDA to take additional food safety actions and support FSMA implementation. The House committee reports provide $2.5 million for FSMA implementation and interagency coordination with USDA's NIFA. Both committees express concerns and encourage FDA to form partnerships under FSMA. The House and Senate committee reports express concerns about the FSMA rulemaking process and economic impacts. They include provisions related to FDA's scientific integrity policy and remind FDA to submit required reports on schedule. The enacted FY2016 appropriation contains provisions on fish and seafood labeling and safety. The enacted FY2016 appropriation includes provisions on fish and seafood labeling and safety, specifying that \"Alaskan pollock\" refers only to fish harvested in Alaska or adjacent areas. It also directs the FDA to develop labeling guidelines for genetically engineered salmon before allowing its introduction into interstate commerce. The Senate report addresses seafood safety, urging FDA to update advice for pregnant women and tackle economic integrity issues like mislabeling. The FY2016 appropriation did not include a rider to preempt state laws on labeling genetically engineered foods. The Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, led by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, supported this provision. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) supported language in the omnibus bill to address state laws on labeling genetically engineered foods, consistent with a voluntary labeling bill. H.R. 1599 passed the U.S. House of Representatives in July 2015. Some states have introduced bills to label genetically engineered foods, while groups like the Center for Food Safety oppose efforts to block state labeling laws. The Senate committee report also urges FDA to resolve disputes with the European Union on molluscan shellfish sanitation protocols. The House committee is addressing trade concerns by expediting audits of European molluscan shellfish growing areas and seeking equivalency in sanitary standards. They are also investigating illnesses related to imported pet food, specifically jerky treats from China. House appropriators are requesting FDA to provide updates on their investigation and work with local governments to reduce foodborne illness risks. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation includes policy riders for FDA's Foods program, such as restrictions on implementing the 2015 \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\" and limits on reducing sodium in federally reimbursed meals. USDA is directed to conduct a study on these issues. The enacted law includes provisions related to FDA's sodium reduction focus, exemption for schools from whole grain requirements, delay in enforcing restaurant menu labeling regulations, and the phase-out of partially hydrogenated oils starting in June 2018. The Senate committee expressed concerns about FDA's actions regarding sodium and partially hydrogenated oils. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides $1.015 billion to FSIS, slightly more than the Administration's request but less than the previous year. FSIS appropriations are divided into various subaccounts, with Federal, State, International Inspection, Codex Alimentarius, and Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System receiving specific amounts. The enacted law does not include the Administration's reproposed user fee of $4 million for additional inspection costs. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation provides $2.5 million for FSIS to implement the catfish inspection program as required by the 2014 farm bill. Both House and Senate committee reports include provisions for FSIS to take additional food safety actions and improve the safety of the U.S. seafood supply. Committees encourage the development of technologies for rapid screening of seafood at ports. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation includes funding for FSIS to implement the catfish inspection program. Committees urge the development of technologies for rapid seafood screening at ports and locations. The enacted law mandates a minimum of 148 FTEs for HMSA enforcement. Policy riders in the appropriation bill address USDA programs and repeal country-of-origin-labeling requirements. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation includes funding for FSIS to implement the catfish inspection program and mandates a minimum of 148 FTEs for HMSA enforcement. Policy riders in the appropriation bill address USDA programs, repealing country-of-origin-labeling requirements for certain beef and pork products due to a WTO ruling. Other provisions include restrictions on horse slaughter, imported processed poultry products from China, and rules governing beef importation. The House and Senate committee bills address USDA's rules on beef importation from Argentina and Brazil, requiring APHIS to prioritize audits of recognized regions. The FY2016 Agriculture appropriation does not include the Administration's proposal for a single food agency within HHS. The Administration's proposal for a new food safety agency within HHS differs from previous legislation that aimed to create a single independent Food Safety Administration by consolidating FDA and USDA authorities. Some groups oppose the plan, citing concerns about HHS's expertise and resources compared to USDA's record in food safety inspection. Large-scale reorganization of agencies falls under the jurisdiction of authorizing committees."
