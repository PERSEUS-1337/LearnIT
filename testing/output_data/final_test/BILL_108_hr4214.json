    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004\" and includes findings related to anti-Semitism. Congress finds that acts of anti-Semitism have increased significantly worldwide, with specific incidents in Australia, Russia, and Canada in early 2004. In Toronto, Canada and Toulon, France, incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism occurred in March 2004. Additionally, anti-Semitism is also present in the Arab and Muslim world through various mediums like books and television broadcasts. In November 2003, Arab television aired an anti-Semitic series called \"Ash-Shatat\" depicting a Jewish plot for world control. The rise in anti-Semitic violence led to international organizations like the OSCE holding a conference in Vienna dedicated to addressing the issue. The OSCE will convene a conference in Berlin on April 28-29, 2004, to address anti-Semitism. The United States strongly supports efforts to combat anti-Semitism through bilateral relationships and interactions with international organizations. Congress has consistently supported addressing the rise in anti-Semitic violence, passing resolutions during the 107th Congress expressing concern with the escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe. Congress supports efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide through bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations like the OSCE. The Department of State should document acts of anti-Semitism globally. The Secretary of State must report on global acts of anti-Semitism, including violence against Jewish people and institutions, government responses, laws protecting religious freedom, and efforts to promote tolerance education."
