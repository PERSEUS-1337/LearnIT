    "content": "Broadband technologies, delivered through various means, are crucial for telecommunications services like voice, video, and data. Private sector companies have been deploying broadband across the US since the late 1990s. The FCC's National Broadband Plan in 2010 highlighted broadband as essential for economic growth, job creation, and improving quality of life by enabling applications like telemedicine, e-commerce, and public safety. Broadband is seen as essential infrastructure for various sectors such as telemedicine, e-commerce, and public safety. Rural and tribal areas are particularly underserved in terms of broadband access. The definition of broadband in regulations impacts federal policies and resource allocation for promoting deployment in unserved areas. The FCC's definition of minimum speed thresholds is a key issue in determining regulatory steps. The FCC's definition of broadband, based on minimum speed threshold levels, influences regulatory decisions and policies. Broadband is defined as high-speed telecommunications capability enabling users to transmit voice, data, graphics, and video. This definition impacts federal policies and resource allocation for promoting deployment in underserved areas. Broadband is defined by setting a minimum threshold speed for high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video transmission. Broadband speeds are measured in download and upload speeds, typically expressed in Mbps. Fixed wired technologies like cable modem and fiber offer higher speeds compared to mobile wireless and satellite broadband. For example, the average mobile speed in the US is 10.7 Mbps, while the overall average for all broadband technologies is 18.7 Mbps. The FCC's Measuring Fixed Broadband Report shows that cable and fiber offer higher download speeds than satellite broadband. Download and upload speeds determine possible applications for broadband users. Federal funding supports broadband infrastructure in rural areas through programs like the FCC's Universal Service Fund and RUS broadband grant and loan programs at USDA. Minimum broadband speed thresholds are set to determine eligible areas for funding. The programs have set minimum broadband speed thresholds to determine eligibility for support, with varying speeds based on specific program needs. The 2014 farm bill established a minimum acceptable level of broadband service for rural areas at 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream, with flexibility for adjustments every 2 years. The Federal Register sets the minimum acceptable level of broadband service for rural areas, allowing for adjustments over time. The latest NOSA for the Rural Broadband Access Loan program defines existing broadband service as a minimum of 25 Mbps (download)/3 Mbps (upload) for both fixed and mobile broadband. The FCC is required to regularly inquire about broadband availability to all Americans. The FCC is mandated to regularly assess broadband availability to all Americans and determine if it is being deployed in a timely manner. If not, immediate action is required to accelerate deployment by removing barriers and promoting competition in the telecommunications market. The FCC sets a minimum broadband speed as a benchmark for its assessments. The FCC regularly assesses broadband availability and determines if it is being deployed in a timely manner. Minimum broadband speeds have increased over the years, with varying opinions among FCC commissioners on deployment. The Section 706 report plays a crucial role in these determinations. The FCC regularly assesses broadband availability and determines timely deployment. In 2015, the FCC raised minimum broadband speeds to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. Critics claimed this was to justify regulatory policies. The 2018 Broadband Deployment Report concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. The FCC's latest 706 determination states that broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely manner, which is a departure from previous determinations. Congress intended for the Commission to evaluate the current state of deployment to all Americans, rather than requiring every American to be served at this moment. The FCC's latest 706 determination states that broadband deployment is now considered reasonable and timely, a change from previous determinations. However, FCC Commissioner Rosenworcel dissents, pointing out that millions of Americans still lack access to broadband, especially in rural areas and among school-aged children. The FCC's latest Section 706 Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on broadband deployment was released on August 8, 2017. It proposed maintaining the 25 Mbps/3 Mbps benchmark for fixed broadband and solicited comments on how mobile broadband should factor into determining timely and reasonable deployment. The FCC's Section 706 NOI seeks comments on evaluating fixed and mobile broadband deployment separately to ensure advanced telecommunications capability reaches all Americans in a timely manner. The inquiry also considers the differences in technical characteristics and marketing strategies between fixed and mobile broadband services. The FCC is seeking comments on benchmarks for defining \"advanced telecommunications capability\" for fixed and mobile broadband. While maintaining a speed benchmark of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for fixed broadband, the FCC is considering setting a speed benchmark for mobile broadband. The Commission is evaluating available mobile broadband services and speeds to determine if a lower speed benchmark should be set. The FCC is considering setting a speed benchmark for mobile broadband, with a proposed benchmark of 10 Mbps/1 Mbps. The issue of setting broadband service benchmarks in Section 706 reports has been controversial in Congress, with some disputing the current benchmark of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps as arbitrarily high. The Senators argued that the FCC's 25/3 broadband benchmark is too high and does not reflect what most Americans need. They pointed out that commonly used applications require speeds below 25 Mbps, and that many people choose not to purchase 25 Mbps service. The letter also mentioned that the benchmark discourages providers from offering faster speeds, and is inconsistent with other broadband benchmarks. The FCC is considering setting the broadband benchmark at 25/3 Mbps for fixed broadband and 10 Mbps/1 Mbps for mobile broadband. Democratic Senators are concerned that this change could disadvantage rural, tribal, and low-income communities who rely on reliable fixed broadband services. The FCC is considering changing the broadband benchmark to 25/3 Mbps for fixed broadband and 10 Mbps/1 Mbps for mobile broadband. Democratic Senators are worried that this could harm rural, tribal, and low-income communities that rely on reliable broadband services. The FCC is considering changing the broadband benchmark to 25/3 Mbps for fixed broadband and 10 Mbps/1 Mbps for mobile broadband. Some parties oppose this change, arguing that mobile broadband is not a satisfactory substitute for fixed broadband due to its limitations in capacity, speed, and reliability. They also highlight the high cost of mobile data and the limited access to internet benefits for low-income and minority communities. Parties supporting FCC's consideration of altering the broadband benchmark argue that mobile broadband, including LTE 4G and future 5G deployments, should be considered as \"served\" areas. They emphasize the growing private sector investment in mobile broadband, the increasing use of mobile devices for various applications, and the need for the FCC to assess the reasonableness and timeliness of broadband deployment. The 2018 Broadband Deployment Report concluded that mobile and fixed broadband are not full substitutes for each other, as they have distinct differences in technology and consumer preferences. Mobile broadband is not currently a full substitute for fixed service due to variability in actual speeds and differences in user mobility and demands. During the FCC's consideration of its latest 706 Report, three issues for Congress were how and at what level broadband benchmarks should be set, whether the FCC would determine that broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, and how that determination and those benchmarks would impact current and future broadband policies and programs intended to improve broadband availability and adoption throughout the nation. The FCC's annual Section 706 determination is likely to remain contentious as the debate over broadband benchmark thresholds continues. Stakeholders are divided on whether broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, with differing opinions on the inclusion of fixed or mobile broadband in the benchmark methodology. The broadband benchmark methodology now includes fixed or mobile broadband as indicators of adequate service. Setting broadband speed benchmarks can impact speeds in rural areas with federal subsidies. Higher speeds offer more applications but are costly, while lower speeds may reach more rural areas but offer less capacity. Policymakers must balance quality with limited funding for rural broadband connections. Policymakers must balance quality and quantity of rural broadband connections due to limited funding available."
