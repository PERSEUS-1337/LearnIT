    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Support for Democracy and Human Rights in Ethiopia Act of 2010\". Since the collapse of the Mengistu regime in 1991, Ethiopia has made progress towards democracy and economic growth. Despite this, the country remains one of the poorest in the world, with over half of the population living in extreme poverty. Ethiopia also faced a border war with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000, which was resolved through the Algiers Accord. Despite the agreement to abide by the Ethiopia-Eritrea Border Commission arbitration, Ethiopia has refused to comply with the final border demarcation, leading to regional instability. Eritrea has expelled the UN peacekeeping force and supported armed groups opposing the Ethiopian government, keeping alive the possibility of a renewed border war. The Ogaden National Liberation Front opposes the Transitional Federal Government, seen as a proxy for Ethiopia. Ongoing fighting between Ethiopian forces and ONLF in the Somali Region. Media and aid worker restrictions hinder monitoring of human rights abuses. Arbitrary arrests and detentions reported in the region. The Ethiopian government has been accused of human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture by military, police, and paramilitary forces. New laws passed before the 2010 elections severely restrict freedom of expression and association. The Department of State's 2009 report highlights frequent mistreatment despite laws prohibiting torture.

The UDJ party president, Birtukan Mideksa, remained in prison throughout the year despite a revoked pardon and reinstated life sentence.

The European Union Election Observer Mission criticized the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia for lack of transparency and a level playing field in the electoral process. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson also expressed concerns about the Ethiopian elections. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson expressed remorse that the Ethiopian elections did not meet international standards and emphasized the need for strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring a level playing field for all participants. The National Security Council also raised concerns about limitations on independent observation and harassment of media representatives in Ethiopia during the elections. The Ethiopian government has restricted political space for the opposition, intimidated and harassed individuals, tightened control over civil society, and limited independent media activities, which has led to concerns about freedom of expression and association.
