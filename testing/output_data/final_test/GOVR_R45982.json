If these bills are not enacted by October 1, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding with limitations and exceptions until final decisions are made. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding with limitations and exceptions until final decisions are made. CRs may be enacted for a period of days, weeks, or months to address special circumstances. If regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the time the first CR expires, further extensions might be enacted. None of the FY2020 regular appropriations bills was enacted prior to the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2019. H.R. 4378 was introduced in the House to provide continuing appropriations for projects and activities covered by all 12 regular annual appropriations bills through November 21, 2019. The legislation H.R. 4378 was passed by the House and Senate in September 2019, and signed into law by the President. It provides continuing appropriations for federal health care programs through November 21, 2019. The report analyzes the funding and budget enforcement issues, as well as agency-specific provisions included in the legislation. Continuing resolutions (CRs) fund projects and activities based on previous appropriations acts, specifying purposes, duration, and funding rates. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide budget authority at a restricted level based on previous appropriations acts. H.R. 4378 covers all 12 annual appropriations bills by extending funding for FY2020 through November 21, 2019, for projects and activities funded in FY2019. The CR maintains the terms and conditions of the FY2019 appropriations acts, extending agency authorities from the previous fiscal year. The FY2019 acts stipulated agency authorities and limited funds for activities without budget authority. Statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2020 are in effect, adjusted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. The CR includes budget authority subject to limits and exempt from them, such as \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism\" or \"emergency requirements.\" The Continuing Resolution (CR) provides funding through November 21, 2019, with exceptions for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism designations. Budget authority may be superseded by regular appropriations acts or another CR before November 21, with immediate cessation of funding for projects not included in subsequent appropriations acts. The Continuing Resolution (CR) provides funding through November 21, 2019, with exceptions for specific programs like the OCO/GWOT designations and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The budget authority remains at FY2019 levels, with some adjustments specified in Section 101 and anomalies for certain agencies. Funding for various programs such as the Assets Forfeiture Fund, Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Colorado River Basin Fund, immigration authorizations for Homeland Security, and Department of State's Ebola funding is provided in the FY2020 appropriations. Spending is subject to statutory limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011, with defense and nondefense categories. If spending exceeds the limit, adjustments are required. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets statutory limits on defense and nondefense spending. If these limits are breached, sequestration involves across-the-board cuts to bring spending into compliance. The Office of Management and Budget evaluates discretionary spending to determine if sequestration is necessary. For FY2020, evaluations must occur within 15 days after the congressional session ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the budgetary effects of interim CRs on an annualized basis. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the annualized amount for discretionary budget authority for regular appropriations subject to the Budget Control Act limits is $648.452 billion for defense and $604.669 billion for nondefense for FY2020. H.R. 4378 specifies that certain amounts designated as OCO/GWOT or disaster relief are not subject to the discretionary spending caps. The CR includes total annualized budget authority of $1.345 trillion, below the BBA 2019 agreement of $1.370 trillion.

The budget line for the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Secretary may be obligated under the House-passed Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, Defense, State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2020. This provision accounts for the transfer of the Strategic National Stockpile from CDC to the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response in HHS OS. The SNS provides medicines and supplies during public health emergencies. Funding for the SNS would be allocated to the HHS OS PHSSEF budget line instead of the CDC Public Health Preparedness and Response budget line. The report accompanying H.R. 2740 explains congressional intent for CDC's role in providing scientific expertise for countermeasure procurement and maintaining relationships with public health departments. Section 138 authorizes up to $20 million transfer to CDC for Ebola preparedness from the Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund.
