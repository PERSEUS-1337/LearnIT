    "content": "The Act titled \"Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act of 2015\" or \"REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act of 2015\" aims to address legal HIV discrimination. The Congress finds that many states have laws criminalizing perceived exposure to HIV, including behaviors with low or negligible risk of transmission. The CDC states that HIV is only transmitted through specific bodily fluids. HIV-specific criminal laws in various states classify exposure to HIV as felonies, with sentences ranging from up to 10 years to greater than 20 years. The number of prosecutions and arrests under these laws is unknown due to lack of available data, potentially underestimating their societal impact. State and Federal criminal laws do not reflect medical advances in HIV transmission and treatment. Condom use is effective in preventing transmission, but laws do not consider it as a mitigating factor. Antiretroviral medications reduce HIV to undetectable levels, lowering transmission risk. HIV/AIDS is now treatable, but legal frameworks have not adapted. Despite advancements in HIV treatment, people living with HIV are still being charged under severe criminal statutes due to the perception of their bodily fluids as deadly weapons. HIV-specific laws do not reduce risky behavior or increase disclosure, and they may even discourage testing. Placing legal responsibility solely on those diagnosed with HIV ignores other sexually transmitted pathogens. The public health message promoting safe behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases is undermined by focusing solely on HIV. Accused individuals face public humiliation, loss of employment, and violation of privacy rights. Convicted individuals may be labeled as sex offenders even in consensual cases, leading to destroyed employability and fractured family relationships. The United Nations urges governments to reconsider strict HIV-specific laws. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law, launched in June 2010, recommends limiting criminalization to cases of intentional HIV transmission. They also suggest that criminal law should not be applied when there is no significant risk of transmission. The Commission calls for the repeal of punitive laws and the enactment of laws that enable effective responses to HIV. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommends limiting criminalization to intentional HIV transmission cases and calls for the repeal of punitive laws. They advise against laws that criminalize HIV transmission, exposure, or non-disclosure of HIV status. The President's National HIV/AIDS Strategy also addresses HIV-specific criminal laws, suggesting that existing laws may not have the desired effect and could increase discrimination. Legislators are urged to reconsider laws that do not further public interest and health. The NHAS and PACHA recommend reviewing and updating HIV-specific criminal laws to align with current scientific knowledge and public health goals. They advocate for laws consistent with human rights-based approaches to disease control and prevention, avoiding unwarranted punishment based on health status. The Sense of Congress regarding laws or regulations directed at people living with HIV/AIDS is highlighted in Section 3. The sense of Congress is that laws and regulations regarding individuals with HIV/AIDS should not impose additional burdens based on their HIV status. Instead, these laws should be based on a public health approach and an understanding of HIV transmission, health implications, benefits of treatment, and the impact of punitive measures. The curr_chunk discusses policies, regulations, and judicial precedents related to public health, HIV, and their impact on affected individuals and communities. SEC. 4. REVIEW OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. The designated officials will conduct a national review of Federal and State laws, policies, regulations, and judicial decisions related to criminal and civil commitment cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The designated officials will conduct a national review of laws related to criminal and civil commitment cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS. They will consult with various stakeholders, including State attorneys general, public health officials, judicial officers, members of the United States Armed Forces, and organizations representing people living with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, they may utilize existing reviews conducted by Federal or State agencies, public health, legal advocacy, or trade organizations. The Attorney General will report the results of a review on laws related to criminal cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS to Congress and the public. This includes a summary of laws, policies, and judicial decisions that may impose additional burdens on people living with HIV/AIDS. The Attorney General will report on laws related to criminal cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS to Congress and the public, assessing if they reflect a public health-oriented understanding of HIV transmission, health implications, benefits of treatment, and the impact of punitive laws on public health. The Attorney General will report on laws related to criminal cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS, assessing their public health implications and the impact of punitive laws. This includes an analysis of the legal consequences and proportionality of punishments under HIV-specific laws compared to other communicable diseases. The Attorney General will analyze laws related to criminal cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS, including DWI and transmission of diseases, as well as vehicular manslaughter offenses. The analysis will focus on common elements in State laws, policies, and judicial precedents, with recommendations for State governments and adjustments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Attorney General will analyze laws related to criminal cases involving individuals with HIV/AIDS, including DWI and transmission of diseases, as well as vehicular manslaughter offenses. Within 90 days, updated guidance for States will be developed based on best practice recommendations to assist States dealing with criminal and civil commitment cases regarding people living with HIV/AIDS. Within 60 days of the guidance release, an integrated monitoring and evaluation system will be established by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Within 90 days of the report release, officials will propose adjustments to Federal laws, policies, and regulations based on recommendations. This may involve changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice through Executive order or statutory law. The Act does not discourage prosecuting individuals who intentionally transmit HIV. It does not increase appropriations and defines terms like HIV/AIDS and State."
