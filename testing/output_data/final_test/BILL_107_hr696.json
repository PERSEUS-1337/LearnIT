    "content": "The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2001\" allows for the expungement of criminal records for certain nonviolent offenders under a new subchapter D in Chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2001\" permits the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent offenders meeting specific criteria outlined in sections 3631 and 3632 of the Act. Requirements for expungement under the \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2001\" include never being convicted of a violent offense, fulfilling all court sentence requirements, remaining free from substance abuse for at least a year, and being rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the court. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2001\" requires individuals seeking expungement to have met all court sentence requirements, obtained a high school diploma or equivalent, completed at least one year of community service, and been rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the court. The term \"satisfaction of the court\" refers to meeting all conditions required at sentencing and probation. An individual may file a petition for expungement if convicted of a felony. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2001\" allows individuals convicted of a felony to petition for expungement in the United States district court. The court will consider evidence from the petitioner and the Government before ruling on the petition. The court will weigh the petitioner's interests against justice and public safety before granting expungement, which restores the individual to their pre-arrest status. After expungement, the individual is not required to disclose the conviction. Upon order of expungement, all official law enforcement and court records related to the arrest, criminal proceedings, and outcomes will be expunged or sealed, except for publicly available court opinions or briefs on appeal. The Department of Justice may maintain a nonpublic index of expunged records for law enforcement purposes, containing only alphanumeric identifiers and custody information. This index is accessible to Federal and State law enforcement personnel for subsequent adjudication. Authorized Disclosure: Expunged records can be accessed by the accused or their designated agent, prosecutors, law enforcement agencies, courts, agencies responsible for issuing gun licenses, and prospective employers for criminal or civil investigations. \"Applicants for law enforcement positions must be provided with all records obtained during background checks and given a chance to explain. Any unauthorized dissemination of expunged conviction information is punishable by fine or imprisonment.\" The expunged records will be restored as public records and can be used in court proceedings if the individual is convicted of a new offense. The amendments made by this Act regarding expungement apply to individuals convicted of an offense before, on, or after the date of enactment."
