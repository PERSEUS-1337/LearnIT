    "title": "AB 1198",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the challenges faced by charter schools in securing suitable facilities and funding, often resorting to private financing and bond transactions due to the lack of local funding support. The California School Finance Authority offers programs to assist schools with facilities financing, but charter schools face high interest rates on revenue bonds. A program insuring or guaranteeing school facility bonds issued by the Authority would lower borrowing costs for charter schools, helping them acquire, renovate, or construct school facilities. This would ensure more funds remain in California's classrooms. The California Credit Enhancement Program is created within the California School Finance Authority to insure facility bonds, reducing borrowing costs for charter schools and ensuring more funds for school facilities. The authority may leverage funding for the California Credit Enhancement Program to exceed the amount of funds on deposit in the California Credit Enhancement Account. Regulations will be adopted for eligibility criteria for participating public schools in the program. The California Credit Enhancement Program includes parameters for credit enhancement, application process, default definition, and options in case of default to prioritize public school use. The California Credit Enhancement Program establishes guidelines for investing in the program, creating the California Credit Enhancement Account within the California School Finance Authority Fund. The authority may deposit funds and fees collected into the account, and hold subaccounts within it. This section does not mandate the authority to deposit or the Legislature to appropriate funds for the program. Bond insurance, credit enhancement, or guarantees under this chapter do not create a debt or liability for the state or its subdivisions, and are payable from the California Credit Enhancement Account. Each bond insurance policy, credit enhancement instrument, or guarantee under the California Credit Enhancement Program clarifies that the State of California is not obligated to pay principal or interest, and neither the state's faith or credit, nor its taxing power, is pledged for payment. The issuance of these guarantees does not obligate the state or its subdivisions to levy taxes or make appropriations for payment."
