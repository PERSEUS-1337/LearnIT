    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Equitable Compensation Act\". Congress finds that the Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River for power production sites, licenses involving tribal land require a reasonable annual charge, the Columbia Basin Commission received a permit for water power development at Grand Coulee, and the Spokane Tribe would have benefited if the site had been developed. In the mid-1930s, the Federal Government federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project, recognizing the impact on the Spokane Tribe and the Colville Reservation. It was deemed appropriate for the tribes to receive a share of revenue from the power produced at the dam. The Act of June 29, 1940 granted the United States the right, title, and interest of the Spokane Tribe and Colville Tribes in the tribal and allotted land within the Spokane and Colville Reservations for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Columbia Basin Project. In 1994, Congress ratified the Colville Settlement Agreement, which required compensation for past land use by the Colville Tribe. The Secretary paid $4,700 to the Spokane Tribe and $63,000 to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for construction activities related to the Columbia Basin Project. The Colville Settlement Agreement in 1994 required a payment of $53,000,000 for past land use by the Colville Tribes and annual payments of $15,250,000 for continued land use. The Spokane Tribe did not file a claim within the statute of limitations, and neither tribe filed claims for compensation before August 13, 1951. In 1976, the Colville Tribes successfully amended their land claims to include the Grand Coulee claim, while the Spokane Tribe settled their land claims with the United States in 1967. The Spokane Tribe suffered harm from the Grand Coulee Dam construction, with their tribal acreage taken equating to 39 percent of the Colville tribal acreage taken for the dam. The payments and delegation made under this Act are considered fair compensation for the past and ongoing use of Spokane tribal land for hydropower production at Grand Coulee Dam, as resolved by the Spokane tribal membership. The Act aims to provide fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe for the use of their land for hydropower generation at the Grand Coulee Dam. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"Colville Settlement Agreement,\" \"Colville Tribes,\" and \"Computed annual payment.\" The Act defines key terms such as \"Computed Annual Payment,\" \"Confederated Tribes Act,\" \"Fund,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Spokane Business Council.\" The curr_chunk defines the Spokane Tribe as the Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation, Washington. The Spokane Tribe of Indians Recovery Trust Fund is defined in the context as part of the Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation, Washington. The \"Spokane Tribe of Indians Recovery Trust Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States with an initial deposit of $53,000,000 on October 1. The Fund will be maintained and invested by the Secretary in accordance with the Act of June 24, 1938. Payments to the Spokane Tribe will be made after the adoption of a plan by the Spokane Business Council. The Spokane Business Council can request disbursement of funds from the Spokane Tribe Recovery Trust Fund by submitting a resolution to the Secretary. The Secretary must disburse the requested amounts to the Spokane Tribe within 60 days. Additionally, the Council must prepare a plan within 18 months outlining how the Tribe will use the funds for economic development. The Spokane Business Council is responsible for promoting economic development, infrastructure development, and various welfare objectives of the Spokane Tribe and its members. They must review and revise a plan before finalizing it, and updates can be made annually. The Spokane Business Council updates the plan annually, with the condition that the Spokane Tribe members can review and comment on it. SEC. 6. PAYMENTS BY ADMINISTRATOR. The Administrator will make payments to the Spokane Tribe, starting with 25 percent of the Computed Annual Payment for fiscal year 2016 on March 1, 2017. Subsequent payments of 25 percent will be made annually until March 1, 2026, after which the payment will increase to 32 percent starting March 1, 2027. Payments made to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe under sections 5 and 6 can be used or invested in the same manner as other tribal governmental amounts. The Secretary and Administrator will not have any trust responsibility for the funds once they are paid. The payments and generated income will be treated similarly to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan Distribution of Judgment Funds Act. After payments are made to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe under sections 5 and 6, the amounts will be considered tribal governmental funds and will be subject to an annual tribal government audit. SEC. 8. REPAYMENT CREDIT. The Administrator shall deduct $2,700,000 from interest payable to the Treasury in fiscal year 2026 and subsequent years when making payments under section 6. The deduction will be credited to interest payments to the Treasury and allocated pro rata to all interest payments on debt associated with the generation function. The Administrator will deduct $2,700,000 from interest payments to the Treasury in fiscal year 2026 and subsequent years. Any excess deduction will be allocated pro rata to all other interest payments due during the fiscal year and applied as a credit against other payments to the Treasury. SEC. 9. EXTINGUISHMENT OF CLAIMS.\n\nUpon depositing amounts in the Fund under section 5, all monetary claims of the Spokane Tribe against the United States for a fair share of annual hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam project will be extinguished.\n\nSEC. 10. ADMINISTRATION.\n\nThis Act does not set a precedent or bind the Southwestern Power Administration, Western Area Power Administration, or Southeastern Power Administration."
