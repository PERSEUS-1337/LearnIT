    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was established in 1930 by President Hoover, consolidating various veterans' programs. In 1988, President Reagan signed legislation to create the Department of Veterans Affairs, replacing the Veterans Administration. The VA operates through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals, with the Veterans Health Administration handling health care, the Veterans Benefits Administration managing compensation and other benefits, and the National Cemetery Administration maintaining national cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains 120 national cemeteries in 39 states and Puerto Rico. The Board of Veterans Appeals makes final decisions on appeals for veteran benefits claims. This report focuses on major issues in veterans' health care during the 109th Congress, distinguishing between veterans and military retirees. A veteran is anyone who has served in the armed forces, while a military retiree has completed a full active duty military career or is disabled in the line of duty. Veterans may not have sufficient service or disability for post-service retired pay and benefits from DOD. VA health care services are available to honorably discharged veterans enrolled in the VA's system. Veterans must enroll in the VA's system to receive care, with priority based on service-connectedness and income. Those enlisting after September 7, 1980, must complete two years of active duty for benefits. Veterans discharged due to service-connected disabilities are exempt from the initial service obligation for VA benefits. Reserve and National Guard members called to active duty can receive care for related conditions for two years initially and for service-connected conditions thereafter. The report provides a history of VHA and eligibility evolution, followed by discussions on major veterans' health care issues. The report discusses major issues in veterans' health care and legislation enacted into law. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest operating unit of the VA, established in 1946 to provide care to veterans injured during wartime. Congress granted access to VA hospitals for wartime veterans without service-connected conditions when there was excess capacity. After World War II, the federal government expanded VA medical facilities to meet the healthcare needs of returning veterans with injuries or illnesses. The focus was on acute care initially, then shifted to long-term rehabilitation for more seriously injured veterans. Specialized services like spinal cord injury care and prosthetics were introduced due to their scarcity in the private medical market. Congress has since broadened the VA's healthcare mission through legislation. The VA's healthcare mission has expanded since World War II, with Congress enacting legislation to establish new programs and services. The VA now provides care to a wider range of veterans, including those not service-connected, serving as a safety net for lower-income veterans. In the 1990s, the VA underwent structural changes to adapt to the evolving healthcare market, establishing regional networks and decentralizing budgetary authority. Advances in medical technology have also influenced the transformation of the VA's healthcare system. The VA shifted focus to outpatient care in response to changing medical practices and legislation in 1996. This allowed for more accessible and efficient healthcare delivery to veterans through 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The VA operates through 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with management offices overseeing hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and counseling centers. Unlike other federal health programs, VA is a direct service provider offering a standardized medical benefits package emphasizing preventive and primary care services. The VA provides a range of healthcare services to enrolled veterans, including immunizations, screening tests, primary care, prescription drugs, mental health services, home health care, hospice, and emergency care. In FY2005, 7.7 million veterans were enrolled, with 4.8 million receiving care. VA treated 768,651 inpatients, 89,961 in nursing homes, and 30,118 in home-based facilities. Outpatient clinics had over 52 million visits. Since 1946, the VA has partnered with medical schools and teaching hospitals to provide training for medical residents and students. VA is affiliated with numerous medical, dental, and other schools, offering education in various health professions. Over half of all practicing physicians in the U.S. have received training in the VA system. In FY2005, over 87,000 health care professionals were trained in VA medical centers, making VA the largest employer of registered nurses in the U.S. The VA is the largest employer of registered nurses in the United States, with 32,582 nurses in FY2005. Veterans' eligibility for health care has evolved over time, expanding to include veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes. VA's health care coverage has transitioned from undefined to standardized benefits. Congress has made significant changes to eligibility criteria for VA health care services since its establishment. Since its establishment, Congress has made significant changes to VA health care services, including providing hospital care, outpatient care, and nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. Over the years, eligibility has expanded to include veterans with nonservice-connected conditions, with outpatient treatment authorized for nonservice-connected conditions in preparation for or to complete hospital care. In 1986, Congress established three categories of eligibility for VA health care under P.L. 99-272. Category A veterans, including those with service-connected disabilities, low-income veterans, and certain exempt veterans, were entitled to hospital care free of charge. P.L. 99-272 established three categories of eligibility for VA health care in 1986, including Category A veterans entitled to hospital care. Category A veterans may receive outpatient and nursing home care, with eligibility determined by income and net worth. Categories B and C veterans are eligible for care but not entitled to it, with different meanings for eligibility and entitlement compared to other public health care programs like Medicare. Under the VA health care system, eligibility for care did not guarantee availability due to fixed annual appropriations. Being entitled to care gave veterans a higher priority, but once funds were expended, care could no longer be provided. Congress occasionally expanded access to VA health care, but criteria for eligibility were a source of frustration for veterans and the VA. Some veterans, VA physicians, and administrative staff were frustrated by eligibility criteria expansions for outpatient care. Most veterans needed to obviate the need for hospitalization to qualify, except for those with a 50% or more service-connected disability and special status nonservice-connected veterans. Interpretations of the obviate the need criterion varied among VA medical centers. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 addressed limitations in VA healthcare by establishing priority categories and a patient enrollment system to manage access to care. This Act aimed to clarify eligibility for services and ensure that VA health care providers could treat the entire patient, not just service-connected conditions. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established priority categories and a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. It aimed to expand services for veterans, eliminate barriers to care, and lower expenses. VHA began enrolling veterans in October 1998, with detailed priority enrollment groups provided. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated 50%-100% are correlated to Priority Group 1, while those rated 0%-40% may be in Priority Group 2 or 3 based on disability rating. Prior eligibility criteria do not directly align with current enrollment priority groups, but Category A was linked to Priority Groups 1-6, Category C to Groups 7-8, and Category B (not shown) to Priority Group 4 for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. After the passage of the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, the VA has seen a significant increase in demand for medical care. The number of veteran enrollees grew by 79.5% from FY1999 to FY2005, with unique veteran patients increasing by 49.2%. This growth has sparked debate in Congress about which categories of veterans should have priority for care. Some in Congress are concerned about the growing costs and eligibility for VA medical care, suggesting it should be narrowed to prioritize veterans with service-connected medical problems. The 1996 reform act expanded veterans' access to outpatient care and limited enrollment based on funding availability. Issues discussed are linked to these concerns, with debates on which veterans should have priority for care. The return of war veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq has strained VHA personnel and budgets. Congress will focus on ensuring a smooth transition for veterans into the VA health care system, improving mental health services, funding veterans' health care, and enhancing the efficiency of VA operations. In recent years, Congress has shown interest in using VA as a model for health care delivery systems. Concerns exist about the smooth transition of OIF and OEF veterans from DOD to VA health care, especially for Reserve and National Guard members. Testimonies have highlighted the lack of integrated medical information systems between DOD and VA hospitals. Health testified that Reservists and National Guard personnel often do not receive timely information about their earned benefits and access to healthcare. The President's Taskforce emphasizes the importance of a seamless transition from military to veteran status, including sharing electronic health information between VA and DOD. GAO reports in 2005 highlighted the lack of systematic access to DOD data for returning servicemembers needing VA services, and limited health information sharing between DOD and VA for OEF and OIF servicemembers and veterans. Approximately 1.4 million troops have served in Afghanistan and Iraq since the conflicts began. Approximately 1.4 million troops have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. As of May 31, 2006, 588,923 OEF and OIF veterans had separated from active duty. Of these, 45% were active duty troops and 56% were separated National Guard members. Around 31% of these veterans have sought care from the VA, with 97% receiving outpatient care and 3% being hospitalized. Reservists and National Guard members make up the majority seeking VA health care. Servicemembers injured in OEF and OIF conflict theaters are first stabilized at in-theater medical facilities before being evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further treatment. After about four to five days in Germany, they are then evacuated to the United States for care at facilities like Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC. After initial stabilization in in-theater medical facilities, injured servicemembers from OEF and OIF conflict theaters are evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. From there, they are flown to specialized centers like Brooke Army Medical Center in Fort Sam Houston, Texas for catastrophic burn patients and amputee rehabilitation. DOD may send servicemembers with traumatic brain injuries and complex polytrauma cases to VA Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers in Tampa, Minneapolis, Palo Alto, and Richmond. These Level 1 polytrauma centers offer specialized care and expertise. The VA has Level 1 polytrauma centers with expertise in treating complex injuries like TBI, amputations, burns, and fractures. VA/DOD liaisons facilitate patient transfers from military to VA hospitals. Video teleconferencing aids in family meetings with the interdisciplinary team. Liaisons also work closely with case managers at VA hospitals. The VA/DOD liaisons collaborate closely with case managers at VA hospitals and assist patients and families in applying for VA benefits. Liaison personnel are assigned to VA's four PRCs to help servicemembers with issues like pay, lodging, and travel. VA has set up a polytrauma system of care to provide services throughout the continuum of care for severely injured servicemembers. VA conducts briefings for servicemembers and families on benefits and services, and sends information brochures and \"thank-you\" letters. In April 2004, VA signed an MOU with DOD to provide health care and rehabilitation services to servicemembers with specific injuries. The MOU established referral procedures for transferring active duty inpatient servicemembers from MTFs to VA medical facilities. VA also sends letters and educational materials to veterans, National Guard Adjutants General, and Reserve Chiefs to provide information on health care and VA benefits. The Office of Seamless Transition ensures continuity of care for DOD patients transitioning to VA care, prioritizing access to treatment. The Vet Center program, established in 1979 for Vietnam veterans, now consists of 207 community-based centers nationwide. The Vet Center program, established in 1979 for Vietnam veterans, now consists of 209 centers nationwide, including new ones in Atlanta, Georgia, and Phoenix, Arizona. All combat veterans are eligible for readjustment counseling services, bereavement counseling is provided to family members of servicemembers killed on active duty, and counseling is available for veterans who have experienced sexual trauma. Outreach workers are hired from recently separated OIF and OEF veterans to facilitate a seamless transition and early provision of VA services to returning veterans and their families. The Army introduced the U.S. Army Wounded Warrior program to advocate for severely disabled soldiers and their families. New veteran hires provide briefing services on VA services and benefits to transitioning servicemen and women. The VA and DOD face challenges in exchanging medical information for injured or ill servicemembers with a disability rating of 30% or higher. Despite efforts since the late 1990s to create interoperable medical records, formal agreements are hindered by differing interpretations of HIPAA privacy provisions. VA believes DOD can share health data due to serving similar populations, but formal agreements are still pending. The DOD and VA face challenges in sharing medical information for injured servicemembers with a disability rating of 30% or higher. DOD is hesitant to share data with VA until servicemembers separate from active duty, citing concerns about conflicting with military retention goals. GAO report highlighted the lack of real-time access to injured servicemembers' data by PRCs. The report from June 2006 highlighted the lack of real-time access to injured servicemembers' medical records by PRCs. The VA and DOD are working on the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange project to share health information between the two departments in real time. This project allows data transfer between VA's CPRS and DOD's CHCS for the benefit of both VA and DOD healthcare providers. Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan can enroll in the VA healthcare system for two years after separation from active duty. The VA health care system allows veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan to enroll for two years after separation from active duty. Legislative proposals have been made to extend this period to five years, but the Administration has opposed this idea. Some believe the current two-year eligibility period is sufficient, while others are concerned about restricting access. The VA health care system allows veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan to enroll for two years after separation from active duty. Concerns have been raised about restricting enrollment eligibility for only a two-year period, especially for conditions like PTSD that may not manifest until years later. The Administration's response is that veterans with service-connected PTSD can still enroll in Priority Group 1, 2, or 3 for needed care. Congress is concerned about VA's capacity to treat mental health issues for new veterans from ongoing conflicts. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can occur after experiencing life-threatening events. Symptoms include nightmares, flashbacks, difficulty sleeping, and feeling detached. Early identification and treatment can improve quality of life. Only 3% of soldiers report serious mental health issues post-deployment. The Army found that up to 17% of returning veterans from Iraq War had depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Studies suggest that prolonged warfare in Iraq could increase PTSD rates. 29,041 OEF and OIF veterans seeking care from VA have probable PTSD symptoms. Stigma in disclosing PTSD symptoms to DOD clinicians hinders early intervention for servicemembers. Congress has emphasized the importance of PTSD services for veterans for over two decades. In 1984, the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was established to assess VA's capacity for PTSD treatment. The committee's 2004 report highlighted the high risk of PTSD among combat veterans of OEF and OIF, with 37 recommendations for VA to improve services. Combat veterans of OEF and OIF are at high risk for PTSD and related problems, with a suicide rate higher than previous wars. The Special Committee highlighted the need for VA to meet the needs of new combat veterans while still providing for veterans of past wars. However, VA lacks sufficient capacity to do so, as reported by GAO in 2004 and 2005. In 2005, GAO reviewed 24 of the Special Committee's recommendations for VA's PTSD care and found that VA has not fully met any of them. VA has undertaken various efforts to improve PTSD care for veterans, including developing an Iraqi War guide for clinicians, implementing a national clinical reminder for assessing OEF and OIF veterans, and establishing specialized PTSD programs in all states. In 2004, VA implemented the \"Afghan and Iraq Post-Deployment Screen\" for OEF/OIF veterans, which includes screening for alcohol use, PTSD, and depression. VA also enhanced its Vet Center program with interdisciplinary teams to address psychological and social readjustment for veterans with TBI or PTSD. Additionally, a Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) was established in North Carolina. A Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) was established in North Carolina to focus on post-deployment health for OIF and OEF veterans. The center collaborates with the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (NCPTSD) and other MIRECCs across the country. Another MIRECC in Denver, Colorado, focuses on suicide prevention for OIF and OEF veterans. VA and DOD are studying psychotherapy for PTSD treatment in female veterans and active duty personnel. Results from a clinical trial are expected in 2007 to inform future research and implementation activities. The Inspector General (IG) reported on insufficient documentation in files of veterans with PTSD disability ratings, noting a rise in claims since 1999. About 25% of reviewed PTSD awards lacked evidence of a traumatic event. VA's review found premature decisions on PTSD claims, with older cases protected from rating changes by statute. After criticism, VA decided not to review 72,000 claims of veterans rated 100% disabled due to PTSD. Instead, they requested the Institute of Medicine to review PTSD diagnosis, assessment, and treatments. The IOM was also asked to examine issues surrounding VA's compensation program for veterans with PTSD. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) prepared three reports on PTSD for veterans. The first report focused on diagnosis and assessment, recommending face-to-face clinical interviews for accurate diagnosis. A second report on treatment is expected in December 2006, along with a compensation study report by the Committee on Veterans' Compensation for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Veterans' advocates express concerns about the uncertainty in funding for PTSD programs. The yearly discretionary appropriations process poses a management problem for the VA due to unpredictable timing and uncertain funding amounts. National veterans' organizations are advocating for \"assured funding\" or \"mandatory funding\" for veterans' health care. Presently, VA programs are funded through both mandatory and discretionary spending authorities, with cash benefit programs, readjustment benefits, home loan guarantees, and veterans' insurance among the mandatory spending programs. The VA programs, including cash benefits, readjustment benefits, home loan guarantees, and veterans' insurance, are funded through annual appropriations as entitlement programs. Congress must provide the necessary funding, and if it falls short, supplemental appropriations are required. Spending adjusts based on the number of eligible recipients, with some benefits indexed for inflation. VA health care programs are a significant part of these entitlement programs. The VA health care programs, including medical facility construction, research, and administration, are funded through annual discretionary appropriations. Mandatory funding proposals aim to provide stable funding based on the number of eligible veterans and medical care inflation rates, reducing uncertainty and meeting the demand for veterans' health care. Critics argue that proposed mandatory funding increases for VHA based on enrollment figures may not account for changing veterans' needs, unlike the current discretionary budget process. Chairman Buyer expressed concerns about the high cost of mandatory funding, citing the flexibility of discretionary budgets in responding to changes in veterans' medical care. Changing veterans' medical care to mandatory budget authority may not solve funding gap issues as Congress could limit spending through reconciliation language. The Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, 2005 proposed mandatory appropriations based on a formula tied to previous years' obligations. The Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, 2005 proposed mandatory appropriations for VA health care programs. CBO estimates a net increase in direct spending of $179 billion over 2007-2010 and $518 billion over 2007-2015. Advocates seek to lift the suspension of Priority Group 8 veterans from enrolling in VA's health care system. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 included language stipulating that medical care for veterans would be provided based on annual appropriations by Congress. In 2003, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs temporarily suspended enrolling Priority Group 8 veterans due to funding constraints and increased demand for care. Approximately 273,000 veterans would have been eligible if the enrollment freeze was lifted. In FY2006, 273,000 veterans in Priority Group 8 were eligible for VA medical care, decreasing to 242,000 in FY2007. The number of enrolled Priority Group 8 veterans is expected to decline from 1.27 million in FY2005 to 1.22 million in FY2006 due to projected death rates and the enrollment freeze. Resuming enrollment for Priority Group 8 veterans would require additional funding of $519 million in FY2005 and $2.3 billion in FY2012. Congress is interested in improving access to care for these veterans. Many veterans' advocates suggest that VA should receive Medicare payments for nonservice-connected disability care provided to veterans covered by Medicare. However, opposition to these proposals exists due to concerns about the impact on the Medicare trust fund and federal health care costs. GAO recommends allowing VA to bill and retain Medicare recoveries. GAO recommended that VA be allowed to bill and retain Medicare recoveries, creating incentives for VA facilities to prioritize care for veterans with Medicare coverage. Previous proposals in Congress, known as Medicare Subvention, aimed to authorize VA recoveries from Medicare for all Medicare-eligible veterans or those with higher incomes. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized a Medicare subvention pilot program in DOD's MTFs, allowing for the transfer of funds from Medicare to VA for Medicare-covered services provided to veterans. In a demonstration, Medicare payments were structured on a capitation basis for DOD to sustain spending on Medicare beneficiaries. Enrolled retirees received Medicare-covered benefits and TRICARE benefits through TRICARE Senior Prime. Eligibility criteria included residing in specific geographic areas, being enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, and being eligible for military health care benefits. The program was not cost-effective for DOD despite positive results for enrollees. The three-year pilot program for Medicare subvention was not cost-effective for DOD and expired in 2001. VA planned to offer Medicare-eligible Priority 8 veterans the option of receiving their Medicare benefits through VA facilities under the VA Advantage proposal in 2004. VA would have contracted with a Medicare Advantage organization to define the benefit package, with enrollees receiving most of their healthcare benefits through VA. Under the VA Advantage plan, out-of-plan-area emergency and urgent care services would have been provided through arrangements with providers and facilities contracted with VA. Medicare would have covered the full cost of care for veterans enrolled in the program. Implementation of the program was delayed due to the need for legislation authorization. Only Medicare-eligible Priority 8 veterans unable to enroll in VA health care would have been eligible for VA Advantage, not their spouses or other dependents. The VA Advantage plan was delayed due to the need for legislation authorization. Veterans enrolled in VA care receive prescription medications at a nominal charge. Copayments are waived for service-connected conditions, severe disability, indigent veterans, or former POWs. Medications are only dispensed to veterans enrolled in VA care and prescribed by a VA physician. The VA provides medications to veterans enrolled in VA care, prescribed by a VA physician, with exceptions for certain disability compensation recipients and permanently disabled veterans. The VA implemented the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) program in September 2003 to provide access to VA prescription drugs for veterans experiencing long waits for their initial primary care appointment. This program allowed VA pharmacies to fill prescriptions written by non-VA physicians until a VA physician could examine the veteran and determine treatment. Veterans had to be enrolled in the VA health care system before July 25, 2003, to be eligible for the program. The VA implemented the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) program in September 2003 to provide access to VA prescription drugs for veterans experiencing long waits for their initial primary care appointment. Veterans had to be enrolled in the VA health care system before July 25, 2003, and waiting more than 30 days for their initial primary care appointment as of September 22, 2003, to qualify for the program. Despite VA's anticipation of 200,000 eligible veterans, only about 41,000 were eligible, with 8,300 participating. Low participation was attributed to many veterans already receiving VA services. The TPB program increased administrative prescription processing costs due to contacting private physicians for formulary alternatives. VA has since discontinued the program. The VA implemented the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) program in September 2003 to provide access to VA prescription drugs for veterans experiencing long waits for their initial primary care appointment. Despite low participation, the program increased administrative costs. VA has since discontinued the program. In response, the 108th Congress showed interest in providing a prescription-only health care benefit for veterans, but none of the bills introduced were enacted into law. In FY2004 and FY2005, bill language was included authorizing the dispensing of prescription drugs from VHA pharmacies to enrolled veterans with privately written prescriptions. Several bills were introduced during the first session of the 109th Congress to require VA pharmacies to dispense medications on prescriptions written by private medical practitioners. At a hearing on S. 614 by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in June 2005, concerns were raised about opening up the VA pharmacy system. The Administration and Veterans Service Organizations expressed worries about increased costs, confusion, and decreased patient safety. VA's medical infrastructure is mainly focused on inpatient care, but it has been shifting towards a more outpatient-based system in recent years. VA has been transitioning to outpatient care through Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), with over 80% of treatment now provided on an outpatient basis. The CARES program was established in 2000 to evaluate veterans' healthcare needs and realign VA's infrastructure. A Draft National CARES Plan recommended closing seven VA facilities and eliminating duplicative services at over 30 others. The Draft National CARES Plan recommended closing seven VA facilities in various locations and suggested new major medical facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada and East Central Florida. It also proposed infrastructure upgrades at existing sites and the establishment of 48 new high-priority CBOCs. A 16-member independent commission was appointed to study the draft plan. The CARES Commission, composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds, applied six factors in reviewing proposals for the Draft National CARES Plan. They conducted public hearings and site visits in 2003, submitting recommendations to the Secretary in February 2004. The final CARES plan, announced in May 2004, included consolidating several facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Gulfport. The final CARES plan announced in May 2004 includes consolidating facilities in Ohio, Mississippi, Iowa, New York, Georgia, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, and Texas. It also involves building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas, adding new CBOCs, spinal cord injury centers, blind rehabilitation centers, and expanding mental health outpatient services nationwide to increase veteran enrollment percentages. The CARES plan announced in 2004 includes consolidating facilities in several states and building new hospitals in Orlando and Las Vegas. The plan aims to reduce costs and redirect funds to patient care, but critics are concerned about the lack of assessment for future long-term and mental health care needs. VA plans to improve forecasting models to address these concerns. Some critics believe the CARES plan does not adequately address future nursing home needs, leading to potential privatization of VA health care. Veterans' groups doubt the plan will result in new facilities and express concerns about the closure of VA medical facilities. Legislation now requires a waiting period before any closures under the final CARES plan. Section 221 of the Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 requires VA to wait before carrying out major construction projects as specified in the final CARES report. The law also mandates notifying Congress of any actions that may lead to facility closure, consolidation, or reorganization. Implementation issues identified in the CARES Decision necessitated further study, including stakeholder input at selected sites. An Advisory Committee for CARES Business Plan Studies was established on September 29, 2004. The Advisory Committee for CARES Business Plan Studies, consisting of representatives from various organizations, will consult with stakeholders during the implementation of the Secretary's CARES Decision. They ensure stakeholder interests are considered in developing site-level business plans. VA awarded a contract to PriceWaterhouseCoopers for studies at 18 sites, with Local Advisory Panels gathering stakeholder views and making recommendations to the Secretary. The VA awarded a contract to PriceWaterhouseCoopers for studies at 18 sites, with Local Advisory Panels gathering stakeholder views and making recommendations to the Secretary. VA plans to announce the Secretary's decision for each site in 2006. The VA health care system has improved its quality of care through initiatives like the National Surgical Quality Improvement program. Recent studies have shown significant improvement in the quality of care provided by VA surgeons, surpassing the quality of care before reengineering. Patients in the VA health care system receive better chronic and preventive care compared to the general population, with better performance in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Attributes of VA's health care system could potentially enhance the quality of care in the broader health care system. The VA's Barcode Medication Administration System, implemented since 2000, allows doctors and nurses to verify patient medication details using barcoded wristbands and medications. This system aims to reduce medication errors and has outpaced private hospitals in implementation. The VA is leading in health care IT systems, mobile and wireless device usage, and Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) technology. The VistA system is in over 1,300 VA facilities, maintaining records for 5 million veterans. Collaboration with CMS aims to adapt VistA for private physician offices as \"The VistA-Office EHR\" by July 2005. VA has been a patient safety leader since the late 1990s, establishing the National Center for Patient Safety in 1999. The VA established the National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) to develop a culture of safety and implemented the Patient Safety Information System (PSIS) for reporting adverse events. Other countries have adopted strategies from VA's patient safety program, and the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organization's (JCAHO) goals have been influenced by VA's advances. The VA also collaborated with NASA to develop the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) in 2002. The VA collaborated with NASA to establish the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) in 2002, allowing VA employees to confidentially report close calls or adverse events. VA has been successful in obtaining prescription drugs at competitive prices through various purchasing arrangements, including the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). Manufacturers must offer their drugs on the FSS to obtain reimbursement for drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. The VA purchases brand-name drugs at prices lower than those listed on the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) through various purchasing arrangements, including national contracts and competitive bidding. In collaboration with the Department of Defense (DOD), they negotiate contracts together to consolidate buying power and achieve cost savings. Several measures have been introduced in Congress to allow for more flexibility in drug purchasing. Several bills were introduced in Congress to allow the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of Medicare Part D pharmaceuticals similar to the VA. Concerns have been raised that extending VA prices to Medicare recipients could result in increased prices for the VA. The beneficiary travel program reimburses veterans for travel expenses to VA medical facilities. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored VA travel reimbursement benefits, requiring VA to provide beneficiary travel reimbursement for health care services to all specified beneficiaries. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored VA travel reimbursement benefits for health care services. The law imposed a $3 one-way deductible for most travel, with exceptions for special modes of transportation. Veterans are reimbursed at $0.11 cents per mile and subject to a $3 deductible per visit, capped at $18 per calendar month for frequent travelers. Veterans are reimbursed at $0.11 per mile with a $3 deductible per visit, capped at $18 per month. Special modes of transportation are fully reimbursed. Bills introduced to change mileage reimbursement and eliminate deductible have not been enacted due to funding issues. The reason bills to change mileage reimbursement for veterans have not been enacted is due to funding issues. Funds for transportation are currently taken from appropriations for medical services, leading to a debate on the appropriate use of funds for veteran healthcare. Legislation P.L. 109-233 incorporated various provisions from bills introduced in the 109th Congress, including limitations on premium increases for health insurance and expanding diseases presumed to be associated with prisoner of war status. Legislation P.L. 109-233 limits health insurance premium increases for servicemembers upon release from active duty, ensuring that the amount charged for coverage reinstatement does not exceed the pre-termination amount. This provision addresses the issue of protecting servicemembers against premium increases when they reinstate their health insurance as civilians. Prior to the enactment of legislation P.L. 109-233, section 1112 (b) of Title 38, U.S.C., listed diseases presumed related to POW experience. The first list included mental and physical trauma-related diseases with no minimum internment period, such as psychosis, anxiety states, and frostbite residuals. The second list required a 30-day internment and included diseases like avitaminosis, malnutrition, and cirrhosis of the liver. The VA added atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertensive vascular disease, stroke, and their complications to the list of diseases presumed related to the POW experience. This legislation was codified by P.L. 109-233, requiring a minimum 30-day internment period. The House passed health care-related legislation during the 109th Congress, not yet approved by the Senate. The bill did not include appropriations for veterans' health care programs but had two provisions related to veterans' health care. One provision allowed VA to bill insurance companies for treatment of nonservice-connected conditions, while another provision prohibited billing for conditions resulting from military service. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee identified weaknesses in VA's billing and collections processes for Medicare and Medicaid payments. H.R. 1220 aimed to improve billing practices by hiring a contractor to evaluate and implement changes at two VHA facilities. Additionally, VA established six Parkinson's Disease Research Education and Clinical Centers for research purposes. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee identified weaknesses in VA's billing and collections processes for Medicare and Medicaid payments. H.R. 1220 aimed to improve billing practices by hiring a contractor to evaluate and implement changes at two VHA facilities.
