The Federal Government has provided billions of dollars for catastrophe-related losses, impacting American taxpayers. The Federal Government recognizes the economic impact of natural disasters like hurricanes in 2005, leading to potential insurance shortages and significant costs for American taxpayers. It is crucial for the government to ensure responsible risk management of catastrophes to maintain property insurance availability and protect public health and safety. The private sector's inability to provide sufficient insurance coverage poses a threat to the national economy and welfare. Multiple proposals have been introduced to address these challenges.

The most efficient approach to assessing the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy context is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to study the management of catastrophic disaster risk.
