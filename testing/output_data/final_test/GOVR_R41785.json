The distinction between cyclical and structural unemployment has implications for economic growth and public policy. During the 2007-2009 recession, economists debated the increase in unemployment, questioning the balance between reduced demand for goods and services and worker reallocation across industries. Many workers who lost their jobs during the recession are expected to return to their former industries as demand for their goods and services grows during the recovery phase. Fiscal and monetary policies have been used to stimulate job growth for the cyclically unemployed. Recent Congresses enacted measures to promote job creation, while the Federal Reserve implemented strategies to mitigate the financial crisis and stimulate economic activity. If the increase in unemployment is due to slow output growth post-recession, fiscal and monetary stimulus could help lower the unemployment rate from its elevated average of 8.1% in 2012. During the 2007-2009 recession, economists debated the increase in unemployment, questioning the balance between reduced demand for goods and services and worker reallocation across industries. Many workers who lost their jobs are expected to return to their former industries as demand grows during the recovery phase. To overcome skill mismatch, displaced workers may require retraining or additional education. Congress included training provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help structurally unemployed workers return to economically productive activities. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act included training provisions to help structurally unemployed workers return to work. Some workers may drop out of the labor force, reducing the supply of labor and impacting the economy in the long run. Policymakers need to distinguish between cyclical and structural unemployment to address the different implications. Frictional and structural unemployment are two types of unemployment that involve the worker-to-job matching process. Frictional unemployment is often voluntary and of shorter duration, while structural unemployment arises from obstacles that lengthen unemployment spells, such as mismatches in skills or locations. Cyclical unemployment occurs when there is a decrease in demand for goods and services, leading to temporary layoffs and reduced work hours. Employers may hesitate to hire immediately even as demand picks up, preferring to increase existing employees' hours first. Eventually, experienced workers may be recalled once firms are confident in economic growth. Under certain conditions, cyclical unemployment can transition into structural unemployment if the economy grows slowly after a recession, leading to a prolonged high unemployment rate. Skills of long-term unemployed workers may deteriorate, no longer matching job requirements as economic growth strengthens. Policy analysts estimate the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) to gauge frictional, structural, and cyclical unemployment levels. The nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is used as a proxy for the structural unemployment rate, reflecting long-term slack in the labor market. A majority of the increase in unemployment during the 2007-2009 recession appears to be cyclical based on changes in labor market indicators. Several empirical studies support the finding that the increase in structural unemployment during the 2007-2009 recession was not the main factor contributing to the rise in the U.S. unemployment rate. This suggests that the nation is not facing a long-term \"new normal\" of high unemployment rates. The mismatch argument for sustained unemployment rate increases is based on imbalances in labor supply and demand across different sectors and skill groups. Analysis of employment growth and unemployment rates across industries, states, and occupations from 2007 to 2010 shows that the 7.8 million jobs lost during this period were spread across various industries. The number of jobs on employers' payrolls plummeted in 18 of the 24 industries during the recession, with manufacturing and construction being the hardest hit. By March 2010, employment gains and losses across sectors returned to pre-recession levels, indicating little imbalance in employment growth. Data supports the idea that the recession led to a collapse in aggregate demand rather than a shift in demand towards sectors lacking qualified workers. As of fall 2010, there was no evidence of labor shortages, rising wages, or increasing prices in expanding sectors despite high unemployment elsewhere in the economy. DeLong noted that prolonged unemployment could lead to structural unemployment becoming a bigger factor. The rise in unemployment rates across all states suggests a decrease in labor demand nationwide, contradicting the idea of a mismatch between job locations and worker availability. Only Alaska, North Dakota, and the District of Columbia saw net employment gains between 2007 and 2010. Between 2007 and 2010, only Alaska, North Dakota, and the District of Columbia saw net employment gains, totaling 17,100 jobs. Speculation that the housing market affected unemployed homeowners' migration rates is not supported by empirical analyses. The decrease in geographic mobility since 2007 was not primarily due to the housing market contraction or the 2007-2009 recession. Changes in Census Bureau procedures, not \"house lock,\" led to a significant drop in interstate migration rates starting in 2006. Population Survey (CPS). Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl analyzed migration rates from various sources to show that interstate migration has not significantly decreased recently. Aaronson and Davis found that state-to-state migration rates during the 2007-2009 recession were similar for homeowners and renters, with little support for the house lock argument. Schmitt and Warner explored how housing market conditions by state impacted migration. Valletta examined the impact of housing market conditions on the geographic mobility of job losers during the 2007-2009 period. Displaced workers in states with the largest decreases in housing prices had similar likelihood of not moving as those in states with the best housing markets. There was no evidence supporting the house-lock argument, as homeowners and renters had similar unemployment durations. Karahan and Rhee analyzed the impact of house lock on worker mobility during the Great Recession. They found that reduced geographic mobility among homeowners did not contribute to high unemployment. Instead, they concluded that house lock exacerbated the increase in unemployment by reducing worker migration rates. Without the housing bust, workers would have been more likely to move from areas with higher to lower unemployment rates. The decline in migration understated the impact of the sharp drop in house prices on worker mobility. The housing bust during the 2007-2009 recession led to a decrease in worker mobility and an increase in unemployment. Underemployment, where workers are employed part-time but prefer full-time work due to economic conditions, also became prevalent. This situation reflects a demand for skilled workers, as firms adjusted labor quantity by reducing workforce size and cutting hours for qualified employees. The demand for qualified employees fell across various industries, leading to an increase in underemployment. The total number of underemployed workers more than doubled to 8.9 million in 2010. Underemployment rose significantly in industries such as retail trade, social assistance, food services, health care, accommodation, arts, entertainment, education, and state government. The number of persons working fewer than 35 hours a week doubled in the construction and financial activities industries, as well as in all other industries, since the 2007-2009 recession. Since the 2007-2009 recession, underemployment has increased across various industries, with a significant impact on the labor market. The hiring rate decreased in most industries between 2007 and 2010, indicating the influence of cyclical forces. Rates returned to pre-recession levels only in construction and the federal government, with offshore outsourcing affecting the skill mix of available jobs for U.S. workers. The slow recovery of the labor market post-recession has been attributed to changes in the skill mix of available jobs for U.S. workers. Despite offshoring concerns, industries with occupations less vulnerable to offshoring experienced the largest declines in hiring rates between 2007 and 2010. Occupations like cooks, food preparation workers, and waiters in the accommodations and food services industry saw a significant drop in hiring rates. Similarly, amusement attendants, fitness trainers, and landscaping workers in the arts and recreation industry were also heavily impacted. The arts, entertainment, and recreation industry saw a decrease in hiring rates, with workers in real estate and rental industries and retail trade industry also affected. Jobs in finance and insurance industries were less vulnerable to offshoring, with tellers comprising a large share of employment. Hiring activity dropped in all geographic areas between 2007 and 2010. Hiring rates decreased in all four geographic areas between 2007 and 2010. The West and South experienced the largest declines, with the Midwest and Northeast also seeing decreases. The number of unemployed workers per job opening increased during the 2007-2009 recession, peaking at 6.7 in July 2009. As of late 2010, there were still about five unemployed workers for every job vacancy. The job vacancy ratio fell slowly as the number of unemployed workers per job opening increased. The rise in industry-level mismatch only accounted for a small portion of the increase in unemployment rate. The rise in U.S. unemployment peaked at 10.0% in October 2009, with a mismatch between job vacancies and unemployed workers across industries. The construction industry had a higher ratio of unemployed workers to job openings, suggesting structural unemployment. The recession was partly due to the housing bubble burst, leading to a decrease in demand across industries. The increase in U.S. unemployment during the recession was mainly due to a reduction in economy-wide demand rather than shifts in demand across industries. The impact of job losses in the construction industry was limited as it accounted for only 2.4% of total nonfarm employment before the housing bubble burst. Structural impediments in efficiently matching workers with jobs may have contributed more to the rise in unemployment rate during the recession. The recent increase in structural unemployment in the United States is unlikely to persist as in some European countries in the 1980s and 1990s. This is partly due to the temporary nature of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program enacted in 2008 and extended through 2013. The concentration of the rise in unemployment among permanent job losers is a worrisome sign of structural labor market problems. The rise in unemployment is concentrated among permanent job losers, leading to a significant increase in long-term unemployment. This shift in the composition of unemployed workers has resulted in a higher unemployment rate, with job losses severing the employee-employer relationship and forcing individuals to search for new positions. The rise in unemployment is concentrated among permanent job losers, leading to a significant increase in long-term unemployment. More than six million workers were unemployed for longer than 27 weeks in 2010, comprising over 40% of all unemployed workers. The long-term unemployment rate was 4.2% in 2010, the highest during the postwar period. The probability of reemployment decreases the longer workers remain unemployed. The long-term unemployed face challenges in finding jobs, with recession having the largest impact on job-finding probability. Reasons for difficulty include potential skill atrophy, stigma from unemployment, and decreased motivation to search for jobs. Lazear and Spletzer attribute the elevated unemployment rate to cyclical factors in the 11th postwar recession. The high prevalence of long-term unemployment in the Great Recession is not due to structural changes but the depth of the recession. There is a concerning anomaly in the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment rates post-recession, indicating potential structural issues in the labor market. The relationship between job vacancies and unemployment rates post-recession has shown an anomaly, with both rates increasing during the recovery period. Economists found that the higher than predicted unemployment rate was mainly due to the low rate of hiring to fill vacancies, especially in the construction industry. This anomaly is not attributed to structural changes but rather the depth of the recession. During the recovery period, the increase in unemployment rates was mainly due to the low rate of hiring in the construction industry. Several economists estimated a slight increase in structural unemployment, contributing to the rise in unemployment rates from 4.6% in 2007 to 9.6% in 2010. Studies varied in their analysis period and results, with most showing a minority contribution of structural unemployment to the overall increase. Seven studies estimated that structural unemployment explained between 20% and 35% of the 5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate between 2007 and 2010. Researchers disagreed on whether the rise was due to skill or geographic mismatch, with different measures yielding varying results. Batini, Celasun, Dowling et al. found that skill mismatch raised structural unemployment by 1.0-1.75 percentage points, while Estevao and Tsounta attributed more of the increase to unfavorable conditions in the housing market. Estevao and Tsounta estimated that structural unemployment increased by 1.75 percentage points due to skill mismatch and 0.25 percentage points due to the interaction of skill match with foreclosures. Sahin et al. found that geographic mismatch did not contribute to the rise in unemployment, while mismatch across occupations explained 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points of the increase. Herz and van Rens gave more weight to geographic than skills mismatch, with 0.1 percentage point attributed to mismatch across states compared to 0.03 percentage point for skill mismatch. Unemployment benefit extensions and skill mismatch each accounted for a portion of the increase in structural unemployment from 2007 to 2010. Daly, Hobijn, and Valletta estimated that the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program contributed 0.8 percentage points to the rise, while Valletta and Kuang initially estimated a 0.4 percentage point increase due to unemployment benefit extensions. Differences in estimates may be attributed to variations in how the explanatory variables were operationalized. The increase in structural unemployment due to unemployment benefit extensions was initially estimated at 0.4 percentage points, but further data analysis revealed a larger impact of 0.8 percentage points. Analysts have speculated on the persistence of this increase, comparing it to European countries with prolonged periods of elevated structural unemployment. The analysis by Batini, Celasun, Dowling et al. suggests a 1.0-1.75 percentage point increase in structural unemployment due to mismatch in the U.S. economy. Daly, Hobijn, and Valletta predict that little of the 1.25 percentage point increase in structural unemployment will persist as labor market conditions improve. Guichard and Rusticelli found substantial differences in vulnerability to structural unemployment increases among OECD nations due to changes in unemployment benefit programs and product market regulations. Guichard and Rusticelli estimated that the United States was less vulnerable than 20 OECD nations to an increase in structural unemployment during the 2007-2012 period, despite the impact of the financial crisis."
