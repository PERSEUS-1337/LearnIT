    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposal requested $34.189 billion, which is $4.261 billion lower than the FY2017 appropriation. The largest increase was for DOE nuclear weapons activities. The FY2018 budget request proposed significant reductions in funding for DOE energy research and development programs, including cuts in energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil fuels, nuclear, and science programs. Programs like ARPA-E, loan guarantee programs, and the ARC were targeted for elimination or phaseout. Funding cuts were also proposed for the Army Corps, Bureau of Reclamation, and CUP. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 largely rejected the Administration's proposed budget cuts for FY2018, increasing funding for energy and water development programs by $4.768 billion. Major funding increases were allocated to energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy R&D, science programs, ARPA-E, and atomic energy defense activities. The FY2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill saw major funding increases for energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy R&D, science programs, ARPA-E, and atomic energy defense activities. The House Appropriations Committee approved the bill with a total funding of $37.641 billion, which was $809 million below FY2017 levels but $3.45 billion above the Administration's request. The bill was later combined with other appropriations bills into the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, and passed by the House on July 27, 2017. The House passed H.R. 3219 on July 27, 2017, which was included in the FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 3354) without further amendment. The omnibus bill includes funding increases for DOE weapons activities, funding for Yucca Mountain, and decreases in energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (S. 1609) on July 20, 2017, with total funding of $39.27 billion. The House passed H.R. 3219 on July 27, 2017, included in the FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 3354) without further amendment. The omnibus bill includes funding increases for DOE weapons activities, Yucca Mountain funding, and decreases in energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (S. 1609) on July 20, 2017, with total funding of $39.27 billion. The committee recommended funding increases to DOE's weapons activities, nuclear waste storage at private facilities, a decrease in funding for EERE R&D, and elimination of the Title 17 Loan Guarantee program. The committee recommended against the elimination of ARPA-E, approving an increase from the FY2017 enacted level. Total funding for Division D was $38.89 billion, offset by $436 million in rescissions, $1.27 billion above the Obama Administration request, and $1.54 billion over the FY2016 level, excluding rescissions. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by procedural and statutory budget enforcement measures, including limits on discretionary spending and sequestration. The House and Senate have differing proposals for funding levels, with the Senate recommending increases for weapons activities and nuclear waste storage, while the House includes funding increases for DOE weapons activities and Yucca Mountain. The Senate also recommends decreases in energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D, and elimination of the Title 17 Loan Guarantee program. The Budget Control Act (BCA) enforces spending limits through sequestration, triggering across-the-board cuts for breaches. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. Controversial issues arose during congressional consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2018. The Energy and Water Development appropriations for FY2018 included proposed cuts for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The Trump Administration requested $5.002 billion for the Corps, a decrease of 17.2% from FY2017, with significant cuts in Construction, Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Investigations. The Bureau of Reclamation saw a reduction of $209 million (14.3%) below FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 provided $6.827 billion for the Corps (13.1% above FY2017) and $1.470 billion for Reclamation (an increase of 12.5%). The FY2018 budget proposed cuts for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. The House and Senate had differing proposals for funding levels. Additionally, the budget request aimed to terminate the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) received funding for the weatherization program and State Energy Program (SEP) in FY2017. Despite not aligning with EERE's focus in FY2018, grants were increased by 10.1%. The Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed significant cuts to DOE research and development on energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy. The Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed significant reductions in funding for Department of Energy programs, including carbon capture and storage, nuclear fuel cycle R&D, sustainable transportation, renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, and building technologies. These cuts aimed to shift the focus towards private sector investment in later-stage R&D. The FY2018 budget proposed cuts in energy R&D funding, with increases in energy efficiency and renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy. The DOE was directed to review the 2009 MOU related to the ENERGY STAR program and report to Congress on home appliance efficiencies. The House approved most proposed cuts in energy efficiency R&D, while the Senate denied most reductions in EERE R&D. The panel recommended reductions in EERE R&D and a review of the 2009 MOU between DOE and EPA. They also called for cuts in nuclear energy R&D by 9.8% and fossil energy by 14.3% from FY2017 levels. The Administration's budget included funding for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, but it was not approved in the FY2018 Appropriations Act. DOE was to receive $110 million for an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would have received $30 million for DOE's application. Additionally, DOE would have received $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The Obama Administration declared the Yucca Mountain site \"unworkable\" due to opposition from Nevada. The House voted for Yucca Mountain funding in FY2018, but the Senate did not. A pilot program for an interim nuclear waste storage facility was included in the Senate panel's proposal. The FY2018 budget request did not include the proposed elimination of DOE's loan programs for Advanced Technology Vehicles and Innovative Technology. The budget focused on private sector funding for energy technologies and continued administering existing loans with prior-year appropriations covering administrative costs. The FY2018 budget request did not include the proposed elimination of DOE's loan programs for Advanced Technology Vehicles and Innovative Technology. The budget focused on private sector funding for energy technologies and continued administering existing loans with prior-year appropriations covering administrative costs. Additionally, there were proposals to cancel unobligated prior-year appropriations for DOE loan programs and rescind unused authority for loan guarantee commitments. Congressional concerns were raised about the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in France. The United States' involvement in the ITER project in France has raised concerns about management, schedule, and cost. The U.S. is responsible for 9.09% of the project's construction costs, estimated between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. DOE recommended continued participation for at least two more years, with Congress appropriating $50 million for FY2017 and a request for $63 million for FY2018. The Senate Appropriations Committee disapproved further funding for the ITER project, despite its potential to revolutionize fusion energy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 provided $122 million for ITER. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposed eliminating ARPA-E, but funding was increased by 15.5% to $353.3 million. The Administration believed the private sector could better finance disruptive energy research and development. The FY2018 budget proposed terminating ARPA-E, which provides advance funding for innovative technologies. The House approved the proposal, but the Senate recommended a $24 million increase in funding. The ARPA-E office would have closed in FY2019, with remaining activities transferred elsewhere within DOE. The FY2018 budget requested a 10.7% increase in funding for Weapons Activities in the DOE's NNSA, totaling $10.239 billion. Aging infrastructure poses risks to mission, worker safety, and the environment. The House approved the funding request, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $239.3 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $239.3 million less than the Administration's funding request for Weapons Activities in the DOE's NNSA, totaling $10.0 billion, still an 8.2% increase over the FY2017 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 provided $10.642 billion for Weapons Activities, up 15.1% from FY2017. The Mixed-Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) has faced escalating construction and operation cost estimates, leading to proposals to terminate it in FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed to end the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) project in FY2018, requesting $279 million for the termination process. They also requested $9 million for a new Surplus Plutonium Disposition Project. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2018 authorized DOE to pursue an alternative plutonium disposal option if costs were lower than half of the MFFF program's estimated remaining lifecycle cost. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 continued MFFF funding at $335 million but allowed DOE to explore alternative disposal methods. The House approved $340 million for MFFF construction in FY2018, while the Senate accepted $270 million to terminate the project and $9 million for an alternative plutonium disposal project. Supporters argue MFFF is necessary to fulfill agreements with Russia and South Carolina. DOE's Office of Environmental Management handles cleanup and waste management. Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for environmental cleanup and waste management at nuclear facilities. The FY2018 appropriations request for EM was $6.508 billion, with increases in Defense Environmental Cleanup and decreases in Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup and Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2018 provided $7.126 billion for EM, with differing proposals from the House and Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed an increase to $6.6 billion for Environmental Management activities. The Department of Energy may negotiate with regulators to modify project milestones. The FY2018 budget request included proposals related to Power Marketing Administrations. The Administration proposed to divest the assets of three Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) that own transmission infrastructure: BPA, SWPA, and WAPA. This includes thousands of miles of transmission lines and power substations, with projected savings of $5.5 billion over 10 years. The proposal faced opposition from various groups and lawmakers. The Administration's budget proposed repealing $3.25 billion in borrowing authority for WAPA's transmission projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This is estimated to save $4.4 billion over 10 years. No congressional action was taken on these proposals. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill includes four titles. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill consists of four titles: Corps of Engineers\u2014Civil, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and Independent Agencies. Major programs in the bill are described in approximate order, with previous appropriations and recommendations for FY2018 shown in accompanying tables. Additional details about these programs can be found in separate CRS reports. FY2018 budget justifications for the largest agencies funded by the bill can be found on specific websites. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an agency with military and civilian responsibilities under the civil works program funded by the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. They plan, build, operate, and maintain water resources facilities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructs and manages water resources facilities for navigation, flood risk reduction, and ecosystem restoration. Recent water resources development acts have authorized new projects and changed Corps policies. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive grants. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is directly involved in planning, designing, and constructing projects with nonfederal sponsors. Congress determines funding for specific projects, with earmarks subject to moratorium policies since the 112th Congress. Instead of project-based increases, Congress now provides \"additional funding\" for select categories of Corps projects with specific directions and limitations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is involved in planning, designing, and constructing projects with nonfederal sponsors. Congress determines funding for projects with specific directions and limitations. The Bureau of Reclamation primarily develops water supplies for irrigation in the West, while the Army Corps of Engineers focuses on flood control and navigation projects. Reclamation now assists in meeting water demands while protecting the environment and infrastructure investments. The Bureau of Reclamation manages numerous dams and water projects in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. They are the largest water supplier in the region and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation's operations have benefits for flood control, recreation, and wildlife, but can be controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife during droughts. Their budget consists mainly of project-specific funding lines. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget consists mainly of project-specific funding lines, with few \"programs.\" The current moratorium on earmarks limits congressional steering of funds towards specific projects. The agency's largest account, Water and Related Resources, covers traditional programs like construction, operations, dam safety, and ecosystem restoration. Reclamation also requests funds in smaller accounts and has proposed additional accounts in recent years. The Central Utah Project is overseen by a separate office within the Department of the Interior. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget mainly consists of project-specific funding lines, with limited \"programs\" due to the moratorium on earmarks. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded all DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear power, and fossil energy. DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy conducts research on various energy technologies and administers formula grants to states for energy efficiency improvements. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) administers grants for energy efficiency improvements and state energy planning. The Sustainable Transportation program focuses on electric vehicles, vehicle efficiency, and alternative fuels. Goals include cutting costs for battery and electric drivetrains for EVs by 2022 and reducing the cost of battery capacity. The fuel cell program aims for lower costs and increased durability by 2020. Bioenergy goals include developing \"drop-in\" fuels compatible with existing infrastructure. Renewable power programs focus on electricity generation. The DOE's SunShot Initiative aims to make solar energy a low-cost electricity source, with a goal of achieving costs of 3 cents per kwh for utility-scale photovoltaics by 2030. The wind energy program targets 5.2 cents/kwh for land-based windfarms and 14.9 cents/kwh for offshore wind settings by 2020. The geothermal program aims to lower exploration risks and production costs to 6 cents/kwh for new technologies by 2030. The advanced manufacturing program focuses on energy-related technologies, while the building technologies program aims to reduce building energy use intensity by 30% by 2030. The DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) supports electric grid modernization and resiliency through research, partnerships, and emergency preparedness. It is the lead entity for energy sector-specific responses to security emergencies. The DOE's 2015 Grid Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan outlines goals for a future electric grid that is reliable, affordable, and clean. These goals include a 10% reduction in power outage costs, a 33% decrease in reserve margin costs while maintaining reliability, and a 50% decrease in the integration costs of distributed energy resources by 2025. The DOE's FY2018 budget request for the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) focuses on research and development activities to address technical, cost, safety, waste management, proliferation resistance, and security challenges of nuclear energy. The Reactor Concepts program area includes research on advanced reactors, such as small modular reactors, and enhancing the sustainability of existing light water reactors. Advanced reactor research focuses on Generation IV reactors and advanced coolants, fuels, materials, and other technologies. The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is conducting research on advanced reactors, including small modular reactors, and extending the life of existing light water reactors. They are also supporting NRC efforts to develop a new licensing framework for advanced reactors and conducting research on accident prevention and mitigation measures. NE completed a program in FY2017 that provided design and licensing funding for small modular reactors, including the NuScale Power SMR. The company's current concept for SMR sites involves housing up to 12 reactors in a single pool of water for emergency cooling. A design certification application for the NuScale SMR was submitted to the NRC in 2017. Funding for next-generation reactors, including SMRs, has been supported by the DOE's Advanced Reactor Technologies subprogram. NuScale was awarded a $40 million FOAK matching grant in 2018. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development program focuses on nuclear waste management, accident-tolerant fuels, fuel cycle options, and improved technologies for prevention. The DOE's Fossil Energy R&D Program focuses on carbon capture and storage for power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Activities include Carbon Capture and Storage subprograms, Advanced Energy Systems subprogram, and Cross-Cutting Research and Analysis on innovative systems. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide strategic and economic security against disruptions in U.S. oil supplies. It consists of caverns in salt domes in Louisiana and Texas with a capacity of 727 million barrels. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994. Since 1994, the government has not purchased oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Additions to the SPR since 2000 were made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil acquired by the Department of Energy (DOE). In 2011, President Obama ordered an SPR sale in coordination with an International Energy Administration sale due to Libya's supply curtailment, reducing the SPR inventory to 695.9 million barrels. In 2014, a test sale delivered 5.0 million barrels of crude oil, generating $468.6 million in cash receipts for the U.S. government. In 2015, DOE purchased 4.2 million barrels of crude oil for the SPR using proceeds from the 2014 test sale. The SPR's drawdown capacity in FY2017 will be 4.25 million barrels per day. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 authorizes the sale of 58 million barrels of oil from the SPR, with authorized sales totaling 5 million barrels per fiscal year for 2018-2021. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act authorizes the sale of 66 million barrels of oil from the SPR, with authorized sales totaling 16 million barrels in FY2023 and 25 million barrels in each of fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas, including advanced scientific computing research, basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, fusion energy sciences, high-energy physics, and nuclear physics. The Office of Science is the largest Federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports fundamental scientific research for the nation's energy future. The Advanced Scientific Computing Research program focuses on developing computing and networking capabilities for science and research, playing a key role in advancing exascale computing. The DOE is working on developing exascale computing, aiming for a machine that can solve scientific problems 1,000 times faster than current machines by the early 2020s. Basic Energy Sciences focuses on understanding and controlling matter and energy at the atomic level, supporting research in various disciplines. Biological and Environmental Research aims for predictive capabilities in its research efforts.

The Department of Energy (DOE) is involved in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, aiming to generate fusion power at unprecedented levels. Concerns have been raised about ITER's cost, schedule, and management, as well as its impact on domestic fusion research. The DOE's High Energy Physics (HEP) program focuses on fundamental research, including dark energy and dark matter studies. The Nuclear Physics program supports research on the nature of matter, with a major project being the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University. Additionally, the DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) was established to support innovative energy projects. The DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) was authorized by the America COMPETES Act to support transformational energy technology research projects. ARPA-E's mission is to overcome long-term, high-risk technological barriers in energy technology development. DOE's Loan Programs Office provides loan guarantees for energy projects authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Title 17 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows DOE to provide loan guarantees for eligible energy projects, covering up to 80% of construction costs. Successful applicants pay an up-front fee to mitigate potential losses. The federal government would repay all covered loans in case of default, reducing risk for lenders. Loan guarantee ceilings include $8.3 billion for non-nuclear technologies, $2 billion for unspecified projects, $18.5 billion for nuclear power plants, $4 billion for uranium enrichment plants, and $1.183 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703. The DOE has allocated $161 million for subsidy costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees under Section 1703, potentially leveraging loan guarantees totaling about $1.6 billion. Loan guarantees under Section 1703 include $8.3 billion for the Vogtle nuclear project in Georgia and an additional $3.7 billion commitment. NuScale Power is seeking a loan guarantee to build a small modular reactor in Idaho. The United States has adopted a science-based program to maintain confidence in nuclear technology. The United States has a science-based program, the Stockpile Stewardship Program, to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile without underground testing. Operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), funded through the Weapons Activities account, most activities take place at the nuclear weapons complex. The NNSA manages the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites. The President's budget requested $10.239 billion for Weapons Activities in FY2018, with the Senate recommending $10 billion, a decrease of $239 million. The Senate recommended $10 billion for Weapons Activities in FY2018, a decrease of $239 million from the budget request. The program areas include Directed Stockpile Work for nuclear weapons maintenance and Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation programs. The Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) programs focus on developing and maintaining capabilities for stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. This includes operating experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility. Infrastructure and Operations funding covers material recycle, facility recapitalization, and construction projects like the Uranium Processing Facility and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project. Weapons Activities also include smaller programs for security. Weapons Activities under the Department of Energy include programs for secure transportation, defense nuclear security, information technology and cybersecurity, and legacy contractor pensions. These programs ensure safe transport of nuclear materials, provide security operations and maintenance, support cybersecurity efforts, and offer supplemental funds for retiree pensions from specific national laboratories. The DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs, administered by NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, focus on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons globally. Global Materials Security includes International Nuclear Security, Radiological Security, and Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence to enhance security, reduce radioactive sources, and prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Materials Management and Minimization aims to eliminate weapons-usable stockpiles. The Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program works to minimize and eliminate weapons-useable material worldwide through activities like reactor conversion, stockpile removal, and excess material disposition. It also focuses on controlling the spread of nuclear material, technology, and expertise, implementing treaty obligations, and advancing nuclear detection technologies. The Nonproliferation Construction program includes the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, proposed for termination by the Obama and Trump administrations. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response provides policy, planning, training, and capacity building to counter nuclear terrorism. The legacy of nuclear weapons production has led to waste and contamination challenges, leading to the establishment of the Office of Environmental Management in 1989. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 to consolidate responsibilities for cleaning up former nuclear weapons production sites. This includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediation of contamination in soil and groundwater, decontamination of buildings, and safeguarding facilities during cleanup. Additionally, the office is responsible for cleaning up DOE sites involved in civilian nuclear energy research. The Department of Energy (DOE) has identified over 100 \"geographic\" sites in 30+ states involved in nuclear weapons and energy research. Cleanup remedies are in place at most sites, with long-term stewardship managed by the Office of Legacy Management. Some smaller sites were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) in 1997. Once cleanup is completed, sites are returned to DOE for long-term stewardship. The DOE transfers FUSRAP sites back for long-term stewardship under the Office of Legacy Management. The Office of Environmental Management is funded by three appropriations accounts, with the Defense Environmental Cleanup account being the largest. The Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account funds the cleanup of federal nuclear energy research sites. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund was established to pay for the cleanup of federal facilities that enriched uranium for national defense and civilian purposes. The three federal uranium enrichment facilities are located near Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH (Portsmouth plant); and Oak Ridge, TN. Adequacy of funding for cleanup milestones at federal facilities has been a recurring issue. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs give preference to publicly and cooperatively owned utilities. They operate in 34 states with transmission infrastructure spanning over 33,000 miles of high voltage lines and 587 substations. PMA customers repay all power program expenses and interest on capital projects. Power revenues since FY2011 are classified as discretionary offsetting receipts, making the agencies have a \"net-zero\" spending authority. Only WAPA and SWPA's capital expenses require appropriations from Congress. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent agency that sets safety standards for nuclear power plants and materials. Major appropriations categories for NRC include Nuclear Reactor Safety, Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety, Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste, Corporate Support, and Integrated University Program. NRC charges fees to regulated entities to cover about 90% of its budget, resulting in a net appropriation of about 10%. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's net appropriation is only about 10% of its total funding level. Hearings were held by the Energy and Water Development subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on the FY2018 budget request, with testimony and opening statements posted on relevant web pages. The National Nuclear Security Administration, Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, and Bureau of Reclamation had budget review hearings in June 2017. Links to the hearings can be found on the Senate Appropriations Committee website."
