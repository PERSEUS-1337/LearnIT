The Strengthening Medicare And Repaying Taxpayers Act of 2011 includes provisions for expediting reimbursement determination, enhancing program efficiency, and setting a statute of limitations for conditional payment reimbursement requests. The Strengthening Medicare And Repaying Taxpayers Act of 2011 allows claimants or applicable plans to request a statement of conditional payment reimbursement amount once for any settlement, judgment, award, or payment subject to reimbursement. The Strengthening Medicare And Repaying Taxpayers Act of 2011 allows claimants or applicable plans to request a statement of conditional payment reimbursement amount within 65 days of receipt, which is subject to recovery related to settlements, judgments, awards, or payments. The Act allows claimants or plans to request a reimbursement statement within 65 days, related to settlements, judgments, awards, or payments. If the Secretary fails to provide the statement, the claimant or plan may take action. If the Secretary fails to provide a reimbursement statement within 30 days of an additional notice, the claimant, applicable plan, and entities receiving payment are not liable for payment under this section. The payment under this section is subject to regulations defining exceptional circumstances, with not more than 1 percent of repayment obligations exempted unless justified by the Secretary. The claimant or applicable plan must notify the Secretary if a settlement, judgment, or payment does not occur within 120 days of the original request under this clause. The Secretary is then exempt from any obligation. The Secretary shall be exempt from any obligation under subclause (II) regarding a statement of reimbursement amount for settlements, judgments, awards, or other payments related to the notice. Final regulations must be promulgated within 9 months of the enactment of this clause, requiring disclosure from a claimant or applicable plan of no more than the necessary information.

The appeal process includes review by an administrative law judge, administrative review board, and access to judicial review in the district court of the United States.

SEC. 3. FISCAL EFFICIENCY AND REVENUE NEUTRALITY. In amending Section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act, a new exception is added regarding settlement payments by an applicable plan, exempting them from certain reporting requirements if the total payment obligation to a claimant does not exceed a specified threshold amount calculated annually. The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services calculates and publishes annual threshold amounts for settlements, judgments, awards, or other payments for conditional payment obligations from liability insurance, workers' compensation, and no-fault insurance. The Chief Actuary calculates and publishes annual threshold amounts for settlements, judgments, awards, or other payments for liability insurance, workers' compensation, and no-fault insurance. The expected average cost of collection incurred by the United States for conditional payments is included in the publication. The Chief Actuary calculates annual threshold amounts for payments related to liability insurance, workers' compensation, and no-fault insurance. The methodology and data used for computing these amounts are summarized. Ongoing expenses for medical payments are also addressed in settlements, judgments, awards, or other payments. The amendments made by subsection (a) regarding the calculation of annual threshold amounts for payments related to liability insurance, workers' compensation, and no-fault insurance shall apply to years beginning more than 4\\1/2\\ months after the date of the enactment of this Act. Payment shall include only the cumulative value of medical payments made and the purchase price of any annuity or similar instrument. SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENT SAFE HARBORS. Section 1862(b)(8) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow for civil money penalties of up to $1,000 per day for noncompliance. The severity of the penalty will depend on the violation's knowing, willful, and repeated nature. Additionally, safe harbors will be established by the Secretary within 60 days of the enactment of this amendment. The Federal Register will solicit proposals for practices exempt from sanctions under certain conditions, including good faith efforts to identify beneficiaries. Compliance with reporting requirements will be deemed met under specified circumstances. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, will publish proposed specified practices exempt from sanctions in the Federal Register for public comment. Final rules specifying these practices will be issued after considering any public comments received. SEC. 5 amends the reporting requirements under the Social Security Act to allow plans to access or report beneficiary social security numbers. SEC. 6 addresses the statute of limitations. Section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a 3-year time limit for filing complaints related to payment owed and for imposing civil money penalties for failure to submit required information. The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to actions brought and penalties sought on or after 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act."
