    "content": "The \"Ultrasound Informed Consent Act\" is added to the Public Health Service Act, including definitions in Title XXX. The curr_chunk defines \"abortion\" as the intentional termination of an unborn child's life or a woman's pregnancy for specific reasons. It also defines an \"abortion provider\" as a person legally qualified to perform abortions. The curr_chunk defines \"unborn child\" as a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage before birth, and \"woman\" as a female human being regardless of age. The curr_chunk states the requirement of informed consent. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for abortion providers regarding ultrasounds before performing an abortion. It includes performing an ultrasound, explaining the results, displaying the images to the woman, and providing a medical description. The section does not mandate women to view ultrasound images before an abortion, and there are no penalties for refusing to do so. \"Exception for medical emergencies.\" The provisions of section 3002 do not apply to abortion providers or facilities in cases of a medical emergency. A medical emergency is defined as a condition that, in the reasonable medical judgment of the provider, poses a serious risk of causing irreversible physical health damage. The judgment must be made by a reasonably prudent physician. Upon determining a medical emergency for a pregnant woman, an abortion provider must certify the specific conditions constituting the emergency in the woman's medical file. Falsifying this certification will result in penalties under section 3004. \"Penalties under section 3004 apply for falsifying certification of a medical emergency for a pregnant woman.\" An abortion provider who fails to comply with this title may face civil penalties in federal court. The Attorney General can start a civil action. For a first offense, a court can impose a civil penalty up to $100,000 and notify the state medical licensing authority. For second or subsequent offenses, the penalty increases if the provider knowingly violates the law again. The court can assess a civil penalty of up to $250,000 against an abortion provider for violations of this title. A pregnant woman or her guardian can also sue for damages for any willful violation of the law. SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act does not override any State law that requires greater disclosure on abortion than what is outlined in this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.\n\nThe provisions of this Act are separable, and if any part is deemed unconstitutional, it does not affect the rest of the Act."
