    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Organ Donation Clarification Act of 2016\". Congress finds that as of January 2016, 121,000 people await an organ transplant, with 100,000 waiting for a kidney. Average wait times for a kidney are approaching five years, with more people added to waiting lists than receiving transplants. Living donor kidney transplants peaked in 2006 but have since declined due to a scarcity of donors. Only a small percentage of Americans who die annually have organs suitable for transplant. On average, 22 people die each day while waiting for an organ, with the majority waiting for a kidney. In 2013, nearly 3,000 people were removed from kidney waiting lists. (6) 90% of dialysis patients are not employed due to the time-consuming treatments, creating a financial burden on patients, families, and the government. (7) Kidney transplant recipients have 10-15 years of additional life compared to dialysis, with living donor kidneys providing 4-8 years more than deceased donor kidneys. As medical advances prolong lives while waiting for organ transplants, costs for individuals and the government will rise significantly. Kidney transplants save over $745,000 in medical costs over 10 years, with 75% of the savings benefiting taxpayers. Increasing the supply of transplant kidneys could meet demand and provide substantial savings. Increasing the supply of transplant kidneys could meet demand and save taxpayers over $5.5 billion annually. The World Health Organization notes that 10% of transplants occur on the black market, leading to poor health outcomes for recipients and victimization of donors. Current domestic donation policies lack evidence-based support and restrict incentives for donors. Experts agree that trials are needed to develop new methods for increasing organ donation without offering incentives to donors. This will help save lives and combat organ trafficking. SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL ORGAN TRANSPLANT ACT. The National Organ Transplant Act clarifies that governments can encourage organ donation through pilot programs without restrictions on noncash benefits. States can also provide benefits for organ donation under this Act. The National Organ Transplant Act prohibits valuable consideration for organ donation, excluding reimbursement for travel, lodging, food, dependent care, lost wages, medical expenses, paperwork/legal costs, and insurance against death. The National Organ Transplant Act prohibits valuable consideration for organ donation, excluding reimbursement for travel, lodging, food, dependent care, lost wages, medical expenses, paperwork/legal costs, and insurance against death or disability resulting from organ donation. The term \"organ\" includes various human body parts, and a covered pilot program is a limited-term initiative aimed at increasing the organ pool by removing disincentives or providing noncash benefits. The pilot program aims to increase the organ pool by distributing organs from deceased donors through approved transplant centers."
