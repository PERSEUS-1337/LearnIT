    "content": "The report presents background information and issues for Congress regarding the Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, raising questions for Congress on whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's shipbuilding program. Congressional decisions on this issue can significantly impact Navy capabilities and funding requirements. The Navy's shipbuilding programs are crucial for Navy capabilities and funding. Detailed reports on specific programs like the Navy Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarine, Navy Virginia Class Attack Submarine, and Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier can be found in CRS reports. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposal, which included not funding a mid-life refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman and retiring it around FY2024, is also covered. The Navy's shipbuilding programs are crucial for Navy capabilities and funding. Reports on specific programs like the Navy Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarine, Navy Virginia Class Attack Submarine, and Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier can be found in CRS reports. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposal includes not funding a mid-life refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman [CVN-75], and retiring CVN-75 around FY2024. Various CRS reports by Ronald O'Rourke cover Navy destroyer, frigate, littoral combat ship, amphibious ship, and oiler shipbuilding programs. The Navy released a force-structure goal on December 15, 2016. The Navy released a force-structure goal on December 15, 2016, aiming for a fleet of 355 ships, replacing the previous goal of 308 ships. This goal is the largest since 2002-2004 when a 375-ship goal was in place. The Navy's actual fleet size in recent years has been between 270 and 290 ships. The 355-ship goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment conducted in 2016. The Navy conducts Force Structure Assessments (FSAs) every few years to determine the types and amounts of Navy capabilities needed for national military strategy implementation. FSAs consider various factors such as ship types, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and weapons. The goal is to translate inputs from combatant commanders into required numbers of ships, with the latest goal set at 355 ships in 2016. The Navy conducts Force Structure Assessments (FSAs) every few years to determine the types and amounts of Navy capabilities needed for national military strategy implementation. The latest goal, set in the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act, is to have not fewer than 355 battle force ships. A new FSA is currently underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA, with completion expected by the end of 2019. The new Force Structure Assessment (FSA) by the Navy, to be completed by the end of 2019, will consider the Trump Administration's National Security and Defense Strategy documents, focusing on great power competition with China and Russia. It will also incorporate updated information on Chinese and Russian military capabilities, new technologies like unmanned vehicles (UVs), and may potentially alter the planned 355-ship figure and ship mix towards a more distributed architecture with fewer large surface combatants. The Navy's new Force Structure Assessment (FSA) is expected to include a greater emphasis on small surface combatants, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). This shift towards a more distributed force architecture aligns with the Navy's new operational concept, Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), in response to China's growing anti-access/area denial capabilities. China's improving maritime anti-access/area denial capabilities and new technologies for UVs and networking Navy ships are driving the Navy's potential new surface force architecture, with a focus on small surface combatants and USVs. The shift towards a more distributed force mix is in response to China's growing capabilities. The Navy's new Force Structure Assessment (FSA) may change the metrics for force-level goals to include large USVs and UUVs. The FY2020 shipbuilding plan includes procurement of 12 new ships, such as an aircraft carrier, submarines, destroyers, frigates, and oilers. Congress authorized the procurement of CVN-81 in FY2019. The Navy's FY2020 shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships over five years, with changes in ship mix compared to the FY2019 budget submission. This includes additional attack submarines, FFG(X) frigates, and LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships. Adjustments were also made to annual procurement quantities for DDG-51 destroyers, ESBs, and TAO-205s. The FY2020 shipbuilding plan accelerates the procurement of several ships, including aircraft carriers, attack submarines, and destroyers, while deferring the acquisition of others. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to achieve its ship force-structure goal by considering construction times, service lives, procurement costs, and funding projections. The Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan aims to achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034, 20 years sooner than projected in the FY2019 plan. This acceleration is not due to a higher number of ships in the FY2020 plan but a decision made by the Navy in April 2018. The Navy's decision in April 2018 to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years significantly impacted the total number of ships in the Navy's FY2019 and FY2020 budget submissions. The FY2019 plan did not project reaching a total of 355 ships within 30 years, while the FY2020 plan aims to achieve this goal by FY2034. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission initially proposed to retire the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) by FY2024 without funding its mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul. However, the Administration later withdrew this proposal and now supports funding the overhaul to keep CVN-75 in service past FY2024. This adjustment increases the projected number of aircraft carriers and total ships for FY2022-FY2047. The Navy's fleet composition in FY2034 will not match the requirements set in the FY2016 FSA, with more large surface combatants, fewer aircraft carriers, attack submarines, and amphibious ships than needed. The Navy acknowledges this discrepancy but states it is necessary due to decisions such as extending the service lives of DDG-51s. The Navy's fleet composition in FY2034 will not match the requirements set in the FY2016 FSA. The new FSA could shift the Navy towards a more distributed force architecture, potentially changing the 355-ship figure and planned mix of ships. Congress needs to assess the appropriateness of the Navy's FY2020 shipbuilding plans amidst potential changes in force-level goals. Another oversight issue is the affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan's affordability is a key concern for Congress, especially from the mid-2020s to mid-2030s. The plan includes procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and replacing retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers, requiring approximately $24 billion annually during that period. The FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan requires $24 billion per year for shipbuilding funds. The Navy prioritizes the Columbia-class program, potentially at the expense of other Navy programs. Concerns about funding for the Columbia-class program led to the creation of the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund by Congress. The Navy's shipbuilding budget has grown to roughly $24 billion per year, with the Columbia-class program projected to require $7 billion per year from the mid-2020s to the mid-2030s. While this amount no longer represents half of the total budget, concerns persist about its impact on funding for other Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy's shipbuilding budget has grown to roughly $24 billion per year, with concerns about potential cost overruns for various ship designs, including the Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers, Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, Virginia-class attack submarines with VPM, DDG-51 destroyers, FFG(X) frigates, LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships, and John Lewis class oilers. If these designs end up being more expensive to build than estimated, the projected funding levels may not be sufficient to procure all the ships in the 30-year plan. CBO is analyzing the cost of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan, comparing funding estimates for FY2019 and FY2020. There are differences in ship types and numbers to be procured in certain years. CBO's analysis of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan shows a cost estimate 27% higher than the Navy's for implementing the FY2019 plan. The cost divergence increases over the years, with CBO's estimate higher for each 10-year period. The growing divergence between CBO's and Navy's cost estimates for the 30-year shipbuilding plan is partly due to a technical difference in inflation treatment. This difference compounds over time, leading to increasing discrepancies in estimates as the plan progresses. Additionally, differences in cost projections for certain ship classes contribute to the widening gap between the two estimates. The CBO and Navy have differing cost estimates for future ship classes, with a new class of SSNs accounting for a significant portion of the variance in their FY2019 30-year plan estimates. The technical difference in inflation treatment exacerbates discrepancies over time. The CBO and Navy have differing cost estimates for future ship classes, with a new class of large surface combatant and frigates accounting for a significant portion of the difference. Other shipbuilding programs also contribute to the variance in estimates. Legislative activity on Navy shipbuilding programs can be found in CRS reports by Ronald O'Rourke, covering funding levels, provisions, and report language for various Navy ship programs including the Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarine, Virginia Class Attack Submarine, Ford Class Aircraft Carrier, and DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposal, which included not funding a mid-life refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman and retiring CVN-75 around FY2024, was withdrawn on April 30. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including a Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, Virginia-class attack submarines, and various other shipbuilding programs covered in CRS reports by Ronald O'Rourke. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget includes funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, such as an aircraft carrier, attack submarines, Aegis destroyers, a frigate, oilers, and towing, salvage, and rescue ships. Congress authorized the procurement of an aircraft carrier in FY2019, and the FY2020 shipbuilding budget also includes funding for ships from prior and future fiscal years, as well as other Navy activities. Congressional action on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for shipbuilding is summarized in Table 6. The table displays requested amounts and congressional changes. Appendix A discusses the shift in the international security environment towards great power competition with China and Russia. The shift in the international security environment towards great power competition with China and Russia has led to a renewed emphasis on U.S. grand strategy and geopolitics. U.S. policymakers have focused on preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia due to the concentration of people, resources, and economic activity in that hemisphere. The U.S. policymakers have focused on preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia to protect core U.S. interests by denying access to key resources and economic activity. This goal has been supported by U.S. military and diplomatic operations in recent decades. The U.S. military is structured to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon in Eurasia by crossing broad expanses of ocean and air space to conduct large-scale military operations. This includes having an Air Force with long-range bombers, surveillance aircraft, airlift aircraft, and refueling tankers, as well as a Navy with aircraft carriers, submarines, surface combatants, amphibious ships, and replenishment ships. The U.S. is unique in designing its military for this purpose, unlike other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. military is structured to prevent a regional hegemon in Eurasia by conducting large-scale military operations upon arrival. Other countries in the Western Hemisphere do not design their forces for this purpose as the U.S. has been doing it for them. The U.S. military's ability to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space sets it apart from other nations' forces. The U.S. military's significant number of aircraft carriers is necessary for conducting sustained, large-scale military operations across broad expanses of ocean and air space. Comparatively, other countries, including U.S. allies, do not require as many carriers as they do not design their forces for such operations. The size of the U.S. Navy, being equal to the next dozen or more navies combined, does not necessarily indicate adequacy or excessiveness, but rather reflects the different military strategies and capabilities of nations. The sufficiency of U.S. naval and military forces is best assessed against U.S. strategic goals, not through comparison to other countries. U.S. allies have different needs for naval forces due to their location in Eurasia, while the U.S. aims to prevent regional hegemony in Eurasia. U.S. naval forces provide the ability to influence global geopolitics. U.S. naval forces enable the U.S. to utilize the world's oceans for projecting power and defending its interests globally. This advantage stems from the vast coverage of international waters, allowing naval operations to occur freely. The overall U.S. role in the world since World War II has been one of global leadership, promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights. Uncertainty about the future U.S. role has arisen due to certain statements and actions from the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration's statements and actions have raised uncertainty about the U.S. role in the world, leading to speculation about potential changes. Concerns have been expressed regarding the narrowing technological and qualitative edge of U.S. military forces compared to other countries, particularly due to China and Russia's improving military capabilities. The U.S. faces challenges from China's improving naval capabilities in the Western Pacific, potentially threatening U.S. Navy's control of ocean areas. Longer ship deployments are needed to meet requests from regional combatant commanders. The U.S. Navy faces challenges from China's naval capabilities in the Western Pacific, requiring longer ship deployments to meet regional combatant commanders' requests. Navy officials stated that a fleet of 450 ships would be necessary to fulfill these demands. The Global Force Management Allocation Plan determines how to allocate Navy ships among different requests. Despite efforts to limit deployments to seven months, ships have often been deployed for longer periods. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes limits on defense spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes limits on defense spending, leading to discussions on balancing competing demands for U.S. defense funds. This includes considerations on adequately funding programs for responding to China's military modernization, initiatives for countering Russia's actions, and operations against the Islamic State in the Middle East. Earlier Navy force-structure goals dating back to 2001 are also highlighted. The force-level goal of March 2015 was replaced by the 355-ship force-level goal released in December 2016. Comparing past ship force levels to current or potential future levels can be problematic due to changing missions, ship mix, and technologies over time. Historical fleet size figures may not be a reliable yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of the Navy's current or future ship numbers. The Navy's fleet size has changed significantly over the years, with the FY1987 fleet focused on countering Soviet naval forces, while the May 2019 fleet is geared towards countering military forces of China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations. The shift in mission requirements has led to differences in ship numbers and capabilities between the two fleets. The Navy's fleet size has evolved over the years, with the FY1987 fleet focused on countering Soviet naval forces, while the May 2019 fleet is geared towards countering military forces of China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations. The capabilities of Navy ships are expected to change in the future due to advancements in networking technology, increased use of unmanned vehicles, and potential new weapons like lasers or electromagnetic rail guns. The effectiveness of past, present, and future fleets in performing their missions is subject to changes in mission requirements, ship mixes, and technologies. The Navy's fleet size has evolved over the years to counter various military threats. Changes in mission requirements, ship mixes, and technologies impact the fleet's ability to perform its missions. The total number of ships in the fleet may not accurately reflect the fleet's capability, as mission requirements and ship capabilities can change independently. Increasing or decreasing ship numbers may not directly correlate with the fleet's ability to perform its missions. The size of the Navy's fleet has evolved over the years to counter military threats, with changes in mission requirements and technologies impacting its capability. Comparisons of fleet size in earlier years may not consider if the fleet was appropriately sized then. Simply assuming that a specific number of ships in the past was suitable for mission requirements may not be prudent. The historical records show a figure of 286 ships in 2016, leading to assumptions about the adequacy of Navy fleet size in earlier years. Previous force structure plans may offer insights, but caution is advised due to changes in mission requirements and technologies over time. The Reagan-era goal of a 600-ship Navy designed for Cold War missions is not suitable for today's Navy planning. The industrial base has capacity for additional shipbuilding work to achieve the Navy's 355-ship goal. The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has unused capacity to support increased Navy shipbuilding work, especially for certain surface ships. Time and investment would be required to hire and train more workers and expand production facilities for higher Navy shipbuilding rates, particularly for submarines. Newly hired workers may initially be less productive than experienced workers. Some parts of the industrial base, like submarine construction, may face challenges in ramping up production for the 355-ship fleet over a few to several years. The U.S. shipbuilding industry has the capacity to support increased Navy shipbuilding, but challenges exist in ramping up production for the 355-ship fleet. Shipyards would need to increase workforces and make infrastructure improvements to build ships at a faster rate. Building more submarines poses the greatest challenge, while increasing aircraft carriers and surface combatants would pose a small to moderate challenge. Amphibious ships and combat logistics vessels would be the least problematic to build. The shipyards would need to increase workforces by 40 percent over the next 5 to 10 years to support increased Navy shipbuilding. Managing the growth and training of new workforces while maintaining quality and efficiency is a significant challenge. Up to $4 billion would need to be invested in shipyard infrastructure for higher production rates. The Navy's production lines are ready for building a larger fleet. The Navy's shipyards are prepared for building a larger fleet, with the possibility of expanding to 355 ships being manageable. Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, Sean Stackley, mentioned that adjustments may be needed in certain areas like Virginia-class attack submarines and DDG-51 guided missile destroyers to meet the demand. Industry experts believe that the Navy is currently underutilizing its facilities. The Navy is prepared to expand to 355 ships, with adjustments needed in ship classes like Virginia-class attack submarines and DDG-51 guided missile destroyers. Industry experts believe the Navy is underutilizing its facilities, and maintaining skilled workers is crucial for ramping up production. Building stable designs with active production lines is central to the Navy's plan for growth. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean Stackley, stated that the Navy is on track to reach 308 ships by 2021 and is aiming for a 355-ship fleet. The focus is on increasing attack submarines and large surface combatants like DDG-51 destroyers. Production lines are active, with exceptions like the Ohio Replacement program and upgrades to existing platforms. The Navy is committed to achieving a 355-ship Navy through ongoing construction efforts. The Navy is planning to increase its fleet size by adding more submarines, carriers, and destroyers. Early conceptual work is already underway, with plans to vastly enlarge the fleet. Ingalls Shipbuilding is currently building 10 ships for Navy and Coast Guard programs and could potentially build more. This plan is part of the Navy's goal to reach a 355-ship fleet by 2021. Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., is currently building 10 ships for Navy and Coast Guard programs and has the capacity to build more as it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity. The Navy is confident that U.S. shipbuilders can meet the increased demand for a larger fleet, with shipbuilders ramping up production and making investments in infrastructure and worker training. Shipbuilders like Ingalls Shipbuilding and Austal USA are prepared to increase their capacity to meet the demand for a larger fleet. Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is currently operating at 75 percent capacity and has the ability to produce more ships in the future. Austal USA, known for building the Independence-variant littoral combat ship, is also ready to ramp up production if needed. Austal USA is prepared to increase its capacity to meet Navy demands, with the ability to adjust production between expeditionary fast transport vessels and littoral combat ships. The company aims to keep manufacturing lines active and explore building other types of vessels. Austal USA is ready to expand its capacity to meet Navy needs by potentially manufacturing smaller vessels. Shipbuilders are currently operating at 70-80% capacity, but the challenge lies in the supplier industrial base's ability to ramp up production. Rear Adm. William Gallinis emphasizes the need to invest in building up supplier capacity now. William Gallinis, program manager for program executive office ships, highlights the importance of supporting the vendor base that supplies shipyards. He suggests potentially re-sequencing funding to assist smaller companies providing power electronics and switchboards. Gallinis also mentions the need for the acquisition workforce to handle increased stress due to higher demand. Despite challenges, he believes the industrial base will adjust accordingly. John P. Casey from General Dynamics Corporation believes the shipbuilding industrial base can scale up production to achieve the 355-ship Navy goal quickly. The nuclear submarine enterprise faces the most challenges due to capacity reductions since the cancellation of the Seawolf Program in 1992, requiring a recapitalization of facilities, workforce, and supply chain. The shipyard will need to recapitalize facilities, workforce, and supply chain to support building the Columbia Class SSBN program and Virginia Class SSNs. Additional SSN procurement will require industry expansion and investment. Shipyard labor resources must be acquired and developed over time for nuclear submarine shipbuilding. The knowledge and skills needed for nuclear submarine shipbuilding are passed on to the next generation of shipbuilders. Key trades like welding, electrical work, machining, shipfitting, pipe welding, painting, and carpentry need to be expanded to meet increased demand. Shipyards have processes in place to train and develop a skilled workforce, but these need to be expanded to support the growing workload. Limiting factors such as facilities, workforce, and supply chain also affect submarine suppliers and sub-tiers in the industrial base. The submarine industrial base needs to expand its supply base to meet increased demand over the next 20 years. Currently, there are about 5,000 suppliers, with 3,000 active ones, and 80% are single or sole source. Shipyards are focusing on core work by strategically sourcing non-core products. It will take 20 years to build the 12 Columbia Class submarines starting in FY21. The shipyards are strategically sourcing non-core products to focus on core work, aiming for cost savings and increased production rates. They are relying on the supply base for structural fabrication, sheet metal, machining, electrical, and standard parts to meet the demand for submarines over the next 20 years. The supply base needs to be prepared to handle submarine-specific requirements at a higher rate and volume than currently. The supply base needs early funding for increased demand preparation, longer lead times for supplier qualification, and market principles to navigate complex demand equations across ship programs. Supplier development funding would support non-recurring efforts to place more orders in various market spaces. This includes valves, fabrication work, commodities, specialty material, and engineering components. Industry needs to invest in additional capital and capacity to support the 355-ship Navy, with a focus on the submarine enterprise. Increased demand for submarines will require scaling facility and workforce development plans to meet higher production rates. Nuclear shipyards will also need to increase material procurement to match the demand. Industry needs to invest in additional capacity to support the 355-ship Navy, particularly in the submarine enterprise. Shipyard facilities may need to source additional work in the supply base to meet increased demand. Creating more capacity in the supply base requires investment in supplier qualification, facilities, equipment, and workforce training. Positive signals of commitment from the Government, such as multi-year contracting and funding for supplier development, are essential for industry to increase investment in new capability and capacity. The Navy is encouraged to invest in facilities and workforce development, with recommended funding of $400M over three years starting in 2018 for supplier development in the Submarine Industrial Base. Other initiatives include accelerating procurement and providing government incentives for construction readiness. This testimony focuses on the Submarine Industrial Base and General Dynamics Marine Systems. The General Dynamics Marine Systems portfolio includes surface ship construction, with Bath Iron Works well positioned to support the Administration's goal of increasing the Navy fleet to 355 ships by potentially increasing DDG production to four per year. No significant capital investment is needed for facilities, but additional funding is required for training and equipment maintenance. BIW has invested significantly in training programs since 2014 to support the projected increase in resources for shipbuilding. The company's supply chain is prepared to handle an increase in procurement rate for the DDG 51 Program. A predictable Navy workload is crucial for expanding hiring and training programs. BIW has confirmed with critical suppliers their ability to support an increased procurement rate for the DDG 51 Program. The Navy is calling for three additional ESBs, and NASSCO is evaluating the possibility of increasing T-AO production to two ships per year. Funding ESB 6 in FY18 and subsequent ships in following years is crucial to avoid increased costs. NASSCO can build three more ESBs at a rate of one ship per year while also building two T-AOs per year. The proposed increase in Navy shipbuilding includes funding for additional long lead time equipment and an extra ship each year starting in FY20. NASSCO is reducing employment levels due to completing commercial programs, but the increase in shipbuilding will stabilize workload and workforce. Some investment in the NASSCO shipyard will be necessary to reach the desired production level. The recent CBO report highlighted NASSCO's ability to handle increased production, with combat logistics and support ships being the least problematic. Ingalls Shipbuilding also supports the need for increased shipbuilding. Creating a sufficient volume and early contractual authorization is crucial for growing the supplier base in Navy shipbuilding. Small businesses face challenges in qualifying as suppliers, with the process taking up to 36 months. Committing to suppliers early is essential to ensure material readiness and availability for construction schedules. The industry's ability to support an increase in shipbuilding is being questioned. The industry is assessing suppliers' capacity to meet increased shipbuilding demand, with a focus on leveraging successful platforms for faster results. The Navy's decision to use existing hull forms for new ships is commended, but commonality is also recommended for efficiency. The recommendation is to leverage existing hull forms for new ships to optimize efficiency, affordability, and capability. By offering a variant of the LPD design for the LX(R) program, significant cost savings and faster delivery can be achieved. Implementing a multi-year procurement approach could result in up to 15% material savings and over $1 billion in savings for an 11-ship LX(R) program. By expanding multi-ship procurements to other ship classes, significant cost savings can be achieved. Implementing a multi-ship procurement strategy for the Ford class ships at three-year intervals would maximize savings through economic order quantities procurement and labor efficiency. The Navy's procurement savings benefit from economic order quantities procurement for a 12-ship CVN fleet could save at least $1.5 billion. The Shipbuilders Council of America emphasizes the need for a substantial investment in procurement and readiness to increase the Navy's Fleet to 355 ships. The Shipbuilders Council of America emphasizes the need for stable and robust funding to sustain industrial capabilities supporting Navy shipbuilding and maintenance. U.S. shipyards must expand workforces and improve infrastructure to meet demand for increased vessel construction. Maintenance of current and new ships is crucial for reaching the target fleet size of a 355-ship Navy. Maintenance has been deferred in recent years, hindering progress towards this goal. The U.S. shipyard industry has the capability to build and maintain a 355-ship Navy, supporting nearly 400,000 jobs and generating billions in income and goods annually. Maintenance has been deferred due to budget cuts, hindering progress towards the target fleet size. The U.S. shipyard industry has the capability to support a 355-ship Navy, creating jobs and income. To meet the demand, workforce expansion and facility investments are needed, requiring stable budgets and procurement plans for long-term sustainability. Industry and government partnership is crucial for developing a skilled workforce through training programs. The shipbuilding industry, facing an aging workforce, aims to attract and retain skilled workers to build a robust training pipeline. Collaboration with the Navy and local resources is key. The industry is capable of building a 355-ship Navy with its skilled workforce and expertise, needing stable funding and inclusion in the national maritime strategy. Building and maintaining a 355-ship fleet requires sustained investment and partnership with the defense industrial base. Private shipyards are ready to meet this goal, creating additional jobs in the U.S. economy. A 2015 MARAD report shows that each job in the shipbuilding industry creates 2.6 additional jobs in the US economy. The Shipbuilders Council of America believes a 355-ship Navy could generate over 50,000 jobs nationwide. The shipbuilding industry may need to add 18,000 to 25,000 jobs to build a 350-ship Navy, with a potential boost of 50,000 workers including indirect jobs. Lessons learned in Navy shipbuilding emphasize getting operational requirements right at the outset and managing risk by not overextending. In shipbuilding, it is important to achieve a realistic balance between operational requirements, risks, and costs. Use competition in awarding contracts, align incentives with desired outcomes, and minimize design/construction concurrency. Properly supervise construction work and maintain a trained workforce. Properly supervise construction work, maintain trained workforce, and ensure stability in industry through multiyear procurement. Government acquisition workforce should understand what they are buying. The challenge lies in consistently adhering to these guidelines. Appendix F discusses considerations regarding warranties in shipbuilding and defense acquisition. Including a warranty in a shipbuilding contract may not always be preferable, as it depends on the circumstances of the acquisition. It is not necessarily a valid criticism to state that a contract does not include a warranty. This generally shifts the risk of fixing problems to the contractor. Including a warranty in a contract shifts the risk of fixing problems to the contractor, potentially leading to higher costs for the government. However, not including a warranty can result in visible payments for fixing issues later on. The presence of a warranty does not eliminate the government's responsibility to pay for fixing problems with earlier work. Including a warranty in a contract may lead to higher costs for the government as it shifts the risk of fixing problems to the contractor. The government may end up paying more upfront for the warranty than it would have cost to fix issues later without a warranty. The decision to include a warranty depends on the potential cost of fixing problems, the risk of issues arising, and the overall cost of the warranty itself. The goal of avoiding visible payments for fixing problems and minimizing costs are separate goals that may conflict in certain situations. The Department of Defense's guide on warranties states that while their use is not mandatory, if the benefits outweigh the costs, they should be considered. A Cost-Benefit Analysis is used to determine the value of a warranty by comparing life cycle costs with and without it. The decision to include a warranty in a contract depends on factors such as potential cost of fixing problems, risk of issues arising, and overall cost of the warranty. A Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is necessary to assess the value of a warranty by comparing the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of a system with and without the warranty. Key factors influencing the CBA results include the cost of the warranty, administration, compatibility with program efforts, overlap with Contractor support, and intangible savings. Effective warranties consider reliability, maintainability, supportability, availability, and life-cycle costs. Decision factors for evaluating warranties include technology state, warranted population size, field performance likelihood, and warranty period. Appendix G discusses considerations related to avoiding procurement cost growth versus minimizing procurement costs in shipbuilding and defense acquisition. The oversight focus on preventing cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs may not always align with minimizing procurement costs. It is important to recognize that avoiding cost growth does not always mean reducing overall procurement costs. The oversight focus on preventing cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs may not always align with minimizing procurement costs. Setting procurement cost at the maximum possible figure may avoid cost growth but could lead to higher overall costs for the government. The Navy can set a target procurement cost for a ship between Points A and D, known as Point B, to pressure industry to reduce production costs. If industry efforts are not successful, the ship's procurement cost may increase from Point B to Point C. Point C could still be lower than Point D, as it reflects cost-saving efforts by the shipbuilder. Setting the ship's cost at Point D may eliminate cost growth risk but could lead to the government paying more than necessary. DOD could prevent cost growth by setting procurement costs at Point D for new programs, but this may result in missed cost-saving opportunities. There is a potential risk of leaving money on the table by budgeting for acquisition programs at an 80% confidence factor. Procurement cost growth can damage credibility and disrupt budgeting, leading to the goal of minimizing cost growth. DOD's efforts to pressure industry for lower costs may contribute to cost growth, despite potential success. A focus on avoiding cost growth is important, but punishing may not always be the solution. The focus on avoiding or minimizing cost growth in DOD procurement is important, but punishing DOD for all instances of cost growth may not be effective. Lower initial cost targets can pressure industry, but some cost growth may be expected in minimizing procurement costs. The goal is to seek lower cost growth while recognizing that some amount of cost growth may be necessary for optimal government strategy. Recognizing the tension between seeking lower cost growth and minimizing procurement cost can lead to a balanced approach. A singular focus on avoiding cost growth may end up costing the government more. The size of the Navy has varied over time, with different counting rules affecting the total number of ships since FY1948. The Navy's battle force ships counting method established in the 1980s showed a peak of 568 ships in FY1987, declining to 289 ships by April 2019. Historical fleet size figures may not accurately reflect future Navy proposals due to changing missions, ship mix, and technologies. The total number of ships in the Navy may not accurately reflect the fleet's ability to perform its missions over time due to changing mission requirements and ship capabilities. An increasing or decreasing number of ships does not necessarily indicate a corresponding increase or decrease in the fleet's ability to carry out its stated missions. The Navy's total ship numbers may not fully represent its mission capabilities due to evolving mission requirements and ship capabilities. Shipbuilding rates from FY1982-FY2019 and projected rates from FY2020-FY2024 are shown in Table H-2 for Navy ship procurement."
