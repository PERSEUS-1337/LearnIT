    "content": "The \"Trade and Environment Enforcement Act\" is also known as the \"Green 301\" Act. It identifies foreign country trade practices that have a negative impact on the environment. This amendment is added to Chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Representative must identify foreign country trade practices causing negative environmental impacts on human, animal, or plant life, or natural resource conservation. Factors considered include the connection between trade and environmental impact, and the significance of the impact on protection and conservation. The Trade Representative must consult with interested parties to identify foreign country trade practices causing negative environmental impacts. A report must be submitted to the Committee on Ways and Means within 270 days of the initial report submission. The Trade Representative must submit a report to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Finance on foreign country trade practices that negatively affect the environment. The report may also include descriptions of other trade practices that could be included in the future. The Trade Representative can receive petitions from interested parties requesting action be taken against foreign country trade practices that harm the environment. The Trade Representative must review these petitions within 45 days and decide on further actions. The Trade Representative receives petitions and decides whether to initiate consultations regarding the allegations. If consultations are not initiated, the reasons are provided to the petitioner and published in the Federal Register. Consultations with foreign governments must be requested within 3 weeks of submitting the required report to congressional committees or upon accepting a petition. The Trade Representative requests consultations with foreign countries identified in petitions to address trade practices. Agreements are sought to mitigate negative environmental impacts, and if no agreement is reached, the Trade Representative takes further action. The Trade Representative is authorized to take action to address negative environmental impacts resulting from trade practices of foreign countries. This includes actions under section 301(c) of the Act and other directives from the President. The term 'foreign country trade practice' is defined in this section. The term 'foreign country trade practice' refers to any act, policy, or practice of a foreign country related to trade, excluding acts reflecting prosecutorial discretion or environmental enforcement resource allocation decisions. This definition is included in the Trade Act of 1974. Sec. 311 of the Trade Act of 1974 identifies countries engaging in trade practices that harm the environment."
