    "content": "There is no information provided in the curr_chunk to summarize. The State Administrator shall establish a Problem Resolution Office with officers authorized to investigate taxpayer complaints and halt collection activities if deemed non-compliant with the law. Only the highest official or General Counsel of the relevant taxing authority can reverse such injunctions based on clear evidence. Officers cannot be penalized unless issuing manifestly unreasonable injunctions. The State Administrator can establish a Problem Resolution Office to investigate taxpayer complaints and stop collection activities if found to be non-compliant with the law. The authority of the State Administrators and taxpayers to pursue legal remedies in court is not limited. SEC. 53. JURISDICTION AND INTERSTATE ALLOCATION. The text chunk discusses the allocation of revenue between states based on the destination of taxable property or services. It establishes a Federal Office of Revenue Allocation to resolve disputes among states regarding revenue allocation. The Administrator's determination can be reviewed in federal court under an abuse of discretion standard. The destination of taxable property or services determines revenue allocation between states. Tangible personal property's destination is where it was first delivered, while real property's destination is where it is located. Other property's destination is the purchaser's residence. Services' destination is where they are used, consumed, or enjoyed. Review of disputes is under abuse of discretion standard in federal court. Allocation of service invoices across jurisdictions is based on time. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. Domestic transportation services are allocated based on the final destination of the trip. International transportation services are allocated based on the final destination or origin. For transportation services with the final destination or origin outside the United States, 50 percent of the service amount is attributed to the US destination or origin. Financial intermediation services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. State Tax Administrators have jurisdiction over gross payments with a destination within their state. Rents and royalties for tangible property leases are allocated based on the property's location. The destination of rent and lease payments for vehicles depends on the term length: for rentals/leases of one month or less, it's where the vehicle was delivered, and for longer terms, it's the lessee's residence. SEC. 54. Tax to be stated and charged separately. For each purchase subject to sales tax, the vendor must separately charge the tax from the purchase price and provide a receipt to the purchaser with specific details including price before tax, tax amount, total price with tax, tax rate, sale date, vendor name, and registration number. The vending machine exception exempts vending machines from the sales tax requirements. Vending machines must dispense taxable items for coins or bills up to twenty dollars and cannot sell items over ten dollars each. The State Administrator or Secretary can enter installment agreements with taxpayers to pay taxes in installments to facilitate collection. The agreement remains valid unless inaccurate information is provided. The Secretary and State Administrator have the authority to compromise on alleged amounts due. SEC. 56. ACCOUNTING.\n\nVendors and other persons must remit taxes and report transactions based on when payment is received or when the tax becomes due. An election can be made to use the accrual method for reporting transactions. For bad debts under the accrual method, refer to section 11(g).\n\nSEC. 57. HOBBY ACTIVITIES. SEC. 57. HOBBY ACTIVITIES. The exemption for non-profit trade or business is not available for taxable property or services. If gross payments exceed certain criteria in 2 or more of the last 4 years, the business is deemed for profit. The Internal Revenue Service appropriations do not cover expenses for processing income tax returns before the income tax repeal. New subsections establish Excise and Sales Tax Bureaus within the Department of Treasury to administer relevant taxes. The Office of Revenue Allocation shall be within the Sales Tax Bureau. The Secretary of the Treasury may appoint up to 5 Assistant General Counsels. Modifications to federal income tax for taxable years ending June 30, 2003 are outlined. For fiscal year taxpayers, the dollar figures in section 1 and section 11 are adjusted based on the taxpayer's taxable year ending June 30, 2003. The Secretary is required to publish tax rate schedules accordingly. Starting January 1, 2003, the Social Security Administration will collect payroll taxes under the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7 of the Act covers revised rules for self-employment tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define self-employment income as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases, wages paid, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten years starting in 2003 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 2002. The unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 2002, is divided by ten. This amount relates to prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 2003, and inventory held at the end of 2002. Conforming amendments are made to subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), with subsections 1402(d) et seq. being renumbered as subsections 1402(b) et seq. SEC. 8. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS INDEXED ON SALES TAX INCLUSIVE BASIS. The Consumer Price Index for Social Security benefits is amended to include the national sales tax paid. The term 'CPI increase percentage' in any calendar year is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index and the national sales tax factor. The national sales tax factor is determined by the sales tax rate divided by one. The curr_chunk states a calculation formula involving the sales tax rate and a specific quantity. SEC. 9. COMPENSATING PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN PERSONS ON FIXED INCOME. Compensating Payment: Eligible persons receive a compensating payment if they comply with the requirements. The payment is calculated based on the qualified fixed income payment amount and the excess inflation rate. An eligible person is someone who receives Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. A qualified fixed income payment is received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan. Payments under annuity contracts or defined benefit plans may not qualify as fixed income payments if they vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation. Additionally, payments under annuity contracts entered into after June 30, 2003, or to beneficiaries who were participants in a defined benefit plan for less than 5 years, are not considered qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is \\1/12\\ of qualified fixed income payments that an eligible person is entitled to receive during the subsequent calendar year, not exceeding $5,000. The excess inflation rate is the difference between the consumer price index (all urban) during an 18-month period ending December 31, 2004, and the projected increase in the consumer price index (all urban) reported in the Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year 2003. An application is required to receive compensating payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requires an application for compensating payments, with documentation as needed. Payments will be received with Social Security benefits, funded from the general fund. Insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors may need to provide information for determining qualified fixed income payment amounts. SEC. 10. INTEREST. Amends section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code by adjusting interest rates.\n\nSEC. 11. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIRED TO RAISE RATE. Prohibits any bill that increases federal sales tax rate and reduces federal revenues without a two-thirds majority vote in the House of Representatives or the Senate."
