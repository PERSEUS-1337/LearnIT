    "content": "Members of Congress have embraced new communication tools, such as radio and television broadcasts, to inform constituents and facilitate better information within Congress. Despite initial reservations and technical challenges, live video broadcasts were eventually adopted in the mid-20th century. Regular coverage of the House floor began in 1977 and the Senate floor in 1986, with C-SPAN broadcasting congressional video independently from Congress. C-SPAN operates three channels for House proceedings, Senate proceedings, and additional programming. Congressionally produced video feeds are available for free to accredited news organizations. The House and Senate began streaming their floor video feeds directly to the public over the Internet in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Committees also provide Internet video broadcasts of their open proceedings, and technological advancements may challenge their control over video coverage. Prior to the 1979 House and 1986 Senate decisions to broadcast proceedings, television cameras rarely covered floor proceedings in either chamber. In 1947, the House allowed television cameras to broadcast portions of the opening session of the 80th Congress, but no other. The report also discusses the administration of video coverage within Congress, rules, regulations, and authorities affecting video recording and broadcasting for House and Senate committees and floor proceedings, as well as recent challenges posed by smartphone and wireless broadcasting technologies. The 80th Congress allowed television cameras to broadcast parts of the opening session, and the State of the Union address was first televised in 1947. Committee hearings were occasionally broadcast before regular sessions, with the Senate Armed Services Committee being the first to do so in 1948. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 formalized the practice of allowing House and Senate committees to film hearings. Before this legislation, there was debate over who had authority over committee broadcasts. The Joint Committee on Congressional Operations expressed concern in 1974 about the lack of public information on how Congress worked and considered ways to improve mass communication. The Joint Committee on Congressional Operations recommended that the House and Senate provide radio and television coverage of their proceedings, utilizing new cable and satellite technologies to have designated channels for full coverage. The House already offers live or recorded video footage of floor proceedings and committee meetings for media outlets and the public to access. Regulations for these videos are outlined in the Rules of the House of Representatives. Media outlets seeking access to House proceedings or House-provided video footage must be accredited by the House Radio and Television Correspondents' Gallery. Approved outlets can show portions of proceedings or broadcast congressional proceedings in their entirety. Committees may have additional rules for videos of their hearings. The Speaker of the House oversees video coverage of House floor proceedings, with responsibilities delegated to other House offices. The House Recording Studio operates video equipment for filming, and the Clerk of the House maintains online video services. Section 116(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 allows House committees to permit photographic coverage. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 allowed House committees to permit photographic, radio, and television coverage of their proceedings, with guidelines to maintain dignity and decorum. Videos can only be used for educational or informational purposes, not for partisan campaigns. Committees can set individual rules for video coverage, typically allowing coverage if proceedings are open to the public. Some committees have detailed rules on the number of journalists allowed and camera positions. The advancement in digital video equipment and the internet has made it easier and cheaper for House committees to create, broadcast, and archive videos. Many committees now broadcast live proceedings on their websites and post videos on YouTube. While most committees post videos online, formal rules for Internet video broadcasting and archiving have not been widely adopted. The House committees utilize digital video equipment and the internet to create, broadcast, and archive videos. In the 1970s, concerns arose about televising House proceedings, leading to the decision to control video production internally but rely on private TV stations for distribution. The House's exclusive control raised worries about censorship, but the internet allowed for easy and inexpensive video distribution. In 2011, the House decided to supplement its video distribution methods. In 2011, the House expanded video distribution by providing access through its website. H.Res. 866 established a closed-circuit video system for broadcasting floor proceedings in the Capitol and House office buildings. The Speaker set up the system and the Committee on Rules studied alternative methods for video coverage. Provisions from H.Res. 866 were later incorporated into the House Rules for video coverage. The House Rules established in H.Res. 866 during the 96th Congress ensured that House video footage would be complete, unedited, and available to accredited media outlets. The footage could be used for news or public affairs programs but not for commercial or political purposes. The Rules Committee recommended the House operate its own television system for broadcasting floor proceedings, using House funds for cameras controlled by the House. The House Rules established in H.Res. 866 during the 96th Congress ensured that House video footage would be complete, unedited, and available to accredited media outlets for news or public affairs programs. House funds could be used for broadcasting floor proceedings if the cameras were controlled and operated by House employees. The first live broadcast from the House floor was a speech by Representative Al Gore on March 19, 1979, aired on C-SPAN and local public broadcasting. C-SPAN's commitment to cover House floor proceedings in their entirety allowed broadcasts to reach interested audiences without scheduling challenges or ratings pressures. Authority to administer House floor broadcasts remains with the Speaker of the House under House Rule V, with occasional directions modifying floor television coverage. In 1984, the Speaker directed the Clerk of the House to provide a caption during special-order speeches and implement wide-angle camera shots. In 2010, HouseLive was launched for live Internet streaming of House floor video feed, allowing users to access archived videos and download recordings. Senate floor proceedings and committee meetings are available for broadcast media outlets accredited by the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents' Gallery. C-SPAN 2 broadcasts live Senate floor proceedings voluntarily. The Senate allows live broadcasting of floor proceedings and committee meetings, with committees having the authority to permit video coverage. Broadcasting of Senate committee hearings was authorized by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. The Senate committees may adopt additional rules for video coverage, with records of open proceedings required to be made public online within 21 days. In the 115th Congress, all standing committees embedded videos of public hearings on their websites. In the early 1980s, there were discussions about broadcasting Senate floor proceedings, with concerns about potential impacts on efficiency and traditions. Some Senators were concerned about the impact television might have on the Senate, affecting its efficiency, traditions, institutional role, and public reputation. Proposals to televise the Senate floor were accompanied by procedural rule changes to address these concerns. Senators feared televised proceedings could make the Senate less efficient and compromise the institution's reputation by exposing unpopular decisions made for the nation's longer-term interests. The Senate agreed to S. Res. 28 on February 27, 1986, initiating a two-month test period for radio and television broadcasts from the Senate floor. This resolution also included procedural rule changes to streamline floor proceedings, such as reducing the time for committee reports to be available and the consideration time after cloture. These changes aimed to balance the Senate's tradition of deliberation with the need to efficiently conduct its work. The Architect of the Capitol, in consultation with the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, would set up broadcast facilities for Senate floor proceedings. The Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper would employ staff to operate the equipment, with funding from the Senate's contingent fund. Video feed access was provided to accredited members of the Senate Radio and Television Correspondents Gallery and authorized news or educational entities. C-SPAN 2 pledged to cover Senate proceedings, with no formal agreement with the Senate. S.Res. 444 allowed video broadcasts to continue, following rules in the Standing Orders of the Senate. Cameras film floor proceedings, focusing on speakers and showing the chamber during roll call votes. Recorded footage can be used for informational or educational purposes, not political ones. The Senate Recording Studio, under the direction of the Sergeant at Arms and the Committee on Rules and Administration, administers video recording for informational or educational purposes, not political ones. The Senate has provided live floor webcasts since January 2012 and allows accredited media outlets like C-SPAN 2 to carry proceedings. C-SPAN became the primary way most people watch House and Senate proceedings. C-SPAN, owned by the National Cable Satellite Corporation, started in 1979 to broadcast live House proceedings. Founder Brian Lamb aimed to enhance public affairs coverage on TV using cable and satellite tech. Lamb discussed his plans with House members in 1977-1978 to create a network for House proceedings. No formal contract or financial agreement was made, but C-SPAN became synonymous with congressional television. C-SPAN, founded in 1979 by Brian Lamb, broadcasts live House proceedings. The network is funded by donations from the cable and satellite industries and operates independently. The House owns its recording equipment and C-SPAN voluntarily distributes its video feed. In 1986, the Senate began televising its proceedings on C-SPAN 2, which operates similarly to C-SPAN. C-SPAN 3 was created in 2001. C-SPAN 2 relies on cable license fees to operate and was created in 2001 to show additional programming. C-SPAN subscribers can also stream the television stations online. C-SPAN launched a radio station in 1997. Challenges have arisen due to separate administration of the network and congressional video feed, particularly in video ownership and camera control. C-SPAN, a public affairs programming network, faced copyright issues in the past, including a dispute with the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Broadcasting in 1981 and a cease-and-desist notification in 2007. They revised their copyright policy to allow noncommercial use of their videos online. Requests to use their own cameras for floor proceedings are regularly denied by the House and Senate. C-SPAN, a public affairs programming network, faces challenges in reaching a wider audience due to its cable television channels' limited reach. Americans without cable subscriptions or access to C-SPAN online may not be able to watch its content. The rise of wireless networks and video-hosting websites has changed the media landscape, making it easier to produce and distribute video content to a broader audience. This poses challenges to the House and Senate's traditions of controlling video feeds. The House and Senate have rules against filming inside their chambers, but it is difficult to fully enforce. During a sit-in on the House floor in June 2016, Members used smartphones to broadcast live on social media when the House went into recess. C-SPAN and other networks aired the Members' videos since the official House cameras were turned off. This event raised concerns about video coverage of congressional proceedings. Under current rules, the House and Senate control floor video coverage, with the House allowing filming suspension by the Speaker. Some suggest alternative ways for real-time information, like letting press record. Concerns about decorum are raised. Rules only allow coverage when chambers are in session, but the sit-in showed newsworthy events can occur during recess. The use of cell phones for recording during such events is also a concern. The use of cell phones for recording in the House and Senate chambers challenges the traditional control of video by the chambers themselves. Rules prohibit cell phones in the galleries and restrict their use on the floor. In the House, mobile devices that disrupt decorum are banned, and no photography, audio, or video recording is allowed. The Senate allows electronic devices only if deemed necessary for official business and not disruptive. Members involved in the June 2016 sit-in were not cited with infractions of House rules, despite being asked to stop taking photos and filming video. House leaders discussed disciplining participants, and a resolution was introduced to allow independent TV cameras to broadcast House proceedings. H.Res. 804 allowed accredited press members to record and broadcast when a Member is present on the House floor, even when not in session. H.Res. 5 established rules for the 115th Congress, including penalties for Members disrupting decorum with photography or recording. House Rule XVII, clause 5 prohibits mobile devices that impair decorum, and H.Res. 5 added language to Rule II, clause 3 authorizing certain recordings. Under H.Res. 5, fines can be imposed on Members for using electronic devices in the House chamber for unauthorized recordings. The fine for a first offense is $500, and subsequent violations incur a $2,500 fine. Members can appeal to the Ethics Committee within a specified timeframe. Supporters argue that this measure helps maintain a conducive environment for legislative debate. The House rule change aims to maintain a conducive environment for legislative debate by discouraging disruptive behavior. It allows for fines to be imposed on Members for disorderly conduct, with an appeal process to the Ethics Committee. Opponents argue that penalties should be decided by the full House, not delegated to administrative officers. The House and Senate implemented video broadcasts of their proceedings after considering the impact of cameras on policymaking and legislative behavior. The cameras have operated without controversy, providing valuable public information about Congress and facilitating communication within Congress. The House and Senate embraced Internet broadcasts to expand access to video coverage, adapting to a new informational environment. They historically sought control over recorded footage, facing challenges with television bandwidth. Technological advancements enabled specialized stations like C-SPAN, meeting the need for audience commitment. The House and Senate have a long-standing partnership with C-SPAN for video coverage, without any formal agreements. The rise of cell phone videos poses new challenges to congressional video coverage, as rules allow members to use devices for productivity and safety. Alternative broadcasting methods may fill gaps in official coverage. Alternative broadcasting methods, such as video footage produced by anyone, could help Congress keep the public informed. The House and Senate may need to address rules on technology use and video coverage as technology advances."
