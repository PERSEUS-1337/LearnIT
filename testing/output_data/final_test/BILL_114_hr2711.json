    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2015\". Congress finds that the final rule implementing the ACA no longer verifies eligibility for premium tax credits, relying instead on self-attestation and sample audits. The Department of Health and Human Services announced a change in policy to extend the sample population to 100 percent for the $1 trillion entitlement program, but this change was never implemented in the final rule. Failure to verify eligibility for Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions could result in approximately $250 billion in fraudulent payments. The House of Representatives passed legislation, H.R. 2775, the No Subsidies Without Verification Act, with bipartisan support to ensure verification of eligibility for Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions before issuance. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2775 with bipartisan support by a 235 to 191 vote margin. The Obama Administration opposed the bill, stating it was unnecessary as an effective system for verification of eligibility for premium tax credits was already in place. The Senate later removed the bill on October 16, 2013. On October 16, 2013, the Senate replaced the verification mechanism of H.R. 2775 with a requirement for a report to Congress by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by January 1, 2014. The Department of Health and Human Services submitted a report to Congress on January 1, 2014, regarding the verification of household income and qualifications for affordable care programs. Beginning in 2014, Federal subsidies have been available to help individuals purchase health insurance through an Exchange via premium tax credits and cost-sharing. The Exchange verifies information provided by consumers on the application to determine eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan (QHP), APTC under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code, and CSRs under section 1402 of the ACA. Various processes have been implemented by the Exchanges to verify applicant information as required by statute and regulations. The Department of Health and Human Services delayed income verification systems in 2014 to boost health care plan sign-ups on healthcare.gov. Internal parts of the website are unfinished, leading to a lack of verification. This has created a new program that risks fraudulent subsidy claims, putting taxpayers at financial risk. Delaying ACA premium and cost-sharing subsidies until eligibility verification process is complete. The premium tax credit or reduced cost-sharing cannot be claimed until the verification process for household income and coverage requirements is completed according to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The verification process for an individual's information under the Affordable Care Act must be completed before a penalty can be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. No penalty will be imposed if a premium tax credit is being claimed for the individual and the verification process is not yet completed. The process described in subsection (a) must be completed for an individual's claim. The provisions of this section apply to coverage months after the enactment of this Act. Individuals currently receiving subsidies may have certain subsidies suspended if claimed before the enactment of this Act. The Act suspends allowances for individuals receiving subsidies until the coverage month described in subsection (a). The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 45-day special enrollment period for individuals to enroll in qualified health plans after completing the verification process. Individuals enrolled in a qualified health plan before the enactment of the Act, subject to suspension, and who terminated enrollment during the suspension period are eligible for special enrollment. Individuals who terminated enrollment in a qualified health plan during a suspension period are eligible for special enrollment if they seek to re-enroll after completing the verification process."
