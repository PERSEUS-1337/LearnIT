    "content": "The House can easily establish an ad hoc select committee to address issues involving multiple standing committees or matters not yet considered. This committee can be created through a simple resolution or included in other resolutions. It may be tasked with making legislative recommendations or granted authority to propose legislation directly to the House. If authorized to propose legislation, the select committee can bypass standing committees or refer the legislation to them for review. The House can establish select committees with legislative authority by referring matters to special ad hoc committees appointed by the Speaker for consideration and reporting. House Rule XII outlines procedures for creating and assigning Members to select committees with legislative authority, dating back to the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974. House Rule XII allows the Speaker to refer matters to a special committee for consideration and reporting to the House. The only change from the original language is regarding membership, specifying inclusion of members from committees of jurisdiction. Additionally, House Rule I grants the Speaker appointment power for select committees. The Speaker's authority to appoint members of select committees has been in House rules since 1880, with the ability to add or remove members added in the 103rd Congress. The minority leader typically proposes names of minority-party members for select committees. The Committee Reform Amendments introduced changes to the referral system, allowing for multiple referrals and giving the Speaker more options for referrals. The rules change introduced three forms of multiple referral: joint referral to more than one committee, sequential referral to one committee and then to another, and split referral of specific parts to different committees. The House introduced three forms of multiple referral: joint referral to multiple committees, sequential referral to one committee and then another, and split referral of specific parts to different committees. In the 104th Congress, the rules were changed to direct the Speaker to designate a primary jurisdiction committee when a measure was referred to more than one committee. Additional initial referral to second or other committees was also allowed. In the 108th Congress, the Speaker could choose not to assign a primary committee in cases where multiple committees were needed for review. Select committees were sometimes created to address specific, complex issues when jurisdiction was fragmented among standing committees. This approach was seen as more efficient and expedient for addressing such matters. Leaders and issue proponents may see advantages in using a select committee for efficiency and expeditiousness. The Speaker chooses committee members, making a select committee more responsive to majority leadership. It also creates additional committee slots for positions like chair and ranking minority member. Some believe previous committee leadership experience is necessary for these roles. The creation of a select committee can help expedite the legislative process by allowing the Speaker to choose members and create additional committee slots. However, there may be controversy over membership decisions, such as whether to include representation solely from standing committees with jurisdiction or from affected committees. The final authority to make appointments rests with the Speaker, but there are disadvantages to creating a select committee, such as potential duplication of efforts and intrusion on standing committees' jurisdictional prerogatives. Select committees, while providing additional opportunities for Representatives, can create tension in the legislative process. Despite proposals in each Congress, the House has been hesitant to create new select committees. In the 103rd Congress, four long-existing select committees were discontinued. There have been attempts in both the House and Senate to abolish existing joint committees. Since 1974, four ad hoc select committees with legislative authority have been created, including the Ad Hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf, Ad Hoc Select Committee on Energy, Select Committee on Homeland Security, and Select Committee on Homeland Security. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is not included in this analysis. The report is divided into three parts: creation and organization of the select committees, analysis of similarities and differences, and conclusions on why the House might choose to employ select committees. The final part of conclusions discusses the reasons for creating select committees in the House, focusing on solving jurisdictional problems. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress was created as a transition committee for homeland security. Members of standing committees held most seats on the Outer Continental Shelf select committee. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress was created as a transition committee for homeland security. Members of standing committees held most seats on the Outer Continental Shelf select committee, while the Energy select committee had a more influential role in legislation. The relationship between select committees and standing committees varied in terms of independence and influence. The Energy select committee played a significant role in congressional action on outer continental shelf legislation, prompted by events such as the 1969 oil spill in California and the Arab oil embargo of 1973. A bill was passed in the Senate to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, leading to the creation of a select committee in the House to ensure prompt action. In the 94th Congress, the select committee reported legislation that passed the House, but action ended when a conference report was recommitted. In the 95th Congress, a bill was reported and enacted into law by the Ad Hoc Select Committee on the Outer Continental Shelf. The select committee was designated to work on a specific bill and related matters within its jurisdiction. It had until January 31, 1976, to complete its work, with its expiration tied to the legislative process. The committee could utilize staff from the standing committees of its members, and additional resources were later authorized. The select committee was created to address jurisdictional issues related to oil and gas reserves in the Outer Continental Shelf. Representative John M. Murphy advocated for its establishment to prevent overlapping jurisdictions among multiple committees. The select committee, comprised of members from three committees with jurisdiction in the area, faced challenges in reporting a bill in the 94th Congress. Despite deadline extensions, the bill passed the House but was recommitted to conference, ending action in that Congress. The committee was reauthorized in the 95th Congress and successfully reported and enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The select committee, established in the 95th Congress, had 19 members appointed by the Speaker to ensure party representation. Members were chosen from various committees to expedite legislation consideration. In the 95th Congress, a select committee was established with 19 members from different committees to expedite legislation consideration. National concern over energy costs in the 1970s exceeded today's concern over healthcare. President Jimmy Carter set a 90-day deadline to submit comprehensive energy legislation to Congress, which was met. President Carter set a 90-day deadline for energy legislation, which was met. However, the 95th Congress ended up spending its whole session working on the remnants of the original proposal. President Carter made several nationally broadcast addresses and submitted energy legislation to Congress. The House established an Ad Hoc Committee on Energy in anticipation of the legislation. The day after President Carter's address to Congress, an ad hoc committee of 37 members was authorized to consider and report on comprehensive energy legislation. The Speaker could select members from various committees to ensure prompt action. The ad hoc committee of 37 members was authorized to consider comprehensive energy legislation, with the Speaker selecting members from various committees to ensure prompt action. The committee was allowed to use staff from standing committees and terminated upon completion of the legislative process. Majority Leader Jim Wright emphasized the need for the committee to provide a comprehensive overview and facilitate the House in achieving a comprehensive energy policy. The ad hoc committee, appointed by the Speaker, would work on specific legislative recommendations for the energy plan. The committee would hold hearings and make recommendations, with the legislation then referred to standing committees for further review and markup. Ultimately, a rule would be sought for the entire program. The ad hoc committee appointed by the Speaker would work on legislative recommendations for the energy plan. A rule would be sought for the entire program, allowing the House to consider the energy problem as one composite issue while preserving the jurisdiction of Standing Committees. The resolution specified the select committee's jurisdiction over a presidential message, with flexibility for the Speaker to refer related matters sequentially. The majority leader explained that legislation related to President Carter's energy message would be referred to the select committee. Representative John D. Dingell outlined the procedures for the select committee's operation, stating that general hearings would be held on the message, but the legislation would be handled by standing committees. The Speaker's letter outlines the process for handling legislation related to President Carter's energy message. Standing committees will work on the bill and report it to an ad hoc committee, which can recommend amendments for consideration on the floor. Each standing committee will manage the parts of the bill within their jurisdiction on the floor, and in conference, representatives will settle differences. Minority Leader John J. Rhodes supported the creation of the select committee for President Carter's energy legislation. He emphasized appointing members who support legislation and facilitating the committee's work. President Carter's energy legislation was introduced as H.R. 6831 by Majority Leader Wright and referred to five committees by the Speaker on May 2. Leader Wright introduced President Carter's energy legislation as H.R. 6831 and referred it to five committees on May 2. The committees established a reporting deadline of July 13. The Banking Committee was discharged on the same day, reporting a freestanding bill (H.R. 7893). Ad Hoc Energy Committee Chair Thomas L. \"Lud\" Ashley introduced a bill (H.R. 8444) on July 20, incorporating recommended changes. The bill was referred to a select committee with a reporting deadline of July 27, which reported the bill. The select committee did not take high-profile public action during the period between receiving the President's legislation and the standing committees' reporting. During the consideration of H.R. 8444, the select committee quickly approved Democratic amendments while rejecting GOP proposals, maintaining a strong majority to support President Carter's energy program. Private caucuses were held before each meeting to coordinate on specific amendments, resulting in a pattern of easily approved agreed-upon amendments and rejected ones, mostly along party lines. The House easily approved Democratic amendments and rejected GOP proposals during the consideration of H.R. 8444, leading to howls of protest from Republicans. The Senate split its energy legislation into five bills, with the Carter energy proposals finally being adopted after 18 months on October 15, 1978. H.Res. 508 authorized a select committee of 37 members, with the majority party gaining 25 seats and the minority 12 seats. Subsequently, H.Res. 509 increased the select committee's size to 40 members, with the majority now at 27 and the minority at 13. The Speaker was tasked with appointing members from relevant House committees. In the 107th Congress, the Select Committee on Homeland Security had responsibilities similar to the Ad Hoc Committee on Energy but operated more independently from standing committees. The bill to create a Department of Homeland Security was referred to 12 committees, but the select committee developed and reported the legislation called up in the House. President George W. Bush proposed the creation of a Department of Homeland Security in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The House established a Select Committee on Homeland Security to facilitate the consideration of wide-ranging legislation at the committee level. The Select Committee on Homeland Security was given jurisdiction to develop recommendations and report to the House on matters related to the establishment of a department of homeland security. Standing committees could submit recommendations on bills proposing the department to the select committee, which would then report its recommendations to the House. The House established a select committee under a resolution to oversee the creation of a department of homeland security. The Speaker had the authority to determine the committee's jurisdiction and appoint nine members, including four recommended by the Minority Leader. The select committee could utilize House staff services and would dissolve after the final decision on the bill. The resolution did not change any standing committee's jurisdiction. The resolution establishes a select committee to oversee the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, allowing for a bipartisan and efficient legislative process. It serves as a clearinghouse for ideas, resolves jurisdictional disputes, and compiles a final package, similar to past initiatives addressing crises. The select committee will operate as a conference committee for relevant committees, ensuring every committee has a voice. Regular order will be applied, complying with all House rules. It is limited to considering legislation for a Homeland Security Department and will dissolve once its duty is completed. The membership will consist of elected leaders from both sides of the aisle. Majority Leader Dick Armey introduced H.R. 5005 on June 24, 2002, referred to the select committee and other relevant committees. The select committee, comprised of members from various committees, was tasked with considering legislation for a Homeland Security Department. Majority Leader Dick Armey introduced H.R. 5005, which was referred to multiple committees. The bill was reported by most committees on July 12, with the select committee making amendments on July 24 after holding hearings. The Select Committee on Homeland Security approved a bill closely aligned with the White House plan on July 19, with a 5-4 party-line vote. The House passed the bill on July 26, and final congressional action was completed on November 22. The House approved a Senate amendment to H.R. 5005, forming a panel with nine members. Majority Leader Armey was appointed chair. Congress included a provision in the Homeland Security Act for each House to review its committee structure. The House responded by creating a Select Committee on Homeland Security with legislative jurisdiction over the Act and study jurisdiction over House rules related to homeland security. The House established a Select Committee on Homeland Security for the 108th Congress with legislative jurisdiction over the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and oversight of homeland security laws and programs. The committee was also tasked with studying the House rules related to homeland security and how the House could organize itself in the future on this issue. The Select Committee on Homeland Security for the 108th Congress was tasked with studying the House rules related to homeland security and submitting recommendations for any changes by September 30, 2004. The committee's jurisdiction focused on specific public law related to homeland security, without changing the jurisdictions of standing committees. The committee had a two-year lifespan but no deadlines for matters referred to it. The Select Committee on Homeland Security was authorized to use House staff and appoint members, including those recommended by the Minority Leader. Speaker Hastert explained the committee's role in overseeing the creation of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure Congress's will is carried out. The Select Committee on Homeland Security will oversee the reorganization of the executive branch. It will work alongside standing House committees with authorization and oversight responsibilities. This committee is crucial for adapting to the largest reorganization in 50 years. In the 108th Congress, measures related to homeland security were referred to the Select Committee on Homeland Security, which considered all seven measures referred to it. The Select Committee on Homeland Security, comprised of 50 Members, analyzed various aspects including legislative authority, jurisdiction, reporting deadlines, membership, resources, and post-passage considerations of legislation. The committee works alongside standing House committees for oversight responsibilities in the largest reorganization in 50 years. Table 1 summarizes key factual aspects about select committees created since 1974, focusing on ad hoc committees with legislative authority. The justification for creating these committees was to centralize decision-making in certain instances, as outlined in H.Res. 988 in the 93rd Congress. The House supported the creation of ad hoc select committees through H.Res. 988 to avoid jurisdictional issues and streamline legislation production. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee was established to prevent competing measures from different committees. Representative Murphy highlighted the need for centralized decision-making due to overlapping jurisdictions. The House felt unable to act quickly through standing committees when the Senate had already passed related legislation. In the 93rd and 94th Congress, bills were passed to create select committees for energy policy. Speaker O'Neill advocated for a standing energy committee but settled for an ad hoc committee. In the 107th Congress, the creation of the Homeland Security select committee was compared to the Energy select committee in the 95th Congress. David Dreier compared the establishment of a select committee for the President's initiative to the Energy select committee of the 95th Congress. He emphasized the importance of efficiency and a sense of urgency in the legislative process. The select committee will act as a conference committee for all relevant committees, ensuring every committee has a voice and avoiding delays caused by overlapping jurisdictional issues. The House has historically used ad hoc select committees in instances where jurisdiction was spread too widely among committees, seeing them as a solution to potential inefficiency and delays. The House established a select committee to mediate among committees and prevent competing measures due to vested interests. Ad hoc select committees are seen as overcoming customary understandings and developing legislation for strategic policy goals. The Select Committee on Homeland Security (108th Congress) was created to provide oversight of the newly formed Department of Homeland Security and to consider legislation from a homeland security policy perspective. Speaker Hastert described it as a transitional entity to monitor the organization of the department. The House will establish a select committee to oversee the reorganization of the executive branch. This committee will serve a specific purpose temporarily and have carefully defined jurisdiction. The House used various methods to establish the jurisdiction of ad hoc select committees, such as specific bill numbers or presidential messages. The use of a specific bill number to set jurisdiction for a select committee gives the majority control over its work, allowing for predictable legislative outcomes while protecting standing committees' jurisdiction. The bill can be drafted to reflect the majority's desired policy outcome or as a bipartisan bill to involve both majority and minority stakeholders. This approach can anticipate Senate action and presidential positions. The House could anticipate Senate action and presidential positions by establishing jurisdiction through a presidential message, which could determine the scope of a select committee's work and legislation development. Coordination between the President and Congress, or the President's party in Congress, could result in a message of appropriate scope, even if there are policy differences. Alternatively, the House could wait for the presidential message before creating an ad hoc select committee. The Speaker could define a select committee's jurisdiction based on subject matter, allowing flexibility in referring measures or presidential messages. Recommendations from standing committees could also be considered in developing legislation. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress had broad jurisdiction related to the Homeland Security Act, allowing it to report on any homeland security legislation referred to it throughout the two-year Congress. It was to be treated similarly to standing committees under House rules. The Speaker's referral authority for select committees in the House rules appeared more discretionary than for standing committees. The language of the resolution creating select committees maximized the Speaker's discretion within the committee's jurisdictional statement. The Speaker could refer legislation to select committees beyond their intended purpose, with wording varying in each case. The Speaker's discretion in referring legislation to select committees was more flexible compared to standing committees. The resolution creating the Outer Continental Shelf select committee specified the Speaker's discretion with reference to three committees, while the Energy select committee allowed sequential referrals of certain measures. The Speaker's discretion in referring legislation to select committees allows for sequential referrals of bills related to the President's message. The Homeland Security select committee's jurisdiction includes establishing a homeland security department, with recommendations from other committees reported to the select committee. The Select Committee on Homeland Security has wide discretion granted by the Speaker to develop recommendations and report to the House on matters related to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Speaker can decide which matters to refer to the committee. The Speaker may have varying levels of discretion in creating select committees or implementing resolutions, as seen in Speaker O'Neill's letter regarding the Energy select committee. The House may desire tighter control over a select committee's jurisdiction, with standing committees and House members benefiting from less flexibility. However, some discretion may be necessary based on past experiences, such as when the Banking Committee referred a bill to the Energy select committee. The House passed a bill that was stuck in the Senate procedurally, so they decided to work on another departmental bill for legislative action. The Speaker referred the second bill to the Homeland Security select committee, using their referral authority sparingly. The select committees had specific purposes, with the Homeland Security committee having broader jurisdiction but only receiving seven measures. The Speaker's discretion in referring additional legislation could have faced resistance from standing committees. In the 94th and 95th Congress, the select committee was authorized to handle related matters within its jurisdiction. H.R. 1614 and President Carter's energy plan were referred to the select committee in the 95th Congress. Speaker O'Neill made a split referral of the energy plan to multiple committees. In the 95th Congress, the select committee handled related matters within its jurisdiction, including H.R. 1614 and President Carter's energy plan, which were split-referred to multiple committees by Speaker O'Neill. In the 107th Congress, a new bill, H.R. 8444, was introduced by Representative Ashley and referred to the select committee with a time limit of July 27, 1977. In the 107th Congress, Majority Leader Armey and other Republican Members introduced President Bush's proposed homeland security department bill, H.R. 5005, on June 24, 2002. It was referred to multiple committees for consideration and eventually discharged on July 12, 2002. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 5005, President Bush's homeland security department bill, was introduced on June 24, 2002. It was discharged on July 12, 2002, from further consideration. The House passed H.R. 5005 on July 26. In the 108th Congress (2003-2005), seven measures were referred to the Select Committee on Homeland Security. In the 108th Congress, several bills were referred to the Select Committee on Homeland Security, including H.R. 3266, H.R. 10, H.R. 2122, H.R. 2886, and H.R. 4259. In the 108th Congress, several bills were referred to three committees, including the select committee; H.R. 2886 and H.R. 4259, both titled the Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act, were introduced by the same Member. The select committee reported five bills referred to it, while a sixth bill, H.R. 4259, was not reported by the select committee but by the primary committee and considered by the House. The select committee also considered but did not report H.R. 10. House Rule XII, cl. 2(c)(4), does not describe the relationship between a select committee and standing committees of jurisdiction. In the four instances of select committees with legislative authority, the resolutions creating two committees referenced the standing committees, clarifying their roles in the legislative process. The relationship between the select committee and standing committees was detailed in a letter from the Speaker and discussed in House debate for one committee, while the other committee outlined the relationship in its resolution. The most recent select committee followed similar rules as House standing committees, with some overlap in membership. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee worked independently of standing committees on specific legislation, possibly due to its jurisdiction and overlap in membership. Speaker O'Neill believed energy policy jurisdiction was divided among too many committees. In the 95th Congress, efforts to create a standing energy committee were unsuccessful, but an ad hoc committee was formed to consider Carter's energy proposals. In the 107th Congress, there was anticipation of committee reorganization after the homeland security department legislation passed, with concerns about jurisdiction over executive branch reorganization. Members wanted to bring their expertise to the treatment of agencies within their jurisdiction. The proposed department reorganization raised concerns about agencies with dual purposes, like the Coast Guard, and the need to consider factors beyond homeland security. Speaker Hastert negotiated with Minority Leader Gephardt to establish a select committee allowing for various perspectives to be heard and turned into recommendations. The resolution dissolved without altering committee jurisdiction. The Energy and Homeland Security select committees had limited scope compared to the Outer Continental Shelf committee. House committees were hesitant to give up legislative participation, leading to a two-step recommendation process. The House opted for a two-step process of recommendations by standing committees to a select committee, which would report a measure for House consideration. The Energy select committee in the 95th Congress had initial reference to a bill or resolution incorporating recommendations from committees with subject-matter jurisdiction. The Speaker detailed the process in a letter to all Members, and Majority Leader Wright summarized the procedure during House debate on the resolution. The House established a two-step process for recommendations on the energy plan. A select committee appointed by the Speaker would hold hearings and make recommendations based on specific legislative proposals from the President. The recommended legislation would then be referred to standing committees for further consideration and markup before returning to the select committee. Energy and Power Subcommittee Chair Dingell outlined the operating procedures allowed by the resolution and Speaker O'Neill's letter. The new committee will organize and hold hearings on the President's energy message, with legislation being divided among standing committees. The ad hoc committee can recommend amendments but not change bills from standing committees. The Speaker will set a reporting deadline for standing committees, giving the majority leadership flexibility in shaping legislation development. The resolution creating the ad hoc committee allows for leadership to define committee roles. The ad hoc select committee allows leadership to define committee roles and relationships while establishing itself as the forum for developing the final draft of legislative text. Standing committees have an influential role in the process. In the 107th Congress, a select committee was created to consider legislation for a homeland security department, with specific provisions on the relationship between the select committee and standing committees. The ad hoc select committee establishes roles and relationships for developing legislative text, with a focus on the homeland security department. The select committee considers recommendations on bills and reports to the House, allowing flexibility for majority leadership in the legislative process. The select committee on homeland security allows majority-party leadership to control policy outcomes in legislation, ensuring adherence to the majority's position. The committee focuses on oversight, legislation, and reform related to the Department of Homeland Security. The House created the Outer Continental Shelf select committee as a transitional entity, with no unique authority or limitation. The Speaker could impose time limits for committee consideration on sequentially referred measures. The Speaker's authority to impose time limitations for committee consideration began in the 106th Congress. Legislation on outer continental shelf and energy consumed significant time across two Congresses. The department of homeland security legislation passed quickly in the House but was not completed until a lameduck session. In the 94th Congress, the Outer Continental Shelf select committee faced deadline extensions before reporting on May 4, 1976. In the 95th Congress, the committee successfully reported by the designated deadline. The Energy select committee in the same Congress did not have a set reporting deadline due to a change in House rules. In a letter to House Members, the Speaker imposed a time limit on standing committees to consider a bill incorporating President Carter's energy message. Majority Leader Wright introduced H.R. 6831, which was referred to five committees with a deadline of July 13, 1977. After four committees reported their parts and one was discharged, the Speaker referred the measure to the Energy select committee. Representative Ashley introduced the amended bill as H.R. 8444, with a deadline of July 27, 1977. The Homeland Security select committee was created in the 107th Congress with Speaker's authority in House rules. Majority Leader Armey introduced H.R. 5005 with 113 Republican cosponsors. The bill was referred to 12 standing committees and the select committee, with a time limit for consideration. Standing committees were discharged on July 12, 2002, and the select committee reported by July 24, 2002. The Select Committee on Homeland Security (108th Congress, 2003-2005) was treated similarly to standing committees regarding referral and reporting. The Speaker's authority to appoint members from committees of legislative jurisdiction changed from House Rule X to Rule XII. Resolutions creating select committees needed to authorize the Speaker to appoint additional members if desired. In the 106th Congress, the Speaker's authority to appoint members to select committees was limited to those meeting specific criteria. The Outer Continental Shelf and Energy select committees drew members from standing committees, while the Homeland Security select committee in the 107th Congress had party leaders as members. The Homeland Security select committee in the 108th Congress was broadly representative of the House and all select committees were able to effectively carry out their assigned tasks. In the 94th Congress, select committees were formed with members from specific standing committees, with the Speaker later increasing the membership to 19. The majority Democrats held 13 seats reflecting the party ratio in the House. The chairs of these select committees were senior House members who had not chaired a standing committee before, and were generally respected and trusted by other Members. In the 94th Congress, select committees were formed with members from specific standing committees, with the Speaker later increasing the membership to 19. The majority Democrats held 13 seats, while the minority Republicans held 6. Members were assigned to various committees based on their representation of different states and industries. Representative John M. Murphy of New York was designated as the chair of one of the committees. In the 95th Congress, John M. Murphy of New York chaired the Oceanography Subcommittee of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. The select committee had members from specific standing committees appointed by the Speaker, with Democrats holding 13 seats and Republicans holding 6. Most members served on the Interior and Insular Affairs, Judiciary, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committees. In the 95th Congress, members of the select committee were appointed from specific standing committees by the Speaker. Democrats held 13 seats and Republicans held 6. Most members served on the Interior and Insular Affairs, Judiciary, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committees. Five members were from the Judiciary Committee, eleven from the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, with some serving on multiple committees. Four new members joined the select committee, with representation from coastal and oil-producing states, as well as Northeastern, Southern, Western, and Midwestern states. In the 95th Congress, the Energy select committee was created with 40 members appointed by the Speaker. Democrats held 27 seats, Republicans held 13. Members were chosen from committees with jurisdiction over the President's message. The larger number of members allowed for representation from additional states. In the 95th Congress, the Energy select committee was created with 40 members appointed by the Speaker from various committees, including Commerce, Ways and Means, Interior, Banking, Merchant Marine, Agriculture, Appropriations, Government Operations, International Relations, Judiciary, Public Works, Rules, and Science and Technology. Some members also served on the Joint Economic Committee. In the 95th Congress, the Energy select committee was created with 40 members appointed by the Speaker from various committees. The chairs of several committees served on the select committee, along with ranking minority members. Members also included representatives from major energy-producing states and states with hydroelectric or nuclear facilities. The Select Committee on Homeland Security (107th Congress) had members from both Republican and Democratic leadership. The Speaker appointed nine members, with four recommended by the Minority Leader. Representative Thomas L. \"Lud\" Ashley of Ohio was designated as chair. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 107th Congress had a bipartisan makeup with a majority of Republicans holding five seats and Democrats holding four seats. The committee was created to prevent jurisdictional fights over the new homeland security department. Key members included Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, J.C. Watts Jr., Deborah D. Pryce, Rob Portman, Nancy Pelosi, Martin Frost, Robert Menendez, and Rosa. In the 107th Congress, key members of the Select Committee on Homeland Security included Dick Armey, Tom DeLay, J.C. Watts Jr., Deborah D. Pryce, Rob Portman, Nancy Pelosi, Martin Frost, Robert Menendez, and Rosa L. DeLauro. Members had various committee assignments, with three from Texas, two from Ohio, and one each from California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Oklahoma. In the 108th Congress, the Select Committee on Homeland Security was created with members appointed by the Speaker, including those recommended by the Minority Leader. The committee had a party ratio of 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats, with members also serving on other key committees. In the 108th Congress, the Select Committee on Homeland Security was created with members appointed by the Speaker, including those recommended by the Minority Leader. The committee had significant homeland security jurisdiction as defined by the Homeland Security Act. Members also served on various other key committees, including Agriculture, Appropriations, Armed Services, Education and Labor, Financial Services, Oversight and Government Reform, House Administration, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Natural Resources, Rules, Science and Technology, Small Business, and the Joint Economic Committee. Twenty-one members served on more than one of these committees. In the 108th Congress, the Select Committee on Homeland Security was created with members appointed by the Speaker. The committee had significant homeland security jurisdiction and included members from various key committees. Select committee members included nine committee chairs and ranking minority members from two committees. Members were from different regions, including Northeastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western states, as well as Delegates from the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. The Speaker designated Representative Christopher C. Cox of California as the chair. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress had significant jurisdiction and included members from various key committees, with Representative Christopher C. Cox of California as the chair. Resolutions establishing select committees authorized the use of existing House resources, allowing them to tap into House staff for support. The House agreed to funding resolutions for select committees, providing specific resources. The Homeland Security select committee in the 107th Congress operated without a separate funding resolution. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee in the 94th Congress received funding resolutions in both sessions. The House approved funding resolutions for select committees, allocating resources for investigators, attorneys, consultants, and assistants. The resolution limited spending on temporary consultants to $30,000 and prohibited funds for duplicate investigations. The chair was required to report on financed studies to the House Administration Committee. Funds could only be used in accordance with the select committee's authority and House Administration Committee regulations. The second-session resolution provided $150,000 with the same spending limit on temporary consultants. In August 1976, additional funding of $89,000 was approved for the select committee in the 94th Congress, with a $18,000 limit on spending for temporary consultants. The total funding for the 94th Congress was $592,000. In the 95th Congress, new funding resolutions were adopted, with $350,000 authorized in the first session and $300,000 in the second session, with a $50,000 limit on spending for temporary consultants. Total funding for the 95th Congress was $650,000, bringing the total for both Congresses to $1,242,000. In the 95th Congress, the House funded the Energy select committee with $212,833 in the first session and $90,000 in the second session. The funding resolution did not limit spending on consultants. Another resolution in August 1978 was passed to maintain a small staff as the legislative process was ongoing. The Energy select committee received additional funding of $50,000 in August 1978, bringing the total authorized amount to $352,833. The Select Committee on Homeland Security (108th Congress) was granted legislative and oversight jurisdiction over homeland security legislation, with an initial funding resolution of $700,000 until March 31, 2003. Payments were to be made on authorized vouchers signed by the chair and approved by the House Administration Committee. The select committee was authorized by the House Administration Committee to expend funds totaling $10,952,787 for expenses over two sessions of the 108th Congress. The Speaker referred legislation to the select committees, which reported at least one measure with a written report. The House authorized select committees to report measures and hold conferences with the Senate on various bills, leading to the adoption of conference reports and the signing of laws. The majority leadership strongly supported the select committees, despite not all Members agreeing with their policy recommendations. The select committees' policy recommendations and final conference products were supported by majority or minority Members. The majority used its status to decide and impose policy goals, with select committees having varying levels of influence. Seven measures were considered by the Select Committee on Homeland Security, resulting in two becoming law. H.R. 6218 was introduced in the Outer Continental Shelf select committee, chaired by Representative Murphy, with cosponsors Sullivan and Rodino. The bill aimed to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 and underwent hearings and markup sessions from 1975 to 1976. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee, chaired by Representative Murphy, introduced H.R. 6218 in April 1976. The committee reported the bill with an amendment on May 4, 1976. The Rules Committee reported a special rule on May 26, 1976, which was agreed to by the House on June 4. The rule provided for two hours of general debate and waived germaneness points of order against the committee amendment. The select committee's amendment was to be considered as an original bill, with amendments under the five-minute rule. The House passed H.R. 6218 on July 21, 1976, and amended S. 521 with its provisions. A conference was requested by the Senate, and after meetings, the conference report was filed on September 20. The report was called up in the House on September 28, but a motion to recommit it ended legislative action on the outer continental shelf in the 94th Congress. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee introduced H.R. 1614 and S. 9 in the 94th Congress. Hearings and markup sessions were held in 1977, with the committee reporting H.R. 1614 with an amendment in August. A special rule was agreed upon in January 1978 for three hours of general debate. The House agreed to a special rule on January 25 by a vote of 247-158, providing three hours of general debate for H.R. 1614. The rule allowed for amendments in the nature of a substitute to be offered by select committee members, with specified points of order waived. The select committee's amendment was to be considered as an original bill, with amendments under the five-minute rule. A motion to recommit with or without instructions was made in order, and the special rule allowed for provisions of S. 9 to be struck and replaced. The House passed H.R. 1614 on February 2 by 291-91, then amended S. 9 and agreed to a conference. After 10 days of meetings, the conference report was filed on August 10, adopted by the House on August 17 (335-18), followed by the Senate on August 22, and signed into law by President Carter on September 18. The Energy select committee was created to address President Carter's energy plan, introduced as H.R. 6831. The bill was split among five standing committees, with a deadline of July 13 for reports. Three committees reported by the deadline with differing views. The Banking Committee was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 6831 and reported a freestanding bill, the National Weatherization Act (H.R. 7893). The Commerce Committee was granted an extension to July 18. H.R. 6831 was referred to the Energy select committee, which held hearings and public briefings with federal officials and experts. On July 15, the select committee adopted an \"order of business resolution\" to divide the legislation into seven topical areas for consideration. On July 20, Representative Ashley introduced H.R. 8444, containing proposed changes to H.R. 6831 by standing committees. The Speaker referred the measure to the select committee with a deadline of July 27. The Speaker referred the measure to the select committee with a time limitation of July 27. The select committee marked up the bill and reported it with amendments. No consensus on a special rule governing floor consideration existed within the select committee. The Speaker included information on what would be requested of the Rules Committee in a special rule. The Rules Committee reported a special rule on July 28 (H.Res. 727, H.Rept. 95-546) for the consideration of H.R. 8444. The special rule, now known as a structured rule, allowed for general debate to be controlled and equally divided. Consideration of the bill was to be done by part rather than by section. The special rule for the consideration of H.R. 8444 allowed for amendments to be made by part rather than by section. It made in order 23 amendments recommended by the select committee, along with 11 amendments by individual Members and a minority substitute amendment. Speaker O'Neill set a schedule to complete House action on the bill before the August recess. The House passed the bill on August 5, 1977, and requested a conference with the Senate on multiple bills. The House appointed 25 conferees from the select committee, while the Senate appointed different conferees for each bill. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee appointed conferees for the energy tax bill from the Senate Finance Committee. The conference proceeded on two tracks, with non-tax measures considered separately from the tax measure. The conference reports on the five bills were filed in the House in October 1978. The Rules Committee deadlocked on whether to vote separately on the conference reports or hold an en bloc vote. Ultimately, the committee voted 9-5 in favor of an en bloc vote. Democrats voted present on the proposal for an en bloc vote, which was approved by the committee 9-5. The special rule allowed for four hours of debate, with the first hour focused on the natural gas policy bill. The key vote on the special rule passed 207-206, and the House then waited for the Senate to agree on the final conference for the energy tax bill. The Senate completed action on October 14, and the House voted en bloc 231-168 on October 15. President Carter signed the five tax measures into law on November 9, 1978. The House created a select committee on June 19, 2002, with jurisdiction over the establishment of a department of homeland security. President Bush submitted draft legislation to Congress, and Majority Leader Armey introduced it as H.R. 5005 on June 24. The bill was referred to the select committee and several other committees for review. The select committee on the establishment of a department of homeland security held hearings and markup sessions on H.R. 5005, with high-ranking federal officials and committee members testifying. The bill was reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute on a party-line 5-4 vote. The select committee on the establishment of a department of homeland security held hearings and markup sessions on H.R. 5005, and reported the bill with an amendment in the nature of a substitute on a party-line 5-4 vote. On July 25, the Rules Committee reported a structured rule allowing 90 minutes for general debate and 18 amendments to be considered in a specific order and manner.

Amendments en bloc would be read, debated for 20 minutes, and not subject to further amendment or division of the question. The House debated and adopted a special rule for H.R. 5005, which was passed on July 26 with a vote of 295-132. The Senate began considering amendments but did not complete action before the election. After the election, the House passed a second homeland security department bill (H.R. 5710) to facilitate the conclusion of the lameduck session. The House passed bill H.R. 5710 under a closed rule (H.Res. 600, H.Rept. 107-773) on November 13, 2002, with a vote of 299-121. The Senate passed H.R. 5005 on November 19 with a vote of 90-9, and the House agreed on November 22. President Bush signed the measure into law. The House created a select committee on January 7, 2003, granting jurisdiction over the \"Homeland Security Act of 2002.\" Seven bills were referred to the committee, including H.Res. 286 pertaining to federal agency resources. The select committee was designated the primary referral for H.R. 3266, the Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders Act of 2004, which was reported on April 2, 2004. The bill H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, was referred to multiple committees including the Intelligence Committee.

The Senate also passed a related bill, S. 15, which was signed into law by the President. Two identical measures, H.R. 2886 and H.R. 4259, were referred to committees and reported on separately. The House passed H.R. 4259 on July 20, 2004, which was subsequently passed by the Senate and signed into law. Ad hoc select committees expire based on specific time frames or events, established by simple resolution and ending with the sine die adjournment of Congress. The ad hoc select committees, such as the Outer Continental Shelf, Energy, and Homeland Security committees, were set to expire when the legislative process concluded, including the final disposition of any veto message. The resolutions creating these committees specified that they would cease to exist after the completion of their legislative work. During the 108th Congress, a Select Committee on Homeland Security was established with legislative authority to develop legislation aligned with strategic policy goals. While a select committee can offer advantages in addressing issues comprehensively and in a timely manner, success is not guaranteed. Factors that may increase the potential for success include the committee's jurisdiction and the ability to address issues effectively. During the 108th Congress, a Select Committee on Homeland Security was established with legislative authority to develop legislation aligned with strategic policy goals. In a timely fashion, if standing committees' jurisdiction over an issue is fragmented or overlapping, a select committee could handle competing legislation effectively. During the 108th Congress, a Select Committee on Homeland Security was established to handle competing legislation effectively when standing committees' jurisdiction is fragmented or overlapping. The Speaker's authority to establish time limitations for committees to report, along with special rules resolutions from the Rules Committee, allows the House to address problems with deliberative urgency and determine legislative vehicles and amendment procedures. If adopted by the House, the special rules resolution will govern procedures for considering legislation. Select committees can reconcile texts in open markup meetings, developing their own amendments for the House's consideration. This process was seen in the Energy and Homeland Security select committees during the 107th Congress. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee operated in open markup sessions, supplanting standing committees. Select committees provide a mechanism for handling fragmented or overlapping jurisdiction effectively. The select committee operates in open markup sessions, providing a transparent process for legislation development. Standing committees may have established policy preferences that differ from presidential proposals, influencing policymaking. Relationships among committee members, staff, and other stakeholders can either facilitate or impede the policy process. A select committee can help mediate differences between standing committees in policymaking by providing a new forum with fewer established relationships and policy preferences. It can play a deciding role in considering recommendations from various sources and aid in developing legislation matched to strategic policy goals. The challenge of ensuring compatibility among provisions is heightened when multiple committees report legislation. The House often relies on majority leadership or the Rules Committee to address issues when multiple committees report legislation. A select committee, like the Energy and Homeland Security committees in the 107th Congress, can serve as a model for developing a coherent legislative text. The Energy committee grouped provisions topically, based on briefings from standing committees, and marked up the bill accordingly. The Homeland Security committee also held hearings to consider recommendations. A select committee can enhance coherence in legislation by providing a mechanism for developing coherent legislation and amendments. It is particularly useful for dealing with controversial provisions and mediating conflicting views to draft compromises. A select committee can help develop coherent legislation by mediating conflicting views and drafting compromises on controversial provisions. This process may involve finding the right legislative package that can pass both chambers and be signed into law. A select committee can expedite legislation through the House and Senate, but the legislation must still gain majority support in both chambers and be signed into law by the President. The Outer Continental Shelf select committee initially failed to pass legislation but succeeded in the following Congress. The House used a select committee for energy legislation, while the Senate employed five legislative vehicles and took nearly a year to reach a conference agreement. The House also passed legislation to create a department of homeland security. The House passed legislation for a department of homeland security shortly after it was proposed by the President. Efforts of a select committee may help in drafting legislation with majority support, but it is not guaranteed. Conference agreements on outer continental shelf and energy legislation faced challenges in the House. The Outer Continental Shelf, Energy, and Homeland Security select committees made compromises, with majority members using their status to push through legislation. Partisan voting was common, with some majority members voting against reporting measures. Strong majority support in one chamber did not always translate to the second chamber. The House passed legislation for a department of homeland security promptly, while the Senate faced challenges in agreeing on outer continental shelf and energy legislation. The House promptly acted on President Carter's energy plan, while the Senate took longer to reach an agreement. The homeland security department also passed the House quickly, but the Senate only completed its work after the general election. Bipartisan support for select committees did not bridge policy differences, but it contributed to leaders and Members being invested in the process. Bipartisan discussions led to agreement on appointing select committee members who support reporting legislation. Minority Leader Rhodes intends to appoint members who favor legislation. Leader support can facilitate procedures for considering reported legislation. The legislation reported by the Energy and Homeland Security select committees in the 107th Congress was considered under structured rules. The roles of standing committees and their members were involved in the work of the select committees, with most members having expertise in relevant areas. The standing committees play a crucial role in developing legislation by providing expertise and recommendations to the select committee. Sufficient time for debate and voting on amendments is necessary to build majorities, consider compromises, and allow all Members to participate. The Speaker and Rules Committee can ensure committees stay on track and draft special rules as needed. The Rules Committee can draft special rules resolutions to keep committees on track and allow for sufficient debate time and an appropriate amendment process. Select committees have specific purposes and have been successful in reporting legislation in the past. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress had a unique role with legislative and oversight authority similar to standing committees. The Ad Hoc Committee on Energy was created as a study committee to make recommendations on House rules in response to the reorganization of the executive branch for homeland security. Speaker Tip O'Neill Jr. inserted a letter in the Congressional Record regarding the creation of the committee. A new ad hoc committee will be created to consider the President's energy message. The committee will organize around the President's speech and have the authority to recommend amendments for consideration on the floor. The new ad hoc committee will recommend amendments for consideration on the floor and work alongside standing committees to settle differences in the energy legislation. It aims to provide comprehensive consideration of the national energy policy. The ad hoc committee will recommend amendments for the national energy policy, aiming to resolve competing claims and ensure fair representation of interests and regions. It will be a crucial challenge for Congress."
