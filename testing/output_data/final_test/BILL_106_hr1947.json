The \"Harbor Services Fund Act of 1999\" imposes fees on commercial vessels based on vessel category and capacity unit to fund harbor development, operation, and maintenance by the Department of the Army. If appropriations are insufficient, fees may be reduced for each vessel category. The fee imposed on commercial vessels is based on vessel category and capacity unit to fund harbor development, operation, and maintenance. Fees may be reduced if appropriations are insufficient. Fees are collected on a voyage basis and must be paid by the operator upon entering a US port from a foreign port or at the originating port for domestic voyages. Fees collected can only be used in the fiscal year they are collected and can be appropriated to remain available until expended. Exemptions from port use fees include United States agencies, intraport movements, and transporting commercial cargo to and from Alaska, Hawaii, or US possessions for local consumption. The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for regulating the payment and collection of fees for transporting cargo within Alaska, Hawaii, or US possessions, as well as for passengers on US flag vessels in Alaska or Hawaii waters. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for auditing these fees. The regulations for prescribing fees include remittance or mitigation of penalties, periodic review of fee amounts, prospective adjustment of fee rates for different vessel categories, and any other necessary regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act.
