    "content": "In February 2016, the United States signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 countries: Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei. The TPP aims to eliminate trade barriers, establish trade rules, and integrate the US into the Asia-Pacific region. It could become the largest plurilateral FTA, covering 40% of world GDP, and has the potential to negotiate new rules and expand membership. The discussion on multilateral trade liberalization in the World Trade Organization (WTO) often focuses on economic effects, particularly on gains or losses in employment. Some argue that U.S. trade deficits are linked to existing free trade agreements (FTAs), impacting employment and wages negatively. Economists believe trade benefits consumers and producers, especially in export-oriented industries, but acknowledge concentrated economic adjustment costs. The relationship between trade and jobs is complex, influenced by various opposing forces. The report examines the economic impact of the TPP and discusses the role of trade agreements in the economy. Economists use various models to estimate changes in economic activity and employment from trade agreements, with proponents and opponents citing these studies to support their positions. The TPP is a high-standard agreement aimed at reducing trade barriers and establishing trade rules among parties. Various economic models have strengths and weaknesses in estimating the agreement's impact, reflecting different assumptions and sensitivities to data limitations. Most economists argue that liberalized trade creates both economic costs and benefits, but the long-run net effect on the economy is positive. Competition through international trade leads to more efficient operations and benefits consumers with a wider variety of goods and services at different quality and price levels. International trade and trade agreements can have positive effects on an economy by enhancing production and employment. However, they can also lead to negative effects such as increased competition and market access, impacting certain workers and firms more heavily. The costs and benefits of trade agreements do not accrue to the economy at the same speed, with costs felt initially. Trade agreements can have initial costs to the economy in the form of job losses and downward pressure on wages, while benefits such as enhanced consumer welfare accrue over time. Most economists agree that trade liberalization has not been a major factor affecting income distribution. International trade can have different impacts on workers in various occupations, known as occupational exposure to international trade. Trade liberalization can disproportionately impact workers and firms within the same industry. Microeconomic analysis at the firm level is not typically included in trade models due to a lack of data beyond direct trade in goods and services. Estimating the economic and employment effects of trade agreements faces challenges, especially in translating barriers in services into tariff-equivalent values. Reduced barriers to trade in services could have a significant positive impact on the U.S. economy. The economic environment for trade is constantly evolving due to domestic and international activities, which may not be fully captured in trade models. The decline in energy prices and global trade slowdown are reshaping the global economy in ways that go beyond potential trade impacts. The global economy is being altered by trade changes since 2011, surpassing potential trade agreements. The effects of these changes may not be fully reflected in economic data. Trade models do not account for exchange rates and rely on existing patterns, limiting their ability to estimate the impact of new trade patterns. Global value chains and intra-industry trade have blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms, challenging traditional concepts of exports and imports. The growth of global value chains has blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms, impacting traditional concepts of exports and imports. Foreign value added makes up 28% of global exports on average, highlighting the importance of trade in intermediate goods. This complex process has reshaped the role of services in international trade and increased the number of jobs tied to international trade. Countries restricting imports may inadvertently harm their own exports due to the interconnected nature of global production and trade. The growth of global value chains has blurred the distinction between domestic and foreign firms, impacting traditional concepts of exports and imports. Efforts to estimate the economic impact of the proposed TPP are complicated by overlapping trade agreements among TPP countries. These agreements may reshape trade patterns and have both trade creating and diverting dimensions, potentially enhancing the trade environment. The TPP aims to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, promoting open, transparent, and non-discriminatory treatment among participants. It is expected to lead to economic benefits by reducing market-distorting activities and creating market efficiencies. Some countries plan to use the TPP rules to support domestic reforms, potentially benefiting themselves and other participants in the long term. Preferential multi-country trade agreements like the TPP are expected to stimulate economic growth and improve overall economic welfare by eliminating tariffs and trade barriers. These agreements alter trade patterns by increasing competition, trade creation, and trade diversion among participating nations. Participating in trade agreements like the TPP can alter trade patterns among nations by creating trade diversion and trade creation effects. The impact of tariff cuts under the TPP may be influenced by factors such as pre-and post-agreement tariff rates, the speed of tariff cuts implementation, and existing trade agreements among participants. Trade agreements, such as the TPP, can have significant cross-border implications beyond tariffs on specific products. These agreements cover a range of policy issues like trade in goods and services, investment, regulatory barriers, and more. They can act as catalysts for economic growth and development, especially for developing countries looking to integrate themselves into the global economy. Trade agreements are seen as important tools for integrating into global economies and implementing economic reforms. They aim to standardize governance issues like dispute resolution procedures. Estimating the impact of trade on employment and wages is challenging due to various factors at play. Most trade models lack detailed industry data to forecast specific job impacts accurately. The economy is influenced by various forces at the micro and macro levels, including technology, currency exchange rates, and interest rates. These factors can have a greater impact on national economies than trade agreements. Economists believe that macroeconomic forces shape trade relationships, but changes in technology and other factors can affect specific industries independently of international trade. Trade agreements may have limited impact on the overall supply of labor in the U.S. economy, as other factors such as national birth rate, productivity improvements, and immigration flows play a significant role. Economists argue that while exports and imports support millions of jobs in various sectors, international trade is just one of many factors influencing total U.S. employment, real wages, and income distribution. The economy is also influenced by technology, currency exchange rates, and interest rates, which can have a greater impact than trade agreements on national economies. The globalization of the economy has expanded the labor market, impacting the distribution of national income. Changes in demand for labor and other factors of production during the business cycle can affect the share of rewards received by labor and production owners. Structural changes in the economy can shift income distribution towards production owners. Technology advancements and globalization can impact labor share and create competitive pressures. Economic stagnation affects all sectors negatively, while dynamic economies constantly create and replace firms and jobs. The economy undergoes constant changes with firms and jobs being created and replaced due to various factors like technological advancements, productivity, and international trade. These changes make it challenging to isolate the impact of a trade agreement on the economy's structure from other dynamic forces. Successful sectors that adopt new technologies receive greater economic rewards and attract more opportunities. New technological advancements drive economic growth by attracting capital and labor, while lagging sectors face increased competition. Global supply chains and trade agreements reshape the economy, requiring firms to adapt for long-term viability. In 2015, 8% of the 141.1 million jobs in the U.S. economy were directly and indirectly supported by exports. Job gains and losses can result from various factors such as new business openings, expansions, voluntary departures, involuntary discharges, and import competition. The combined share of gross jobs gained and lost in the economy accounts for 14.3%, reflecting annual churning in the labor market. International trade can impact the economy through increased competition, leading to short-term adjustment costs for some workers, firms, and communities. Foreign firms may engage in unfair competition or trade-distorting practices. Some estimates indicate that short-run costs for workers affected by trade-related dislocations can be significant, leading to depressed property values, lost tax revenues, and challenges for communities. Adjusting to new employment opportunities may result in substantial costs for workers switching occupations or industries. Trade liberalization has a small effect on wages and jobs at the industry level, prompting workers to shift from manufacturing to services. Job switchers due to trade liberalization experience wage reductions, especially in routine tasks, and occupations exposed to imports from lower-income countries. In contrast, export-related jobs see rising incomes. Skilled jobs show a positive relationship between rising incomes and export share growth. Trade models like CGE analyze FTAs using data on trade and domestic economic variables. The Global Trade Atlas Project at Purdue University is a commonly used CGE model for estimating trade changes. USITC economists Petri and G. study the effects of trade liberalization on sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. The GTAP model is used by USITC, economists Petri and Plummer, and the World Bank for simulations. In contrast, economists Capaldo and Izurieta use a different model for their estimates of the impact of TPP. CGE models provide estimates of gains and losses in trade sectors based on baseline economic projections. Trade policies affect national productivity levels, wages, and trade through microeconomic channels. Trade models estimate economic effects of trade agreements by tracing changes in trade policy to national productivity levels, wages, and incomes. These models operate with assumptions like full employment and are limited in estimating the impact of new trade agreements on previously untraded goods or services. During the implementation period of trade agreements, it is unlikely that persistently low unemployment levels would significantly impact the models' results. The economy is expected to return to full employment through market forces or government intervention with stimulative macroeconomic policies. Trade models aggregate vast amounts of data into a manageable size by reducing individual commodities and countries into categories and regions. Tariffs in the models represent weighted averages, masking the importance of products with high tariff rates. Trade models often overlook the impact of high tariff rates on specific products, leaving it to modelers to make assumptions about how quickly tariff changes affect economies. These models also do not consider adjustments in the economy's input-output structure due to changes in goods prices. Trade models like the CGE do not provide precise estimates of job impacts in trade agreements, especially in bilateral and plurilateral agreements where trade volume is lower. This lack of precision is a drawback when compared to large macroeconomic models used for forecasting GDP growth, wages, and taxes. Some groups use various methods to assess the impact of trade agreements on jobs, with estimates varying widely. Models face limitations in data and practical issues, making precise estimates challenging. Studies selected provide an overview of the economic impact of the proposed TPP on U.S. trade, employment, and GDP compared to a baseline projection. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) conducted a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of the TPP agreement in May 2016 using the GTAP model to estimate changes in trade, foreign investment, and services. They also made assumptions about the evolution of the U.S. and world economies without the TPP. The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) used the GTAP model to assess the economic impact of the TPP agreement in 2016. They projected the evolution of the U.S. and world economies without the TPP until 2047, incorporating projections from IMF, OECD, and ILO. The model simulations included potential trade policy changes in the absence of TPP, adjusting for labor supply effects and including 12 TPP countries and 56 industry sectors. The GTAP model used by the United States International Trade Commission projected the economic impact of the TPP agreement. By 2032, with TPP, U.S. annual real income would increase by $57.3 billion, real GDP by $42.7 billion, employment by 0.07%, and the capital stock by 0.18%. The ITC projected that with TPP by 2032, U.S. annual exports and imports with TPP partners would increase by $57.2 billion (5.6%) and $47.5 billion (3.5%) respectively. Additionally, exports and imports with new FTA partners under TPP are projected to increase by $34.6 billion (18.7%) and $23.4 billion (10.4%) by 2032. The majority of growth in U.S. exports under TPP is with new partners, with projected increases in exports by $27.2 billion and imports by $48.9 billion by 2032. The ITC analysis of TPP focuses on the effects of liberalizing tariffs and nontariff measures on goods, with significant tariff reductions for certain products and increased exports to TPP countries without a trade agreement with the U.S. The ITC study analyzed the effects of TPP on various industries, showing gains in output and employment in the agriculture and food sector while manufacturing, natural resources, and energy sectors would see slight declines. Tariff reductions would lead to shifts in resources, with global U.S. service exports projected to increase by $4.8 billion by 2032. Services exports to TPP countries were estimated to rise by 10.8% ($16.6 billion). The ITC study examined the impact of the TPP on trade in services, projecting a 10.8% increase in exports to TPP countries and a 1.9% decrease in exports to non-TPP countries. The agreement would remove barriers to trade in services on a negative list basis, with broad disciplines to ensure transmission ability. The TPP includes provisions to ensure data transmission across borders and prohibits data-localization measures. Estimates show a $42.3 billion increase in the U.S. services sector under TPP by 2032. Services exports are projected to increase by 0.6% and imports by 1.2%. Employment in most services sectors is expected to be higher by 2032. The ITC adjusted its modeling process to consider potential changes in direct investment resulting from the TPP. The ITC analyzed the impact of the TPP on foreign affiliate sales, productivity, and macroeconomic variables in the United States. It concluded that the TPP is not expected to significantly alter investment inflows in the US, but could increase US direct investment in countries like Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. The Peterson Institute for International Economics conducted an analysis using the GTAP model to estimate the economic impact of the TPP. The study concluded that the agreement could increase U.S. income, generate jobs, boost annual GDP by $131 billion, and increase annual exports by $357 billion by 2030. The model scenario also estimated a potential 0.1% increase in unemployment in the short run. The increase in GDP from the TPP is expected to be about 0.1% of U.S. annual GDP, with gains from foreign direct investment, reduced trade barriers, and tariff rate cuts. The largest economic gains are projected to come from reductions in non-tariff barriers for goods and services. The authors estimate a global GDP increase of $492 billion by 2030, benefiting countries like Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Global GDP is projected to increase by $492 billion by 2030, with Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam experiencing significant growth due to high existing trade barriers. Trade agreements can lead to economic gains by lowering barriers and increasing competition. Europe is expected to see a $50 billion GDP increase by 2030, driven by exports to TPP countries and liberalization of services trade. China, India, and Thailand may lose income, while South Korea could lose some economic gains from the South Korea-United States FTA. The authors estimate that the TPP will raise U.S. wages and benefit both capital and labor, with labor's share increasing slightly. Delaying the agreement could result in a $94 billion permanent loss to the U.S. economy. They also project the agreement could add about 19,000 jobs annually through job churn. Additionally, they estimate all jobs directly and indirectly displaced by imports. The analysis estimates that the TPP agreement could potentially displace 53,000 U.S. jobs, adding 0.1% to annual labor market turnover. The model projects increased inward and outward investment flows, with U.S. exports of certain goods expected to rise. The TPP agreement is projected to increase exports of primary goods, advanced manufacturing, and services, while imports may rise in labor-intensive manufacturing products and certain services. The model assumes that the agreement could attract more firms into exporting, potentially leading to a larger impact than models without this assumption. This would require subjective decisions as trade models typically lack microeconomic data on firms' exporting behavior. The authors projected U.S. GDP in 2025 to be $20 trillion, with an average income of $121,000 per worker. They estimate the Free Trade Agreement will generate annual income gains for the U.S. economy, reaching $79 billion by 2025. This increase in income is seen as equivalent to a net positive gain in employment. The authors project a net positive annual gain in employment over the baseline projection by 2025, cautioning that the trade-employment relationship is complex and sensitive to macroeconomic circumstances. They did not attempt to estimate the number of jobs that might arise from the agreement. The TPP is projected to increase member country GDP by an average of 1.1% by 2030, with estimates ranging from over 8% for Vietnam to 0.5% for other countries. Trade agreements are believed to affect how people are employed, ideally substituting more productive jobs for less productive ones. The TPP is projected to increase member country GDP by an average of 1.1%, with estimates ranging from over 8% for Vietnam to 0.5% for the United States. The agreement would stimulate a shift in resources towards more productive firms and sectors, leading to an increase in export markets. The impact on NAFTA members would be about 0.6% of GDP, primarily in the United States, due to low trade share and tariff rates. Spillover effects on non-TPP countries are expected to be small but positive due to greater regulatory harmonization. Trade diversion effects for non-TPP members are projected to be limited. The TPP agreement is projected to increase member country GDP by an average of 1.1%, with benefits materializing slowly but accelerating towards the end of the projection period. Trade among TPP members is expected to increase by 11% by 2030, with benefits derived from reductions in non-tariff measures and services. Lower tariff rates would account for 15% of the projected GDP increase, while non-tariff measures would drive 53% increase in exports of goods and 51% increase in exports of services. This would also allow for the emergence of new trade products between countries. The authors of the TPP agreement expect that the rules of origin will lead to the replacement of imported inputs with higher-cost inputs from TPP members. They also anticipate increased trade with non-TPP members due to more transparent regulatory approaches. The TPP is projected to accelerate shifts in the economy towards traded services, advanced manufacturing, and primary products for resource-rich economies. The TPP agreement is expected to accelerate shifts in the economy towards traded services, advanced manufacturing, and primary products for resource-rich economies. Developing countries are projected to experience growth in manufacturing, especially in unskilled labor-intensive industries. The authors project small changes in real wages for the United States by 2030, with skilled workers seeing a higher increase compared to unskilled workers. This is influenced by the agreement's rules of origin and potential economic benefits from regulatory convergence among TPP members. The TPP agreement is projected to boost intra-regional trade among members through a common rules approach. Trade with non-TPP members will be influenced by existing standards and hypothetical mutual recognition agreements on rules of origin. Changes in regulatory standards are expected to impact trade with non-TPP countries differently based on their level of economic development. Developed economies are likely to see an increase in trade, while developing economies may experience a decrease due to more stringent regulatory standards. The TPP represents a significant milestone in trade agreements, with potential impacts on economies of scale, rules of origin, and global negotiations. The ultimate implications of the TPP remain uncertain, depending on its adoption, implementation, and ability to trigger reforms in both developing and developed countries. Expanding such reforms globally through TPP enlargement or competitive effects on other trade agreements will be crucial for broader systemic effects. The TPP's economic impact study by Tufts University's Global Development and Environment Institute using the United Nations Global Policy Model (GPM) predicts job losses for all TPP members, totaling 771,000 jobs. The largest losses are expected in the United States. Additionally, the study suggests negative effects on growth and employment in non-TPP countries, with Europe projected to lose 879,000 jobs and non-TPP developing countries facing a loss of about 4.5 million jobs. The authors of the study argue that the TPP and non-TPP countries will face job losses, leading to global instability and a race to the bottom in labor incomes. They criticize the standard CGE model for its assumptions about full employment and lack of wage-earner differentiation. Their demand-driven, global econometric model is seen as more realistic than the standard model. The UN GPM model challenges conventional assumptions about full employment, income distribution, and productivity growth. It differs from traditional trade models by using minimal trade data and providing detailed estimates of the TPP's impact on specific countries. The UN GPM model challenges traditional trade models by focusing on macroeconomic impacts of the TPP on specific countries. It includes four broad international trade sectors and borrows estimates from other studies to predict potential trade effects of the TPP. The authors suggest that the TPP may lead to job losses in TPP countries. The UN GPM model predicts job losses in TPP countries and negative impacts on non-TPP countries. The authors suggest that the TPP would affect international competition by lowering prices and cutting costs to maintain market shares, leading to a shift in income distribution towards business profits. The TPP would impact income distribution by favoring profits over labor, potentially leading to job losses, recession, and a shift towards higher returns for firms and borrowers. Foreign income inflows would depend on fiscal policy adjustments to attract capital. The TPP may lead to job losses and favor profits over labor, with a shift towards higher returns for firms. Foreign income inflows would require fiscal policy adjustments to attract capital, leading to a race to the bottom in labor shares across the TPP bloc. This study focuses on negative effects of trade agreements, contradicting standard economic concepts without explanation. Trade models cannot precisely estimate adjustment costs, but trade agreements are generally expected to have positive economic effects. The costs and benefits of trade agreements do not accrue at the same speed to the economy. Job losses are experienced in the initial stages, while benefits generally accrue over time. Criticism is directed towards the assumption of full employment in typical CGE models. Economic adjustments to shocks are expected either through market mechanisms or deliberate macroeconomic policies. Unemployment rate is noted at 4.7% in the United States. The United States is nearing full employment with an unemployment rate of 4.7%. Capacity utilization levels are below long-run rates, indicating excess productive capacity. Trade agreements like the TPP are expected to have positive economic effects through lower tariff rates, increasing trade and improving consumer choices and purchasing power. Businesses are anticipated to improve performance through mutual lowering of barriers. The TPP is expected to improve business performance by lowering market barriers and tariffs, leading to long-term productivity gains. Trade agreements like the TPP aim to reduce economic inefficiencies and job losses by shifting resources within the economy in response to market forces. The authors analyze the negative adjustment costs of market forces on shifting resources within the economy. International trade can be influenced by economic factors like recessions and new entrants like China and India, impacting global labor supply and wages. The global labor market has quadrupled in the past two decades, with the US and other developed economies accessing it through imports and offshoring of production. The IMF states that globalization, through factors like imports, offshoring, and immigration, has led to increased labor compensation in advanced economies by boosting productivity. This has benefited emerging market economies as well. However, increased exports from developing countries may lower wages for unskilled workers in developed economies. Despite this, the positive effects of trade and productivity could still benefit workers in developed economies. Globalization is just one factor contributing to the decline in labor's share of income in advanced economies, with technological change playing a significant role as well. Technological change has had a significant impact on income distribution, particularly affecting lower-skilled workers. The GPM model's estimates of job and GDP losses due to the TPP are biased towards adjustment costs and do not consider the full economic effects. The model fails to account for supply side effects of trade agreements, leading to projected losses in employment, output, and wages for all TPP partners. These estimates overlook potential positive gains for consumers and producers, contradicting traditional economic principles. Limited trade data and the absence of tariff or industry data in the GPM contribute to the author's pessimistic outlook on job and GDP losses. The GPM model lacks detailed micro data on tariffs, trade, and industry-specific information, hindering its ability to capture trade effects, benefits to consumers, and gains in productivity. It also fails to account for shifts in capital and labor among sectors within the economy. The GPM model does not account for shifts in capital and labor among sectors within the economy. The authors focus on wages as a key government policy variable, emphasizing that trade is driven more by the value of wages relative to productivity levels. The United States, being a high wage and high productivity country, can export capital-intensive and technology-intensive products. The TPP's impact is assumed by the authors without evidence from their model. The authors assume in their report that the TPP will result in negative adjustment costs and lower wages for all workers in the economy. This assumption implies government intervention in private labor markets and a decrease in income distribution between workers and owners due to trade agreement adjustment costs. The GPM model lacks detailed industry, production, or labor data, but indicates that lower tariffs can benefit export-oriented industries. The authors suggest that lower tariffs can benefit export-oriented industries, despite the limited role of trade in the U.S. economy. The economic gains from the TPP may be small relative to the overall economy, but cutting tariffs and reducing non-tariff barriers among TPP countries could lead to positive output, employment, and wage gains. Labor markets respond to economic stimuli, with firms in different industries varying in their competitive ability. How firms react to challenges will impact their long-term viability. The assumption that national governments and businesses will take extreme measures to maintain market shares contradicts the idea that firms, not countries, are the main actors in international trade. Policy objectives of governments and businesses can sometimes conflict, especially regarding monetary policies and exchange rates. Governments and businesses may not prioritize maintaining market shares or income shares in their policy objectives. Firms can increase exports but still lose market share if total export value rises faster. Similarly, real wages can rise even if labor's share of income falls. Real wages can increase even if labor's share of national income falls as long as the total amount of national income is rising at a faster pace. The concept of market shares is becoming less relevant due to the growth of global value chains, characterized by trade in intermediate goods. Countries imposing trade measures restricting imports may negatively affect their own exports. The authors also discuss assumptions about capital flows and government policies to preserve capital inflows. The authors discuss how capital inflows depend on a country's fiscal policy and the overall savings-investment balance in the economy. Capital flows bridge the gap between total capital supply and demand, influenced by government budget deficits, household and firm accounts, affecting interest rates and exchange rates. The U.S. dollar's role as the international reserve currency impacts interest rates, exchange rates, and capital flows. Foreign investments affect the savings-investment balance, exchange value of the dollar, and U.S. exports/imports. Studies estimate the TPP's impact on U.S. employment using data from the International Trade Administration. The ITA methodology estimates the number of jobs supported by U.S. exports based on economic relationships. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million jobs, with 7.1 million in goods producing and 4.6 million in services. Each billion dollars of merchandise goods exports supported 5,210 jobs. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million jobs, with 7.1 million in goods producing and 4.6 million in services. Each billion dollars of merchandise goods exports supported 5,210 jobs, and one billion dollars of services exports supported 7,033 jobs. Opponents and proponents of trade agreements use this data to estimate the employment effects of FTAs. Some argue that an increase in imports due to trade agreements leads to job losses in the economy. The methodology used to estimate jobs supported by exports is not applied to imports or trade deficits. The composition of U.S. imports differs from exports, with some being substitutable items and others being inputs for further processing. Imports represent substitutable items, inputs for further processing, or items not fully available in the economy. Import-competing industries have different capital and labor mixes compared to export-oriented industries, leading to varying demands on capital and labor markets across sectors. ITA warns against using export-supported jobs data to estimate the relationship between imports and jobs, as it is a static relationship and should not be used as a multiplier for estimating changes in jobs associated with changes in exports or imports. The ITA warns against using export-supported jobs data to estimate the impact of trade agreements on U.S. jobs. The debate over the proposed TPP may focus on its potential effect on employment and the economy, amid concerns about slow wage growth and income distribution. The potential impact of a new trade agreement like TPP on U.S. employment, trade, and economic welfare is analyzed, raising questions about the reliability of estimates. Economic modeling involves various assumptions and methodologies that can significantly affect the generated estimates. Different studies can produce varying results, with some using non-standard approaches. Estimates of the impact of the TPP on the U.S. economy can vary due to different modeling approaches and assumptions. The most accurate models can only provide rough estimates of potential changes in employment, with the expected level of labor utilization being a key assumption. The expected level of labor utilization in the U.S. economy over the phase-in period following the adoption of TPP is likely to track closer to the current situation than data from the 2008-2009 financial crisis. However, estimates of employment effects of new FTAs can be subjective and misleading as they do not account for changes in exchange rates, which may have a wide-ranging effect on prices of internationally traded goods. The study by Petri, et al. attempts to bridge the gap in estimating employment effects of new FTAs, focusing on goods sectors while neglecting services and investment areas. Additional information is needed to determine the actual costs and benefits of liberalizing trade. Estimates also overlook potential broad impacts on the economy, such as consumer benefits, productivity gains, and enhanced employment. The TPP may have a significant impact on the economy and employment. Policymakers should consider a range of estimates on the employment effects of the agreement to gauge its overall impact. Reliable data on specific sector effects is needed to assist those most affected. Initiatives to improve information and data on international agreements are necessary. Initiatives are needed to improve information and data on the impact of international trade on the economy, including services, worker dislocations, and global supply chains in the U.S. economy."
