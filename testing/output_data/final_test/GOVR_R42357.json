    "content": "The omnibus farm bill periodically establishes agricultural and food policy, including federal farm commodity price and income support, conservation, food assistance, agricultural trade, marketing, and rural development policies. These policies are often evaluated, revised, and renewed through the farm bill. The most recent omnibus farm bill is the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246), with many provisions expiring in 2012. Without new legislation, farm commodity support programs may be affected. Without new legislation, outdated permanent statutes in farm commodity support programs could take effect, no longer aligned with current economic objectives and global trading rules. Congress keeps these laws to ensure future attention to agricultural policy. The omnibus farm bill focuses on commodity price and income support, agricultural trade, conservation, and environment. The farm bill addresses various agricultural issues such as trade, conservation, forestry, food assistance, credit, rural development, research, animal agriculture, and marketing programs. It also includes titles on emerging issues like biofuels, specialty crops, and organic agriculture. The omnibus nature of the bill garners support from a wide range of stakeholders, including farm organizations, input suppliers, processors, retailers, consumers, and scientific organizations. The farm bill addresses various agricultural issues and includes titles on emerging topics like biofuels and organic agriculture. It garners support from a wide range of stakeholders, including farm organizations, input suppliers, processors, retailers, consumers, and scientific organizations. The 112th Congress is considering reauthorization of the next farm bill amidst high farm commodity prices, income, and deficit reduction concerns. The current farm safety net is being questioned for restructuring or elimination to redirect financial resources to other initiatives. Proponents want a stronger safety net with enhancements to risk management tools, while opponents cite cost and budget concerns. There are calls for support for small and medium-sized farms, specialty crops, organic agriculture, and other priorities in the farm bill. The 2008 farm bill covers mandatory and discretionary spending for farm commodity programs, crop insurance, nutrition assistance, conservation, trade, rural development, research, education, and agricultural credit. The budget and economic setting for the next farm bill debate are reviewed, along with potential issues that could arise. The farm bill covers mandatory and discretionary spending for various programs including farm commodity, crop insurance, nutrition assistance, conservation, trade, rural development, research, education, and agricultural credit. Mandatory spending is determined by authorizing committees, while discretionary programs are funded separately through annual appropriations bills. The Congressional Budget Office develops baseline projections for mandatory spending under the supervision of the House and Senate Budget Committees. The baseline projection estimates federal spending on mandatory programs under current law, serving as a benchmark for the farm bill budget. New provisions impacting mandatory spending are measured against the baseline, with increases subject to budget constraints like PAYGO requirements. Reductions from the baseline can offset other provisions or reduce the deficit. The January 2012 CBO baseline for continuing mandatory farm bill programs is about $994. The January 2012 CBO baseline for continuing mandatory farm bill programs is approximately $994 billion for the 10-year period FY2013-FY2022. Most of this baseline is for domestic nutrition assistance programs, primarily SNAP, while the rest is divided among various agriculture-related programs. The budget situation for the 2012 farm bill is more difficult and uncertain due to federal debt attention. The amount that can be used to write a farm bill and what will remain for 2013 and beyond is unknown. The uncertainty surrounding deficit reduction beyond the control of agriculture committees has impacted the budget for the 2013 farm bill. Congressional and administration proposals targeting agricultural programs with mandatory funding have not been enacted. Discretionary appropriations for agricultural programs have also decreased in recent years, affecting farm bill opportunities. Budget sequestration is forthcoming in 2013 under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 will reduce the future baseline for farm bill programs, with certain programs exempt from sequestration. The official sequestration amount and scope of programs included are still pending OMB interpretation. Estimates suggest mandatory farm bill programs may face about $16 billion in sequestration over 10 years. The budget picture for nondefense mandatory programs, including agriculture, is clouded by uncertainties. Some programs have assumed future funding, while others do not. Thirty-seven programs from the 2008 farm bill do not have assured funding for the next bill, with three programs accounting for most of the affected amount. Continuing these programs could cost about $10 billion over five years, posing challenges during a contraction from sequestration or deficit reduction. New budget rules enacted in 2010 further restrict funding options. The current budgetary pressures and deficit reduction goals are making it challenging to extend the 2008 farm bill. There is a debate on redesigning farm policy and reallocating the farm bill baseline in a post-sequestration and/or post-deficit reduction environment. Congress faces difficult choices on how much support to provide for agriculture in an era of deficit reduction. The U.S. agricultural sector has been thriving economically since the mid-2000s, with rising commodity prices and land values leading to record farm incomes and reduced debt levels. In 2011, U.S. net farm income reached a record high of $100.9 billion, up 28% from the previous year. Farm asset values are expected to rise to a record $2,340 billion, with the farm debt-to-asset ratio projected to reach a low of 10.4% in 2011. Farmland values are also at a record high, with an average acre of cropland valued at $3,030. In 2011, farm land values reached a record high, with an average acre of cropland valued at $3,030, up over 9% from the previous year. Strong farm income projections were driven by robust U.S. agricultural exports and growth in the corn ethanol industry. This surge in demand, aided by a weak dollar, led to historically low grain and oilseed stocks, supporting higher commodity prices. International trade remains strong for U.S. agriculture despite challenges in multilateral trade negotiations. U.S. officials aim to expand export opportunities through free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia. Robust economic growth in global markets, especially in China, is expected to drive demand for cotton, feed grains, oilseeds, and livestock products in 2012. High commodity prices are supported by growth in corn-based ethanol production and strong livestock prices. The U.S. agricultural sector is in a strong financial position, with regional variations. Livestock producers are facing high feed costs, narrowing profit margins. A severe drought in 2011 led to herd liquidation in some regions. The severe drought in 2011 led to substantial herd liquidation for cattle ranchers in affected regions. The federal government supports farm income and helps manage risks through various programs, including farm commodity price and income support, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. The total cost of farm safety net programs for FY2011 is estimated at $13.5 billion. In FY2011, farm safety net programs cost $13.5 billion, with most attributed to five main crops: corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and rice. These crops accounted for 90% of commodity program payments and crop insurance subsidies. Initially started in the 1930s to raise farm household income during low commodity prices, the programs have evolved to provide direct income and price support payments. Federal crop insurance and commodity stocks management provide income and price support payments for farm businesses. Many policymakers and farmers view federal support as essential for financial survival due to the unpredictable nature of agriculture. However, critics argue that subsidies lead to overproduction on environmentally fragile land and distort markets. The 2008 farm bill's commodity provisions offer support for 26 farm commodities, including food grains, feed grains, oilseeds, upland cotton, peanuts, pulse crops, and milk. Eligible producers receive various types of payments such as \"direct,\" \"counter-cyclical,\" or \"Average.\" In the 2008 farm bill, benefits for producers of certain commodities were expanded to include different types of payments such as \"direct,\" \"counter-cyclical,\" and \"loan deficiency.\" Producers of loan commodities are eligible for nonrecourse marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments. Current farm law also supports sugar and dairy product prices through various mechanisms like nonrecourse loans, quotas, and guaranteed government purchases. The federal government provides support to producers of traditional farm bill commodities through various mechanisms like nonrecourse loans, quotas, and guaranteed government purchases. In contrast, producers of specialty crops and livestock receive little to no direct government support. They manage risks through business diversification, federal crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs. The federal crop insurance program offers risk management tools to address revenue and crop yield losses, with price guarantee levels set before the planting season. Federal crop insurance has grown in importance as a farm risk management tool since the early 1990s, with the federal government paying about 60% of the farmer's crop insurance premium. The program is projected to cost $8.9 billion per year through 2022 and covers a wide range of commodities and regions, with policies covering 264 million acres in 2011. Major crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton are included in most counties. Crop insurance covers a wide range of commodities and regions, with policies covering over 264 million acres in 2011. Specialty crop policies covered more than 7 million acres in 2009, constituting 53% to 75% of specialty crop area. The 2008 farm bill included authorization and funding for five new disaster programs, but they were only authorized for losses up to September 30, 2011. The 2008 farm bill included new disaster programs, such as the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program (SURE) for crop losses and Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) for livestock mortality. These programs were authorized until September 30, 2011, and are not included in future budget estimates. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and Tree Assistance Program (TAP) provide assistance for disaster losses not covered by other programs. The current federal budget constraints may impact the next farm bill's overall spending. The Congressional Budget Office baseline budget for agricultural programs is crucial for funding changes to the farm safety net. Outlays for safety net programs are projected at $150 billion over 10 years, with crop insurance accounting for the largest share of costs. Direct payments are estimated at $49.6 billion over the same period. The costs of farm safety net programs averaged $15.7 billion per year during FY2003 to FY2010, with criticism for being slow to respond to disasters and not providing adequate risk protection. Some argue against farm subsidies, suggesting government funding could be better spent on environmental goals or improving productivity. Critics also mention economic arguments, such as distorting production and benefiting resource owners at the expense of smaller producers. Since fall 2011, various proposals have been suggested to revise the farm safety net, aiming to eliminate direct payments and redirect savings towards new programs addressing shallow losses not covered by crop insurance. The recent surge in U.S. farm income has raised questions about the necessity of nearly $5 billion in farm subsidies. The recent surge in U.S. farm income has raised concerns about the need for $5 billion in direct payments to agricultural landowners, with calls for a loss to be required to trigger federal farm program payments. There is apparent overlap among farm safety net programs, including the ACRE program and crop insurance addressing revenue variability. Simplifying the current farm program mix with a combined approach has been proposed to make it more effective and cost-efficient. The historical evolution of farm policy has primarily benefited producers of major commodities, shaping the current commodity coverage of the farm safety net. To increase commodity coverage, options include enhancing crop insurance for non-program crops, developing a whole-farm program, or revising the current whole-farm insurance product. In the dairy industry, price and income volatility have led to proposals like H.R. 3062 to protect dairy farmer incomes by replacing current dairy product price supports. One proposal (H.R. 3062) aims to replace current dairy product price supports and the MILC income support program with a new program that provides farm payments based on low margins. Critics argue that reducing milk production during low margins could harm the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry. In contrast, the sugar program operates without cost to the federal government and has not received much attention for revision. Producers and processors of sugar beets and sugarcane support keeping the current program unchanged. Producers and processors of sugar beets and sugarcane favor retaining the current sugar program unchanged, citing the jobs and economic activity it generates. On the other hand, food and beverage manufacturers using sugar advocate for program elimination or a shift towards a free market due to higher refined sugar prices. Payment limits for farm commodity programs are contentious, addressing issues of farm size support, payment proportionality, and eligibility criteria. Some policymakers debate payment limits for farm commodity programs, considering factors like production proportionality and recipient eligibility. There is a push to tighten limits to save money and address public concerns about payments to large farms. However, others argue against penalizing larger farms for their efficiencies. The United States, as a WTO member, faces pressure to adjust certain trade-distorting elements of commodity programs. The United States faces pressure from WTO due to findings that payments to cotton producers violate commitments. In response, a 2010 agreement aims to address concerns in the next farm bill. Specialty crop and organic producers advocate for a more inclusive farm bill, seeking benefits currently limited to major commodity producers. Specialty crops and organic crops are eligible for various USDA programs in the omnibus farm bill, including nutrition, conservation, research, crop insurance, disaster assistance, and trade titles. Specialty crops are defined as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture crops, representing a significant portion of U.S. agriculture. In 2007, specialty crop production totaled $42 billion, accounting for over 40% of U.S. crop value. Specialty crops in the U.S. account for over 40% of crop production value, with exports totaling nearly $15.9 billion in 2010. Organic agriculture is a small but growing sector, with farm sales reaching $3.2 billion in 2008. Livestock products make up about 40% of organic farm-level sales, followed by vegetables, fruits, and field crops. The Organic Trade Association (OTA) reports that organic food sales totaled $26.7 billion in 2010, with U.S. exports of all organic products totaling about $2 billion annually. In 2008, there were 14,540 organic farms and ranches covering 4.1 million acres, or about 1% of total U.S. cropland. Production is mainly focused in California, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin. USDA requires that agricultural products labeled as \"organic\" originate from certified farms or handling operations. The 2008 farm bill expanded support for specialty crop and organic programs. The 2008 farm bill expanded support and funding for specialty crop and organic programs under Title X, with estimated mandatory outlays of $0.4 billion. Despite shared interests, there are differences between U.S. specialty crop and organic producers in farm bill priorities. The U.S. horticulture sector is diverse, with advocates pushing for incentives and programs to support producers. The U.S. horticulture sector is diverse, with various groups advocating for different farm bill priorities. Specialty crop growers are represented by the SCFBA, UFPA, PMA, and regional groups like Western Growers. The organic sector is also diverse, with groups like OTA, OFRF, National Organic Coalition, and OCA advocating for their priorities. These interests sometimes overlap with other agricultural groups like NSAC and NFU. The USDA historically has not directly supported specialty crops and organic production, but Congress has authorized programs to benefit fruit and vegetable producers. The Specialty Crop Block Grants Program (SCBGP) is administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and is important for specialty crop and organic producers. The Specialty Crop Block Grants Program (SCBGP) and Farmers Market Promotion Program (FMPP) are key USDA programs supporting the specialty crop industry. SCBGP provides block grants to states, while FMPP offers grants to improve farmers' markets and direct marketing activities. Other programs in Title X support organic production, including the National Organic Program (NOP). The USDA supports organic production through programs like the National Organic Program (NOP) and the National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program. Specialty crop producers benefit from grants like the Value-Added Producer Grant Program and the Market Access Program (MAP) for export promotion. The farm bill also includes provisions for Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) to address barriers to exports. Additionally, federal cash assistance is provided to schools and other programs. The USDA provides federal support for fruit and vegetable purchases through various programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program in schools, Section 32 program, DoD Fresh program, and pilot projects in SNAP. USDA's research and extension services also support specialty crop and organic production. The farm bill includes programs like the Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI) to address food safety hazards for specialty crop producers. USDA research programs for organic production are the Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) and the Organic Transitions Integrated Research Program. Title X of the farm bill focuses on preventing and eradicating plant pests and diseases for specialty crops. Incentives are provided for specialty crop growers to participate in voluntary conservation programs. The 2008 farm bill incentivized participation in voluntary conservation programs for specialty crop growers, provided additional assistance to organic producers, and supported sustainable farming strategies through programs like SARE grants and the ATTRA project. Other programs in the bill focused on preventing plant pests and diseases for specialty crops. The 2008 farm bill expanded planting flexibility for fruits and vegetables on cropland enrolled in farm commodity support programs, opposed by specialty crop growers but supported by food processors. It also increased crop insurance and disaster assistance for specialty crop and organic producers, including higher payments for tree removal and replacement costs for orchard crops. The 2008 farm bill included provisions to improve insurance coverage for organic crops and prioritize loans for producers converting to sustainable or organic practices. The specialty crop industry is requesting increased mandatory spending for programs supporting fruit and vegetable crops due to their importance in various policy areas. Calls for increased investment in organic products are driven by demand growth and equity concerns. Calls for increased investment in the organic sector are driven by demand growth and equity concerns. The Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance (SCFBA) recommends maintaining funding for primary nutrition programs and expanding funding for Specialty Crop Block Grants. The Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance (SCFBA) recommends maintaining funding for primary nutrition programs and expanding funding for Specialty Crop Block Grants, USDA APHIS plant pest and disease programs, and the Specialty Crop Research Initiative. SCFBA also suggests maintaining planting flexibility restrictions, eliminating the pilot program from the 2008 farm bill, and increasing payment limitations on tree replacement. Additionally, SCFBA requests maintaining current MAP funding, expanding funding for TASC, expanding relevant conservation programs for specialty crop producers, and continued funding for the Value-Added Producer Grant Program. The SCFBA recommends continued funding for the Value-Added Producer Grant Program and suggests changes to H-2A workers under the Rural Development Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants program. Organic industry recommendations focus on funding for existing programs like NOP, OREI, National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program, and organic data collection at USDA. They also support improving organic producers' access to USDA conservation programs, crop insurance, marketing issues, and addressing potential losses from contamination of organic crops by genetically engineered crops. Livestock and poultry producers traditionally lack price and income support programs in omnibus farm bills. Livestock and poultry industries rely on federal government for trade dispute resolution, establishing import/export rules, and ensuring product safety. Public policy concerns include food safety, environmental protection, and animal welfare. The 2008 farm bill included Title XI specifically for livestock and poultry issues, addressing animal health, diseases, and inspection. The 2008 farm bill included Title XI focusing on livestock and poultry issues, covering areas such as animal health, diseases, inspection, production contracts, and ongoing concerns like mandatory price reporting and country-of-origin labeling. It also included provisions for food safety improvements, a national sheep industry improvement center, and a study on the use of manure as fertilizer. Some livestock industry groups have suggested excluding a livestock title in the next farm bill. The NCBA aims to reduce federal involvement in cattle production by eliminating or reducing the livestock title in the next farm bill. They argue that previous farm bill initiatives like USDA's proposed rule on livestock marketing and COOL policies have not benefited cattle producers. Some groups advocate for including a livestock title in the next farm bill to address competition issues, given the market consolidation in the livestock and poultry industries. Past Congresses have debated market competition measures in omnibus farm bills, with some measures being rejected and others, like production contract provisions, being enacted. In June 2010, USDA proposed a rule to implement sections of the 2008 farm bill regarding the Packers and Stockyards Act. The rule aimed to clarify conduct violations in livestock and poultry markets for fair competition. However, it was controversial, with supporters believing it would increase transparency and fairness, while opponents argued it would interfere with market efficiency and lead to more litigation. In 2011, the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act prevented USDA from implementing the rule. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-55) prevented USDA from implementing most provisions of a proposed rule on livestock and poultry markets. In response, USDA issued a final rule in December 2011 with only four of the original 13 provisions. Congressional concern about competition in these markets persists, with bills introduced in the 112th Congress addressing these issues. The Livestock Marketing Fairness Act (S. 1026 and H.R. 2631) aims to prohibit certain forward contracts. Feed costs, the largest input for producers, are currently high, accounting for 50% to 80% of cash. Interest in addressing consolidation and competition issues in livestock and poultry markets is expected to continue. Livestock and poultry producers are concerned about agricultural policies that can raise feed prices, which account for 50% to 80% of their cash operating expenses. The 2008 farm bill authorized three new livestock disaster assistance programs: Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP). These programs provide compensation for disaster losses not covered under other programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized three livestock disaster assistance programs: Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), and Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP). These programs compensate producers for disaster losses not covered under other programs, but all three expired in 2011. Reauthorization in the next farm bill may be challenging due to lack of baseline funding. Additionally, retail food stores must now disclose the country of origin for certain meat products, leading to concerns from Canada and Mexico about the impact on their livestock sectors. In November 2011, the WTO ruled that COOL violates trade standards, giving the US until March 23, 2012, to appeal. Failure to comply could lead to trade retaliation. Congress may address this in the next farm bill. Farm animals are not covered under the Animal Welfare Act but are subject to other federal laws on humane transport and slaughter. The federal government has a history of providing credit assistance to farmers, justified by factors like asymmetric information and lack of competition in rural lending markets. Increased interest in animal welfare for farm animals could lead to debate in the next farm bill. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides direct loans to farmers who cannot qualify for regular commercial credit and guarantees repayment of certain loans. FSA targets lending to disadvantaged groups like beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers, making it a lender of last resort. Special loan pools are available based on race and gender. FSA accounts for about 2% of total farm debt through direct loans and guarantees another 4%-5% of loans. The Farm Credit System (FCS) is a federally chartered private lender serving agriculture-related borrowers, accounting for 40% of farm debt. Farmer Mac, another government-sponsored enterprise, provides a secondary market for agricultural loans. Other agricultural lenders include commercial banks, life insurance companies, and individuals. The 2008 farm bill made adjustments to eligibility criteria and lending limits for FSA, FCS, and Farmer Mac. Credit issues are not expected to be a major part of the next farm bill, with potential changes not anticipated to be significant. Issues likely to arise include targeting FSA lending resources to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and providing support for emerging agricultural sectors like local food systems and organic agriculture. The federal government supports U.S. agricultural exports through various programs, including export market development, export credit guarantees, and direct export subsidies. Legislative authorizations for these programs are included in Title III of the 2008 farm bill and are administered by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service. Funding for these programs comes from USDA's borrowing authority. The Market Access Program (MAP) and other export market development programs aim to assist U.S. industry in expanding overseas markets for agricultural products. These programs, funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, have faced potential cuts in deficit reduction proposals. The 2008 farm bill extended funding for these programs until FY2012, expanded support to include organic products, and increased funds to address barriers for U.S. specialty crops. Additionally, the bill reauthorized FAS-administered export credit guarantee programs. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized FAS-administered export credit guarantee programs, including GSM-102 short-term guarantees and Facilities Financing Guarantees. GSM-103 and SCGP were repealed due to WTO violations and high default rates. The bill also reauthorized the Dairy Export Incentive Program. The 2008 farm bill repealed the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and reauthorized the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP). Questions arise about the effectiveness and appropriateness of government support for agricultural export promotion programs like MAP and FMDP. Critics argue that these programs may be considered as corporate welfare and suggest that funds could be better spent on educating U.S. firms about exporting and overcoming trade barriers. The 2008 farm bill made changes to agricultural export credit guarantee programs in response to a WTO dispute settlement. The bill repealed GSM-103 and lifted the 1% cap on loan origination fees for GSM-102. These changes were made to address the dispute panel's findings of export subsidies inconsistent with WTO agreements. The 2008 farm bill repealed GSM-103 and removed the 1% cap on loan origination fees for GSM-102 in response to a WTO dispute settlement regarding export credit guarantee programs. Brazil has criticized the U.S. response as inadequate, and discussions on reauthorizing trade programs will review U.S. credit guarantee programs in line with WTO commitments to eliminate agricultural subsidies by 2013. The Export Enhancement Program (EEP) subsidies ended in 1995 and were not present in the 2002-2007 period covered by the farm bill. Agricultural conservation policies expanded from soil and water issues in the 1930s to include broader environmental concerns by the 1980s. Many current conservation programs were established in the 1985 farm bill, which included a conservation title for the first time. Since its inclusion in the 1985 farm bill, the conservation title has been significant, with programs reauthorized, modified, and expanded. The approach remains unchanged, focusing on voluntary farmer participation through land rental payments, cost-sharing conservation practices, technical assistance, education, and research. Congress continues to address concerns about program funding, policy objectives, effectiveness, geographic emphasis, and federal assistance structure in each omnibus farm bill. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized and modified existing conservation programs while creating new ones, expanding USDA's conservation activities. Over 20 agricultural conservation programs are managed by USDA, mainly by the NRCS. Each farm bill since 1985 has increased the number of programs and funding levels to address natural resource issues. These programs have unique provisions and eligibility requirements, although they share similarities and are administered with slight differences. Farm bill conservation programs are categorized into working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, conservation compliance programs, and other programs. Budget constraints are driving the debate on conservation in the next farm bill, with programs authorized in the 2008 farm bill set to expire in 2012. Issues under discussion include program consolidation, environmental regulation, and the balance between land retirement and working lands programs. The 2008 farm bill conservation title received increased funding, but since then, program funds have been reduced annually, impacting the ability of programs to benefit producers and the environment. Advocates argue that these reductions alter the farm bill's intent and create a backlog of applications for funding. The 2008 farm bill conservation title received increased funding, but since then, program funds have been reduced annually, impacting the ability of programs to benefit producers and the environment. Critics argue that reductions create a backlog of applications for funding, while others believe overall conservation funding has not decreased. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extends the expiration date of selected farm bill conservation programs to FY2014 to address concerns about funding reductions affecting the farm bill baseline. The 2008 farm bill conservation title received increased funding, but program funds have been reduced annually since then. The FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act extends the expiration date of selected farm bill conservation programs to FY2014 to address concerns about funding reductions affecting the farm bill baseline. Maintaining the conservation program baseline for the next farm bill does not guarantee that funds will continue to support conservation programs beyond 2012. The current conservation portfolio includes over 20 distinct programs with annual spending exceeding $5 billion. Program consolidation in farm bill conservation programs with annual spending over $5 billion aims to reduce overlap, generate savings, and simplify policies. While consolidation could lead to potential savings, it may also remove the original geographic or issue-specific emphasis created by Congress. Conservation programs are voluntary federal policies addressing environmental impacts in agriculture. The federal government addresses environmental impacts in agriculture through regulation and conservation programs. The farm bill debate may focus on strengthening voluntary responses to environmental issues through conservation programs, which could influence funding allocation. Land retirement programs like the CRP initially aimed at soil conservation and reducing commodity production during economic downturns, but later showed potential for multiple benefits. The potential benefits of land retirement programs go beyond soil conservation, including benefits to wildlife habitat, air and water quality, and carbon sequestration. However, high commodity prices and incentives to plant crops may be decreasing producer interest in land retirement. This could lead to a shift in farm bill conservation policy towards conservation working lands programs. The 1985 farm bill created highly erodible lands (HEL) conservation and wetland conservation compliance programs, tying farm program benefits to conservation standards. Amendments have been made over the years, with the 1996 farm bill removing crop insurance premium subsidies and adding production flexibility contracts. The debate continues on the appropriate mix of land retirement and working lands programs. The debate on compliance requirements for farm program benefits like direct payments and conservation programs is ongoing. Direct payments are under scrutiny due to high commodity prices, with potential reductions in the next farm bill. Concerns exist that without direct payments, producers may lack incentives for conservation compliance. Without direct payments, producers may lack incentives for conservation compliance. Advocates propose including crop insurance premium subsidies as a benefit tied to conservation compliance. However, industry organizations argue that recouping subsidies for noncompliance could deter producers from purchasing crop insurance. Domestic nutrition programs account for nearly 80% of spending in the farm bill, including SNAP, TEFAP, CSFP, FDPIR, and other programs. The nutrition title of the 2008 farm bill, including the SNAP program, accounted for the majority of spending. Changes in SNAP led to significant new costs over five and ten years. Most nutrition assistance programs are mandatory entitlements, except for CSFP, FDPIR, and TEFAP. SNAP is an appropriated entitlement with limited spending. Discretionarily funded programs include CSFP and administrative costs. The farm bill reauthorizes discretionary programs like CSFP, TEFAP administrative costs, and FDPIR funding. Programs like WIC, National School Lunch Program, and SNAP are not reauthorized in the farm bill. SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, provides benefits to low-income households through an EBT card. In FY2011, SNAP had an average monthly participation of 44.7 million individuals. In FY2011, participation in the SNAP program was 44.7 million individuals with federal spending totaling approximately $75.3 billion. SNAP provides eligibility based on low income and limited assets, with specific income and asset thresholds for qualification. The 2008 farm bill made changes to SNAP, including increasing benefits and liberalizing income eligibility standards. Minimum benefits were raised and indexed, and minimum benefits for recipient households were set at 10% of the maximum monthly benefit for a one-person household. The 2008 farm bill included policies related to program integrity, such as participant disqualification and transitional SNAP benefits. It also indexed the asset limit for inflation and excluded tax-recognized retirement and education savings from asset calculation. Changes were made to benefit issuance processes, including the use of telephonic signatures. USDA was given authority to recoup over-issuances from states for major systemic errors. Pilot projects were authorized to improve participant health, with funding for point of purchase incentives. The 2008 farm bill included policies related to program integrity and benefit issuance processes. It authorized pilot projects to improve participant health with funding for point of purchase incentives, including the Healthy Incentives Pilot in Hampden County, Massachusetts. TEFAP provides food commodities to states to supplement food aid for needy persons, with eligibility decisions made by states and involvement from national emergency provider networks like Feeding America. Each state receives discretionary money to fund administration and distribution expenses of commodities. Entitlements to TEFAP commodities are supplemented with bonus commodities acquired through USDA agriculture support programs. The 2008 farm bill increased mandatory funding for TEFAP commodities, with immediate infusions of $50 million in FY2008 and $250 million in FY2009. Funding for FY2010 through FY2012 was adjusted for food-price inflation. The farm bill also increased annual appropriations for TEFAP administrative and distribution costs to $100 million. CSFP provides supplemental foods to low-income elderly persons, pregnant women, infants, and children through projects in 35 states and the District of Columbia. Eligibility for elderly participants is limited to those with income below 130% of the federal poverty level. CSFP participants must have income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, with a higher limit for women, infants, and children. The majority of participants are elderly. USDA purchases and distributes food specific to nutritional needs. Grantees receive funding for administrative costs based on prior year's number of persons served. USDA cannot prioritize assistance among different groups. Under the SFMNP, low-income seniors receive vouchers for fresh produce at farmers' markets. The program's funding was increased from $15 million to $20.6 million per year in 2008. Indian tribal organizations can opt for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations instead of regular food stamp benefits. The school meals programs are also reauthorized. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for the SFMNP from $15 million to $20.6 million per year. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, also known as the \"snack program,\" allows schools to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables as snacks. Funding is allocated to states based on a formula, prioritizing schools with high proportions of low-income students. The law also allows for additional purchases of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The 2008 law requires USDA to purchase additional fruits, vegetables, and nuts for domestic food assistance programs. It also allows schools and institutions to use geographic preference for procuring locally grown agricultural products. The 1996 farm bill established a program for community food projects, while the 2008 farm bill funded a grant for a nonprofit organization to support healthy urban food initiatives. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for purchasing more fruits and vegetables for food assistance programs and allowing schools to prioritize locally grown products. A grant was awarded to a nonprofit organization to establish a \"healthy urban food enterprise development center\" for underserved communities. Discussions on the current farm bill are influenced by the Budget Control Act's deficit reduction framework. Local nutrition and producer groups are advocating for increased funding and participation in nutrition programs. In the 112th Congress, there is interest in changing categorical eligibility for SNAP applicants based on their receipt of benefits from other low-income programs. S. 1658 and H.R. 3111 propose limitations to categorical eligibility in SNAP, but an amendment to the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill to prohibit this was defeated. The use of FY2012 funds for categorical eligibility in SNAP was proposed but defeated. Asset limits in SNAP are linked to categorical eligibility, with some states adding asset limits to their programs. The next farm bill may reconsider the role of asset tests and eligible foods or retailers for SNAP benefits. Media attention has focused on SNAP use at fast food restaurants and for perceived \"junk food.\" The state restaurant option allows states to choose restaurants to serve those in need. In FY2010, $20 million of SNAP benefits were redeemed at \"meal delivery/private restaurants.\" USDA denied New York City's waiver to disallow SNAP benefits for soda purchases, sparking debate on balancing food insecurity and obesity prevention. The Healthy Incentives Pilot evaluation could influence policy options in the farm bill. Policymakers view SNAP as a way to improve access to healthy foods and support local farms. Bills in the 112th Congress aim to address SNAP issues. Policies in the 112th Congress aim to expand farm-to-consumer retailers' access to wireless EBT machines, promoting local farmers and increasing low-income community access to fresh foods. Bills also focus on encouraging schools to purchase local crops and foods, potentially including more locally grown options in USDA commodity food distribution. In the 112th Congress, U.S. agricultural commodities are provided as emergency and economic development assistance in response to food security issues in developing countries. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized various food aid programs, including the Food for Peace Act Title II administered by USAID, with an average annual budget of $2 billion. Additionally, a pilot program for Local and Regional Food Aid Procurement Projects (LRP) was established. The Food for Peace Act Title II, administered by USAID, has an average annual budget of $2 billion. The 2008 farm bill made changes to food aid programs, focusing on humanitarian assistance and global food security, with authorized funding levels increased to $2.5 billion. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for food aid programs to $2.5 billion, introduced innovations for cost-effective and timely delivery, reauthorized programs like Farmer-to-Farmer and Food for Progress, and extended the McGovern-Dole program. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for food aid programs to $2.5 billion and extended the authority for the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) through FY2012. The focus of the farm bill debate was on making food aid delivery more efficient and effective, with discussions on funding levels, program priorities, quality of food aid, local procurement, and costs and benefits of cargo. The 2008 farm bill increased annual authorization for Title II Food for Peace programs to $2.5 billion, but actual appropriations have fallen short every year. Future funding for international food aid and the \"safe box\" for non-emergency food aid projects are likely to be debated in the next farm bill. During the 2008 farm bill debate, concerns were raised about the adequacy of food aid resources for emergencies. Advocates of the safe box argue that it provides funding for development projects by monetizing commodities. However, organizations like Oxfam worry that the safe box limits resources for emergency assistance. USAID predicts a 50% increase in global demand for emergency food aid over the next 20 years. The role and level of the safe box in development food aid may be discussed in the next farm bill. Food assistance globally is expected to increase by 50% over the next 20 years. With limited funding, there is a need to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of programs, focusing on the nutritional quality of the products provided. Advances in food technologies, products, and logistics, along with improvements in nutrition science and supply chain management, offer opportunities to enhance food aid quality. These issues are likely to be important in farm bill discussions. The recent release of reports identified issues and recommended improvements in food aid programs. One contentious issue was using funds to purchase commodities locally or regionally overseas instead of U.S. commodities for international food aid. The Bush Administration proposed using some funds for local and regional procurement to provide emergency food aid more efficiently. Other donors like the EU, Japan, and Canada provide food assistance in cash and technical assistance. The 2008 farm bill included a compromise for a pilot project to assess the effects of local or regional purchases of food aid for emergency relief, using $60 million of CCC funds over four years. The future of the pilot project and the use of Food for Peace funds for local or regional purchases may be discussed in the next farm bill. U.S. cargo preference laws require certain government-owned or government-financed cargo to be carried on U.S.-flag vessels to support the U.S. merchant marine and commercial sealift capability. Cargo preference regulations mandate that 75% of U.S. food aid must be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, leading to higher shipping costs. The U.S. government spends millions annually on excess shipping costs for food aid programs. MARAD compensates for some costs, and cargo preference may be addressed in the next farm bill for cost reduction. The USDA's Agricultural Research, Education, and Extension programs have evolved since 1862, with four agencies carrying out its mission: the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the Economic Research Service (ERS), and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The 2008 farm bill made significant changes to the structure and organization of USDA's Research, Education, and Extension (REE) programs. Funding for REE programs is allocated through various mechanisms, including formula fund programs and competitive grant mechanisms like the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Farm bills authorize, extend, and amend existing authorities for REE programs, with most of the $2.7 billion funding determined through discretionary appropriations. The 2008 farm bill restructured the REE mission area, creating the Research, Education, and Extension Office (REEO) and establishing the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to oversee extramural research. CSREES was replaced by NIFA, which launched in October 2009. The bill also authorized the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI). The 2008 farm bill established the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) under NIFA, replacing previous grant programs. It also created new research initiatives for specialty crops, organic agriculture, nutrition, bioenergy, and pollinators. Additionally, it increased funding for \"1890 institutions\" and expanded eligibility for federal grants to include Hispanic-serving institutions. The 2008 farm bill established the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) under NIFA, replacing previous grant programs and creating new research initiatives. The current fiscal situation and pressure in Congress may affect agricultural research in the next farm bill, with uncertainty about sustaining funding for related activities. Several mandatory programs authorized in the 2008 farm bill may need additional funding in the next bill. In the next farm bill, funding for various mandatory programs, including research initiatives like the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, Organic Agriculture Research Initiative, and Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, will need to be paid for with offsets. Additionally, programs in the energy title totaling about $1.9 billion over five years also lack a budget baseline. USDA provides federal funding for intramural and extramural research activities. Federal funds for extramural agricultural research, education, and extension activities are distributed through block grants, competitive grants, and congressional earmarks. Proposals may redirect federal formula funds to competitive grants in the next farm bill. State Agricultural Experiment Stations have diversified funding sources over time due to decreased federal funding. The SAES system has diversified funding sources over time, with an increasing emphasis on competitive grant funding by USDA. Formula funding supporters argue for stable and recurring funds allocated by state and local entities, while competitive grant proponents believe in peer-reviewed quality research despite funding uncertainties. The USDA allocates a significant portion of its research funding to intramural research agencies like ARS, ERS, and NASS. There have been criticisms about the lack of coordination between intramural and extramural research objectives, particularly in ARS. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) competitive grants program focuses on six core themes. The USDA's grants program focuses on six core themes: plant and animal health, food safety, renewable energy, agriculture systems, and economics. Additional funding has been allocated to research areas like global food security, obesity prevention, and climate change. Congress may address USDA REE program priorities in the next farm bill. Grant funds cover indirect costs of research institutions. The 2008 farm bill increased the cap on indirect costs for USDA grants to 22%, with discussions of raising it further to 30% in the next bill. This could attract more diverse talent but may also lead to higher program costs and fewer grants. Rural development has been included in farm bills since 1973. The current debates about the future of rural America focus on creating new competitive advantages in rural areas to better compete globally. Policymakers recognize the need for new approaches to federal assistance beyond piecemeal programming. The rural development title of farm bills supports infrastructure and business creation in rural areas. The 2008 farm bill expanded rural business development, including innovative approaches like bioenergy and local food production. It also aimed to address the diversity among rural communities, with some thriving while others struggle due to declining industries and outmigration. Title VI of the bill focused on expanding broadband access, creating micro-entrepreneurial assistance programs, and authorizing regional economic development authorities. The 2008 farm bill introduced new provisions for rural economic development, including the creation of three regional economic development authorities. It expanded the definition of \"rural\" to include areas rural in character, allowing for more areas to be eligible for USDA loans and grants. Other programs included loans for locally produced agricultural food products and a Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program to support rural entrepreneurs with limited access to credit and capital. The 2008 farm bill introduced provisions for rural economic development, including three regional economic development commissions. These provisions aimed to increase equity capital in rural areas through various programs, but not all have been implemented or funded as authorized. Only the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program received mandatory funding in the FY2011 appropriations act, with funding being zeroed out in the FY2012 Agriculture Appropriations Act. Funding for the program was zeroed out, except for the Northern Border Regional Commission. The House-passed FY2012 appropriations bill showed little support for local and regional food production efforts, but various groups are backing the idea to improve access to fresh produce in low-income urban areas. Secretary Tom Vilsack's Regional Innovation Initiative focuses on economic development pillars like broadband and biofuels, as well as linking local food production with ecosystem markets and forest restoration. Some policymakers argue that current farm policies heavily rely on commodity support for a few sectors, which has limited impact on most rural areas. Rural manufacturing faces challenges from foreign competition, while service employment tends to be lower-wage. Economic development efforts focus on entrepreneurial strategies and new markets for agricultural products, aiming to capitalize on local strengths. To attract relocating businesses, approaches aim to capitalize on an area's social, economic, and environmental assets to build on existing strengths. Developing a local entrepreneurial culture is crucial. The mixed success of past efforts suggests a need to reexamine federal assistance to rural areas, with a focus on socioeconomic relations between rural and urban areas for more successful development outcomes. Redesigning existing programs to target regional efforts could lead to more successful rural development outcomes. The current application processes for program loans and grants can be a barrier for rural projects, especially in smaller, poorer areas. Limited funding for rural and regional planning efforts weakens development outcomes, and technical assistance support for strategic planning could benefit many rural communities. Coordination among federal agencies targeting rural areas is essential for effective development strategies. In the current budget environment, advancing new approaches to rural development in the next farm bill may be challenging. Congress is concerned about the need to reexamine federal approaches to rural development and better target programs to overall development strategies. The new farm bill will be crucial in addressing these issues, with a focus on renewable energy due to the rise in fuel prices and biofuel production. The USDA renewable energy programs focus on promoting U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and biodiesel. The 2002 farm bill was the first to include an energy title, authorizing grants and loans for research in renewable energy. The 2002 farm bill included an energy title (Title IX) that authorized grants, loans, and loan guarantees for research on agriculture-based renewable energy. Subsequent energy bills in 2005 and 2007 expanded renewable energy programs, with the 2008 farm bill focusing on non-corn feedstocks for biofuels in response to concerns about increased corn use for ethanol production. This bill also contained an energy title (Title IX) that expanded programs to support renewable energy production and use. The 2008 farm bill included new renewable-energy provisions in various titles, such as rural development, research, livestock, and tax. Key biofuels-related provisions included expanding the Biobased Markets Program, additional support for biorefinery development, restructuring the Repowering Assistance Program, and establishing the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for renewable energy, such as the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels (BPAB), Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI), Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP), and Sun Grant Initiative programs for advanced biofuels research at universities. Initiative programs for advanced biofuels research at universities and federally funded laboratories are administered by various agencies within USDA. The 2008 farm bill authorized significant funding for energy programs, including grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Mandatory funding included $320 million for BAP, $300 million for BPAB, and $255 million for REAP, with BCAP receiving open-ended funding based on program participation. Additionally, discretionary funds of $1.7 billion were authorized, including $600 million for BAP. The 2008 farm bill authorized significant funding for energy programs, including grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Discretionary appropriations to Title IX energy programs have been below authorized levels through FY2012. Most Title IX programs fund similar projects like anaerobic digesters and wind. Expired energy programs may survive by offsetting costs with reductions in other mandatory programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized funding for energy programs, including grants, loans, and loan guarantees. Most programs fund projects like anaerobic digesters, wind turbines, solar panels, and biofuels. There is potential for overlap in projects funded by different agencies. Some policymakers suggest merging or eliminating energy programs to reduce redundancy. Some energy programs may be merged or eliminated to reduce redundancy, while others argue for the merits of specific programs. Ethanol-blended fuels burn hotter than regular gasoline, stressing motors and parts. Automakers warranty vehicles to run on gasoline with up to 10% ethanol, known as the \"blend wall.\" If all gasoline contained 10% ethanol, only about 14 billion gallons could be produced, falling short of the Renewable Fuel Standard mandates. The EPA has issued waivers for ethanol blending. The EPA has issued waivers for ethanol blending up to 15% in newer vehicles. Infrastructure issues like the lack of flex-fuel vehicles and high-blend-ratio pumps may limit blending rates. USDA aimed to install 10,000 blender pumps by 2016 to address this. U.S. ethanol production has consumed 40% of the annual corn crop by 2010. The growth in ethanol demand for corn has affected various agricultural markets, sparking a \"food-versus-fuel\" debate. The 2008 farm bill shifted focus towards non-corn biofuels due to concerns about costs and uncertainties in producing cellulosic feedstocks. The development of commercial cellulosic biofuels has been slow, raising doubts about meeting federal mandates. EPA has waived the cellulosic biofuels mandate for the first three years. The EPA has waived the cellulosic biofuels mandate for the first three years, leading to slow investment in the sector. Advocates are concerned about the lack of support for BCAP and the need for additional REAP funding to overcome infrastructure shortcomings. The \"blend wall\" is hindering domestic consumption of ethanol, leading to increased exports. The United States has been exporting ethanol and its byproducts since late 2010, raising concerns about energy security. Anti-dumping investigations by major trading partners could impact the U.S. biofuels sector. The country's forestlands, totaling nearly 751 million acres, provide wood for various products and environmental services. The USDA Forest Service manages a significant portion of these lands. The USDA Forest Service manages a significant portion of U.S. forestlands, providing technical and financial assistance to private landowners. The next farm bill may include a forestry title to modify existing programs and establish new options for forestry research and land management. Forestry assistance programs, managed by the State and Private Forestry branch of the Forest Service, receive funding through annual appropriations acts. These programs include Forest Health Management for pest control, Cooperative Fire Assistance for fire departments, and Cooperative Forestry Assistance for forest stewardship and conservation efforts. The Urban and Community Forestry program provides financial and technical assistance for forestry activities in urban and community settings. Economic Action offers support for diversifying forest-dependent rural communities. There are no forestry-specific cost-share assistance programs for private forests, but forestry practices are accepted in farmland conservation programs. The International Forestry and Forest Inventory programs are smaller initiatives. The threat of wildfires to forests and communities has increased, leading to the authorization of a community wildfire protection program in the 2002 farm bill, although funding has been limited. Interest in producing energy from woody biomass and other renewable sources is driven by supply efforts to reduce wildfire threats and control invasive species, as well as by state and federal requirements for renewable transportation fuels and electricity production. Various programs exist to support biomass energy production, including those in the 2008 farm bill. These energy programs face budgetary challenges, and a new farm bill may extend, expand, alter, or replace them. Invasive species threaten forests and wildlife, with options to prevent their spread being a potential farm bill issue. Landowners do not receive compensation for ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and wildlife habitats. Developing markets for these services could be a solution. One option to address the lack of compensation for ecosystem services is to develop markets for these services, as outlined in the 2008 farm bill. The provision in \u00a7 2709 may be extended, expanded, altered, or replaced with \"green payments\" to incentivize environmentally friendly practices by farmers and landowners."
