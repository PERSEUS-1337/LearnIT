SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS FOR AFFECTED PARTICIPANTS. Authorization for Payment to Affected Participants: The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to pay affected participants a one-time lump sum determined by the Secretary. Information procurement may be contracted to carry out this section. An affected participant is defined under the USEC Privatization Act. The Secretary will pay affected participants a one-time lump sum based on the actuarial present value of their accrued benefits under the pension plan from which a transfer of assets and liabilities was made. The payment is determined by the ratio of the participant's accrued benefits to the total accrued benefits of all affected participants under the same plan before the transfer. The total recoverable amount is calculated as the excess of the present value of benefits that would have been accrued by affected participants under the pension plan if no transfer had occurred, over the present value of benefits accrued by all affected participants under the plan. The Secretary will determine payments under this section by considering benefits accrued and accruable under the pension plans involved in the transfer under the USEC Privatization Act. The Secretary will provide for pro rata reductions in payment amounts to affected participants to adjust for amounts provided in appropriation Acts for the program under subsection (a). The Secretary may make findings of facts and decisions on participant rights for payments under this section. Regulations must be issued within 60 days of enactment, requiring applicants to consent to information release. Public notice will be given to potential eligible individuals, and applications for payment must be submitted within 240 days of enactment. The Secretary must make timely payments to affected participants within 180 days of application submission. Participants can choose to treat the payment as a rollover contribution to an IRA within 1 year of receiving the payment. Contributions to individual retirement plans are not included in gross income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Contributions are treated as distributions and transferred to the IRA within 60 days. Special rules apply for Roth IRAs. If a contribution is made to a Roth IRA, it will be included in gross income over a 2-taxable-year period unless the taxpayer elects otherwise. The Secretary must provide a hearing upon request by an affected participant who believes their rights have been prejudiced by a decision. The Secretary may hold a hearing upon request by an affected participant within 60 days of receiving notice of a decision. The Secretary is authorized to conduct investigations and proceedings as necessary. Judicial review is available to any affected participant. Any affected participant can seek a review of the Secretary's final decision through a civil action within 60 days of receiving notice. The action must be filed in the district court where the participant resides or has a principal place of business. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has the power to review and make a final judgment on the Secretary's decision in a civil action filed within 60 days by an affected participant. The court's judgment is final but can be reviewed in the same manner as other civil actions. Any action filed under this section will survive even if there is a change in the Secretary. The Secretary is responsible for all payments and costs under this section, reporting payments to participants and the IRS, and answering questions. Employers are not responsible for communication, payments, or reporting. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary is responsible for communication, payments, reporting, and answering questions. No third party liability is imposed on the operator of the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky. SEC. 4. RE-ENRICHMENT PLAN. The Secretary must develop a plan to re-enrich and sell uranium tailings within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The plan includes seeking a contract for re-enrichment at government-owned sites in Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio. The contract for re-enrichment at the Paducah facility must involve 50 percent of materials in cylinders, starting within 90 days of the plan's publication. The Secretary can suspend or cancel the contract if necessary. The Paducah facility operator must fulfill re-enrichment obligations or face contract suspension. The Secretary will sell the product of re-enrichment and 50% of uranium tailings to qualified buyers. The Secretary will give preference to qualified buyers committed to re-enrichment of materials in the United States. The Secretary will also seek a contract with the operator of the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky for re-enrichment. The Secretary may defer negotiation of a contract for re-enrichment of materials in cylinders not sold, or sell the materials under specific terms if no contract is entered within 270 days."
