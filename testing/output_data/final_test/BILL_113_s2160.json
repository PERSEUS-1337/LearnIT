    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Native American Children's Safety Act\" and includes provisions for character investigations. Section 408 of the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act is amended to include provisions for foster care placements in Tribal Court Proceedings for individuals 18 years and older. The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act is amended to include provisions for temporary placement of Indian children with a parent or Indian custodian in foster care, institution, guardian, or conservator's home if the parent or custodian cannot have the child returned on demand and parental rights have not been terminated. An Indian custodian is defined as someone with legal custody of an Indian child under tribal or state law, or to whom temporary care has been transferred by the parent. The term 'parent' refers to a biological parent or an Indian who has legally adopted an Indian child. A 'tribal court' is a court with jurisdiction over foster care placements, established under tribal law or custom. The term 'tribal social services agency' refers to the agency responsible for foster care services on an Indian reservation. Foster care placements cannot be ordered in any proceeding where an Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction. The Indian tribe's social services agency must investigate the character of individuals involved in a foster care placement and ensure they meet the tribe's established standards of character. The tribal social services agency must conduct criminal records checks, including fingerprint-based checks, and check child abuse and neglect registries for individuals involved in foster care placements. The Indian tribe may impose additional requirements for foster care placements, and no placement shall be ordered if an investigation reveals abuse or neglect by the individual. The tribal social services agency must meet specific requirements within 14 days of a court proceeding involving a person found guilty of certain crimes or listed on a registry. Emergency foster care placements are exempt from this deadline. Each Indian tribe must establish procedures to recertify foster homes or institutions for placements within 180 days of this subsection's enactment. The procedures should ensure the safety of the home for the Indian child and all individuals residing or employed there. Each covered individual residing in the home or employed at the institution must undergo a character investigation as per regulations or guidance issued. The Secretary will issue regulations within 180 days for character investigations of covered individuals in foster care placements, following consultation with Indian tribes. The regulations require self-reporting by foster care homes or institutions where a covered individual resides if they have knowledge of the individual committing certain crimes. The regulations include procedures for emergency foster care placements and certifying compliance with the Act."
