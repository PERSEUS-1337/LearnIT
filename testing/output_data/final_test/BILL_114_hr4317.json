    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Reliable Subcontractors Act of 2016\" or \"PROS Act of 2016\" aims to provide small business subcontractors ratings for past performance on a contract. The Small Business Act is amended to establish a pilot program for small business subcontractors to request past performance ratings for covered contracts. Subcontractors can apply for a past performance rating in the Federal Government's system. The Small Business Act establishes a pilot program for small business subcontractors to request past performance ratings for covered contracts. Subcontractors can apply for past performance ratings with written evidence and suggested ratings, which will be reviewed by the contracting officer and prime contractor within 30 days. The Small Business Act pilot program allows subcontractors to request past performance ratings for contracts. If the contracting officer and prime contractor agree on a rating or fail to respond within 30 days, the agreed-upon rating will be entered into the system. If there is a disagreement on the rating, it will be resolved accordingly. If the contracting officer or prime contractor fail to respond and the responding individual disagrees with the rating of the small business concern, a notice contesting the application must be submitted to the appropriate official. The official must follow specific procedures for rating within 14 calendar days of receiving the notice. The small business concern can then provide comments or rebuttals. The appropriate official must enter a neutral rating into the system within 14 days of receiving a notice contesting the application. A small business subcontractor can use this past performance rating to establish its past performance for a prime contract. The pilot program for small business subcontractors will end 3 years after the first small business receives a past performance rating. The Comptroller General will assess the program after 1 year and submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 6 months. The report on the pilot program for small business subcontractors shall include the number of small businesses with past performance ratings, instances of contested applications, and recommendations to address disputes. The report on the pilot program for small business subcontractors will include ratings, suggestions for improvement, and the definition of an appropriate official as designated by the Administrator."
