    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Chapter 3.6 is added to the Government Code, requiring agencies to review regulations for consistency with law and economic impacts, but not for overlapping or outdated regulations. In an effort to address unemployment and underemployment in California, state agencies are urged to identify and eliminate overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations to ensure more efficient implementation of laws and reduce unnecessary rules. Definitions for \"state agency\" and \"regulation\" are provided in the chapter. State agencies in California are required to review and address any duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out-of-date regulations by January 1, 2018. This process includes identifying, amending, or repealing regulations to eliminate any issues, with public hearings being held as necessary. Compliance with specified processes is mandatory. State agencies in California must hold public hearings and notify legislative committees of proposed regulation revisions at least 30 days in advance. They are also required to report to the Governor and Legislature on compliance with regulations, including actions taken to address duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out-of-date regulations. State agencies in California are required to report any regulations that may be duplicative, overlapping, or inconsistent with those of another department within the agency by January 1, 2018, in compliance with Government Code Section 9795. State agencies in California must notify their agency of proposed regulation revisions at least 90 days before a public hearing and adoption, amendment, or repeal of regulations. The agency must review and provide recommendations within 30 days on any duplicative, overlapping, or inconsistent regulations within the agency. Additionally, agencies listed in Section 12800 must inform state agencies of any regulations that may duplicate, overlap, or be inconsistent with the state agency's regulations. Chapter 11366.45 ensures that existing human health, public welfare, and environmental protections are not weakened. It emphasizes the need for state agencies to focus efficiently on their duties to use public funds effectively. Chapter 11366.5 will be repealed on January 1, 2019, unless a later statute extends the date."
