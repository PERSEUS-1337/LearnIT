    "content": "In response to the 1973 OAPEC oil embargo, Congress passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which included a provision to prohibit the export of crude oil and natural gas. However, around 2010/2011, advancements in drilling technologies led to a significant increase in U.S. crude oil production by nearly 80%. In April 2015, U.S. crude oil production increased by approximately 4.3 million barrels per day, a nearly 80% increase. Infrastructure bottlenecks led to domestic oil prices being discounted relative to international prices, with discounts as large as $30 per barrel. This price differential motivated interest in exporting U.S. crude oil globally. Congressional debate on U.S. crude oil export policy began in earnest in January. The congressional debate on U.S. crude oil export policy started in January 2014, with calls to remove export prohibition. Analytical studies from various organizations were published in 2014 and 2015, covering price effects, impacts on the refining industry, geopolitical considerations, economic impact, government revenues, and environmental concerns. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029) on December 18, 2015, which included provisions related to crude oil exports. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029) included provisions that repealed the EPCA crude oil export prohibition, allowing U.S. producers to sell and export crude oil internationally. P.L. 114-113 also addressed maritime transportation of crude oil and the effects on independent oil refiners. Division O, Title I, Section 101 of P.L. 114-113 repealed the President's authority to restrict the export of hydrocarbon materials, including crude oil and natural gas produced in the United States. P.L. 114-113 repealed the EPCA crude oil export prohibition, allowing U.S. producers to export crude oil internationally. The law removes all existing crude oil export restrictions but includes exceptions for national emergencies or price and supply effects. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about limiting presidential authority, leading to the inclusion of a \"Savings Clause\" affirming presidential authority. The bill P.L. 114-113 repealed the EPCA crude oil export prohibition, allowing U.S. producers to export crude oil internationally. A \"Savings Clause\" was included to affirm presidential authority to prohibit exports under certain circumstances. The President has the authority to impose crude oil export licensing requirements or restrictions for specific exceptions, limited to one year but renewable. Exceptions include a national emergency declaration and sanctions. The bill P.L. 114-113 repealed the EPCA crude oil export prohibition, allowing U.S. producers to export crude oil internationally. A \"Savings Clause\" affirmed presidential authority to prohibit exports under certain circumstances, including a national emergency, sanctions, or adverse effects on U.S. employment due to supply shortages and high prices. The repeal of the EPCA crude oil export prohibition under P.L. 114-113 allows U.S. producers to export crude oil internationally. While this provision offers a way to restrict exports in the future, determining the direct impact on supply shortages, price increases, and U.S. employment is complex due to various influencing factors. Congressional interest lies in understanding potential export volumes, economic impacts, and environmental concerns. Analytical studies suggest exports could range from 0 to 2 million barrels per day, with differing assumptions leading to this disparity. The repeal of the EPCA crude oil export prohibition under P.L. 114-113 allows U.S. producers to export crude oil internationally. Export volumes could range from 0 to 2 million barrels per day, with differing assumptions leading to this disparity. Companies export crude oil based on financial and market conditions, including price differentials between domestic (WTI) and international (Brent) benchmark prices. Dubai is also an important price benchmark for Asian markets. The WTI/Brent price differential fluctuated during 2010-2015, with WTI prices $10-$30 below Brent. A large differential incentivizes exporting crude oil, with costs varying by destination. Atlantic basin countries in Europe and the Americas are likely export markets. Analysis by the Energy Information Administration indicates that U.S. oil exports are likely to be directed towards Atlantic basin countries in Europe and the Americas. Export costs ranged from $6 to $8 per barrel, creating an economic incentive for exports from 2011 to 2015. However, price differentials have since narrowed to $1 or less per barrel since 2016, impacting the attractiveness of exporting crude oil. Other factors such as logistics, storage, and localized price relationships may also influence export decisions. The Eagle Ford and Permian Basin oil producers in Texas may choose to export to global markets despite narrow price differentials between WTI/Brent. From December 2015 to February 2016, 1.7 million barrels of crude oil were exported to France, the Netherland Antilles, and the Mediterranean region. The level of U.S. crude oil exports to the Mediterranean region is relatively small compared to total production. Export volumes may increase in the future if U.S. oil production rises and the price differential widens due to oversupply in the Gulf Coast. The elimination of crude oil export restrictions benefits U.S. oil producers by allowing them to sell to international buyers at potentially higher prices and moderating domestic/international price differentials. This could limit differential values to export costs, reducing the likelihood of severe domestic price impacts. The debate over allowing crude oil exports in the U.S. also involved discussions about providing cargoes for the U.S.-flag merchant fleet. U.S.-flag international vessels, which require U.S. ownership and crewed by U.S. citizens, are guaranteed government-impelled cargoes but have high operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships. In 2015, the lack of cargo led to a decline in ships participating in the Maritime Security Program (MSP). There was a proposal to require some crude oil exports to be carried by U.S.-flag ships, but it faced opposition over concerns about cost competitiveness. P.L. 114-113 increased operating subsidies for MSP vessels from FY2017 to FY2021 to incentivize ship operators to keep their vessels in the MSP fleet. The annual subsidy for Maritime Security Program (MSP) vessels is set to increase from $3.1 million per ship to around $5 million per ship through FY2020 and then $5.2 million per ship in 2021, before reverting back to $3.1 million per ship in 2022. This increase aims to offset the cost of employing U.S. merchant mariners and complying with U.S. flag requirements, helping these ships compete with foreign-flag vessels in carrying private-sector imports and exports. However, the higher subsidy may lead to increased costs for U.S. seafarers and ship supply vendors. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) fleet consists of 57 enrolled ships, including container ships, roll-on/roll-off ships, and tankers, employing about 2,500 U.S. mariners. 75% of the fleet is owned by U.S. entities affiliated with foreign shipping lines. Section 305 of P.L. 114-113 enhanced the domestic production activities deduction for refiners to address concerns about crude export policy changes. Domestic and international price differentials motivated oil producers to advocate for exports. The motivation for oil producers to advocate for crude oil exports benefited U.S. refiners by increasing profit margins. Refinery advocates raised concerns about the Jones Act cost premium for transporting oil from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast, potentially putting East Coast refineries at a disadvantage compared to European refineries. Additionally, some refineries invested in expensive rail transportation for crude oil. Investments in rail transportation for crude oil were motivated by price differentials since 2010. Changes in crude oil export policy could impact the value of these investments. The Section 199 deduction reduces tax rates on domestic manufacturing activities. Section 305 of P.L. 114-113 allows independent refiners to account for transportation costs when calculating the deduction, potentially increasing tax relief. The Section 199 production activities deduction allows taxpayers to deduct a fixed percentage of income from qualified production activities or taxable income. The Section 199 deduction allows taxpayers to deduct a percentage of income from qualified production activities or taxable income. For independent refiners, the deduction is 6% for oil-related activities and 9% for other domestic production activities. Changes in P.L. 114-113 allow qualifying entities to reduce oil transportation costs when calculating their QPAI, excluding 75% of these costs for the Section 199 deduction. The modified treatment for transportation costs under P.L. 114-113 allows refiners to reduce oil transportation costs when calculating their QPAI for the Section 199 deduction. This change increases the deduction amount, with the provision set to expire at the end of 2021. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a $1.9 billion reduction in federal revenues between 2016 and 2025 due to this provision. An example calculation in Table 1 shows how the deduction is applied, with actual figures varying for each refiner. The Section 199 deduction allows for a reduction in tax liability for independent refiners by including only 25% of oil transportation expenses when calculating QPAI. This results in a potential tax savings of up to 1.575% of oil transportation expenses. The Section 199 deduction allows for a reduction in tax liability for independent refiners by including only 25% of oil transportation expenses when calculating QPAI, potentially reducing tax liability by up to 1.575%. Some independent refineries may not benefit from this provision, especially if their taxable income is less than QPAI. The modifications to Section 199 in P.L. 114-113 have limitations for independent refiners with zero taxable income. The modifications in P.L. 114-113 have limitations for independent refiners with zero taxable income or taxable income less than QPAI. The tax relief for transportation expenses is capped at 1.575% of oil transportation costs. The temporary provision may offer some relief but could also lead to uncertainty as it is set to expire in 2021."
