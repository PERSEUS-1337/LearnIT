    "content": "Encryption is a method of scrambling data for private communication, authentication, and data integrity. It involves algorithms and keys, which can be secret or public. Public key systems are useful for encrypting messages in large computer networks like the Internet. Key escrow or recovery systems allow access to encrypted data for parties other than the original users, which is beneficial for law enforcement and commercial purposes. Strong encryption was initially limited to the federal government but expanded to commercial use with the development of a 128-bit key cipher code by IBM in 1971. In 1974, IBM developed a marketable encryption product with a 128-bit key. The federal government sought an encryption algorithm for unclassified data, leading to the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). IBM proposed a 56-bit key version of DES after discussions with the NSA, which certified its security. Critics raised concerns about vulnerabilities in the shortened key and the clash of governmental and business interests. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was developed with a 56-bit key, allowing the NSA to penetrate communications links. In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began developing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key length of 128 to 256-bits. NIST chose the Rijndael algorithm for AES in 2000, which will be proposed for incorporation in a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The business community expresses a need for strong encryption for domestic and cross-border communications. Export controls have hindered U.S. technological development, impacting competitiveness and availability of strong encryption for legitimate users worldwide. The federal government argues against facilitating encryption proliferation due to national security concerns. The Administration promotes a key management infrastructure for public key encryption, but faces opposition from business, consumer, and privacy groups over government control of encrypted data access. Export controls for encryption have been deemphasized for KMI development. Export controls for encryption have been deemphasized for KMI development, with encryption subject to U.S. export controls under the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1979. Encryption is treated as a munition and a dual-use item on lists maintained by the Wassenaar Arrangement, with restrictions on mass market hardware and encryption with key lengths greater than 64 bits. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) allows the President to regulate the export of defense articles and services through the United States Munitions List (USML). Administered by the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC), the AECA requires arms exporters to register and obtain licenses before exporting items. Enforcement authorities are strong, with criminal and civil penalties for violations. Unlike the Export Administration Act, the AECA does not consider foreign availability in licensing decisions. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) imposes strict penalties for violations and involves the State Department and NSA in the licensing process. The Export Administration Act (EAA) authorizes the Commerce Department to control exports for national security reasons. Items subject to EAA regulation are listed in the Commerce Control List (CCL). The Department of State exempted nine types of encryption from AECA control and transferred authority to the Commerce Department in the early 1990s. Encryption exports could be transferred to the Department of Commerce for mass market software. The State Department allowed exports of commercial encryption with 40-bit keys, with some exceptions for software with DES. The Clinton Administration announced a new encryption policy in October 1996, giving the Department of Commerce jurisdiction over all commercial encryption. The Clinton Administration gave the Department of Commerce control over commercial encryption, with key recovery requirements for exports. In 1997, controls were eased for financial encryption, allowing exports of unlimited key length for financial transactions. In 1998, the Clinton Administration changed encryption export policies, allowing export of 56-bit encryption to most destinations without key recovery commitment. Financial institutions' export treatment extended to insurance companies, health end-users, and online merchants. U.S. companies could export encryption of any key length for internal use to subsidiaries in non-embargoed countries after agency review. The Clinton Administration relaxed encryption export policies in 1998, allowing the export of encryption products to many countries without key recovery commitment. This included the export of \"recoverable\" encryption that allows access to plaintext by law enforcement. Additionally, a technical support center run by the FBI was established to assist law enforcement with encryption technology. Further relaxation of encryption export controls occurred in September 1999, allowing the export of encryption items of any key length under a license exception after a technical review. The Clinton Administration relaxed encryption export policies in 1998, allowing the export of encryption products to many countries without key recovery commitment. In September 1999, further relaxation of encryption export controls occurred, permitting the export of encryption items of any key length under a license exception after a technical review. Post-export reporting is required for exports over 64 bits to non-U.S. entities. The updated Wassenaar controls allow for the export of 56-bit DES and equivalent products without a license to all users and destinations, except for seven terrorist countries, after a technical review. Encryption items of 64-bits or less meeting mass market requirements are eligible for export without a license after a technical review. The Clinton Administration relaxed encryption export policies in 1998, allowing the export of encryption products without key recovery commitment. In January 2000, the Administration expanded encryption license exceptions for source code and retail transactions, and allowed exports to government entities like telecommunications companies and Internet service providers. The Clinton Administration announced the Cyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999 to limit government's use of encryption keys obtained under court order. They also streamlined encryption export controls to 23 countries in 2000, removing distinctions between government and non-government end users. Regulations were issued in October 2000. The AECA regulations issued in October 2000 treat the disclosure of encryption software to foreign individuals as an export, potentially subjecting individuals to strict penalties for discussing cryptography with foreign participants without an export license. There have been conflicting opinions in federal district courts regarding the constitutionality of these regulations under the First Amendment. The court affirmed a lower court ruling striking Department of Commerce regulations as unconstitutional prior restraint. Court challenges typically involve restrictions on exporting software with encryption source code, distinguishing between expressive and functional aspects of the software. The President's 1996 Executive Order emphasized controlling encryption software exports based on functional capacity rather than information value. In Bernstein v. Dep't of State, a California federal district court ruled that source code is protected speech under the First Amendment. The court also found AECA licensing requirements to be an unconstitutional prior restraint. The plaintiff challenged 1996 DOC regulations on First Amendment grounds, which were also deemed unconstitutional by the court. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision allowing a First Amendment challenge to Commerce Department regulations, deeming them an impermissible prior restraint. The case was reheard by the full court and later remanded for reconsideration in light of new encryption regulations. Plaintiff was informed he could post source code online under the new regulations. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision allowing a First Amendment challenge to Commerce Department regulations, deeming them an impermissible prior restraint. The court ruled de novo that the two-prong test for facial challenges set forth by the Supreme Court in Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. was met. The court held that a licensing scheme is subject to a facial challenge if it gives substantial power to discriminate based on speech content or viewpoint, posing a real threat of censorship risks. The court found that the constraint on official discretion in denying export licenses under the Export Regulations was insufficient. The court ruled that the Commerce Department's regulations were an impermissible prior restraint, as they gave substantial power to discriminate based on speech content. The court also determined that encryption software, in its source code form, is expressive and entitled to First Amendment protections. The court found that the Commerce Department's regulations on encryption software were an impermissible prior restraint, as they allowed for discrimination based on speech content. The regulations were deemed to infringe on First Amendment protections for expressive source code. The court found that the licensing scheme lacked procedural safeguards required by Freedman v. Maryland. The Executive Branch process and internal appeals process did not have firm deadlines or provide judicial review for denied export license applications. The government argued that the lower court's order regarding encryption source code was invalid as it also applied to encryption object code, commodities, and technology. The court acknowledged the ability to conceptually separate the regulations but decided not to do so, upholding the lower court's relief. The dissenting judge in Bernstein believed the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for a facial First Amendment challenge under the EAR, emphasizing the functional aspects of encryption. The dissent in the case argued that encryption source code is more of a functional device than speech, and therefore, not protected under the First Amendment. They pointed out that the export of encryption source code is primarily used for protecting computer communications, rather than as a form of expression. The dissent in the case argued that export of encryption source code is not protected under the First Amendment as it is considered a functional device rather than speech. The dissent also noted that the regulations did not prevent the print publication of scholarly articles containing source code. In Karn v. Dep't of State, a case in the U.S. District Court challenged the State Department's disapproval of exporting encryption algorithms on a diskette. The plaintiff's First Amendment and Fifth Amendment due process claims were dismissed, with the court ruling the diskette as content-neutral. The court upheld the AECA regulations on encryption source code exports, stating that the government's regulation was not based on expressive content but on national security concerns. The regulations were deemed constitutional under the O'Brien test. The court upheld the AECA regulations on encryption source code exports, stating that the government's regulation was narrowly tailored to meet its goal of national security. The plaintiff's argument that cryptographic algorithms were widely available or weak was not sufficient to challenge the regulation. The court viewed the disagreement as a foreign policy issue and upheld the classification of encryption items as defense articles. The court upheld the classification of encryption items as defense articles, citing the President's foreign policy judgment on the harmful effects of encryption product proliferation. The plaintiff's request for judicial balancing of First Amendment harms against national security interests was rejected, with the court finding the regulation necessary to prevent encryption product proliferation. The plaintiff was denied an export license by the Department of Commerce and pursued constitutional claims in district court, leading to an evidentiary hearing on the production of encryption. In Junger v. Daley, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a district court decision, ruling that computer source code is protected by the First Amendment. Plaintiff Junger, a law professor, sought to post encryption programs online, but the Department of Commerce required export licenses for software programs. Junger's constitutional challenge was remanded for further consideration. The plaintiff, a law professor, was informed that export licenses were needed for software programs, but a chapter in his textbook with encryption code could be exported without a license. Instead of applying for licenses, he challenged the regulations on First Amendment grounds, claiming prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth. The court found that source code was not protected under the First Amendment, rejected facial challenges to the regulations, and upheld them under intermediate scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit later ruled that computer source code is protected by the First Amendment. The Sixth Circuit ruled that computer source code is protected by the First Amendment, allowing the plaintiff to proceed with his facial challenge of the DOC regulations. The court considered the government's interest in regulating source code speech, emphasizing the need for real, not conjectural, harms to be demonstrated for regulation to be justified. The Sixth Circuit allowed the plaintiff to challenge encryption regulations on First Amendment grounds. Bills in the 106th Congress aimed to relax encryption export controls and address related issues. H.R. 850, the SAFE Act, sought to expand on previous encryption legislation. In the 106th Congress, H.R. 850, the SAFE Act, aimed to expand encryption legislation, while S. 798, the PROTECT Act, was introduced by Mr. McCain with co-sponsors. The Clinton Administration opposed H.R. 850 and S. 798, but generally favored H.R. 909. The House Armed Service Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had differing versions of the bill regarding encryption export controls. S. 798 was ordered reported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee, while H.R. 850 aimed to grant the Secretary of Commerce sole authority over nonmilitary encryption. The Secretary would have been required to permit the export of strong encryption for nonmilitary end uses in certain countries, unless there was evidence of diversion to military or terrorist activities. Controls could not be reinstated on decontrolled encryption items, but exports could be prohibited to specific individuals or organizations in foreign countries with substantial evidence of misuse. The bill would have allowed the President to prohibit the export of encryption products to terrorist countries or as part of an embargo. It would have made it lawful for any U.S. person in a foreign country to use encryption, except for activities related to a felony. The bill would have also prohibited the Federal Government from requiring key escrow capabilities in encryption products. The bill prohibited the Federal Government from requiring key escrow capabilities in encryption products. The House Judiciary Committee reported the bill on April 27, while the House Commerce Committee reported the bill with added provisions on July 2. The added provisions delegated authority regarding export determinations and technical regulations for critical infrastructure protection products. The amended version of the bill delegated all export determination authority to the Secretary of Commerce, expanded technical review periods to 30 working days, required consultation with various agencies before licensing policies took effect, allowed for prohibition of encryption exports for national security reasons, and maintained the Secretary's ability to control exports for reasons other than encryption. The amended version of the bill expanded export determination authority to the Secretary of Commerce, added provisions for a National Electronic Technologies Center, directed export promotion activities for encryption products, and criminalized transfers of encryption products to military end users in China. The reported version of the bill, as amended on July 19, 1999, included provisions to expand technical review periods, require consultation with various government officials before licensing policies took effect, and mandate consultation on encryption exports to drug-transit countries. It also emphasized that the President's authority under certain acts was not limited by the SAFE Act. The amended bill expanded reasons for export denials, required consultation with various officials, and changed the evidentiary standard for decisions regarding encryption products subject to export controls. The SAFE Act and its amendment did not affect the Secretary of Commerce's ability to control exports for reasons other than encryption capabilities. A revised version of H.R. 850 was proposed, renaming it the \"Protection of National Security and Public Safety Act\" and giving the President sole authority to control the export of dual-use encryption products. Judicial review of presidential export denials was also prohibited. The amendment to the SAFE Act would have allowed encryption exports under licenses based on strength, with notification to Congress required. Encryption products meeting specified criteria could be eligible for export license exceptions, subject to technical review and restrictions on end users. The amendment to the SAFE Act would have required exporters to provide names and addresses of distribution chain partners for encryption products eligible for export license exceptions. The President would have needed to inform Congress every 180 days of encryption strength levels and could not decrease them. A license would be necessary for exporting encryption products exceeding the license-exception level, with requirements for technical review, certification of end use and user, and submission of necessary information. The amendment would require exporters to report if products were diverted to unauthorized end users, with post-export reporting and submission of specific product details. The President could waive license exceptions for national security reasons and for specific eligible end users of encryption commodities and software. The committee amendment proposed creating a public-private Encryption Industry and Information Security Board to advise the President on encryption products' foreign availability. It also required the Secretary of Commerce to conduct market share surveys of foreign markets for encryption products every 6 months. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reported an amendment to H.R. 850, renaming it the Encryption for the National Interest Act. This version would give the President sole authority to control the export of dual-use encryption products. The amendment proposed giving the President sole authority to control the export of encryption products based on national security interests, with no judicial review allowed. It also required a system of export licenses and exceptions, with products of 64 bits or less eligible for a license exception after a technical review process. The exporter had to submit certification and information on intended use and recipients within 180 days of export. They also needed to provide details of distribution chain partners and ensure partners agreed to abide by U.S. laws. The proposed legislation allowed for license exceptions for exporting encryption products without decryption methods. The President would periodically review encryption strength for export without harming national security. The proposed amendment would allow the export of encryption products with higher strength levels under certain conditions, including no requirement for decryption methods, technical review, certification of intended use, and ensuring distribution partners comply with U.S. laws. The bill allows for the export of U.S.-origin encryption products with certain conditions, including post-export reporting and expedited review of export license applications. The President can permit exports under a license exception for higher level encryption if consistent with national security. The bill also grants the President the authority to waive export restrictions. The committee amendment proposed creating an Encryption Industry and Information Security Board to advise the President on encryption issues, including global encryption standards and the threat of foreign encryption to U.S. industry. It also urged the President to negotiate international agreements on encryption export control requirements to protect privacy and enhance information security. The committee bill addressed encryption export control requirements, granting the Secretary of Commerce sole authority over nonmilitary encryption exports. It allowed the President to use TWEA and IEEPA authorities to prohibit encryption exports to entities supporting terrorism or posing a national security threat. The bill proposed export controls on encryption, allowing the Secretary of Commerce to impose embargoes on specific entities. It would decontrol encryption up to 64 bits and require license exceptions for certain products and end-users. Requests for exceptions were to be completed within 15 working days. The bill proposed export controls on encryption, allowing the Secretary of Commerce to impose embargoes on specific entities. It would decontrol encryption up to 64 bits and require license exceptions for certain products and end-users. Requests for exceptions were to be completed within 15 working days. The bill also permitted exports of stronger encryption under certain conditions, with a technical review and 15-day processing period. Additionally, DOC license approvals for over 64-bit encryption would have been grandfathered. The National Institute of Standards and Technology was required to adopt an Advanced Encryption Standard by January 1, 2002, allowing export of goods incorporating the new standard without restrictions. The bill also prohibited the Secretary of Commerce from imposing government-designed encryption standards on the private sector and from imposing reporting requirements on encryption products not subject to export controls. Additionally, the bill addressed domestic use of encryption, government procurement, and improving the government's technological capability. The Electronic Rights for the 21st Century Act, introduced by Mr. Leahy, aimed to allow any U.S. person in a foreign country to use encryption products without restrictions. It also prohibited government-mandated key escrow and key recovery."
