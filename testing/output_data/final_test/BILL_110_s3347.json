    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Put School Counselors Where They're Needed Act\" and includes a demonstration project for additional secondary school counselors under Part H of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \"Congress highlights the low graduation rates and high dropout rates among high school students, especially those from low-income families, African-American, Hispanic, and students with disabilities. The transition to adulthood and the workforce is crucial during high school.\" \"School counseling programs are essential for students to achieve personal growth, develop social skills, set career goals, and reach academic potential. Professional counselors play a crucial role in guiding students through high-stakes testing, college admissions, financial aid, and job market challenges.\" Professional secondary school counselors are highly qualified educators with a mental health perspective, holding a master's degree or higher in school counseling. They are certified or licensed by the State and provide proactive leadership to help students achieve success in school. Professional secondary school counselors play a crucial role in supporting students' academic achievement in the 21st century. However, their ability to assist students is often limited by high student-to-counselor ratios. The recommended ratio by various counseling associations is 1 counselor to 250 students, with even lower ratios for counselors working with at-risk students. SEC. 1842. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project providing grants to secondary schools with low graduation rates. Grants can be used for additional counselors and resources to support at-risk students. Congress suggests one additional counselor per 250 at-risk students. Under subsection (b)(1), 1 additional counselor per 250 at-risk students is provided. The counselors will identify students at risk of not graduating in 4 years, primarily focusing on those before grade 9. Services will continue as needed, including after graduation, offering a range of resources like individual graduation plans and tutoring services. The additional school counselors provided through funds under this subpart shall supplement existing resources and not replace them. Meetings with students, teachers, tutors, and parents will be conducted to support at-risk students. Additional individuals like probation officers, mentors, and employers may also be involved in the student's support network. The grant program allows secondary schools to receive multiple grants if they show improvement. The grants decrease in amount each year, requiring the school to increase non-Federal funds. Adequate improvement is required to qualify for additional grant periods. The grant program allows secondary schools to receive multiple grants if they show improvement in the 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate by 10 percent or more over the grant period. The Secretary will select at least 10 schools for the demonstration project, with the first 5 schools chosen from different states. \"SEC. 1843. DEFINITIONS.\" The term '4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate' refers to the number of students who received a high school diploma by the end of their fourth year, divided by the total number of students in the adjusted cohort. An 'adjusted cohort' includes students who started grade 9 together, with adjustments for transfers and removals. The term 'transfers in' refers to students enrolling or re-enrolling after the beginning of the entering cohort's first year in high school, up to grade 12. Cohort removal involves confirming transfer out, custody in the juvenile justice system, or deceased status. 'Transfers out' refer to moving to another school or educational program. The term 'transfers in' refers to students enrolling or re-enrolling after the beginning of the entering cohort's first year in high school, up to grade 12. Cohort removal involves confirming transfer out, custody in the juvenile justice system, or deceased status. 'Transfers out' refer to moving to another school or educational program. Confirmation of a student's transfer to another school, local educational agency, or program requires formal documentation that the student enrolled in the receiving school. A student who enrolls in a GED or other alternative educational program that does not issue credits toward a regular high school diploma is not considered to have transferred out. A student who was retained in a grade, enrolled in a GED program, or left school for any other reason may not be counted as a transfer out for calculating graduation rates and shall remain in the adjusted cohort. For high schools starting after ninth grade, the cohort calculation shall apply. The cohort calculation for high schools starting after ninth grade is based on the earliest high school grade. A regular high school diploma is defined as the standard diploma aligned with State standards, excluding GEDs and lesser diplomas. For students with significant cognitive disabilities, alternate assessments may lead to a regular diploma or State-defined alternate diploma. For students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, their completion counts as a regular high school diploma. Only up to 1 percent of students in a school can be considered graduates with a regular diploma. Authorization of appropriations for a demonstration project for additional secondary school counselors is set at $6,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2011."
