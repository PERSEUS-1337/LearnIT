The debate over regulating offshore oil and gas drilling in the US, especially in the context of the Gulf oil spill, has sparked interest. Discussions focus on drilling operations along the Outer Continental Shelf and in regions like the Great Lakes. Controversy surrounds the issue of drilling under the Great Lakes, with concerns about environmental and economic impacts. Opponents fear oil spills, gas leaks, and pollution harming residents and the ecosystem. Proponents argue that new technologies minimize risks, making accidents unlikely. Permits for drilling under the Great Lakes have been largely banned by state and federal laws, with a Great Lakes-wide ban driven by a statement of principle against oil drilling signed by eight Great Lakes governors in 1985. Various states have enacted permanent or temporary bans against drilling, and the federal government enacted a temporary ban on permits for drilling under the Great Lakes in 2001. A ban on federal and state permits for drilling under the Great Lakes was initially implemented in 2001, extended in 2003 and through 2007, and made permanent in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This ban has sparked controversy, with some arguing for states' rights to decide on drilling in the Great Lakes and others viewing the federal ban as a violation of such rights. Some argue for states' rights in banning drilling in the Great Lakes, while others see a federal ban as necessary. Concerns have been raised about Canadian offshore drilling in Lake Erie and the potential harm from a spill. Canadian directional drilling for gas is allowed in the Great Lakes, but offshore drilling for oil is prohibited. Drilling for oil is prohibited in the Great Lakes. This report provides background information on drilling history, current production statistics, environmental and economic issues, state laws, and implications of a federal ban on drilling. The Great Lakes basin is shared by eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The Great Lakes watershed, containing the largest volume of fresh surface water in the world, covers approximately 300,000 square miles. The Great Lakes themselves hold an estimated six quadrillion gallons of water, constituting nearly 90% of the US's surface freshwater supplies and 20% of the world's. The region is vital to millions of people and two nations' economies, with around 40 million people relying on it for jobs, drinking water, and recreation. The area's physical characteristics, including topography, soils, and climate, vary significantly, as do water flow characteristics across the lakes. Water levels in the Great Lakes vary seasonally based on precipitation and runoff, with low levels in winter and high levels in early summer. Human development has degraded water quality, habitats, and led to the introduction of non-native species, threatening wildlife and human health. Efforts by the US and Canada governments aim to counter these negative impacts. The governments of the United States and Canada, along with state and provincial governments in the Great Lakes basin, have implemented restoration activities. Offshore oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes has not occurred in U.S. waters, with onshore drilling attempts in several states but only existing wells in Michigan. Interest in oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes dates back to the mid-1950s, with Ohio encouraging oil development under Lake Erie. However, opposition to drilling in Lake Erie due to environmental concerns led to the program's abandonment by 1968. In Ohio, offshore and onshore drilling in Lake Erie was abandoned in 1968 due to environmental concerns. Temporary bans have been placed on drilling under Lake Erie in Ohio, with the latest one in 2003. In Pennsylvania, there is no history of oil or gas production under Lake Erie. In Michigan, since 1979, 13 onshore wells have been drilled under the Great Lakes, with seven still in production. Directional drilling technology is used in Michigan to drill underneath the lakes. In Canada, oil and gas drilling under the Great Lakes is allowed, with 2,200 wells drilled in Lake Erie and 550 currently producing. Offshore oil wells are prohibited, and if a gas well shows oil, it must be closed. Directional drilling is extensively done in Lake Erie. In Lake Erie, natural gas extraction peaked at 15.2 billion cubic feet in 1985, declining to 10 bcf by 2000. Oil production through directional drilling in Ontario has 100 wells with an average depth of 2,800ft and 2.2 miles horizontal offset. U.S. oil and gas production in the Great Lakes is in Michigan state waters, with variable production levels. Michigan's average annual natural gas production from 2000 to 2009 was 1.1 bcf, while oil production averaged 660 barrels annually. The US Geological Survey estimated oil and gas resources in the Great Lakes region for 2005, with Lake Huron and Lake Michigan having the most oil resources and Lake Erie having the most natural gas resources. The estimated resources include 312 million barrels of oil, 5.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 122 million barrels of natural gas liquids. The estimates are tabulated based on the percent chance of recovery. In Canada, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources estimates 195 million barrels of oil and 1.1 tcf of gas under Lake Erie. Michigan has the most oil resources under the Great Lakes, with potential for 20 to 30 new wells if drilling ban lifted. Michigan and Ohio have the highest natural gas resources, mainly in Lake Erie. Negative effects of drilling near large waterbodies like the Great Lakes include oil spills and discharge. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study on the environmental effects of oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes under the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2002. Possible consequences include oil spills, contaminated drilling fluids, and impacts of drilling infrastructure. Benefits may include increased revenues, employment, and energy production. Drilling under the Great Lakes can have economic benefits such as jobs and revenue for the owner. If significant deposits are found, local and state governments would benefit from revenues generated from permits, leases, and taxes. Revenues from oil and gas leases in some Great Lakes states potentially benefit the environment, like in Michigan where funds go towards protecting sensitive areas. Drilling operations would also create employment opportunities. Potential economic costs from drilling under the Great Lakes may include impacts on tourism, recreational opportunities, property values, and the ecosystem. Environmental concerns, such as leaks, spills, and blowouts, have been the main driver of opposition to oil and gas drilling in this region. Oil spills, leaks, and blowouts can harm the environment through pipeline ruptures, containment failures, and high-pressure formations during drilling. These incidents can also occur during transport, releasing drilling wastes that can harm vegetation and streams. Directional drilling is discussed as an activity with potential environmental consequences. Even a minor oil spill can have significant impacts on organisms and populations over varying time scales. Oil spills can have impacts over varying time scales, from days to decades. Acute exposure to oil spills can kill organisms and cause reduced reproduction, altered development, impaired feeding mechanisms, and weakened immunity. Birds, marine mammals, bottom-dwelling species, and organisms in their developmental stages are particularly vulnerable. Wildlife can be affected by direct exposure to oil, polluted waters, contaminated prey, or depleted food resources. Impacts can also occur through chronic, low-level exposure. Chronic exposure to oil spills can harm wildlife and their habitat through persistent contaminants in the ecosystem, such as leaking pipelines and production discharges. Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of buried drilling wastes and injected production water on ecosystems due to their toxic chemicals. Evidence shows that chronic exposure to oil contaminants can impact the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals. Chronic oil exposure can affect the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals, leading to debates among scientists. Oil discharge can also alter coastlines and aquatic habitats by degrading water quality, lowering oxygen levels, contaminating sediments, and changing aquatic vegetation. Water flow influences the impact of spills, with high-flow areas experiencing less immediate impact but potentially more widespread damage, while low-flow areas can sustain longer-lasting harm to vegetation and organisms. Spills in the Great Lakes can have varying impacts due to the different water flow rates of the lakes. For example, Lake Superior, with a low-flow rate, takes 182 years to replace water, while Lake Erie and Lake Ontario take three and six years, respectively. Toxins from spills can settle into sediments and persist for many years. Directional drilling in Michigan, targeting the Niagaran Reefs, is debated for its environmental effects, with offshore drilling considered more hazardous due to its location. Directional drilling beneath the Great Lakes in Michigan targets the Niagaran Reefs formation, located four to five thousand feet below ground. A study evaluated the environmental impacts and suggested drilling at least 1,500 feet from the shoreline to mitigate risks. While spills at the reservoir and well pose little risk to the lakes, leaks at the wellhead onshore could be problematic. The potential for oil spills in the Great Lakes remains uncertain due to current directional drilling technology limitations. The potential for oil spills in the Great Lakes would increase with offshore oil exploration and production operations, as minimal drilling has occurred under the Great Lakes. Canada has had one reported oil spill attributed to drilling since 1959. Offshore oil exploration in the Great Lakes would raise the risk of oil spills. Advances in drilling tech have reduced spills and footprints, with 3D seismic imaging improving success in finding oil and gas deposits. Offshore drilling innovations, such as slimhole drilling and modular rigs, reduce waste volumes and surface area. Despite advancements, there is still a risk of oil spills in the Great Lakes. Directional drilling could help mitigate this risk. Congress has the authority to regulate oil and gas development in the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes' authority to regulate oil and gas development falls under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Federal regulation implications depend on whether the resources are state-owned or federal property. Eight states border the Great Lakes, and according to federal law, these states own the beds and resources within their boundaries. Supreme Court precedent states that states hold title to submerged lands within their boundaries that were navigable at the time of statehood. The determination of navigable waters is made by federal law, stating that waters used for commerce are navigable. The Great Lakes satisfy this test, allowing states to hold title to some portions under the Submerged Lands Act. Under common law and the Submerged Lands Act, states can claim ownership of oil and gas in the Great Lakes within their boundaries. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Illinois has rights to Lake Michigan, suggesting other Great Lakes states also have ownership and regulatory authority over resources within their boundaries. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 limits state authority over oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, potentially implicating the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. State regulation may still be viable if it does not conflict with federal law, but inconsistent state laws are preempted. Repealing the federal ban would make state regulation applicable again. Each state's existing laws regarding oil and gas activities in the Great Lakes are briefly summarized. Illinois laws regarding structures in Lake Michigan fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources. The state permits structures in its waters and allows for oil and gas development agreements. Leasing state-owned lands for mineral development may include lake bottoms, except in specific protected areas. Indiana law does not address drilling in the Great Lakes, but the Indiana Department of Natural Resources can permit oil and gas development on lake beds. Michigan law gives the Department of Natural Resources authority to lease state-owned mineral resources, but recent changes prohibit future leasing of Great Lakes oil and gas. Only those with leases before April 5, 2002, can drill in the Great Lakes. Minnesota and Ohio laws allow for oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes under certain conditions. While Minnesota does not have an explicit ban on drilling, Ohio permits the issuance of permits and leases for mineral extraction from Lake Erie. However, the governor of Ohio has issued an executive order banning oil and gas drilling, which could potentially be changed in the future. Pennsylvania law allows drilling in the Great Lakes with Department of Conservation approval. New York prohibits oil leases in Lake Ontario, while Wisconsin bans drilling under the Great Lakes beds. The federal government has the authority to regulate oil and gas drilling operations in the Great Lakes, including banning new leases and permits. States also have the authority to regulate drilling within their boundaries, with some prohibiting drilling under the Great Lakes beds. The federal government has the authority to regulate oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, including banning new leases and permits. Congress may have the power to regulate or ban drilling, but it could be considered a \"taking\" of private property, requiring compensation. The federal ban on drilling may fall under federal navigational servitude, where a state's property rights are subject to federal navigation interests. Compensation may not be required if Congress regulates waters for navigability under the Commerce Clause. The U.S. government has the authority to regulate oil and gas drilling in the Great Lakes, including banning new leases and permits. The extent of navigational servitude and whether a drilling ban is related to navigability are unclear. The Court of Appeals has differing opinions on when the navigational servitude applies, with one interpretation suggesting that the current ban may not constitute a taking. However, the navigational servitude only applies when the government has legitimate navigational reasons for its regulation. It is possible that a drilling ban could be justified on navigational grounds. The Army Corps of Engineers claims regulatory authority over drilling in navigable waters under the Rivers and Harbors Act. The unclear legal status of a drilling ban in relation to navigational servitude raises questions about potential Fifth Amendment takings. A ban on leasing or permitting for drilling could potentially constitute a regulatory taking if it sufficiently impairs property interests. The Supreme Court's Penn Central decision states that takings analysis for property interests is case-specific, focusing on factors like government action, economic impact, and interference with investment-backed expectations. Severe economic impact and interference are required for regulation to be considered a taking, especially in the context of Great Lakes oil and gas resources with multiple entities holding property rights. The federal ban on drilling may constitute a taking of property rights for leaseholders, especially if it renders their leases valueless. However, the ban does not affect leases or permits issued before the 2005 Energy Policy Act. Permit renewal may now be banned, and new permits for oil and gas development may not be issued. The federal ban on drilling may result in a taking of property rights for leaseholders if it renders their leases valueless. States hold title to portions of the Great Lakes, including the lakebed and minerals underneath. The ban on future leasing could make oil and gas accumulations valueless unless extracted through non-lease arrangements. The issue of whether this constitutes a taking of state property rights is complex and would depend on specific lease agreements. The federal ban on drilling may result in a taking of property rights for leaseholders if it renders their leases valueless. The whole parcel rule complicates the analysis, stating that regulation affecting only a portion of the property may not constitute a taking. Therefore, a 'taking' of the mineral interest may not result in a Fifth Amendment taking because the totality of the state's rights in the Great Lakes remains unaffected. The U.S. Supreme Court has indicated that it rejects conceptual severance of property rights, including the subsurface mineral estate. It remains unclear whether a taking of state property would result from the current oil and gas leasing ban. Another argument suggests that a ban on leasing in the Great Lakes may not constitute a taking, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission. The government regulation could potentially eradicate drilling in or under the Great Lakes, which may be considered a nuisance under common law. While oil and gas drilling is not inherently a nuisance, specific circumstances could lead to it being regulated as such. The ban on leasing or permitting activities may be seen as regulating a nuisance, potentially avoiding a taking of property. The government regulation could potentially eradicate drilling in or under the Great Lakes. Congress has enacted a permanent ban on new federal or state leases for oil and gas drilling in U.S.-controlled waters of the Great Lakes, citing environmental risks and economic gain as key factors. This ban would not affect Canadian production."
