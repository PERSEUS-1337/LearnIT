    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Safety Act of 1994\". It includes findings related to rail-highway grade crossing safety. Congress finds that there are approximately 170,000 public and 110,000 private at-grade rail-highway crossings in the United States, with nearly 4,900 accidents in 1993. It is necessary to improve safety at these crossings and along rail rights-of-way. There are insufficient public funds for warning systems at all public crossings, and many crossings are unnecessary and should be closed. Rail-highway crossing consolidation will reduce collisions and allow states to focus on safety improvements. Incentives are needed to encourage State and local actions. Increased funding and incentives are needed to encourage the consolidation of rail-highway crossings and educate motorists on their responsibilities to improve safety and realize the benefits of public investment in warning systems. SEC. 3. RAIL-HIGHWAY GRADE CROSSING CLOSING PROGRAM. The text chunk discusses amending Section 120(c) of title 23, United States Code, to include \"rail-highway crossing closures\" and introducing incentive funds for closing crossings in Section 130. States can use funds to provide incentive payments to local jurisdictions for permanently closing public at-grade crossings. The incentive payments for closing rail-highway crossings can be up to $7,500, with matching funds required from the railroad. Local jurisdictions must use the Federal funds for transportation safety improvements. The Secretary will establish guidelines for analyzing public benefits and costs within 18 months of the enactment. SEC. 4. OPERATION LIFESAVER. The Secretary must allocate $500,000 for a public information program to prevent motor vehicle accidents and improve driver performance at railway crossings. Matching funds are required for expenditures over $300,000.\n\nSEC. 5. GRADE CROSSING CORRIDOR SAFETY INCENTIVE PROGRAM. The Grade Crossing Corridor Safety Incentive Program allocates $15,000,000 for states to implement safety improvements on a corridor basis. The program aims to provide financial incentives for reviewing and implementing grade crossing safety measures in accordance with section 130(k) of title 23, United States Code. The Secretary will provide a financial incentive to States for grade crossing safety improvements on a corridor basis. Funds for this program can be used at the Secretary's discretion, with investment criteria issued for project approval. All chapter provisions, except for apportionment formulas and Federal share, apply to funds allocated for this program. Funds authorized for this section will remain available until expended."
