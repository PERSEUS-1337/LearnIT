Congress acknowledges the unique relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal governments, along with the Federal trust responsibility to Indians. It is noted that Indians face severe housing conditions, with high rates of overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, unsafe water supply, and a significant number of homeless or underhoused families.
