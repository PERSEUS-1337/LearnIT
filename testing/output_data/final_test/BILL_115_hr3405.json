    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Maximizing Opportunities for Research and the Enhancement of Automated Vehicles Act\" or the \"MORE Act\". It pertains to motor vehicle testing or evaluation. The MORE Act amends Section 30112(b)(10) of title 49, United States Code, regarding the importation of certified motor vehicles or equipment. Subparagraphs are reorganized and margins adjusted. Manufacturers conducting evaluations must agree not to sell the vehicles. The MORE Act amends Section 30112(b)(10) of title 49, United States Code, regarding manufacturers of highly automated vehicles agreeing not to sell or lease the vehicles after testing or evaluation.

The curr_chunk amends Section 30102 of title 49, United States Code by redesignating paragraphs and requiring proof of insurance for testing highly automated vehicles. The curr_chunk defines \"automated driving system\" as the hardware and software capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis. It also defines \"dynamic driving task\" as the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic. The curr_chunk outlines the functions of a highly automated vehicle, including lateral and longitudinal motion control, monitoring the driving environment, object and event response execution, maneuver planning, and enhancing conspicuity. It also defines a highly automated vehicle as a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial motor vehicles. The curr_chunk revises definitions related to operational design domain for driving automation systems. If SAE International updates certain terms in Recommended Practice Report J3016, they must notify the Secretary for publication in the Federal Register after a public comment period. The Secretary can reject a new definition from SAE International if it doesn't meet safety needs. If accepted, conforming amendments will be made without following standard procedures. The Secretary can update definitions related to highly automated vehicles under section 553 of title 5 without following standard procedures."
