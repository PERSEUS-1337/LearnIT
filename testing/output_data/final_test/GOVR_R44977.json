    "content": "The Stafford Act allows the President to authorize federal assistance for disasters that overwhelm state or tribal capacities. Requests for a major disaster declaration must be made by the governor or tribal chief executive based on the severity of the disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) to evaluate the impact of damage and unmet needs after a disaster. PDAs are crucial in the declaration process for requesting federal assistance. Despite their importance, PDA information has only recently been made available to the public. In 2008, FEMA began posting PDA reports on its website as directed by Congress. These reports summarize damage assessment information for declaring a major disaster, including damage estimates, demographic data, and insurance coverage. They also track the timeline of declaration requests. The PDA process involves gathering information from citizens, officials, and professionals to assess disaster damage. If deemed necessary, a joint FEMA-State or FEMA-Tribal Nation team is assembled to document the damage. The PDA process involves representatives from state government, FEMA regional office, local officials, and sometimes American Red Cross/SBA. Information is gathered, consolidated, and submitted for a disaster declaration. State and tribal governments verify damage before requesting federal assistance. The PDA process involves a pre-assessment by state or tribal government to determine if federal participation is needed. This allows the governor to review the situation before officially requesting a major disaster declaration. A request for federal assistance may be withheld if there are indications of possible denial, as a denied request can only be appealed once. After a pre-assessment by state or tribal government, a damage assessment team is assembled for a major disaster request. The team includes state, federal, and local officials to verify damage extent. A denied request may reflect negatively on a governor's decision-making skills. The damage assessment team, consisting of state, federal, and local officials, collects relevant information about the incident and completes FEMA's PDA template. Challenges may arise in obtaining less tangible information and dealing with the geographic span of damage. The damage assessment team, made up of state, federal, and local officials, faces challenges in covering the geographic span of damage and accessing all affected areas in a limited time. State or tribal governments may halt the information gathering process if they believe enough damage has been documented for a declaration, leading to an incomplete picture of damages and needed assistance. A joint Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) is typically required for a Stafford Act declaration, but waivers can be granted for incidents of unusual severity or magnitude. The PDA process may be waived in certain instances, such as Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Irene, Mathew, and Sandy. Initial federal assistance is limited even when the PDA is expedited, with subsequent assessments needed to determine additional assistance. Conducting an assessment to identify unmet needs can help the FCO determine necessary assistance. After the PDA process, FEMA consults with state or tribal officials to discuss findings and reconcile any differences. Governors or chief executives can then request a major disaster declaration. After completing the PDA process, the governor or chief executive can request a major disaster declaration from FEMA. The request is sent to the FEMA Regional Administrator, who analyzes the data and submits a recommendation to FEMA Headquarters. FEMA then presents a recommendation to the President for a decision on whether to declare a major disaster. The recommendation provided to the President is considered confidential and may not be available under the FOIA process. The FEMA Assistant Administrator for Disaster Assistance determines types of assistance (PA, IA, Hazard Mitigation) based on severity of damage beyond state and local capabilities. The Assistant Administrator for Disaster Assistance authorizes federal assistance requested by the governor, including Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. Factors from Preliminary Damage Assessments influence PA and IA determinations. PA grant program aids in debris removal, emergency services, and infrastructure repair for governments and nonprofits. The Public Assistance (PA) program covers emergency and permanent work for repairing or replacing infrastructure damaged by disasters. FEMA considers factors like cost, localized impacts, insurance coverage, and hazard mitigation when assessing requests for PA. These factors have been in use since 1968 and have been subject to reports by the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Homeland Security Office. The Government Accountability Office and Department of Homeland Security Office have recommended updating the Public Assistance factors to better assess a state's capacity. FEMA proposed a \"Disaster Deductible\" based on fiscal capacity and disaster risk for categories C through G of permanent work. The proposal for a \"Disaster Deductible\" for PA categories C through G aims to improve the assessment of a state's capacity for permanent work, without affecting FEMA assistance for emergency work. The comment period for the proposal closed on April 12, 2017, and a final rule is pending. FEMA considers the estimated cost of assistance as a key factor in determining the need for PA. FEMA relies on two thresholds to recommend Public Assistance (PA): $1 million in public infrastructure damages and $1.43 per capita impact indicator. These thresholds help determine if a major disaster declaration with PA is necessary. The per capita threshold is based on the state's population and has been adjusted periodically since 1999. The per capita threshold for recommending federal supplemental assistance through a major disaster declaration is based on the state's population. For example, California would need damages and costs exceeding $53.27 million to qualify for assistance. This approach considers a state's capacity to respond to incidents within its capabilities. Some argue that using per capita thresholds to determine federal assistance eligibility is consistent with the Stafford Act, while others disagree. Instances where rural areas in highly populated states are denied assistance despite overwhelming local capacity raise concerns about equity. Differences in state populations can lead to disparities in disaster declarations. GAO suggests alternative methods to assess state capabilities. CRS analyzed FEMA's PDA reports to assess alignment of declaration decisions with PA thresholds. Out of 410 requests resulting in PA authorization, two for Vermont met per capita but not $1 million threshold, while two did not meet per capita threshold. One declaration for Arizona in 2010, despite not meeting per capita threshold, was authorized due to severe storm and flooding damages affecting Havaspupai Tribal Nation. PA cost estimate was $1.63 million, exceeding $3,000 per capita impact. Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act allows similar requests now. The Stafford Act allows tribal nations to make similar requests for Public Assistance (PA) directly. In some cases, requests with per capita impact estimates just below the threshold were denied. Despite adherence to thresholds, there were instances where major disaster declarations were not made even when the per capita threshold was exceeded. The next section will discuss thresholds for declarations in tribal nations in more detail. The Stafford Act allows tribal nations to request a major disaster declaration directly from the President. P.L. 113-2, the Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act, amended the Stafford Act to include tribal nations as eligible for assistance. FEMA's use of thresholds for assistance eligibility may be justified if considered along with other factors. Tribal nations can request a major disaster declaration directly from the President under the Stafford Act. FEMA considers tribal declaration requests based on a minimum of $250,000 in PA-eligible damages or costs. Seven out of eight tribal requests exceeding this threshold were declared in the FEMA database. In 2013, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe requested PA after estimating $472,158 in damages from severe storms, winds, and flooding. The tribe estimated $472,158 in PA-eligible damages and costs, requested a major disaster declaration, which was denied and upheld upon appeal. FEMA evaluates costs at the state-level and considers impacts to localities. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate designates affected areas eligible for federal assistance under the Stafford Act, including all local government jurisdictions within its boundaries. FEMA uses a countywide approach for assistance designation. FEMA uses a countywide per capita impact indicator of $3.61 to assess localized impacts for PA funding. If a locality meets or exceeds this threshold, it may be designated for funding. FEMA can recommend a disaster declaration even if the cost threshold is not met, especially for critical infrastructure damage. The President's decision on a disaster declaration may consider large localized impacts, and FEMA also considers insurance coverage in its determinations. FEMA assesses disaster-related damage for major disaster assistance by subtracting insurance coverage from the total estimated eligible cost of Public Assistance (PA) for government units and nonprofit organizations. The process can be complex, especially for entities that self-insure against disasters. State insurance commissioners must certify the availability and affordability of hazard insurance for certain disaster types. FEMA deducts insurance coverage from estimated eligible Public Assistance costs for disasters. The process is complex, especially for self-insured entities. State insurance commissioners certify availability and affordability of hazard insurance for certain disasters. FEMA encourages hazard mitigation efforts and considers previous measures to reduce damages and costs. This includes rewarding states with statewide building codes. FEMA considers infrastructure damage and mitigation efforts in recommending disaster declarations. Previous FEMA funding for mitigation may also be taken into account. PDA reports do not include mitigation information, making it challenging to assess its impact on the decision-making process. If a state has experienced multiple disasters in the past year, FEMA will consider this in their evaluation. FEMA considers the financial and human toll of recent disasters when recommending Public Assistance (PA) declarations. PDA reports do not capture all recent incidents, making it difficult to assess the full impact on decision-making. Some requests for declaration were submitted for damages caused by multiple incidents, surpassing thresholds when combined. Both requests for FEMA assistance were denied despite surpassing thresholds for damages caused by multiple incidents. FEMA considers other federal disaster assistance programs that may be more suitable for addressing specific types of damage, such as the Emergency Relief Program for federal-aid roads and bridges or the U.S. Department of Agriculture for drought assistance. Assistance can be provided under separate authorities from the Stafford Act with or without a major disaster declaration. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) can provide assistance without the President's involvement via a Stafford Act declaration. The Individual Assistance (IA) program offers aid for individuals and households after a disaster, including housing assistance, crisis counseling, and disaster unemployment assistance. FEMA considers various factors when determining IA eligibility, such as damages, trauma, and insurance coverage. These factors were established in 1999 and updated in 2013 under Section 1109. In 2013, Congress directed FEMA to review factors for recommending Individual Assistance (IA) under Section 1109 of SRIA. Proposed factors include state fiscal capacity, uninsured losses, impacted population, community impact, casualties, and unemployment. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on January 11, 2016. FEMA published Individual Assistance Declarations Factors Guidance on September 22, 2016, with a comment period closing on October 24, 2016. Final rule pending. FEMA analyzed major disaster requests for Individual and Household Program (IHP) funding from January 2008 to July 2013. They found that uninsured home and personal property losses played a significant role in determining if a major disaster declaration for IHP was needed. FEMA considers the concentration of damages as a factor for evaluating the need for federal assistance, believing that highly concentrated damages indicate a greater need for help. The dispersion of damage in rural incidents can make assessing individual and household needs challenging. FEMA regulations identify three conditions indicating high community trauma: large numbers of injuries and deaths, disruption of community functions, and emergency needs like power or water loss. FEMA considers trauma from injuries and loss of life when determining assistance eligibility. FEMA considers trauma from injuries and loss of life in determining eligibility for assistance, including medical and funeral expenses. Factors such as media coverage, disruption of community functions, and emergency needs like power or water loss are also taken into account. Evaluating these indicators for large-scale disruptions involves discretionary judgments due to the lack of defined criteria in law or regulation. In response to large-scale disruptions, FEMA evaluates IA needs considering trauma, community infrastructure impact, casualties, and special populations like low-income, elderly, and tribal groups. Congress directs FEMA to reassess conditions contributing to trauma under Section 1109 of SRIA. Special populations, such as low-income and elderly households, are considered in a governor's request for Individual Assistance (IA). PDA reports provide data on the percentage of these households in affected areas. Tables compare the percentage of low-income and elderly households in requests that resulted in IA authorization versus those that were denied. The data in the PDA reports align with FEMA's analysis of major disaster declaration requests. The analysis of requests for Individual Assistance (IA) between January 2008 and July 2013 shows that the percentage of low-income households decreases as the total estimated costs of assistance for uninsured losses increase. However, there is no clear trend regarding the percentage of elderly households in relation to the estimated costs of assistance. The analysis of requests for Individual Assistance (IA) between January 2008 and July 2013 shows no systematic difference in the percentage of elderly households for declared disasters that received IA. FEMA evaluates state and local capabilities and voluntary agency assistance to determine supplemental IA. This evaluation can vary greatly in subjectivity and may be contentious in the disaster declaration process. The capacities of primary voluntary agencies to meet disaster victim needs depend on the number of simultaneous events. Federal resources are crucial for full recovery as state and local capacities may not be sufficient. Insurance coverage is important for Individual Assistance (IA) as federal aid cannot duplicate insurance coverage. FEMA deducts losses covered by insurance when calculating IA-eligible losses. FEMA uses census data to determine homeowner insurance penetration, especially in flood-prone areas where insurance is often required for federally-backed mortgages. The NFIP administered by FEMA helps officials assess flood insurance status in communities. FEMA compares IA cost estimates to average individual assistance amounts by state, using data from 1994 to 1999 as a guide, not as thresholds. The average individual assistance amounts by state are not to be used as thresholds but as a guide for disaster planning. FEMA determines incidents warranting IA based on damage amounts, not solely on the table values. The table, based on outdated census data, causes confusion among states and should be removed according to a proposed rule by FEMA. The CRS dataset compares average assistance per disaster from 1994 to 1999 with estimates from PDA reports for small, medium, and large states. Damage estimates exceeding certain indicators predict major disaster declaration for IA. However, over 75% of requests did not exceed these indicators. The PDA reports provide information on major disaster requests and the time between request and decision by the President. Requests with damage estimates below certain indicators still received Individual Assistance (IA). The requests are categorized into declared/expedited, denied/appealed, etc., with varying timelines for decision. Requests for Individual Assistance (IA) are often decided quickly, with 89.8% decided within a month, 63.7% within two weeks, and 18.5% within a week of being requested. The decision timeline can be influenced by factors such as the extent of damage, with requests exceeding per capita impact estimates being decided 6.4 days sooner on average. Additionally, requests estimating over $7.5 million in costs were decided on average in 6.2 days. Requests for Individual Assistance (IA) are often decided quickly, with 89.8% decided within a month, 63.7% within two weeks, and 18.5% within a week of being requested. Factors like the extent of damage and cost estimates influence decision timelines. Requests over $7.5 million in costs were decided in 6.2 days on average. The type of disaster event can also impact the timeline, with flooding events taking an average of 48.5 days due to unique access issues for damage assessment teams. The time between when a request is submitted and when a decision is announced varies by event. For all events, the average time is 13.4 days, but for fire-related events, it is 20.5 days on average. This delay may be due to the availability of Fire Management Assistance Grants. The PDA process can help predict obligations for public and individual assistance after a disaster declaration. Combining PDA reports with DRF information allows for assessing accuracy in estimating assistance amounts. It is important to note that PDA estimates are just estimates and some degree of inaccuracy is expected. Damage assessment teams may have an incentive to gather sufficient data for a disaster declaration. The PDA estimates for disaster assistance may under-estimate ultimate obligations, with PDAs over-estimating PA obligations in 56.3% of cases. The largest over-estimate was $64.6 million, while the largest under-estimate was $453.9 million. The largest over-estimate for disaster assistance obligations by PDAs was $64.6 million, while the largest under-estimate was $453.9 million. PDAs were just as likely to overestimate IA obligations as to underestimate them, with the largest over-estimate being $19.4 million and the largest under-estimate being $361.5 million. The difference in estimation magnitudes may be influenced by the incentive structure. The differences in estimation magnitudes for disaster assistance obligations by PDAs may be influenced by the incentive structure. FEMA recommends a major disaster declaration based on a per capita impact indicator, adjusted periodically since 1999. The rationale for using a per capita threshold is to assess tax revenues supporting disaster assistance. The per capita threshold for disaster assistance is based on tax revenues supporting state capacity. Some argue it aligns with the Stafford Act, while others question its usefulness. Concerns about its accuracy may lead to the need for alternative measurements, as suggested in a 2001 GAO report on disaster declaration criteria. In 2001, GAO recommended that FEMA develop more objective criteria for disaster declaration, suggesting replacing per capita measure with Total Taxable Resources (TTR) as a better indicator of state funding capacity. TTR includes business income, undistributed profits, and payments to out-of-state owners, providing a more comprehensive measure of state resources potentially subject to taxation. Total Taxable Resources (TTR) is recommended by GAO as a better indicator of state funding capacity compared to per capita measure. TTR includes business income, undistributed profits, and payments to out-of-state owners, providing a more comprehensive measure of state resources potentially subject to taxation. It is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states under certain programs. Adjustments for TTR in FEMA's Public Assistance program could result in a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to respond to disasters. While some may argue that TTR conflicts with Congress's prohibition against arithmetic formulas, GAO suggests that TTR could be used alongside other criteria without violating the law.

It is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states under certain programs. Adjustments for TTR in FEMA's Public Assistance program could result in a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to respond to disasters. Some argue that loss of life should be given greater weight when evaluating incidents for federal assistance, using methods like the value of statistical life (VSL) to assign a monetary value to each fatality. The U.S. Department of Transportation uses the value of statistical life (VSL) to assign a monetary value to each fatality in risk evaluation. Congress may require FEMA to consider loss of life in disaster recommendations. PDA reports were made public due to Congress's requirement from 2008 to 2015, which may continue in future appropriations. Congress could specify the information needed in public reports. PDA reports provide information on the timeline for major disaster requests and decisions. Congress may consider shortening these timelines and conducting oversight on the accuracy of PDA reports. PDA reports are summary documents of information gathered during preliminary damage assessments. Congress may need to increase accuracy or provide more resources for the PDA process. However, this could potentially delay federal assistance. Some argue that certain requirements may violate the Stafford Act. Some argue that the use of per capita threshold in disaster declarations may violate the Stafford Act. Congress could consider strengthening or eliminating Section 320 of the Stafford Act based on the importance of the PDA process in determining federal assistance. The PDA reports provide valuable data for assessing disaster impacts and guiding decisions on federal assistance requests. FEMA's consistent use of indicators in declarations decisions, such as per capita amounts, helps in estimating disaster costs. While estimates may not always align with actual spending, they offer insights into disaster scope and spending categories. The PDA reports offer insights into disaster response efforts, indicating swift decision-making processes. Different types of disasters require varying assessment times, with tornado damage assessed quickly and flooding damage taking longer. Future improvements may include better survey tools for capturing more information efficiently. The efficiency of the PDA process relies on factors for assessing disaster damage, which are expected to change. Congressional oversight of these changes will be a priority in the future."
