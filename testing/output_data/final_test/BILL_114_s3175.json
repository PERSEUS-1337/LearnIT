    "content": "The \"First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016\" is cited as the short title. Section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the \"First-Time Homebuyer Refundable Credit.\" The \"First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016\" amends Section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit of 2.5% of the purchase price of a first-time homebuyer's residence, not exceeding $10,000, with limitations based on marital and filing status. The First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016 amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a credit based on the purchase price of a first-time homebuyer's residence, with limitations on income and purchase price. The First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016 offers a credit for first-time homebuyers based on the purchase price of their residence, with income and purchase price limitations. The credit amount is determined by the purchase price and modified adjusted gross income. There is an age limitation for claiming the credit, and it cannot be claimed if the taxpayer is under 18 at the time of purchase or if a deduction under section 151 is claimed. The First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016 provides a credit for first-time homebuyers based on the purchase price of their residence, with income and purchase price limitations. The credit amount is determined by the purchase price and modified adjusted gross income. There is an age limitation for claiming the credit, and it cannot be claimed if the taxpayer is under 18 at the time of purchase or if a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year. Married couples must file a joint return to claim the credit. If two or more individuals who are not married purchase a principal residence, the credit amount shall be allocated among them, not exceeding $10,000 in total. The First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016 provides a credit for first-time homebuyers based on the purchase price of their residence. Married couples must file a joint return to claim the credit. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who acquires a principal residence by purchase and has not claimed any credit or deduction for the purchase or ownership of any residence in previous taxable years. The First-Time Homebuyer Credit Act of 2016 provides a credit for first-time homebuyers based on the purchase price of their residence. To qualify, the individual must not have owned a principal residence before and must provide their social security number on the tax return. The Secretary may waive certain requirements for individuals not eligible to file a joint return if they were married when purchasing a previous residence. The term 'principal residence' has the same meaning as in section 121, and 'purchase' refers to any acquisition not from a related person. The basis of property acquired by a person is not determined by the adjusted basis of the property from the previous owner. A residence constructed by the taxpayer is considered purchased on the date they first occupy it. The term 'purchase price' for a principal residence is the adjusted basis on the purchase date, to be included in the tax return. Related persons are defined based on relationships that would disallow losses under specific sections. Marital status is also a factor in this context. Marital status is determined according to section 7703. If a taxpayer disposes of their residence within 5 taxable years, no credit is allowed for the purchase of a residence. Partial recapture may apply if the residence is disposed of after receiving a credit. If the taxpayer disposes of their principal residence within 4 taxable years after receiving the credit, the tax imposed will be increased by a recapture percentage of the credit amount. The \"credit year\" refers to the year when the credit was allowed, and the recapture percentage is applied in such cases. The recapture percentage for disposal or cessation of a principal residence within 4 taxable years after receiving the credit is determined according to a specific table. The recapture percentage for disposal or cessation of a principal residence within 4 taxable years after receiving the credit is 80 percent in the 1st year, 60 percent in the 2nd year, 40 percent in the 3rd year, and 20 percent in the 4th year, with exceptions for certain circumstances like death or divorce. The circumstances that may trigger recapture of a homebuyer credit include divorce, involuntary conversion of the residence, relocation of duty station, change of employment, or other specified situations. The recapture of a homebuyer credit can be triggered by various circumstances such as divorce, involuntary conversion of the residence, relocation of duty station, change of employment, loss of employment, health conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances specified by the Secretary. If a credit is allowed, the taxpayer's basis in the property will be reduced by the amount of the credit. Reporting requirements may be necessary to verify eligibility for the credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new provision in section 36(e) regarding basis adjustment. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 1016(a) and section 26(b)(2) to align with the changes. A clerical amendment is also made to update the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new provision in section 36(e) for a first-time homebuyer refundable credit. Subparagraph (N) of section 6213(g)(2) is amended to address errors related to claiming the credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new provision for a first-time homebuyer refundable credit. IRS recordkeeping rules are adjusted despite limitations on assessment and collection. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue must maintain records of returns and return information for taxpayers claiming the credit under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code. These records can be discarded after the taxpayer's death. The amendments apply to residences purchased after December 31, 2016."
