It outlines the authorities of the District of Columbia Courts. The \"District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2014\" amends Chapter 17 of title 11, District of Columbia Official Code, by adding a new section for the collection, compromise, and waiver of employee debts and erroneous payments. The Executive Officer has the authority to collect debts and erroneous payments made to employees of the District of Columbia Courts. The Act allows for the collection of employee debts through deductions from their pay, limited to 20% of disposable income unless consent is given. Deductions can be made from various forms of pay, excluding retirement pay. The Act allows for the collection of employee debts through deductions from their pay, limited to 20% of disposable income unless consent is given. If an employee's employment ends before the debt is fully collected, deductions can be made from later non-periodic government payments. Prior to initiating debt collection proceedings, the Executive Officer must provide the individual with a minimum of 30 days written notice. The District of Columbia Courts will collect debts through deductions from pay, with options for the individual to inspect records, establish a repayment schedule, and request a hearing on the debt determination. The individual can request a hearing within fifteen days of receiving a notice about their repayment schedule, as per the procedures set by the Executive Officer. The hearing will be granted if the debt's existence or amount is in question. The hearing for a debt issue of credibility or veracity, or unresolved by documentary evidence, will be conducted by an independent officer. Filing a petition for a hearing stays collection proceedings. The hearing officer must issue a final decision within 60 days of the hearing. The Executive Officer has the authority to compromise claims to collect debts under $100,000. Routine pay adjustments due to clerical errors or delays within the last 4 pay periods are exempt from certain notification requirements. The Executive Officer can compromise claims under $100,000, suspend collection if no one can pay, and the compromise is final unless obtained fraudulently. An official is not liable for lost amounts due to a compromise. The Executive Officer has the authority to waive a claim if it goes against equity, good conscience, or the best interests of the Courts. However, this authority cannot be used if there are indications of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith related to the claim. The Executive Officer can waive a claim if it goes against equity, good conscience, or the best interests of the Courts. The application for waiver must be submitted within 3 years of discovering the erroneous payment, except for certain federal benefits claims. Denial of waiver application is the final decision, and refunds may be issued for amounts already collected against the claim. If a claim is waived by the Executive Officer due to equity, good conscience, or the Courts' best interests, the employee can apply for a refund of any reimbursement within 2 years of the waiver. Full credit will be given for waived amounts in the audit of accountable officials' accounts, and waived payments are considered valid. The Executive Officer's authority to waive claims does not affect other authorities. Regulations by the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration will govern this authority. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents. The amendments allow for the collection, compromise, and waiver of employee debts and erroneous payments. The Executive Officer is authorized to purchase uniforms for nonjudicial employees of the District of Columbia Courts. The United States Code allows for a uniform allowance for Government employees.
