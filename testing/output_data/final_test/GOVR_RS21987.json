    "content": "Federal lawmakers recognize the importance of financial businesses in the U.S. economy and provide protection for individual account holders in case of firm failure. This protection aims to safeguard individuals from risks they may not be aware of and prevent financial panics that can have severe consequences for the economy. Before the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, deposit insurance covered accounts up to $100,000, which was increased to $250,000 for both regular and retirement accounts after the enactment of the EESA. After the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 on September 23, 2008, the maximum deposit insurance was raised to $250,000 for both regular and retirement accounts. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 extended the increases until 2013, with the possibility of reverting back to $100,000 and $250,000 for retirement accounts after that. Various financial institutions receive government guarantees on specified accounts. This report summarizes the customer protection systems of financial institutions. Financial institutions have safety-net provisions legislated over time in reaction to financial collapses. Regulatory bodies can rescue failing enterprises using tools like liquidity lending and arranging mergers. The Federal Reserve can step in as a lender of last resort to prevent serious adverse consequences for the economy. The financial safety net includes provisions for assisting failing institutions during crises, such as the subprime meltdown. Congress may need to provide emergency funding in times of severe pressure. Examples include the cleanup of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided funds for distressed assets and troubled financial institutions. Lawmakers have used different models, such as federal deposit insurance with a \"user fee\" approach. Following the banking failures of the late 1980s-early 1990s, legislation shifted deposit protection towards a \"mutual\" model where the banking industry bears more of the financial burden. Some analysts argue that in this mutual mode, the banking industry essentially owns the deposit insurance fund. However, if the FDIC taps into its credit line at the U.S. Treasury for the first time, the system would revert back to a user fee model, requiring banks to pay assessments and repay borrowed funds to the government. The federal government owns and operates the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), with its ultimate guarantor being the government's economic power, particularly its ability to tax. History has shown that deposit guarantees below the federal level have been insufficient in preventing financial crises. State-level programs have only contained collapses if damages were small. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and FDIC have accepted increased lines of credit from the U.S. Treasury to address failing institutions during the current financial crisis. The NCUA and FDIC accepted an increased line of credit from the U.S. Treasury to resolve failing corporate credit unions and restore the NCUSIF. Corporate credit unions suffered losses in the subprime foreclosure turmoil. The NCUA moving closer to user fee mode like the FDIC. Tables compare account protection at depository and non-depository institutions. Further analysis available on administering agencies' websites. On October 23, 2008, during the financial crisis, the FDIC introduced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee program to unfreeze the short-term credit markets. The program guaranteed new senior unsecured debt and funds in non-interest bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. This restored investor confidence and normalized short-term markets. The FDIC's TLG program guarantees 100% of non-interest-bearing transaction accounts in insured depository institutions until December 31, 2009, addressing concerns about small business accounts exceeding the $250,000 insurance limit. Additional fees on depository institutions fund the program, not taxpayers."
