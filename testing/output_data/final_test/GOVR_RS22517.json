    "content": "The EU sees enlargement as a chance to promote stability and prosperity in Europe. Membership criteria include adopting shared political values and norms, such as democracy, rule of law, human rights, and a market economy. Any European country can apply for membership under Article 49 of the Treaty on the European Union. The EU decides when to accept new members based on its ability to absorb them. The application process is rigorous, with approval procedures ensuring all requirements are met before admission. The EU's enlargement process involves rigorous criteria for new member admission, with the European Council overseeing the application process. Accession talks include screening an applicant's ability to meet the EU's rules and regulations, known as the acquis communautaire. Negotiations at the ministerial level establish terms for implementing the rules in each of the 35 chapters. The European Commission proposes common negotiating positions for the EU on each chapter. The EU's enlargement process involves rigorous criteria for new member admission, with the European Council overseeing the application process. The Commission proposes common negotiating positions for the EU on each chapter, which must be approved unanimously by the Council of Ministers. Candidate countries must align their institutions, management capacity, and systems with EU standards. Financial assistance is provided to aid in the accession process. Chapters of the acquis can only be opened and closed with the approval of all member states. Progress reports are issued periodically to assess the candidate country's progress. The EU's enlargement process involves rigorous criteria for new member admission, with the European Council overseeing the application process. The Commission concludes negotiations on all 35 chapters with an applicant, which are then incorporated into a draft accession treaty for approval by the Council and European Parliament. The largest expansion of the EU was in 2004, accepting 10 new member states. Currently, there are five candidate countries, with Montenegro being a candidate since 2010 and formally opening accession negotiations in 2012. The EU enlargement process involves strict criteria for new member admission, overseen by the European Council. Currently, there are five candidate countries: Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, Turkey, and Iceland. Iceland has expressed disinterest in EU membership. Prior to October 2009, barriers to enlargement included conditions set by the 2000 Treaty of Nice limiting EU membership to 27 countries. The Lisbon Treaty, in effect since December 1, 2009, allows for future enlargement of the EU. A candidate country with significant financial implications for the Union can only be admitted after 2014, as per the EU's budget framework. Turkey's candidacy falls under this restriction, stemming from the 1963 Ankara Agreement for closer economic ties. In 1987, Turkey's first application for full EU membership was deferred until 1993. The EU recognized Turkey formally as a candidate in 1999 but failed to put Turkey on a clear track to membership. In 1999, the EU recognized Turkey as a candidate for membership but stated that Turkey needed to meet political and economic criteria before accession talks could start. In 2001, an \"Accession Partnership\" was adopted, outlining priorities for Turkey to meet EU standards. Despite hopes for negotiations to begin in 2002, no agreement was reached. In 2004, the European Council acknowledged Turkey's progress in legislative, economic, and judicial reforms, allowing accession talks to proceed within a year. The European Council acknowledged Turkey's progress in legislative, economic, and judicial reform, allowing accession talks to proceed within a year. The European Parliament supported this decision, despite concerns over Turkey's potential membership in the Union. Voter concerns over EU enlargement and Turkey's cultural differences were factors in the defeat of the Treaty for a European Constitution in 2005. Turkey was required to sign a protocol by October 2005 to adapt the 1963 Ankara Agreement for EU membership. Turkey signed a Protocol in July 2005 to adapt the 1963 Ankara Agreement for EU membership, but clarified that it did not grant diplomatic recognition to Cyprus. Turkey insisted on recognition only after the reunification of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. Ankara also stated that it would not open its seaports or airspace to Greek Cypriot vessels until the EU ended the \"isolation\" of Turkish Cypriots. This declaration by Turkey soured attitudes within the EU, leading to a rebuttal from the EU Council in September 2005 reminding Turkey that Cyprus was a full member of the EU. The EU Council issued a rebuttal to Turkey, emphasizing Cyprus' full EU membership and the need for recognition of all member states in the accession process. The EU warned that failure to implement obligations under the Additional Protocol would impact negotiations. Despite controversy, formal accession talks with Turkey began in October 2005 under an open-ended Negotiating Framework. In 2006, Turkey faced challenges in its EU relations as negotiations began, with Cyprus opposing progress unless Turkey recognized all EU member states. This strained relations and may have influenced a shift in attitudes between Turkey and the EU. In 2006, Turkey's EU negotiations faced obstacles due to Cyprus's demand for recognition from Ankara. The EU warned Turkey about the impact of not fulfilling obligations, particularly regarding Cyprus. The Enlargement Commissioner highlighted the Cyprus issue as a major hurdle in the accession talks, urging Turkey to resume reforms to avoid a potential crisis later in the year. Advocates in Ankara feared a shift in European interest towards Turkey, viewing EU incentives for reforms as diminishing. Many Turks felt EU incentives turned into discouraging conditions, slowing reform in Turkey. In September 2006, the European Parliament criticized Turkey for slow reforms in freedom of expression, minority rights, law enforcement, and judiciary independence. Recognition of all member states, including Cyprus, was deemed necessary for Turkey's accession process. The EU Commission urged Turkey to fulfill its obligations under the Association Agreement and Additional Protocol. In December 2006, a compromise was reached at the EU Summit regarding Turkey's accession negotiations, highlighting concerns about Turkey's compliance with its obligations towards Cyprus. The EU Commission urged Turkey to fulfill its obligations under the Association Agreement and Additional Protocol. In December 2006, a compromise was reached at the EU Summit regarding Turkey's accession negotiations, with a deadline set for Turkey to implement the Additional Protocol by December 2009. The accession process between 2007 and 2011 lacked direction and progress, leading to a sense of disappointment for Turkey's EU aspirations. Turkey's EU aspirations suffered a setback when negotiations on key chapters of the acquis were halted until the Cyprus issue was resolved. France's 2007 presidential election saw opposition to Turkey's membership, with Nicolas Sarkozy stating Turkey should never join the Union. In 2007, the EU agreed to open three more chapters and set benchmarks for 14 additional chapters pending Turkey's compliance. Progress was noted in political reforms, but challenges remained in areas like freedom of expression, corruption, cultural rights, and civilian oversight. In 2008, limited progress was made in political reform in Turkey. The EU opened six additional chapters of the acquis, but key chapters on energy, external relations, and security were delayed by some member states. Despite internal political issues and the global economic crisis, Turkey showed renewed commitment to the EU accession process in early 2009. In early 2009, Turkey appointed its first full-time EU accession negotiator, State Minister Egemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f, which was seen as a positive step by the EU Council. However, in March 2009, Turkey faced political challenges in the European Parliament regarding the reform process. Despite concerns raised by the Parliament, the 11th chapter of the acquis was opened in June 2009, indicating some progress in meeting reform criteria. The Commission, Council, and Parliament noted positive advancements in Turkey's reform process, including improvements in judicial reform, civil-military relations, and cultural rights. However, they also highlighted shortcomings in freedom of expression, press freedom, and property rights. Turkey was criticized for not fulfilling obligations regarding the Additional Protocol and normalization of relations with Cyprus. The EU expected Turkey to actively support ongoing negotiations for a Cyprus solution, but was not satisfied with Turkey's level of engagement. Turkey skeptics in Europe suggested altering the accession process if Turkey did not meet membership requirements or if the EU's capacity for absorption was limited. French Secretary of State Pierre Lellouche hinted at the need to consider alternatives if Turkey did not progress by the end of 2009. In late 2009, Lellouche suggested exploring alternative paths for Turkey's EU membership, reflecting France's opposition. Cyprus supported Turkey's EU course but emphasized not compromising EU principles. In May 2010, the EU-Turkey Association Council discussed relations. Egemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f discussed EU-Turkey relations, highlighting the need for more reforms in areas like corruption, freedom of expression, and judicial reform. EU Commissioner F\u00fcle praised Turkey's constitutional reform referendum as a step towards EU accession but expressed concerns about freedom of expression and press in Turkey. The 2010 progress reports by the European Commission and Council acknowledged positive steps taken by Turkey but also highlighted areas of concern. The European Parliament sharply criticized Turkey for lack of dialogue among political parties, failure to implement Additional Protocols, and limited press freedom. This criticism marked a shift from Turkey's negotiator's positive view on the progress reports. The European Parliament criticized Turkey for lack of dialogue among political parties, failure to implement Additional Protocols, and limited press freedom in 2005. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan expressed anger at the resolution, suggesting it was unbalanced. Some believed Turkey's EU accession talks were heading for stalemate due to differing assessments on Turkey's reform progress and customs union obligations towards Cyprus. In 2011, EU accession negotiations with Turkey stalled, with no new chapters opened and little progress made. Turkish officials acknowledged political blockages causing a bottleneck in talks. Erdogan expressed frustration with the lack of advancement. In 2011, Turkey faced political blockages in EU accession negotiations, with Prime Minister Erdogan expressing frustration towards France and Germany. The country was also preoccupied with a national election, strained relations with Israel and Syria, and the ongoing Cyprus issue. Despite the AK Party's victory in the elections, they did not secure a super majority for a new constitution, but it was seen as a step towards reform. In 2011, despite Turkey's victory in the elections, goals for a new constitution and reform agenda were not achieved. The EU and accession process seemed less important, leading to speculation about waning interest in EU membership. Prime Minister Erdogan established the European Union Ministry to oversee Turkey's EU accession process, signaling continued interest in membership. The Cyprus issue emerged during the summer of 2011. During the summer of 2011, the Cyprus issue resurfaced as a major obstacle to Turkey's EU accession process. Prime Minister Erdogan visited northern Cyprus and emphasized the need for a resolution by the end of the year to prevent the island from remaining divided. Erdogan also stated that certain security and territorial demands from the Turkish Cypriots were unacceptable. In response to demands made of Turkish Cypriots, Erdogan stated that if \"southern Cyprus\" assumed EU Council presidency, Ankara would freeze relations. Criticism followed from Greek Cypriot community and EU members. Turkey opposed Cyprus drilling for gas in Eastern Mediterranean, calling it illegal. Ankara criticized the decision regarding the coast of southern Cyprus, warning of negative effects on negotiations and increasing naval presence. The EU questioned Turkey's foreign policy initiative and praised its economic and regional contributions. The European Commission and Council recognized Turkey's importance for the EU's security and prosperity, noting positive developments in the constitutional referendum and June elections. The European Commission and Council acknowledged positive developments in Turkey, such as civilian control of the military and financial services. However, concerns were raised about issues like freedom of expression and women's rights. Erdogan's statements about freezing relations with the EU Presidency in 2012 were also criticized. Turkey's threats towards Cyprus' right to explore natural resources, particularly gas in the Cypriot Exclusive Economic Zone, elicited a swift and negative reaction from Ankara. Prime Minister Erdogan criticized the EU for its \"mud-slinging\" and claimed the progress reports showed a lack of reason. Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Egemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f, argued that the Commission's report focused on problems and overlooked Turkey's progress, while the main opposition party, CHP, praised the report for highlighting democracy issues. The EU Commission's report criticized Turkey for lack of progress in meeting required benchmarks for opening three remaining chapters of the EU accession acquis. Despite this, the Commission proposed a \"positive agenda\" with Turkey outside of accession negotiations if Turkey avoided the Cypriot presidency in 2012. The European Parliament supported the Commission's intention to develop a new agenda for EU-Turkey relations, emphasizing the need for a positive agenda to enhance reforms without replacing accession negotiations. Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU were at a political standstill in early 2012. In early 2012, Turkey's EU accession negotiations were at a standstill. Turkey's disregard for the Republic of Cyprus' EU Presidency caused tension in the EU. Little progress was expected until after the Cyprus presidential election in 2013. The EU Commission initiated a new \"positive agenda\" with Turkey in 2012 to improve relations, focusing on legislative alignment and enhanced energy cooperation. The \"positive agenda\" with Turkey in 2012 aimed to enhance cooperation in various areas such as legislative alignment, energy, visas, and political reforms. Some viewed it as a way to complement formal accession negotiations, while others saw it as a tactic to bypass the Cyprus EU Presidency. The \"positive agenda\" with Turkey in 2012 aimed to enhance cooperation in various areas such as legislative alignment, energy, visas, and political reforms. Some saw it as a way to complement formal accession negotiations, while others viewed it as a tactic to bypass the Cyprus EU Presidency. The new \"agenda\" for some could potentially allow the EU and Turkey to achieve a \"virtual membership\" with stronger political, economic, and social relations, without necessarily aiming for full Union membership. Turkey would still need to comply with the detailed acquis to become an actual EU member, but by embracing the new \"agenda,\" Turkey seemed to be moving towards closer ties with the EU. In 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan froze certain relations with the EU, including formal accession negotiations, when Cyprus assumed the EU presidency. This decision was made despite the launch of the \"positive agenda,\" impacting Cyprus settlement negotiations. Turkish Cypriots may have concluded that Turkey's long-term relations with the EU were no longer dependent on progress in the Cyprus issue. Despite the EU's calls for Turkey to play a constructive role in Cyprus, negotiations stalled by July 1, 2012, leading to the suspension of talks by the UN. The Cyprus presidency began, and formal EU-Turkey accession negotiations halted, but informal discussions continued under the \"positive agenda.\" Turkey's refusal to engage with the Republic of Cyprus did not affect these talks. Engagement between the EU and Turkey continued in the last six months of 2012, focusing on visa liberalization. Both sides emphasized the importance of simplifying visa requirements for Turkish business people, academics, students, and civil society representatives. Progress under the \"positive agenda\" was unclear, and it was uncertain if it would continue after the Cypriot EU presidency ended. The formal accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey have now resumed. The EU and Turkey have resumed formal accession negotiations, with uncertainty surrounding the continuation of the \"positive agenda\" framework for blocked chapters. The EU Commission expressed disappointment with Turkey's progress in its annual report, citing issues such as diplomatic recognition of Cyprus and opening sea and air ports. Turkey's stance on the Cyprus EU presidency was also highlighted. The European Council released conclusions on Turkey's progress in EU accession, noting some positive steps but also highlighting shortcomings in media freedom, expression, assembly, and judicial reform. The Turkish Foreign Ministry published its own progress report refuting criticisms from the EU Commission. In early February 2013, France, Germany, and Cyprus showed willingness to resume EU accession talks with Turkey. Technical discussions on Chapter 22 began, leading to a new round of negotiations scheduled for mid-June 2013. The European Parliament issued a resolution in April 2013 echoing the EU's concerns on judicial reform and freedom of expression in Turkey. The European Parliament echoed concerns on judicial reform and freedom of expression in Turkey, emphasizing the importance of good neighborly relations and solidarity within the EU. The Parliament commended Turkey and the Commission for implementing the \"positive agenda\" initiative, but also highlighted the need for mutual respect and cooperation among EU members. In early June 2013, as the resumption of accession negotiations with Turkey approached, domestic turmoil rocked Turkey with public protests over Gezi park in central Ankara. The European Parliament expressed deep concern over the excessive use of force by Turkish police, leading to verbal sparring between Turkey and the EU. Prime Minister Erdogan rejected decisions made by the European Parliament, causing tension between Turkey and several EU member states. In response to Ankara's crackdown on protestors, some EU member states, including Germany, threatened to delay accession talks. Turkey's EU Minister Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f criticized European countries, leading to a decision to officially open Chapter 22 but postpone negotiations until October 2013. Talks resumed on November 5, 2013, seen as a symbolic victory for Turkey. The EU's decision to open Chapter 22 was a symbolic victory for Turkey, signaling progress towards membership. However, the focus should be on closing chapters where criteria have been met. The European Commission's 2013 assessment of Turkey was more positive, highlighting the country's importance and mentioning a new democracy proposal. The European Commission expressed disappointment with Turkey's progress on various issues, including handling of protests, freedom of expression, and refusal to recognize EU member Cyprus. Relations between Turkey and the EU have been uncertain regarding future membership, but both sides agree on the importance of close relations. The EU accession process has been a significant motivation for Turkey over the years. Over the past eight years, the EU accession process has driven Turkey's internal reforms, democratization, and economic growth. It has strengthened ties between Europe and Turkey, with a significant portion of Turkey's exports going to the EU. Turkey's growing economy serves as a vital market for European goods and attracts foreign direct investment, particularly from Europe. Additionally, Turkey plays a crucial role as an energy hub and transit region. Turkey's role as an important energy hub and transit region for European energy supply diversification continues to grow with the construction of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) bringing natural gas from Azerbaijan through Turkey into Europe. The instability in North Africa and the Middle East suggests closer EU-Turkey relations, despite Turkey's criticism of the EU's policies towards Egypt and Syria. Turkey's foreign policy activism aims to establish itself as an independent regional influence, prompting calls for a \"strategic dialogue\" with Turkey on foreign policy. The EU and Turkey need each other for various reasons, but European attitudes towards Turkey are clouded by cultural and religious differences. German Chancellor Merkel's coalition partners stated in their election manifesto that Turkey should not become an EU member. A policy paper by German Chancellor Merkel's advisors and coalition partners suggests supporting a \"privileged relationship\" with Turkey instead of full EU membership. Concerns have been raised in Europe about Turkey's political, economic, social, and religious orientation, with some perceiving a shift away from European values. Despite concerns about Turkey's non-European disposition, some EU member states and the EU Commission still express a desire for Turkey's accession. However, Europe's disinterest, skepticism, and opposition, along with perceived foot-dragging in negotiations, have led to ambivalence in Turkey about its future in the EU. The AK Party's early embrace of EU reforms was seen as a way to legitimize itself, but some believe it was more about solidifying power than Europeanization. The 2010 constitutional referendum and 2011 national elections are also significant events in this context. Despite initial efforts to align with European norms, Turkey's EU aspirations were not central to political parties' messages during the 2010 constitutional referendum and 2011 national elections. Some believe that Turkey's leadership may no longer prioritize EU membership as the desired end point, leading to a slowdown in the reform process. The EU Commission's 2011 progress report on Turkey's accession was seen as a concern for Turkish bureaucrats and Eurocrats. The 2012 Commission assessment had little impact on Turks, with many feeling that Europe is no longer a priority for Turkey. Ankara's focus on reforms is driven by its own needs, rather than EU influence. Prime Minister Erdogan's 2012 speech to the AKP party congress did not mention Turkey's EU perspective. Despite dynamic changes in Turkey driven by EU aspirations, Erdogan's 2012 speech to the AKP party congress did not mention Turkey's EU perspective. The slow pace of EU accession, exacerbated by Turkey's refusal to recognize Cyprus and open its ports, remains a major obstacle to progress. Turkey's tough rhetoric and naval presence in the Eastern Mediterranean further complicate negotiations. Turkey's tough rhetoric and occasional naval presence in the Eastern Mediterranean are seen as Ankara's response to Cyprus' energy exploration. The handling of the Gezi park protests in June also alienated Europe, raising doubts about Turkey's EU membership. Ankara questions the need for EU accession, with little enthusiasm from Europe for Turkey as a full member. Observers question the continuation of the accession process. Turkey and its supporters argue for enhanced dialogue with the EU, highlighting Turkey's economic partnership and regional importance. Many Europeans acknowledge Turkey's role in defense and foreign policy, but some express concerns about foreign policy alignment. Energy security and foreign policy are key issues, but Turkey must comply with all 35 chapters of the acquis for EU membership. Turkey must comply with all 35 chapters of the acquis for EU membership, relying on the European market and political goodwill. Despite doubts, Turkish leaders continue the accession process, with President Gul stating EU membership remains a priority in 2013. This approach may serve as a hedge in case Turkey's regional leadership ambitions falter or internal reforms are questioned. The Gezi park demonstrations and government reaction may impact Prime Minister Erdogan's future political plans. Turkey and the EU may not be prepared to end the accession process, but there are suggestions that both parties could mutually agree to end it if formal membership is no longer a priority. The United States does not have a direct role in the EU accession process. The United States supports EU enlargement for stability and economic opportunities in Europe. The US has backed Turkey's EU membership, causing some displeasure among EU member states. Many European countries, including France, Germany, and Austria, have narrow views on Turkey's accession to the EU, focusing mainly on geopolitical and security issues. Some Europeans fear that not granting full EU membership to Turkey would be seen as a rejection of the Muslim world. However, there is relief in Europe that the US has toned down its rhetoric and hope for a more constructive relationship with Turkey for the EU's benefit. The United States believes Turkey can positively impact Europe through its NATO membership, but is disappointed in its inability to influence EU-Turkey relations. The United States is disappointed in its inability to shape a more constructive EU-Turkey relationship to promote closer NATO-EU relations. While some Members of Congress support Turkey's EU accession, attitudes have shifted, with concerns over Turkish foreign policy initiatives towards Israel and Cyprus. However, these concerns are unlikely to change support for Turkey or alter new EU approaches during the 113th Congress."
