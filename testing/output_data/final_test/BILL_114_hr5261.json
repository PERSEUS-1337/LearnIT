    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the U.S. Corporate Tax Base Act of 2016\" includes provisions regarding the inclusion of investments by controlled foreign corporations in subpart F income with respect to members of a foreign group that includes a United States shareholder. The Act \"Protecting the U.S. Corporate Tax Base Act of 2016\" amends Section 956(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code to include a controlled foreign corporation's average holdings of United States and foreign group property in the calculation of a shareholder's pro rata share. The Act \"Protecting the U.S. Corporate Tax Base Act of 2016\" expands the definition of foreign group property under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to include stock or obligations of foreign persons not classified as controlled foreign corporations. The Act expands the definition of foreign group property under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to include stock or obligations of foreign persons not classified as controlled foreign corporations. Voting power of an entity owned by the common parent is considered after acquisition of stock by the controlled foreign corporation. The Act expands the definition of foreign group property under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code to include stock or obligations of foreign persons not classified as controlled foreign corporations. A foreign corporation shall not be treated as a controlled foreign corporation unless more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock and total value is held by such corporation. The term 'foreign person' refers to any person who is not a United States person. An 'expanded affiliated group' is defined as an affiliated group with more than 50 percent ownership, without considering certain sections. \"A partnership or entity (other than a corporation) can be part of an expanded affiliated group if it controls or is controlled by members of the group. For non-corporate entities, references to stock are considered as equity or profits interest, and ownership thresholds are adjusted accordingly.\" Section 956(e) of the Code is amended to address pledges and guarantees by controlled foreign corporations. It states that a controlled foreign corporation will be considered as holding obligations of a United States person or a foreign person if it acts as a pledgor or guarantor of such obligations. Section 958(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a provision regarding the acquisition date of related-party stock. Section 960(c) of the Code will now apply to acquisitions of foreign group property after December 31, 2010. These amendments will apply to taxable years going forward. The amendments in this section apply to taxable years of controlled foreign corporations and United States shareholders after the enactment of the Act. The rule allowing related-party transactions to avoid treatment as a controlled foreign corporation will terminate for taxable years ending on or after May 17, 2016."
