    "content": "The House and Senate Agriculture Committees have significant influence over federal forestry activities, including laws like the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and the National Forest Management Act of 1976. They also oversee forestry research and assistance to states and private landowners. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of 1978 and the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, along with subsequent farm bills, govern federal forestry activities and assistance programs. The 1990 farm bill introduced new forestry assistance programs, revised existing ones, and created special forestry research programs. The 1996, 2002, and 2008 farm bills included various forestry provisions such as special research programs, a tree planting foundation, and an international forestry branch. The 2002 bill had a separate forestry title with differences between House and Senate provisions. Some disputed provisions were later enacted in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. The 2008 farm bill (Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246) included a forestry title with national priorities for private forest management, competitive funding for programs, new conservation and reforestation programs, and amendments to the Lacey Act. It also established a USFS tribal relations program and grants program for Hispanic-serving institutions. The bill modified national forest boundaries and timber contract provisions. The 2008 farm bill revised conservation actions to include forestry activities, required special reporting on softwood lumber imports, altered tax treatments for forests and landowners, and included new woody biomass energy programs. Reauthorization of agriculture programs is a major reason for farm bills, but most forestry programs are permanently authorized. Interest groups have raised various forestry issues for possible discussion within a farm bill, including funding forestry assistance programs, controlling invasive species, increasing wildfire protection, producing energy from woody biomass, and marketing ecosystem services. Federal funding for forestry assistance programs has been increasing, with a focus on cooperative fire programs and Forest Legacy. However, funding for the Economic Action Program has decreased significantly, raising concerns for private landowner assistance programs. The 2002 farm bill replaced the Forestry Incentives Program (FIP) and the Stewardship Incentives Program (SIP) with the Forest Land Enhancement Program (FLEP), which had mandatory funding of $100 million through FY2007. However, some FLEP funds were diverted for firefighting and not repaid, leading to only half of the guaranteed funds being used for landowner assistance. FLEP was not reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill. The 2002 farm bill replaced FIP and SIP with FLEP, which had $100 million in mandatory funding through FY2007. However, some funds were diverted for firefighting, leading to only half being used for landowner assistance. FLEP was not reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill, but Congress may revisit separate funding for forest landowner assistance programs. Some question the need for a forestry-specific assistance program, as existing conservation programs could provide more funding. Most farm bill conservation programs receive mandatory funding, seen as more consistent than discretionary programs. The 2008 farm bill included forestry in almost all agriculture conservation programs. Invasive species are recognized as a significant problem, with the USFS highlighting them in their National Strategy and Implementation Plan for Invasive Species Management. The USFS Forest Health Management Program addresses all forest pests, including invasive species. Congress could address invasive species prevention and control in federal, state, and private forests through future farm bill deliberations. The threat of wildfire damage has increased, with attention on high biomass fuel levels and at-risk forest areas. The 2002 farm bill created a Community and Private Land Fire Assistance Program to help communities and private landowners protect themselves from wildfires. Despite being a state responsibility, the issue of protecting private lands from wildfires continues to be a concern for Congress. Funding for this program has not been explicitly appropriated, but the threat of wildfires persists. Interest in producing energy from woody biomass and other renewable sources is driven by demand for renewable transportation fuels, state and federal requirements for electricity production from renewable sources, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Supply interests stem from concerns over hazardous wildlife fuels and invasive species, which can be converted into renewable energy instead of being disposed of in ways that contribute to carbon emissions. Numerous programs exist to incentivize renewable energy production. Numerous programs exist to incentivize renewable energy production, including those specifically directed at woody biomass. Concerns over duplication, inconsistencies, and potential diversion of wood waste from existing markets to energy production exist. Congress may need to modify existing programs to encourage sustainable and beneficial use of biomass for renewable energy production. Some may seek to limit incentives for renewable energy to prevent biomass from being diverted from current beneficial uses. Private landowners do not receive compensation for providing environmental services like clean air and water. The 2008 farm bill included a provision to develop markets to compensate landowners for ecosystem services. A new farm bill could extend, expand, alter, or terminate this provision, or consider federal \"green payments\" to reward landowners for environmental benefits. Some suggest compensating farmers for environmental benefits through land management practices, while others argue the benefits are too modest for compensation. Congress may discuss green payments or market development for ecosystem services in the future farm bill. Forest landowners selling carbon sequestered by their forests has gained attention, but voluntary markets are small with low carbon prices. Legislation for a domestic cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was debated in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, legislative proposals were made for a domestic cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions, but no action was taken in the 112th Congress. These proposals exclude agriculture and forestry from regulated sectors, allowing them to buy carbon offsets from unregulated sectors. Concerns about carbon offsets include additionality and verification, particularly in forestry projects. Following timber harvests in states requiring reforestation may not qualify as a carbon offset. Verification of carbon sequestration in forestry poses challenges. Concerns exist about the impact of carbon markets on farmers and landowners. Congress may need to address the structure of carbon offsets in future farm bills or other legislative vehicles. Rural economies reliant on natural resources can suffer when a dominant resource is depleted. The National Forest-Dependent Rural Communities Economic Diversification Act of 1990 aimed to assist economically disadvantaged rural communities in diversifying their economies to mitigate the impact of a depressed dominant economic sector. Funding for this assistance has fluctuated over the years and has been proposed for termination in various budget requests. Congress may need to consider the continuation of economic assistance programs in future farm bill deliberations. Congress may need to decide whether to continue economic assistance programs for wood products-dependent communities or terminate forestry-related economic assistance programs."
