    "content": "The Budget Control Act (BCA) was enacted in response to concerns about the federal debt and deficit. The federal budget has been in deficit since FY2002, with large deficits from FY2009 to FY2013 due to increased defense spending, lower tax receipts, and responses to the economic downturn. In FY2010, spending reached its highest level as a share of GDP since FY1946, while revenues reached their lowest level since FY1950. As the effects of the recession lessen, higher tax revenue and lower spending levels have resulted in lower budget deficits. In FY2015, the deficit was 2.4% of GDP, 7.4 percentage points below its peak in 2009. The BCA reduces spending through discretionary spending caps and automatic reductions. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented discretionary spending caps from FY2012 through FY2021, limiting annual appropriations with adjustments allowed for certain purposes such as emergency requirements, Overseas Contingency Operations, disability reviews, health care fraud, and disaster relief. These adjustments effectively exempt certain discretionary spending from the caps. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented discretionary spending caps from FY2012 through FY2021, limiting annual appropriations with adjustments allowed for certain purposes such as emergency requirements, Overseas Contingency Operations, disability reviews, health care fraud, and disaster relief. The BCA limits adjustments for spending on disability reviews and controlling health care fraud abuse to relatively small amounts and limits adjustments for disaster relief by a formula based on historical levels. Cap levels are enforced through a sequestration process. The sequestration process has not been used to date, as Congress has enacted budgets with spending amounts consistent with the cap levels. Adjustable caps are broad limits on total discretionary spending, not placed on specific accounts or appropriations bills. In FY2012 and FY2013, separate caps existed on security and non-security spending. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented discretionary spending caps from FY2012 through FY2021, with separate caps for security and non-security spending in FY2012 and FY2013. For FY2014 to FY2021, the BCA established separate caps for defense and non-defense spending. Congress and the President make decisions on how these caps affect specific agencies or programs through the appropriations process. The BCA also created a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a proposal to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over FY2012 to FY2021. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established discretionary spending caps from FY2012 to FY2021 to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion. When the Joint Committee failed to reach an agreement, a $1.2 trillion automatic spending reduction process was triggered starting in January 2013. 82% of the reduction in budget authority was required, with 18% credited to debt service savings. The reduction was evenly spread over nine years and split between defense and non-defense spending. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established discretionary spending caps from FY2012 to FY2021 to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion. When the Joint Committee failed to reach an agreement, a $1.2 trillion automatic spending reduction process was triggered starting in January 2013. The reduction was evenly spread over nine years, with $54.7 billion applied to defense and $54.7 billion applied to non-defense programs each year. Some programs are exempted from automatic spending reductions, and cuts to others are limited by statute. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established discretionary spending caps from FY2012 to FY2021 to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion. The automatic spending reduction process in subsequent years allows for recalculations based on changes in budget accounts. The reductions are applied through sequesters for mandatory spending and discretionary caps for discretionary spending, with exemptions for certain accounts. The sequester is applied proportionately to all non-exempt accounts, with future Congresses determining how to apply reductions to discretionary accounts within the caps. The FY2013 sequester reduced defense discretionary spending by 7.8%, non-defense discretionary spending by 5.0%, Medicare by 2%, and other mandatory spending by 5.1%. In FY2014, mandatory defense spending was reduced by 9.8% and mandatory non-defense spending by 7.2%. FY2015 saw reductions of 9.5% for mandatory defense spending and 7.3% for mandatory non-defense spending. In FY2015, defense and non-defense spending were reduced by 9.5% and 7.3% respectively. Medicare cuts remained capped at 2% per year. Mandatory programs make up two-thirds of outlays, with non-defense programs accounting for 47% and Medicare for 18%. Discretionary spending makes up 34% of total spending. In FY2015, discretionary spending is projected to account for 34% of budgetary resources but receives 84% of automatic spending reductions, with defense discretionary spending particularly affected. Mandatory programs account for 66% of budgetary resources but bear 16% of the spending reduction. The automatic spending reduction process disproportionately affects mandatory programs, with Medicare limited to a 2% cut under the Budget Control Act (BCA). Future legislative changes or forecasting errors could impact the deficit savings achieved through these reductions. Since the enactment of the BCA, its spending reductions have been modified by three pieces of legislation. The BCA's spending reductions have been modified by three pieces of legislation - ATRA, BBA 2013, and BBA 2015. These laws lowered spending reductions required from FY2013 to FY2017. ATRA postponed FY2013 spending cuts until March 1, 2013, reducing cuts by $24 billion to $85.3 billion. BBA 2013 and BBA 2015 extended the mandatory spending sequester through FY2025. ATRA reduced the BCA's discretionary spending caps by $4 billion in FY2013 and $8 billion in FY2014, offsetting half of the total cost. A provision in ATRA raised revenue by allowing certain retirement accounts to be transferred to Roth accounts. BBA 2013 eased spending restrictions in FY2014 and FY2015 by increasing defense and non-defense discretionary spending caps by roughly $22 billion each. The BCA's discretionary spending caps were increased by $22 billion in FY2014 and $9 billion in FY2015. BBA 2015 further raised the caps by $25 billion each in FY2016 and $15 billion each in FY2017, while extending direct spending reductions through FY2025. The Budget Control Act's discretionary spending caps were increased in FY2014 and FY2015, and further raised in FY2016 and FY2017 by BBA 2015. The BCA as enacted contained over $2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, affecting primarily the discretionary side of the budget. This section evaluates the effect of the Budget Control Act's discretionary caps and automatic spending reduction process on total spending levels. The Budget Control Act's discretionary spending caps were increased in FY2014 and FY2015, and further raised in FY2016 and FY2017 by BBA 2015. Appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2015 have been provided under the BCA framework. Discretionary budget authority exceeded the caps in all years due to discretionary BA provided in categories not subject to the caps. In 2013, a sequester was applied, reducing discretionary BA. Total discretionary budget authority decreased from $1,196 billion in 2012 to $1,101 billion in 2015. The Budget Control Act's caps and automatic spending reduction process reduced discretionary outlays by $95 billion in FY2013 and $1,459 billion over 10 years. Defense discretionary spending saw slightly larger reductions compared to non-defense discretionary spending from 2016 to 2021. The Budget Control Act's caps and automatic spending reduction process led to lower overall discretionary spending from 2016 to 2021. Spending on disaster relief and OCO was below 2011 levels, offsetting cuts to discretionary spending subject to the caps. Emergency spending in 2013 and 2015 allowed for higher overall discretionary spending by $42 billion in 2013 and $5 billion in 2015. In 2013 and 2015, emergency spending allowed for higher discretionary spending by $42 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The enacted emergency spending was netted out of reductions in discretionary spending, resulting in cuts of $137 billion in FY2013 and $147 billion in FY2015. Mandatory spending was also reduced by $11 billion in FY2013 and is projected to be cut by $182 billion over the FY2013-FY2021 period. The Budget Control Act (BCA) has extended mandatory spending reductions until FY2025, with most cuts affecting Medicare. Discretionary spending restrictions are set to end in FY2021. The BCA also cuts mandatory spending on student loan programs by $5 billion over 10 years. Comparisons of spending levels and percentage changes under the BCA to historical data are used to understand its impact on spending over time. Recent policies to reduce the deficit have focused on cutting discretionary spending, leading to a decline in overall discretionary spending from $1.264 trillion in FY2010 to $1.198 trillion in FY2012. The reductions were mainly due to cuts in non-defense discretionary spending in 2011 and spending on overseas contingency operations in 2012. The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets caps on discretionary budget authority, with projected levels subject to automatic spending reductions. The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets caps on discretionary budget authority, with projected levels subject to automatic spending reductions. Exempt categories of spending could lead to higher overall discretionary spending growth than growth in spending subject to the caps. Discretionary budget authority subject to the caps fell in real terms each year from FY2011 to FY2015. In FY2013, there were significant declines in spending due to the BCA, with discretionary budget authority falling by 6.5% in nominal terms and 8.0% as a percentage of GDP compared to FY2012. Spending saw smaller declines in FY2014 and FY2015, with increases in FY2016 and decreases in FY2017. BBA 2015 raised caps on discretionary spending, impacting the trends. The BCA led to declines in discretionary budget authority in FY2013, with smaller declines in FY2014 and FY2015. BBA 2015 raised caps on discretionary spending, impacting future trends. From FY2019 to FY2021, discretionary spending is forecasted to have modest real increases, but inflation rates will heavily influence actual spending levels. In FY2013, discretionary spending subject to caps declined significantly, reaching its lowest value since FY2007. Adjustments were made to compare spending trends before and after the BCA, ATRA, and BBA took effect. From FY2001 through FY2011, discretionary spending subject to caps grew at an average annual rate of 2.9%, with defense spending increasing by 3.5% annually and non-defense spending by 2.3%. However, from FY2012 to FY2015, the combined effect of the BCA, ATRA, and BBA led to a decline in spending by an average of 2.5% annually, with defense and non-defense discretionary reductions fairly evenly split. The difference between the growth rates in the two periods highlights the potential for overall discretionary spending to exceed the desired rate under the caps. Discretionary spending growth exceeded other discretionary spending rates from 2012 to 2015, with total real discretionary spending declining by an annual average of 4.0%. Levels of total discretionary and mandatory spending as a percentage of GDP between FY1962 and FY2025 are shown in Figure 2, with projections assuming current law goes into effect. Adjustments are needed to compare historical data to projections due to categories exempt from BCA caps. Discretionary spending averaged 9.1% of GDP from FY1962 to FY2011, rising from 1999 to 2011 but remaining below levels from FY1962 to FY1987. Discretionary spending is projected to decline to 5.1% of GDP by FY2025, reaching its lowest level since data was first available in 2018. This decline is mainly driven by reductions in defense spending, similar to previous periods of decline in FY1969-FY1974 and FY1987-FY1999. The decline in non-defense discretionary spending in Vietnam and after the Cold War was from a higher starting point than today. Mandatory spending under the BCA is projected to grow in nominal terms and relative to GDP due to elderly entitlement spending increasing faster than GDP over the next 10 years. The BCA has minimal effect on this trend, reducing mandatory spending by one-tenth of 1% of GDP annually. Social Security is exempt from the BCA's automatic process. The BCA's cuts to Medicare are not projected to prevent spending growth in real terms or relative to GDP over the 10-year budget window. Total spending, including discretionary, mandatory, and net interest, is projected to rise as a percentage of GDP, reaching 21.3% in FY2021, well above the historical average of 19.7% from FY1947 to FY2011. The BCA was projected to reduce the deficit by $1.9 trillion between FY2012 and FY2021, but legislative provisions have increased the deficit, offsetting the reduction. ATRA had the most significant impact on increasing the deficit relative to current law. The ATRA legislation, along with other legislative actions, increased the deficit by over $3 trillion between FY2013 and FY2021. Compared to the current law baseline, legislative actions from August 2011 to August 2015 raised the projected deficit by $1.483 trillion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. The legislative actions, including the Budget Control Act (BCA), increased the projected budget deficit by $3.408 trillion. The BCA aimed to match deficit reduction with a multi-step increase in the debt limit, but deficit reductions alone would not eliminate the need for future debt limit increases. Economists emphasize the importance of placing the budget on a sustainable path to prevent debt from outpacing income (GDP) indefinitely. The budget deficit is projected to decrease from 2.8% of GDP in FY2014 to 2.1% of GDP in FY2017 under the most recent CBO baseline. The budget deficit is projected to decrease from 2.8% of GDP in FY2014 to 2.1% of GDP in FY2017. It is expected to rise to 3.7% of GDP by FY2025, with the debt held by the public increasing from 74.0% to 76.9% of GDP in FY2025. Projections assume that health care costs will continue to grow faster than GDP, leading to larger deficits beyond the 10-year budget window. Congressional actions could impact these projections. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the deficit will increase by nearly an additional $1 trillion over the FY2016-FY2025 period if expiring tax provisions are extended. This increase in deficit is expected to continue beyond FY2025."
