    "content": "Indonesia, with a population of 240.3 million, is the world's most populous Muslim nation and the fourth-most populated overall. It has extensive natural resources and is a key player in ASEAN. Indonesia is transitioning from authoritarian rule to democracy, with 86% of its population being Muslim. Indonesia, with a population of 240.3 million, is the world's most populous Muslim nation and the fourth-most populated overall. The majority of Indonesians subscribe to a moderate form of Islam, which can act as a counterbalance to more extreme expressions of the religion. However, radical Islamists and terrorist cells have operated in the country. Internal strife, social dislocation, political machinations, Islamist extremism, government corruption, and economic uncertainty have all undermined stability in Indonesia in the past. Despite setbacks, Indonesia has conducted free and fair elections and built a more robust civil society. The key challenge for the United States and Indonesia is to build on recent progress in their relationship and deliver demonstrable results in developing a comprehensive partnership. The relationship between the United States and Indonesia focuses on democracy promotion, security cooperation, human rights, trade policies, and regional/global issues like climate change. The military-to-military relationship has improved since restrictions were lifted in 2005, with Indonesia playing a key role in counterterrorism efforts in Southeast Asia and becoming a significant player in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite concerns over human rights abuses, Indonesia has made progress in various areas and has engaged in military cooperation with the US, such as the Tri-border initiative in the Makassar Strait. The US has also provided assistance for Indonesia's defense university and procurement of C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. In 2010, the US announced a resumption of security cooperation with Kopassus forces. During the Cold War, the US was concerned about communist influence in Indonesia. Post-Cold War, Congress focused on human rights abuses by the Indonesian National Defense Forces. After 9/11, the war on terror in Southeast Asia became a concern. Some members of Congress are still unsatisfied with progress on holding Indonesian military personnel accountable for past abuses in East Timor and West Papua. The 2006 arrest of Anthonius Wamang, linked to an attack killing two Americans, helped improve relations. Human rights concerns have been balanced with security cooperation as the US shifted from the post-Cold War era to the war on terror. During the shift from the post-Cold War era to the war on terror, human rights concerns have been balanced with security cooperation, particularly in developing counterterror cooperation with Indonesia. The human rights record of the Indonesian military is perceived to have improved, and there is a growing recognition of Indonesia's geopolitical importance in Southeast Asia and East Asia among American decision-makers. Some argue for a working relationship with Indonesia to secure American strategic interests, while others prioritize promoting American values like human rights and religious freedom in U.S. relations with Indonesia. President Obama's visit to Indonesia in November 2010 was highly anticipated. President Obama's successful visit to Indonesia in November 2010 strengthened bilateral relations, building on efforts by his predecessor. The Comprehensive Partnership Agreement signed during the visit aims to broaden the relationship and enhance collaboration in countering Islamist extremists. This strategic move by the U.S. is seen as a way to engage the moderate Muslim world and shape the evolving geostrategic environment in Asia. President Obama's visit to Indonesia in November 2010 strengthened bilateral relations and aimed to engage the moderate Muslim world. He expressed personal interest in the country, with a promise to return in 2011 for the East Asia Summit. Obama's connection to Indonesia, where his mother's second husband was from, drew a rock star-like welcome from the public. President Obama's visit to Indonesia in November 2010 strengthened bilateral relations and aimed to engage the moderate Muslim world. He made a pledge to return in 2011 for the East Asia Summit. The key events of his visit included a bilateral meeting with President Yudhoyono, a state dinner, a visit to the Istiqlal Mosque, and a speech at the University of Indonesia. Discussions between the two presidents covered various topics such as trade, investment, energy, climate change, education, counterterrorism, and global issues. President Obama's visit to Indonesia in November 2010 strengthened bilateral relations and aimed to engage the moderate Muslim world. His speech at the University of Indonesia focused on development, democracy, and religious faith. During a joint press conference with President Yudhoyono, Obama emphasized trade, investment, and deepening political and security cooperation. He highlighted the United States' leadership in Asia and the forging of new partnerships with countries like Indonesia. The visit was seen as a significant broadening of the relationship between the two countries. Obama's visit to Indonesia in 2010 strengthened bilateral relations and aimed to engage the moderate Muslim world. The signing of the Comprehensive Partnership Agreement marked a broadening of the relationship with expectations for future cooperation. Strengthening ties with Indonesia will also likely help Washington strengthen its ties to ASEAN. Despite constraints, Indonesia may seek to hedge its growing relationship with the United States by forming ties with other countries like China or Russia. Indonesians have concerns about U.S. support for Israel. The signing of the Comprehensive Partnership Agreement during Obama's visit to Indonesia in 2010 marked a new level in bilateral relations. Concerns about U.S. support for Israel, human rights issues, and lack of emphasis on past abuses by the Indonesian military may limit the broad appeal of the United States in Indonesia. The agreement, which had been in progress since 2010, includes detailed items under political and security cooperation. The Comprehensive Partnership Agreement signed during Obama's visit to Indonesia in 2010 includes detailed items under political and security cooperation, economic and development cooperation, and socio-cultural, educational, science and technology cooperation. Specific priority areas of the partnership are trade and investment, education, energy, climate change, security, and democracy. Initiatives such as a $165 million U.S. education initiative and collaboration in science and technology have already been launched. The United States is also offering Indonesia 24 F-16 aircraft, highlighting the importance of trade and investment in the relationship. The joint press conference between the two leaders highlighted the importance of Asia as a key source of economic growth for the U.S. President Obama aims to develop economic opportunities for U.S. exports, especially in Indonesia where only 7.3% of imports come from the U.S. compared to 14.5% from China. China is a significant trade partner for Indonesia, with plans to double trade by 2014. Indonesia's economy has shown solid growth, with a projected 5.9% growth rate for 2010. Obama's visit to Indonesia aimed to strengthen strategic ties with the Muslim-majority country. President Obama's objectives for his Indonesia visit included strengthening strategic ties with the world's largest Muslim population and fastest-growing economy in Asia. Analysts believe his focus on Indonesia, along with other key democratic states in the region, may signal America's re-engagement in the Asia-Pacific. Indonesia, known for its Non-Alignment tradition, aims to avoid being caught in Sino-U.S. rivalry. President Obama's visit aimed to address whether U.S. engagement serves as a counterbalance to China's rise. President Obama's visit to Indonesia aimed to strengthen strategic ties with the country, which is seen as a key player in shaping regional security and economic architectures for the Asia-Pacific. Both leaders emphasized the importance of maintaining positive relations between China and the U.S. to avoid severe impacts on the region and the world. Developing ties with Indonesia is a priority for the Obama Administration in facilitating the peaceful rise of China in the Asia-Pacific. President Obama's visit to Indonesia focused on strengthening strategic ties and discussing the U.S. role in the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia, as Chair of ASEAN and host of the EAS, will play a key role in shaping the EAS's role in political security issues. Obama's visit also aimed to reach out to the Muslim world and emphasize the respect for Islam, utilizing Indonesia's moderate Islamic character as a strong setting for this message. Modern Indonesia has been shaped by various influences including Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Dutch colonial rule, and a nationalistic independence movement. Dutch direct colonial rule began in 1799, with independence declared in 1945 by Sukarno. The Republic of Indonesia gained independence from the Dutch in 1949 after a four-year anti-colonial insurrection. The Dutch retained control of West Papua until the transition period 1963-1969. During the transition period 1963-1969, West Papua was known as part of Indonesia. President Sukarno's \"Guided Democracy\" replaced parliamentary democracy in 1959. In 1965, General Suharto marginalized Sukarno, leading to a period of anti-communist riots and purges where over 500,000 Indonesians lost their lives. Suharto ruled Indonesia until 1998. President Suharto ruled Indonesia until 1998, leading an authoritarian regime known as the \"New Order\" that prioritized economic growth and political stability. His death in 2008 sparked reflection on his rule, marked by corruption and repression. A period of reform, called \"reformasi,\" followed his fall, with subsequent leaders implementing key reforms to enhance governance and democracy. President Suharto's authoritarian regime in Indonesia prioritized economic growth and political stability until 1998. After his fall, a period of reform called \"reformasi\" began, with subsequent leaders implementing key reforms to enhance governance and democracy. In 1999, a law transferred authority to provincial and district-level governments, but by 2003, reform momentum was faltering. President Yudhoyono advanced the reform agenda to a limited extent, reflecting changing sources of legitimacy for the Indonesian government over time. The Dutch colonial administration was seen as illegitimate, Sukarno's rule lacked economic development, and Suharto's regime faced challenges after the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Indonesians no longer accepted the corrupt and authoritarian regime, leading to the era of democratic reform before 2004. Indonesia's democratic reform post-Suharto regime has seen progress in building effective government institutions and expanding civil society. The military no longer has parliamentary seats, and the police are separate from the military. The 2004 elections were deemed free and fair, consolidating the legitimacy of democratic government. The 2004 elections in Indonesia were considered free and fair, boosting confidence in the democratic process. The 2009 parliamentary and presidential elections further strengthened democracy. Indonesia's legislative structure includes the House of Representatives (DPR), Regional Representative Council (DPD), and People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Decentralization has increased focus on local government. President Yudhoyono began his second term in 2009 with strong support. Yudhoyono's approval rating dropped from 85% to 66% after his reelection in 2009, attributed to controversies like the Bank Century bailout and the departure of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. Observers believe Aburizal Bakrie benefits politically from Indrawati's departure and may position himself for a presidential run in 2014. Indonesians went to the polls in the 2009 parliamentary elections, the third since the transition from the authoritarian New Order era. The 2009 parliamentary elections in Indonesia saw a strong endorsement of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his Democrat Party, with a preference for secular-nationalist parties over Islamic ones. The Democrat Party emerged as the largest political party, with declining food and fuel prices contributing to their victory. According to Marcus Mietzner of the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, massive cash programs for the poor boosted Yudhoyono's popularity in the 2009 election. The government spent $2 billion on compensation payments. Indonesian perceptions of the economy also shifted during this time, with more people believing the economy was improving. Despite a drop in popularity and reformist credentials, 80% of Indonesians in 2009 believed Yudhoyono was good at fighting corruption. In 2009, Indonesian voters believed that SBY was good at fighting corruption and the Democrat Party was perceived as the least corrupt political party. However, Indonesians viewed the parliament and judiciary as the most corrupt institutions. Islamist messages did not resonate with voters, leading to a decline in vote tallies for Islamic parties from 38.1% in 2004 to 27.8% in 2009. The 2009 parliamentary election in Indonesia saw stable or declining performance of Islamic parties due to internal divisions and political stagnation. The Democrat Party's strong performance allowed them to nominate their own presidential candidate, meeting the required 20% of seats in the House of People's Representatives. The 2009 Indonesian election saw President Yudhoyono's party gaining significant votes, leading to a stronger position for him in selecting coalition partners and a vice presidential running mate. Analysts noted a shift away from the importance of religion and civil-military relations in Indonesian politics. The Democrat Party, lacking strong ideological foundations, is driven by support for Yudhoyono as an individual, raising concerns about the move towards personality politics. The 2009 Indonesian presidential election saw President Yudhoyono winning with 60% of the vote, avoiding a runoff election. Candidates run with their choice of vice presidents, and Yudhoyono is described as moderate, cautious, and intelligent. President Yudhoyono, a moderate and intelligent leader, chose Boediono as his vice presidential running mate based on his abilities rather than political standing. Boediono, a former Governor of Bank Indonesia with a doctorate from the Wharton School, played a key role in implementing government initiatives for economic policies. In the 2009 election, Yudhoyono's former vice president, Jusuf Kalla, ran against him with former General Wiranto, who was accused of human rights abuses in East Timor. Former President Megawati Sukarnoputri of PDI-P ran for president in 2009 with vice presidential candidate Probowo Subianto, leader of Gerindra party and former son-in-law of President Suharto. Probowo faced criticism for alleged violence during Indonesia's transition to democracy in 1998. The 2009 election marked Indonesia's progress towards democracy and away from authoritarian rule. The Indonesian election in 2009 marked a shift towards democracy and away from authoritarian rule. Indonesian voters preferred national, secular, and democratic leaders, endorsing SBY's economic policies. The Indonesian National Defense Force (TNI) is a strong institution focused on internal threats and preserving the nation's territorial integrity. The Indonesian military, including the Army Strategic Reserve Command and Special Forces Command, has a less formal role in politics but remains influential. Past human rights abuses in regions like East Timor have raised concerns, though current issues are mainly in Papua. The TNI has moved away from its dual function doctrine and efforts have been made to establish civilian control over the armed forces. Efforts are underway to establish civilian control of the Indonesian military (TNI) and reform its territorial structure, business activities, and human rights sensitivity. The TNI budget is largely self-generated, outside governmental control, and will continue to play a key role in Indonesian politics. Reform process in Indonesia continues, with a shift in TNI's mission towards traditional and professional roles. There is a shift towards traditional military roles in Indonesia, with a focus on sovereignty and external security. Admiral Agus Suhartono leads the TNI and is tasked with completing internal reforms, maintaining neutrality in politics, and enhancing border security. Efforts are being made to end the TNI's involvement in business, with proposals to address budget shortfalls through continued reform. Some suggest dismantling the territorial command structure to move away from the military's former political role. Indonesia is shifting towards traditional military roles, focusing on sovereignty and external security. Efforts are being made to end the military's involvement in business and address budget shortfalls through continued reform. There are center-periphery tensions between the dominant Javanese culture and minority groups in outlying regions, leading to political instability. The primary security threats are thought to come from within the country. The Indonesian archipelago, centered in Jakarta on Java, has a history of power extending from Java to outlying areas. Resistance to centralized control is seen in regions like East Timor, Aceh, Papua, and West Papua due to strong ethnic, cultural, and religious identities different from Java. Debate exists on whether Indonesia is an organic state or a creation of Dutch colonial rule. The Dutch colonial rule played a significant role in unifying Indonesia through wars to subdue outlying islands. Economic integration and the nationalist movement also contributed to creating a national identity. In Timor-Leste, Portuguese influence lasted until 1975, leading to the emergence of different political parties. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor with tacit compliance from the US and Australia, fearing it would become a Soviet satellite state. A third of the population died during the guerilla war against Indonesia. In 1999, East Timorese voted for independence, leading to attacks by pro-integrationist militias and the death of over 7,000 people. In 1999, more than 7,000 East Timorese were killed and 300,000 displaced after pro-integrationist militias formed by hard-line elements of TNI sought to intimidate them into voting to remain integrated with Indonesia. TNI had reasons to prevent East Timor's independence, fearing it would encourage secession in other regions like Aceh and Papua. The devastation in East Timor was seen as a warning to potential secessionist movements. The violence in East Timor in 1999, involving TNI, was either carried out by local \"rogue\" elements or orchestrated higher up in the military command. East Timor gained independence in 2002, leading to efforts by Indonesia and East Timor to improve relations. A report by the East Timorese Commission found Indonesia responsible for abuses during its rule, with up to 180,000 East Timorese dying as a result. This strained the relationship between Indonesia and East Timor, but both countries committed to resolving issues. President Yudhoyono and Xanana Gusmao reaffirmed their commitment to resolving differences between Indonesia and East Timor. President Ramos-Horta urged acceptance that Indonesian perpetrators of human rights abuses in East Timor would not face justice. The United Nations tribunal convicted some East Timorese militia members but failed to extradite any Indonesian indictees. Aceh, located on Sumatra, has a population of 4.4 million. Aceh, located on the tip of the Indonesian archipelago on the island of Sumatra, has a population of 4.4 million Acehenese with strong Muslim beliefs and an independent ethnic identity. The Acehenese have a history of resistance against colonial powers, including the Dutch Aceh War lasting from 1873 to 1913. The group Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) fought for independence until a peace agreement was reached after the 2004 tsunami. The peace agreement signed in Helsinki in August 2005 ended a conflict in Aceh that had claimed an estimated 15,000 lives. GAM fighters received training in Libya in the late 1980s, leading to suppression by the TNI. Former President Megawati called for military action against the Free Aceh Movement, which was popular among Indonesian voters. President Yudhoyono's leadership leveraged the opportunity presented by the conflict. Under President Yudhoyono's leadership, Indonesia achieved a peace settlement in Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. The Free Aceh Movement disarmed in 2005, and the Indonesian Military reduced its presence. However, the conflict in West Papua continues, with indigenous Melanesian people facing injustices at the hands of the Indonesian government. This presents a challenge for Congressional decision-makers as human rights and geopolitical interests clash. West Papua's separatist sentiment and human rights concerns could hinder the growing partnership between the U.S. and Indonesia. Papuan groups are turning to internationalizing the conflict as they believe peaceful means won't lead to a referendum on Indonesian rule. The conflict in Papua is driven by the desire for change, with some advocating for violence to gain international attention. The region's natural wealth, including mining and logging, plays a central role. Despite this wealth, Papua remains one of Indonesia's poorest provinces. The Special Autonomy Law allocates royalties to the province, but economic activity is dominated by migrants. The Grasberg Mine, operated by Freeport Indonesia, is a key player in the region's resource extraction industry. The Freeport mine in Papua, operated by Freeport Indonesia, is the world's largest gold and one of the largest copper mines. It accounts for a significant portion of the province's exports and GDP. The mine has faced controversy over its impact on indigenous people. West Papua has poor social indicators, with high rates of HIV/AIDS and infant mortality. Poverty in the region is twice the national average. The International Crisis Group (ICG) report highlights key issues in Papua and West Papua, including political autonomy, affirmative action for Papuans, and addressing fears of in-migration. Failure to address these issues may lead to increased radicalization. Non-Melanesian migration is a significant factor in tensions, with predictions that Melanesian Papuans may soon be a minority in their homeland. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows a significant population increase in Papua and West Papua due to migration, leading to displacement and marginalization of local Papuans. This has fueled resentment and demands for autonomy or independence, with Papuans feeling a threat to their cultural survival. Papuans reject Special Autonomy status introduced in 2001, citing failure to benefit indigenous people. Protestors in Jayapura call for referendum, independence, and criticize funds going to non-Melanesians. Calls for international mediation and dialogue with Jakarta. Autonomy funds mostly spent outside the provinces, leading to demands for community-focused use. The OPM is open to dialogue with Jakarta with UN mediation. Vanuatu will raise West Papua issue at the UN. Papuans, like PNG people, have a long-standing Melanesian culture. Dutch claimed Papua in 1828, different from the Malay character of Indonesia. Spanish discovered Indonesian islands in 1546. The Dutch controlled West Papua, separate from Indonesia, due to ethnic and cultural differences. In 1962, the US pressured the Dutch to hand over control to the UN, leading to Indonesia assuming control in 1963. The \"Act of Free Choice\" allowed Papuans to decide on joining Indonesia. In 1963, Indonesia took control of Papua from the Dutch. The \"Act of Free Choice\" in 1969 saw selected delegates vote to join Indonesia, but it was not representative of most Papuans. The UN failed to provide a broad-based referendum, with only 1,025 officials voting in favor of merging with Indonesia. The Free Papua Movement emerged in response, with estimates of 100,000 Papuans dying due to Indonesian control. The United States supported Indonesia's takeover of Papua in 1969 despite knowing that most Papuans opposed Indonesian rule. This support was to maintain Suharto's Indonesia's backing during the Cold War. President Yudhoyono has rejected independence for Papua but has considered some autonomy. In 2010, he called for an audit of Special Autonomy programs for Papua and West. In 2010, President Yudhoyono called for an audit of Special Autonomy programs for Papua and West Papua, opposing international involvement in the conflict and emphasizing a peaceful resolution through dialogue and without foreign interference. In 1999, President B.J. Habibie enacted laws granting Special Autonomy for Papua, allowing the province to keep more locally generated wealth. However, this period of openness to autonomy lost momentum and was never fully implemented. In 2003, President Megawati Sukarnoputri moved to divide Papua into three provinces, which was seen as undermining the Papuan cause. In 2010, there were reports of the military considering basing a new infantry division in Papua. In April 2010, Major General Hotma Marbun stated that a 10,000 strong infantry brigade unit in Papua, including naval and air forces, was sufficient for duties in Papua and West Papua. A small radical minority in Indonesia seeks to establish an Islamic state, with some extremists hostile to the Christian minority. These groups, though small in number, have caused internal turmoil in Indonesia. The disbanded Lashkar Jihad and factions of Jemaah Islamiya in Indonesia have used terrorist methods to promote an extreme Islamist agenda. Inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Christians have been observed in Maluku, Sulawesi, and the Maluku, as well as between local Dayaks and Madurese migrants in Kalimantan. There are concerns about the rise of Islamic sentiment in Indonesia, exemplified by the rise of the Islamist PKS Justice Party in the 2004 election. The rise of the Islamist PKS Justice Party in the 2004 election was attributed to its campaign platform of good governance and party organization rather than its Islamist character. Despite concerns about political Islam radicalizing Indonesia, Islamic political parties did not see further success in the 2009 election. Indonesians overwhelmingly support the state ideology of Pancasila, which includes key guiding principles for the state and the constitution. Islam's influence in Indonesia has led to challenges to the secular nature of the state, with radical Muslim groups like the Islamic Defenders Front targeting businesses and institutions representing Western values. They have forcibly shut down gambling dens, nightclubs, bars, and Christian churches, leading to the closure of over 100 churches since September 2004. Muslim groups, including the FPI, have closed over 100 Christian churches since September 2004, with support from Saudi Arabia. Despite government efforts, arrests of FPI members are rare. Pressure for Sharia law is mainly at the local level, with over 56 Sharia-based laws in Indonesia. More than 56 Sharia-based local laws have been issued in Indonesia, requiring women to wear headscarves, officials to read the Koran in Arabic, segregating men and women in public places, and prohibiting alcohol and gambling. The central government has not challenged the constitutionality of these laws. Judicial action has been taken against non-Muslims accused of insulting Muslim beliefs, such as the prosecution of the editor of Playboy Indonesia. Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia are increasingly teaching a fundamentalist ideology that promotes intolerance towards other religions and secular beliefs. Former Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid warned in April 2007 about the spread of fundamentalist Islam in pesantren schools and Indonesian universities. Inter-communal strife in Indonesia includes clashes between ethnic groups like the Bugis and Tidung in East Kalimantan. The Sampit incident in central Kalimantan in 2000 resulted in over 500 deaths and 100,000 displacements. The United States and Indonesia share a common interest in addressing these issues. The United States and Indonesia have a common interest in addressing the threat of militant Islamists in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. The syncretic nature of Islam in Indonesia is more moderate than in the Middle East or Pakistan. Radical Islamists pose a threat to Indonesia's secular state and moderate Muslim society. Views on the threat have evolved over time, with suppression of Islamists under former President Suharto. Islamists were suppressed under the New Order regime of former President Suharto in Indonesia. The reformasi period that followed allowed for the emergence of militant Islamist groups like Jemaah Islamiya (JI). Key terrorist attacks in Indonesia include the Bali bombing of 2002, the Marriott Hotel bombing in 2003, the Australian Embassy bombing in 2004, and attacks on Western hotels in Jakarta in 2009. JI was the main terrorist organization in the 2000s. In 2009, JI was the main terrorist organization in Indonesia. Now, militant Islamists are associated with JI, Noordin Top's network, and a new jihadist alliance in Aceh. JI is rebuilding and aims to establish an Islamist state, while Noordin Top's network focuses on attacking Western targets. The raid on the jihadist alliance in Aceh in 2010 revealed a group composed of members from various militant groups. The militant group in Aceh, led by Sydney Jones, consists of members from various militant groups frustrated with the lack of action. The raid in February led to the killing of Dulmatin, a planner of the 2002 Bali bombing. Saptono took over the Aceh cell but was killed in May 2010. Experts suggest capturing leaders for valuable intelligence. A plot to assassinate President Yudhoyono was disrupted in May 2010. The government's response to militant Islamists in Indonesia has been effective, but there are some challenges. Rivalry between the military, police, and intelligence agency hinders effectiveness. Prisons have lax standards allowing militants to communicate. Deradicalization programs have allowed some militants to rejoin their organizations. In September 2010, General Ansyaad Mbai was appointed head of Indonesia's new National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) formed by presidential decree. The BNPT will coordinate counterterrorism efforts of the police, TNI, and BIN, with concerns about potential similarities to Suharto's regime. Security Affairs Minister Djoko Suyanto emphasized the need for continued vigilance during a BNPT-organized conference on counterterrorism in October 2010. In October 2010, there was an increase in low-level terrorism activity in Indonesia aimed at funding terrorist groups. Robberies were linked to radical organizations, with three policemen killed in Hamparan Perak and robbers killed in Padang. Abu Bakar Ba'asyir's sermons in Medan were believed to have motivated these attacks. Indonesia also faced economic challenges during the global downturn. Indonesia's economy weathered the global economic downturn well, with GNP growth expected to increase in 2010 and 2011. The growth is driven by private consumption, investment, and capital inflows. The country benefited from significant foreign direct investment, infrastructure, and real estate investments in 2010. Listed companies saw strong earnings growth, and the Jakarta composite index rose significantly. The Indonesian economy showed strong growth in 2010, with GNP expected to increase further in the following years. The Jakarta composite index rose significantly, reflecting the country's positive economic performance. Despite this growth, poverty alleviation, social welfare, and job creation remain key issues for the government, as a large portion of the population still lives below the poverty line. The World Bank highlighted the need for investment in Indonesia's institutions to address these challenges. Indonesia's economy has shown strong growth, but poverty alleviation and job creation are still key issues. The country has transitioned from being a key oil exporter to a net oil importer, with plans to boost production through foreign investment. Indonesia is the world's second largest producer of LNG and has significant reserves of oil and natural gas. The country is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to deforestation, but President Yudhoyono has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 26% by 2020. President Yudhoyono aims to reduce Indonesia's carbon emissions by 26% by 2020. A $1 billion deal with Norway will help preserve Indonesian forests and peatlands, with a two-year moratorium on forest clearing. Indonesian efforts to protect the maritime environment can benefit Pacific tuna stocks. Yudhoyono has raised Indonesia's environmental profile, leading to cooperation with the U.S. on climate change. In 2009, he pledged a 41% reduction in carbon emissions below business-as-usual levels. Indonesia pledged to reduce carbon emissions by up to 41% below business-as-usual levels by 2020. Deforestation is the main contributor to Indonesia's high carbon emissions, threatening its diverse tropical rainforests and marine environment. Logging, climate change, and pollution are putting pressure on Indonesia's ecosystems. The country has the world's third-largest tropical forests and largest timber trade, making rainforests crucial in absorbing atmospheric carbon and regulating climate. Rain forests are crucial for absorbing atmospheric carbon and regulating climate, containing two-thirds of the planet's plant and animal species. Logging and clearing have reduced rain forests from 14% to 6% of the earth's surface. Indonesia has lost a quarter of its forests in 15 years, with projections that they could be logged out in 10 years. Illegal logging costs Indonesia $3 billion annually, leading to widespread species extinction and haze from burning for palm plantations. In Southeast Asia, widespread haze in 1997 accounted for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesian fires have contributed to haze in the region, with significant forest loss in West Papua from 1998 to 2010. The US and Indonesia signed a bilateral agreement in 2006 to combat illegal logging, with the US committing $1 million for remote sensing and partnerships. Indonesia has partnered with Norway for a national REDD program, with Norway pledging $1 billion. Concerns about corruption in the forestry sector may hinder efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The country faces threats to endangered species like orangutans, Sumatran Tigers, and Javan Rhinos due to poaching, deforestation, and illegal logging. The orangutan's habitat has been destroyed by illegal logging, plantation companies, and farmers, leading to a threat of extinction. The Javanese Tiger and Balinese Tiger are already extinct, with only about 400 Sumatran Tigers remaining. The Javanese Rhino is similarly threatened with only 60 left in the wild. Effective control of illegal trade in wild animal parts is crucial for species survival. The Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security was adopted by Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Philippines to address threats to the maritime environment. The agreement covers 6 million square kilometers of ocean and focuses on coral reefs, fish, and mangroves. Indonesia faces threats from climate change, particularly sea level rise affecting coastal areas. The US State Department's human rights report on Indonesia noted improvements in respecting human rights but highlighted ongoing issues like killings by security forces and corruption in the judicial system. The US State Department's human rights report on Indonesia highlighted concerns such as corruption in the judicial system, limitations on free speech, and societal abuse against religious groups. The report also mentioned weakened civilian control of the military and Indonesia's lack of progress in addressing human rights violations, including police torture going unpunished. The US State Department's human rights report on Indonesia criticized the government for human rights violations, including endemic police torture and pressure from Islamic hard-line groups. Concerns were raised about the lack of progress in addressing abuses, with some pointing to the candidacy of former generals suspected of human rights abuses. There are also concerns about genocide against the Papuans and a deep-rooted distrust in Jakarta. Recent reports suggest ongoing political repression and genocide in West Papua, with concerns raised about the survival of the indigenous Melanesian people and their culture. Indonesian security forces and the government have been accused of committing abuses, including the torture and killing of Papuan journalists and separatists. The Webster's dictionary defines genocide as the deliberate destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group. Recent reports indicate ongoing political repression and genocide in West Papua, with concerns about the survival of the indigenous Melanesian people and their culture. Indonesian security forces and the government have been accused of widespread human rights abuses, leading to a significant death toll among the Papuan population. The United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices of 2009 highlighted killings by security forces and violence in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. The Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney published a report on genocide in West Papua, assessing the treatment of Papuans. The report \"Genocide in West Papua\" assesses the treatment of Papuans by the Indonesian military, highlighting threats to the survival of indigenous people. It mentions military campaigns decimating tribal communities, HIV/AIDS issues, underdevelopment, and a culture of impunity leading to thousands of deaths in Papua. Eyewitness accounts point to military involvement in crimes like arson, theft, and rape. The report highlights Indonesian military involvement in acts of arson, theft, rape, and torture in Papua. Human Rights Watch describes the military's actions as using disproportionate force against civilians, leading to arbitrary detention, torture, disappearances, and arson in the region. The influx of non-Melanesian Indonesians has also been noted, contributing to tensions in the area. The 2004 report by the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale University Law School suggests that the Indonesian government may have committed genocide against the West Papuans. An international dimension to the conflict emerged in 2006 when a group of 43 Papuans sought political asylum in Australia. In 2006, a group of 43 Papuans fled to Australia in an outrigger canoe and requested political asylum. Indonesia's constitution protects religious minority groups, but there have been instances of inter-communal violence. In 2008, the Ahmadiyya group, a Muslim sect, was recommended to be banned by a government panel following a fatwa by Indonesia's highest religious authority. The Ahmadiyya believe their founder was a prophet and the belief was brought to Indonesia from India. The Ahmadiyya belief, brought to Indonesia from India in 1925, differs from mainstream Muslims as they accept Prophet Mohammad but are not considered true Muslims by many in Indonesian society. With an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 followers in Indonesia, Ahmadiyya face growing attacks and calls for banning them from the country. The Alliance for Freedom of Religion and Faith demonstrated peacefully in support of religious freedom at the Indonesian National Monument Square in Jakarta. The government of Indonesia banned the group due to their views on the Ahmadiyya sect, causing unrest in the Muslim community. Despite the ban, the Vice President stated there would be no detention of Ahmadis. Muslim hard-liners protested for the disbanding of the Ahmadiyya, with concerns about potential extremist actions. The government of Indonesia faced pressure from Muslim extremists to disband the Ahmadiyya sect, leading to a crackdown in 2008. The government issued a decree banning the sect from spreading its message but also pledged not to persecute Ahmadiyya members. This decision was seen as a balancing act to avoid alienating both religious extremists and moderates before the 2009 elections. The Indonesian government's crackdown on the Ahmadiyya sect in 2008, in response to pressure from Muslim extremists, included restrictions on their religious practices. The State Department's International Religious Freedom Report 2008 highlighted government limitations on the Ahmadiyya community's freedom to practice, with instances of violence and intimidation leading to the closure of churches and mosques. Indonesia's foreign policy, influenced by past leaders like Sukarno and Suharto, has aimed at maintaining independence and increasing global presence, with recent presidents like Yudhoyono seeking to enhance the nation's international standing. Indonesia has traditionally aimed to remain independent from great power conflicts and alliances. Sukarno's focus was on fighting neo-colonialism, colonialism, and imperialism, aligning the government with China in 1964-65. Suharto's New Order shifted towards better relations with Southeast Asian nations, leading Indonesia to become a founding member of ASEAN in 1967. Since 1998, internal issues have kept Indonesia internally focused, reducing its active role in international organizations like ASEAN. Indonesia maintains a moderate voice in the OIC and is a member of APEC. Indonesia has positioned itself as a moderating force in the Muslim world and a potential bridge between Islam and the West. Democracy is increasingly important in Indonesia's external engagement, demonstrated by initiatives like the Bali Democracy Forum launched in 2008. The forum aims to promote regional and international cooperation in democracy, bringing together democracies and those aspiring to be more democratic. Indonesia also supports the new ASEAN Charter, which advocates for democratic development and human rights. Indonesia, with its large population and strategic location in Southeast Asia, plays a central role in the region. Under President Yudhoyono's leadership, Indonesia has been increasingly active in shaping the strategic and economic architectures of Asia through ASEAN and the East Asian Summit. Speculation suggests Indonesia may expand its foreign policy beyond ASEAN, as it engages in multilateral fora like the OIC and the G-20. Its proximity to Australia also influences its bilateral relationships. Indonesia's bilateral relationship with Australia is key due to their geographic proximity. They signed the Timor Gap Treaty in 1991 for resource sharing, but it lapsed with East Timor's independence. Ties have been strained over human rights issues, but they have cooperated in counterterrorism. A security agreement was signed in 1995 and a new pact, the Lombok Treaty, in 2006. In 2006, Indonesia and China normalized ties strained since the alleged coup in 1965. China claims the South China Sea near Indonesia's Natuna Islands. President Yudhoyono signed a strategic agreement with Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2005. Chinese investments in Indonesia have grown, especially in energy and minerals. In 2008, China expressed interest in strengthening bilateral relations with Indonesia. In recent years, Indonesia's ties with China have developed in terms of security and economic relations. Indonesia has sought to diversify its defense relationships, including with China, amidst improving relations with the United States. Trade and investment between Indonesia and China have also increased. China has pledged to increase direct foreign investment and trade with Indonesia to $50 billion by 2014. Bilateral trade between the two states was $25.5 billion in 2009, with China's direct investment totaling $265.5 million over the past four years. Indonesia and Malaysia have had maritime border disputes, including over the Sipadan and Ligitan Islands in the Celebes Sea. Tensions flared in May 2009 over conflicting claims to oil-rich waters near their border, leading to naval confrontations. Indonesia and Malaysia have maritime border disputes over oil-rich waters near their border. Indonesia deployed troops and announced plans to deploy a tank battalion to the Malaysian border in response to tensions in 2010. The United States has economic and military interest in keeping the strategic sea lanes around Indonesia open. China's relations with Indonesia and Southeast Asia have evolved over the years, with a shift from assertiveness in the 1990s to a more accommodating approach. China signed agreements with ASEAN countries and initiated a Free Trade Agreement. However, recent developments suggest that relations may have reached a limit as regional states show signs of pushback. The bilateral comprehensive partnership between the United States and Indonesia focuses on key areas such as education, forestry, marine management, clean energy, regional security, government services, health, and employment. U.S. assistance also supports democracy, rule of law, human rights, maternal and child health, and economic growth in Indonesia. China's expanding naval capability is a concern for some regional states. The State Department FY2011 Budget Justification for Foreign Operations highlights continued U.S. support to Indonesia in areas such as counterterrorism, regional peace and security. Indonesia has engaged in various programs with the U.S., including intelligence cooperation, civil-military cooperation, and maritime security. Military-to-military ties between the two countries have fluctuated over time. Military ties between the United States and Indonesia have varied since the 1950s, influenced by Jakarta's stance towards the U.S. and U.S. views on Indonesia's human rights record. A strong relationship was established in the 1960s and expanded after Sukarno's downfall. U.S. assistance to Indonesia is guided by its role in combating terrorism in Southeast Asia, including funding for counterterrorism units, training for security officials, and support for anti-money laundering efforts. The United States has been providing assistance to Indonesia in combating terrorism through various programs, including training for security officials and support for counterterrorism units like Detachment 88. The U.S. aims to build the capacity and will of regional states to fight terror through diplomatic, financial, law enforcement, intelligence, and military tools. This approach complements bilateral assistance and focuses on promoting counterterrorism in Southeast Asia on a regional and multilateral basis. The United States supports Indonesia in combating terrorism through various programs, including training for security officials and assistance to counterterrorism units like Detachment 88. Regional anti-terrorism cooperation goals include information sharing, capacity building, maritime security, border controls, and compliance with international conventions. Assistance programs like the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program, Financial Systems Assessment Teams, and the Terrorist Interdiction Program have aided Indonesia. The U.S. also supports the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Counter-terrorism in Kuala Lumpur. Observers believe there is an opportunity to deepen bilateral relations with Indonesia, which has made progress in democracy and civil society since 2004. However, concerns remain about human rights abuses by the Indonesian military, particularly in West Papua. Decision makers will need to consider a mix of U.S. foreign and strategic policy interests when approaching Indonesia. The consideration of U.S. foreign policy interests regarding Indonesia may involve tradeoffs between promoting human rights and strengthening bilateral ties to combat violent extremists and advance U.S. geopolitical interests."
