    "content": "The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) prohibits theft of trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign entity or for pecuniary gain, including theft from electronic storage. Individual offenders can face up to 15 years in prison for economic espionage and up to 10 years for trade secret theft, with fines of up to $250,000 or twice the loss/gain for trade secret theft. Organizations can be fined up to $5 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret for trade secret theft, and up to $10 million for economic espionage. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes severe penalties for theft of trade secrets, including fines of up to $5 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret for organizations. Courts can also order restitution to victims and confiscate property derived from the offense. Victims may seek double damages and other relief under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016. Other federal laws, like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, may also apply and allow victims to sue for damages. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes severe penalties for theft of trade secrets, including fines of up to $5 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret for organizations. The trade secrets prohibition under the EAA criminalizes stealing, copying, or possessing trade secrets related to a product or service used in interstate or foreign commerce for the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner, with the intent to injure the owner. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) imposes severe penalties for theft of trade secrets, including fines of up to $5 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret for organizations. The EEA criminalizes stealing, copying, or possessing trade secrets related to a product or service used in interstate or foreign commerce for the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner, with the intent to injure the owner. The term \"whoever\" encompasses both individuals and organizations, with special fines for organizations committing the offense. The Dictionary Act includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies as examples of entities that may qualify as \"persons.\" Conversion is a common law concept defined as the wrongful possession or disposition of another's property without lawful justification. The intent to steal, knowledge, and intent to injure elements ensure that theft of a trade secret requires deliberate actions. An EEA trade secret is information that the owner has taken reasonable measures to keep secret and derives economic value from not being generally known. The definition of a trade secret includes information that the owner has taken reasonable measures to keep secret and derives economic value from not being generally known. An owner must take steps to ensure the secrecy of the trade information, such as limiting access and notifying employees of its confidential nature. The requirement for the owner to take \"reasonable measures\" does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague. The element of secrecy being \"known or readily ascertainable\" is more complex to interpret under the Economic Espionage Act. The Economic Espionage Act's definition of secrecy for trade secrets is ambiguous, suggesting information is secret if unknown to the general public or industry. However, a narrower interpretation may require the information to be unknown or not readily ascertainable by the public or industry. The Act's definition is based on the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which focuses on information known or readily ascertainable by those who can gain economic value from it. The Defend Trade Secrets Act replaced the previous terminology. The Defend Trade Secrets Act replaced the original definition with the UTSA language, requiring a trade secret to have an interstate or foreign commerce nexus. The theft must benefit someone other than the owner, with economic benefit only needing to be intended, not necessarily realized. The government must prove that the defendant intended to injure the trade secret's owner or knew the owner would be injured, without requiring actual injury. The defendant must be aware that he is stealing, downloading, or receiving a stolen trade secret. The government must prove that the defendant intended to injure the trade secret's owner or knew the owner would be injured, without requiring actual injury. The defendant must be aware that he is stealing, downloading, or receiving a stolen trade secret, as outlined in the legislative history of the EEA case. The government is not required to prove that the defendant knew and understood the statutory definition of a trade secret. The EEA case requires the government to prove that the defendant intended to injure the trade secret's owner or knew the owner would be injured, without requiring actual injury. It is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew and understood the statutory definition of a trade secret. Congress intended to extend the reach of federal offenses involving trade secret misappropriation. The legislative history supports a \"knew or should have known\" mens rea requirement for trade secret misappropriation cases. The government must prove that the defendant's actions were not authorized by their relationship to the owner of the property and that the defendant knew or should have known this fact. Congress did not require the government to show that the defendant specifically was aware of each element of the offense. The defendant in a trade secret misappropriation case does not need to be aware of specific security measures taken by the trade secret owner. The Sixth Circuit has ruled that the defendant only needs to know that the information is proprietary and intends to use it to harm the owner. In trade secret misappropriation cases, the defendant must know the information is proprietary and intend to harm the owner. Some courts require the defendant to know the information has the general attributes of a trade secret. The second subsection of trade secret misappropriation covers situations where the owner is denied control over access to the information, prohibiting unauthorized copying, downloading, uploading, or conveying the information. It also outlaws alteration or destruction of a trade secret, including instances where a faithless employee or cyber intruder commits the trade secret to memory. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) does not apply to individuals who use their lawfully developed knowledge, skills, or abilities. Companies should pursue civil remedies if evidence of theft by a former employee is unclear, and consider making a criminal referral if more evidence is found. Tangible evidence of theft is crucial to overcome the defense of \"mental recollections\" or \"great minds think alike.\" The third subsection prohibits the knowing receipt of stolen trade secrets, requiring proof of theft or conversion. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) prohibits the theft or conversion of trade secret information. Conviction requires proof of theft and knowledge of the trade secret. Attempting to steal a trade secret carries the same penalties as succeeding. Conspiracy to steal a trade secret also results in penalties, requiring proof of intent and an overt act towards the conspiracy's purpose. Individuals and organizations involved in conspiracy to steal trade secrets face imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines of up to $250,000. The court may fine an organization up to $5 million upon conviction. Restitution to victims is mandatory, and property used in the offense may be confiscated. The Attorney General can seek injunctive relief, and owners can sue for damages. The offense of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets have similarities but also key differences. Theft of a trade secret requires intent to benefit someone else, intent to injure the owner, and must be related to interstate or foreign commerce. Economic espionage involves intent to benefit a foreign entity, does not require intent to injure the owner, and applies to any trade secret regardless of commerce connection. Economic espionage is punished more severely than theft of trade secrets, with a maximum imprisonment term of 15 years and a maximum fine of $5 million for individuals. For organizations, the maximum fine is the greater of $10 million or three times the value of the trade secret. The crime is also considered a RICO and money laundering predicate offense. Section 1831 condemns stealing, appropriating, or concealing trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. Section 1831 of the law prohibits unauthorized actions related to trade secrets, including stealing, copying, or possessing them for the benefit of a foreign entity. The definition of foreign beneficiary is clarified in Section 1839, requiring a substantial connection to a foreign agent or instrumentality. The law prohibits unauthorized actions related to trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign entity. A substantial connection to a foreign government is required for an entity to qualify. Economic espionage includes conferring economic, reputational, strategic, or tactical benefit. Intent to confer benefit is necessary, even if not realized. The EEA authorizes prosecution without disclosing trade secrets. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) allows the trial court to issue orders to protect trade secrets during prosecution. The government can appeal failure to protect trade secrets but not orders to reveal already disclosed information. Appellate review of disclosure orders may be possible through a writ of mandamus. Congress specified when the EEA provisions apply overseas, allowing prosecution as long as the offender is a U.S. citizen. The Economic Espionage Act allows prosecution of offenses overseas if the offender is a U.S. national or if an act in furtherance of the offense occurs within the United States. Foreign conspirators may not be charged unless an overt act in furtherance of the scheme happens in the U.S. Prosecution of overseas offenses of foreign nationals impacting the U.S. may be precluded without an express provision. Prosecution of economic espionage and trade secret violations under the EEA required approval from senior Justice Department officials for five years after its passage. Prosecutors no longer need approval for theft of trade secret charges under the Economic Espionage Act. Violations of the Act may also breach other federal criminal laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, National Stolen Property Act, and federal wire fraud statute. These laws prohibit unauthorized computer access, interstate transportation of stolen property, and wire communications for fraud schemes. The Economic Espionage Act outlaws wire communications for fraud schemes and computer intrusions for espionage purposes. Violations may also lead to prosecution under general espionage statutes or failure to register as a foreign agent. The Act now allows for a private cause of action under the Defend Trade Secrets Act. The Economic Espionage Act (EEA) allows for a private cause of action under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, enabling owners of misappropriated trade secrets to sue, including licensees. The EEA defines \"misappropriation\" as acquiring, disclosing, or using a trade secret through improper means. One notable feature of the EEA is its pre-trial seizure procedure for alleged trade secret appropriation. The EEA allows for a private cause of action under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, defining \"misappropriation\" as acquiring, disclosing, or using a trade secret through improper means. The pre-trial seizure procedure for alleged trade secret appropriation involves obtaining an ex parte order seizing the purported trade secret, with restrictions similar to a temporary restraining order in federal civil actions. This provision is used when a TRO is insufficient, typically in cases where immediate harm is threatened or the defendant is uncooperative. The party from whom the trade secret is seized is entitled to a hearing within seven days to justify the seizure order. The EEA empowers district courts to award relief for trade secret misappropriation, including damages, double damages for willful misconduct, attorneys' fees, and equitable relief. An action for misappropriation must be brought within three years of discovery. Section 1836 of chapter 90 applies to conduct outside the US if the offender is a US national or if an act in furtherance of the offense occurs within the US. The Supreme Court is hesitant to recognize private causes of action based on conduct abroad, which may impact the future application of Section 1836's civil remedies."
