The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" defines terms related to Indian tribes, tribal-state agreements, and ownership of businesses by Indian tribes or their members. The \"Tribal-State Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" applies to covered State taxes unless exempted by State law or if the legal incidence of the tax falls on a tribe or its members. It only applies to purchases made after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. COLLECTION OF COVERED STATE TAXES PURSUANT TO AN ENFORCEMENT PETITION. The Secretary must investigate allegations of non-collection or non-remittance of covered State tax by a tribal retail enterprise within 60 days of receiving a petition from the Governor. If the allegations are valid, the Secretary will notify the enterprise within 60 days. The Enforcement Petition directs tribal retail enterprises to collect and remit State taxes to the Secretary within 60 days of notification or mediation. Remittance to the Secretary must occur monthly by the 15th day following collection. The Enforcement Petition requires tribal retail enterprises to remit State taxes to the Secretary monthly by the 15th day following collection, with the amount not exceeding what is specified in any existing tribal-State agreement. The Secretary consults with the Governor to determine State taxes if no tribal-state agreement exists for the tribal retail enterprise or Indian tribe named in an Enforcement Petition. The Secretary collects taxes from the enterprise or tribe as specified in relevant State law. The Secretary determines State taxes for a tribal retail enterprise or Indian tribe named in an Enforcement Petition. If parties cannot agree on the amount, mediation is requested between the enterprise or tribe and the Governor of the State. The Secretary determines State taxes for a tribal retail enterprise or Indian tribe named in an Enforcement Petition. If parties cannot agree on the amount, mediation is requested within 180 days. The Service's determination will be used to establish the appropriate amount to be remitted. Failure to cooperate with mediation may result in consequences. If the Governor fails to participate in mediation or cooperate with the Service, the Service may make a determination based on available information. Remittances of covered State taxes to the Secretary will continue until the Governor certifies that the Secretary's involvement is no longer needed or a tribal-State agreement is reached. The Secretary remits taxes collected from tribal retail enterprises to the State fund specified by the Governor, after deducting administrative expenses. Administrative expenses are deducted before remitting funds, with an administrative fee equal to the direct cost of administering the Act or one percent of the amounts remitted. Amounts remitted to the Secretary under subsection (c) or paid pursuant to a judgment under section 6 shall be applied by the State to amounts due under the terms of the tribal-State agreement or the covered State tax obligation of the relevant tribal retail enterprise. SEC. 5. The Secretary must mediate disputes between States and Indian tribes regarding tribal-State agreements within 60 days of a request. Mediation must be completed within 210 days, and the parties must adopt the Secretary's determination. SEC. 6 addresses enforcement of payments under tribal-State agreements or State tax obligations. If a tribal retail enterprise violates section 4(b)(2), the Secretary will issue a notice of violation and demand immediate compliance. If the enterprise does not comply within 30 days, the matter will be referred to the Department of Justice, which will initiate a civil enforcement action in Federal district court within 60 days. If a tribal retail enterprise owned or operated by an Indian tribe violates section 4(b)(2), a civil enforcement action will be taken, including injunctive relief and payment of covered State taxes to the Secretary. If the enterprise is owned or operated by a member of an Indian tribe, the action will also include civil penalties three times the amount of covered State taxes. If a tribal retail enterprise appeals a decision in Federal court, they must post a bond for the amount of State taxes and interest until a final determination is made. SEC. 7 allows the Governor of a State or a tribal retail enterprise named in an enforcement petition to challenge the Secretary's conclusions in Federal court. If the challenge fails, the challenging party must pay attorney's fees and court costs. SEC. 8 mandates the Secretary to issue regulations for implementing the Act within 180 days of enactment. SEC. 9 states the Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, regardless of regulation issuance."
