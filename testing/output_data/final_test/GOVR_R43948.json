    "content": "The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and includes four main programs with funding of over $1 billion each. The nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA, consists of three laboratories and four production sites. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress seeks further changes for increased efficiency and security. The nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA, consists of three laboratories and four production sites. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress seeks increased efficiency and security. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex, with projected costs for FY2011-FY2020 between $85.4 billion and $86.2 billion. The nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA, consists of three laboratories and four production sites. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the complex, with projected costs for FY2011-FY2020 between $85.4 billion and $86.2 billion. Concerns about the organization of the federal agency responsible for managing the nuclear weapons program have been ongoing since World War II. Congress created the Atomic Energy Commission in 1946, which was later dissolved in 1974, leading to the creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration. The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 dissolved ERDA and created DOE, which later led to the creation of NNSA in 2000. Concerns about the management of the nuclear weapons complex have prompted various reorganizations over the years. In response to these concerns, Congress established the Congressional Advisory Panel on the Governance of the Nuclear Security Enterprise to address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in the existing governance structures. The NNSA governance reform has failed to address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in the enterprise, putting it at risk over the long term. Recommendations include strengthening presidential guidance, establishing new congressional mechanisms, replacing NNSA with a new Office of Nuclear Security within DOE, and promoting a culture of performance and accountability. The NNSA governance reform has not effectively addressed inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in the enterprise, risking its long-term stability. Recommendations include strengthening presidential guidance, establishing new congressional mechanisms, replacing NNSA with a new Office of Nuclear Security within DOE, and promoting a culture of performance and accountability. Additionally, P.L. 113-235 included sections on cost and oversight, such as requiring independent oversight for high-hazard nuclear facilities and independent cost estimates for projects over $100 million. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about poor cost estimating within the Department, particularly in the NNSA, and directed the Secretary of Energy to provide a report outlining plans for improving cost estimating for major projects and programs related to nuclear weapons. The FY2016 request for this program was $3,187.3 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $3,354.3 million. The House passed H.R. 2028, Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, without amendments to the Weapons Activities section. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3,039.5 million for FY2016 for the Weapons Activities section of the bill. Specific programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and the B61 mod 12 is ongoing. The amounts requested by NNSA for LEPs in FY2016 were approved in the omnibus appropriations bill. $244.0 million was allocated for the W76-1 LEP, with production scheduled to be completed by FY2019. The production unit for the B61-12 LEP was completed in FY2008, with production set to finish by FY2019. $643.3 million was allocated for the B61-12 LEP, with the FPU expected by the second quarter of FY2020. $220.2 million was designated for the W88 Alt 370, including an arming-fuzing-firing system, with the FPU planned for the first quarter of FY2020. The House Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to integrate the cost of additional work for the W88 LEP into acquisition reports. The Senate Appropriations Committee emphasized the difference between LEPs and alterations, stating that the distinction should be maintained. The omnibus appropriations bill required NNSA to account for all costs of major multi-year stockpile refurbishment activities exceeding $1,000,000,000. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the NNSA's handling of the W80-4 life extension program, directing an independent group to assess the alternatives selected. The committee noted the NNSA's history of spending large amounts on alternatives that are later abandoned for more affordable options. The omnibus appropriations bill required the NNSA to have a formal acquisition management plan for refurbishment activities costing over $1 billion. The omnibus appropriations bill retained the request for an assessment of the NNSA's alternatives selected for the W80-4 life extension program. The FY2016 budget proposed suspending activities for an interoperable warhead (W78/88-1) for ICBMs and SLBMs, with a projected 2030 FPU. P.L. 113-235 provided full funding for various LEPs and studies, including the B61 LEP, W76 LEP, W88 Alt 370, and cruise missile warhead life extension study. The Explanatory Statement required NNSA to provide a report on military requirements, cost, and schedule for the latter program. The FY2015 and FY2016 budget requests for routine maintenance, replacement of components, and surveillance for weapon types in the stockpile were provided in the omnibus appropriations bills. The number of warheads has decreased since the Cold War, with activities such as interim storage, dismantlement, and disposition being part of the Weapon Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program. Funding for WDD in FY2015 and FY2016 was allocated, with a directive to avoid a dismantlement workload gap in the mid-2020s. The FY2016 budget request was $48.0 million, with the House passing H.R. 2028 to provide the requested amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $52.0 million, which was included in the omnibus appropriations bill. This category includes Production Support, R&D Support, R&D Certification and Safety, Management, Technology, and Production, and Plutonium Infrastructure Sustainment. Stockpile Services are crucial for the nuclear security enterprise's production capability and capacity. The FY2015 request was $1,108.5 million, with P.L. 113-235 providing $1,034.5 million. The FY2016 budget proposed moving some programs from Stockpile Services to a new account, Nuclear Material Commodities. H.R. 2028 provided $932.1 million for Stockpile Services in FY2016, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $858.0 million. The committee supported an increase in subcritical experiments to study plutonium behavior under pressure from conventional explosions, which validates weapons simulation codes. The committee directed NNSA to increase the frequency of experiments to validate weapons simulation codes. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $938.6 million for Stockpile Services, consolidating funding for key material and production capabilities. The FY2016 request was $415.0 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $589.2 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $612.3 million for Strategic Materials, including $250 million for Strategic Materials Sustainment. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $50 million for Dismantlement and provided reprogramming authority for another $50 million. The committee awaited a study on tritium and low enriched uranium. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $50 million for Dismantlement and provided reprogramming authority for another $50 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended $50 million for DUE, with reprogramming authority for an additional $50 million. The omnibus appropriations bill accepted this funding level for RDT&E programs focused on developing and maintaining critical capabilities. The NNSA focuses on five RDT&E programs to support stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. These programs have policy significance and fund facilities like the National Ignition Facility. The FY2016 budget request was $1,776.5 million, with the House providing $1,774.2 million and the Senate recommending $1,766.3 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1,818.5 million for a program that maintains the nuclear stockpile and identifies future risks. The FY2016 request was $389.6 million, with the House recommending $412.9 million for plutonium research and enhancing U.S. capabilities. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $423 million for the science program, including $45.7 million for advanced radiography capabilities to improve weapon surety and support stockpile assessments. The NNSA was directed to provide cost estimates for developing new radiography capabilities at U1a. The FY2015-enacted funding for annual stockpile assessments was $136.0 million, with a FY2016 request of $131.4 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided the requested funding for the program developing tools to simulate nuclear explosion conditions in the laboratory. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the centerpiece of this program, aiming to achieve nuclear fusion ignition. Despite delays in achieving ignition, NIF has proven valuable for stockpile stewardship. Controversy surrounding NIF in Congress has decreased over the years, with its dedication in May 2009. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) was dedicated in May 2009. Funding for NIF in FY2015 was $512.9 million, with a directive to assess the likelihood of achieving ignition by December 2015. The FY2016 request was $502.5 million, with the omnibus appropriations bill providing $511.1 million, including $329 million for NIF. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported efforts to operate NIF more efficiently and attract top talent for stockpile stewardship. The program develops computational models of nuclear weapons using data from various sources to simulate weapon behavior. Some doubt the reliability of simulations for certifying warhead safety and advocate for a return to testing. Funding for the program was $598.0 million in FY2015 and $623.0 million in FY2016, with a focus on increasing computing capability. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount, including $64.0 million for activities related to the exascale initiative. The NNSA budget request includes $64.0 million for the exascale initiative, aiming to develop supercomputers capable of 1 billion calculations per second. The omnibus appropriations bill approved this amount. The House Appropriations Committee recommended establishing an Advanced Manufacturing Campaign instead of funding the Readiness Campaign for nuclear weapon production. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $70.0 million for the exascale initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $70.0 million for the Readiness Campaign. P.L. 113-235 provided $107.2 million for Advanced Manufacturing Development, including additive manufacturing, component manufacturing, and process technology development. The FY2016 request was $130.1 million for Advanced Manufacturing Development, with no funds allocated for additive manufacturing. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $113.8 million, with $16.0 million designated for additive manufacturing. The committee expressed concern about the budget request for advanced manufacturing capabilities, citing a lack of transparency in NNSA's development progress. The omnibus appropriations bill allocated $130 million for the program, which previously funded infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites. Funding elements now focus on material recycle, facility recapitalization, and construction, including controversial projects like the Uranium Processing Facility and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project. The FY2016 budget for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory has been revised due to cost growth and schedule delays. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating funding for various functions into a new category called Infrastructure and Operations (I&O) with a recommended budget of $2,228.2 million to eliminate duplication. The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating funding for various functions into a new category called Infrastructure and Operations (I&O) with a budget of $2,228.2 million to eliminate duplication. H.R. 2028, as passed by the House, provided the recommended amount and expressed concerns about construction funding accountability and advance funds for new projects without cost and schedule projections. The Committee cannot determine if requested projects are affordable and well-managed to approve new start authority. The committee recommended funding amounts for UPF and CMRR, $430.0 million and $155.6 million respectively. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,021.1 billion for RTBF and recommended requested amounts for UPF and CMRR. The omnibus appropriations bill allocates $430 million for UPF and $155.6 million for CMRR to enhance plutonium capabilities. NNSA is directed to provide results of an Independent Cost Review of the UPF project and a multiyear funding profile. The Infrastructure and Safety program aims to maintain, operate, and modernize NNSA's infrastructure with five key elements. The FY2016 NNSA budget request was $1,466.1 million, with $660.2 million allocated for construction under RTBF. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $660.1 million for RTBF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for I&S construction. The omnibus appropriations bill appropriated $2,279.1 million for Infrastructure and Safety programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $232.0 million for Weapons Activities, emphasizing the lack of justification for a federal workforce increase. H.R. 2028 passed with the recommended amount, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $219.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $219.0 million for the Secure Transportation Asset program, expressing concern over the lack of justification for a funding increase. The omnibus appropriations bill allocated $237.1 million for this program area, which plays a crucial role in responding to nuclear and radiological incidents globally. Congress rejected NNSA's proposal to transfer the program to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation in FY2014, providing $228.2 million instead. For FY2015, NNSA requested $173.4 million, with the House allocating $202.9 million. Additionally, $25.0 million was provided for emergency response-related R&D. The bill provided $25.0 million for emergency response-related R&D traditionally funded in Weapons Activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount, while P.L. 113-235 allocated $177.9 million, with $142.6 million for emergency response activities supporting a ninth stabilization city. The Administration proposed merging the Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response and Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation Programs for FY2016. The House passed H.R. 2028, changing the NCTIR name to Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response Program and moving it to the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $234.4 million for NCTIR under Weapons Activities, aligning with NNSA's request for funding in the DNN account. The omnibus appropriations bill funded the program under the DNN account to sustain and exercise the U.S. Government's ability to understand and counter nuclear terrorism. In FY2015, NNSA requested $76.9 million for a program in Weapons Activities, but funding was reduced to $46.1 million under P.L. 113-235. In FY2016, NNSA proposed moving the program to DNN. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended no funding for the program under Weapons Activities for FY2016. The program includes subprograms for Nuclear Materials Integration, focusing on the stabilization, consolidation, packaging, and disposition of nuclear materials. The NNSA funds research and education enhancements at under-represented colleges and universities to support its technical workforce. The FY2016 request for the Site Stewardship program was $36.6 million, an increase from $27.8 million in FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for this program, proposing its inclusion in Infrastructure and Operations instead. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $36.6 million for Site Stewardship, which provides operations, maintenance, and construction funds for security programs at NNSA facilities. The FY2016 request was $632.9 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $682.9 million to address security camera replacements and funding shortfalls for protective forces. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $35.0 million for a Security Improvements Program to address security infrastructure upgrades at NNSA sites, expressing concern over terminated projects at Y-12. The House passed H.R. 2028 with the recommended amounts. The Committee also recommended $657.9 million to meet shortfalls in protective forces and replace vital security infrastructure. The NNSA terminated the Y-12 Security Improvements Project without completing the full scope of work planned. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $682.9 million for Defense Nuclear Security, with $30 million directed towards the Security Improvements Program to address security projects backlog. The program focuses on IT initiatives for nuclear security, including cybersecurity and cloud-based desktop solutions. The FY2016 request was $157.6 million. The FY2016 request for the desktop-based solution was $157.6 million, slightly lower than the FY2015 amount of $179.6 million. The omnibus appropriations bill provided the requested funding. The University of California previously operated Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, with employees participating in the UC pension plan. After privatization, NNSA paid into the pension plan for UC employees to make up for differences in pension benefits. For Weapons Activities, the FY2016 request was $283.9 million, down from $307.1 million in FY2015. For FY2016, H.R. 2028 provided the requested amount for Legacy Contractor Pensions under Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended and the omnibus appropriations bill provided the amount requested by NNSA. NNSA projects a decline in requests for this program, with funding falling to $87.4 million in FY2019 and FY2020."
