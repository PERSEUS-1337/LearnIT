    "content": "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) are federally developed food-based recommendations for Americans over two years old, aimed at promoting health and preventing disease. Mandated by the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act, the guidelines are reviewed and updated every five years by the Secretaries of HHS and USDA. The DGA is evidence-based and serves as the basis for policy decisions. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) is an authoritative policy document that influences nutrition policies and programs in the United States. It has impacted public policy, such as nutrition labeling, with recommendations to reduce added sugars intake. The FDA proposed a rule to mandate an \"added sugars\" line on Nutrition Facts labels, distinguishing between added sugars and naturally occurring sugars. They also suggested a percent daily value declaration for added sugars based on new evidence supporting a reference amount for added sugar intake. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) have evolved over the years to provide recommendations for a healthy diet based on scientific evidence. The DGA suggests that added sugars should not exceed 10% of total calories, with the latest edition expected to include recommendations for children up to 24 months of age. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) have evolved to include recommendations for children up to 24 months of age, as directed by the Agricultural Act of 2014. The process for reviewing evidence and drafting the DGA has also changed, with the establishment of an external committee in 1983 to review scientific evidence and recommend revisions. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) have evolved over the years, with the 1985 edition being more widely accepted. In 1987, a House Committee directed the establishment of a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Group. The 1995 DGA was the first statutorily mandated edition, following voluntary editions in 1980, 1985, and 1990. The process involved a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) after the 2005 DGA. Following the 2005 DGA, the USDA CNPP developed the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL) for the 2010 DGAC to review scientific evidence. The DGAC, composed of experts in nutrition and chronic disease prevention, provides advisory reports to the Secretaries of HHS and USDA. The 2015 DGAC provided advisory scientific reports to HHS and USDA for the final DGA policy document. They examined the 2010 DGA, developed food-based recommendations, and used systematic reviews and data analyses to inform their revisions. The NEL was relied upon for objective research synthesis. The CNPP established the NEL in 2008 to conduct systematic reviews on food and nutrition. The NEL uses a six-step process to inform federal nutrition policy and programs, with the DGAC utilizing this process to evaluate evidence for its Advisory Report. The NEL was created to comply with the Data Quality Act and assist in the development of nutrition guidelines. The Data Quality Act directed the OMB to issue guidelines for ensuring information quality. The DGAC identified research questions and developed frameworks for systematic reviews. CNPP professionals screened articles for inclusion criteria, with oversight from the DGAC. The DGAC oversaw the systematic review process, ensuring studies were appropriately included or excluded, key information was extracted, and bias assessments were conducted. NEL staff supported the process, but the DGAC made substantive decisions and graded the strength of evidence for conclusion statements. The 2015 DGAC graded statements based on predetermined criteria assessing study quality, consistency, generalizability, and public health impact. Recommendations were submitted in a 571-page report to HHS and USDA on Feb 15, 2015. The final policy document was released on Jan 7, 2016, considering input from federal agencies and public comments. The DGAC focused on the high prevalence of preventable chronic diseases and the influence of personal, social, and environmental factors on individuals' behaviors. The 2015 DGAC's report framed its evidence review in a socioecological model, examining how personal, social, organizational, and environmental factors influence nutrition and health behaviors. Recommendations included a healthy dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts, moderate in alcohol, and low in sugar-sweetened foods and refined grains. These recommendations align with the 2010 DGA guidelines. The 2015 DGAC's report advised a diet high in whole grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, lean meat, beans, and nuts. It recommended using oils instead of saturated fats, consuming moderate amounts of coffee, limiting added sugar intake, and reducing red and processed meat consumption. The 2015 DGAC report recommended a diet high in whole grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, lean meat, beans, and nuts, while advising to limit added sugar intake and reduce red and processed meat consumption. The report also addressed recommendations on healthy food environments, sustainability, and tax policy, receiving feedback from stakeholders on various concerns regarding the scope and process of the recommendations. The 2015 DGAC report recommended a diet high in whole grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, lean meat, beans, and nuts, while advising to limit added sugar intake and reduce red and processed meat consumption. Stakeholders expressed concerns about the committee exceeding its scope by making policy recommendations, such as eating less red and processed meat in favor of a plant-based diet for improved health and environmental impact. The 2015 DGAC report recommended a diet high in whole grains, low-fat dairy, seafood, lean meat, beans, and nuts, while advising to limit added sugar intake and reduce red and processed meat consumption. The DGAC also made policy recommendations regarding nutrition labeling, federal nutrition assistance programs, and economic and tax policies to promote healthy food consumption and reduce unhealthy food consumption. Some Members of Congress criticized the DGAC for making recommendations on sustainability and tax policy. The HHS and USDA Secretaries decided that sustainability and tax policy concerns would not be included in the final policy document for the 2015 DGAC report. Stakeholders also raised issues about the evidence evaluation process used in the report. The 2015 DGAC report used the NEL for 27% of its questions, existing sources for 45%, and data analyses for 30%. Unlike the 2010 DGAC, it relied more on existing evidence, which some criticized. Some criticized the 2015 DGAC for using existing reviews and bypassing the NEL process, questioning its scientific rigor. Concerns were raised about the reliance on observational evidence and the recommendation to reduce red and processed meat consumption, which was met with opposition from meat industry groups. The 2015 DGAC recommended limiting added sugars to below 10% of total calorie intake, citing evidence linking reduced sugar intake to lower BMI in both children and adults. Some food industry groups disputed the need for distinguishing between naturally occurring and added sugars. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans do not differentiate between occurring and added sugars nutritionally and do not set a specific limit on added sugars. The guidelines focus on following a healthy eating pattern, emphasizing variety, nutrient density, and portion control to support overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasize variety, nutrient density, and portion control to support overall health. It recommends choosing nutrient-dense foods, limiting added sugars and saturated fats, reducing sodium intake, and making healthier food and beverage choices. It also encourages supporting healthy eating patterns for all in various settings. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a healthy eating pattern that includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and limits saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium intake. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting saturated fats and sodium intake, moderate alcohol consumption, and meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. It does not include the recommendation to reduce consumption of red and processed meat. Eating patterns with lower meat intake, including processed meat and lean poultry, are linked to reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Lean meats and poultry provide essential nutrients, but should be consumed within daily limits for sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars. Moderate coffee consumption (up to 400 mg of caffeine per day) can be part of a healthy diet, but added sweeteners and creams should be limited to avoid extra calories. The 2015-2020 DGA does not differentiate between caffeine sources. The 2015-2020 DGA does not differentiate between caffeine sources, but focuses on coffee intake. Limited evidence exists on the relationship between high caffeine energy drinks and health outcomes. Mixing caffeine with alcohol is not considered safe by the FDA. The recommendation to limit daily dietary cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg per day has been removed due to lack of evidence. The 2015-2020 DGA retains recommendations from the 2010 DGA and the 2015 DGAC's report. The 2015-2020 DGA aligns with previous guidelines but differs in recommendations on cholesterol and added sugars. Stakeholder concerns led to policy changes in the development process. The FY2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113) included DGA-related policy riders. Section 734 limited the scope of the 2015-2020 DGA to \"nutritional and dietary information only.\" Section 735 required a comprehensive study by the National Academy of Medicine on the process used to establish the 2015 DGAC and the subsequent development of the 2015 DGA. This study aimed to improve the DGA's ability to prevent chronic disease, ensure nutritional adequacy for all Americans, and consider individual factors like age, gender, and metabolic health. The DGAC selection process can be improved for transparency and bias elimination, including committee members with diverse viewpoints. The NEL is used for compiling data and conducting systematic reviews following rigorous scientific standards. Section 735(b) requires a NAM study to recommend improvements for the DGA development process to reflect balanced and sound science. Congress allocated $1 million for this study, and potential changes to the DGA development process will depend on the NAM study findings. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) will now include guidance for infants, toddlers, and pregnant women, as mandated by the 2014 Agricultural Appropriations Act. This expansion follows recommendations from the congressionally mandated NAM study."
