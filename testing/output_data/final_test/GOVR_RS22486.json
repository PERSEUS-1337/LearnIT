    "content": "A July 2005 Joint Statement established a U.S.-India \"global partnership\" focusing on economic cooperation, energy, environment, democracy, non-proliferation, security, high-technology, and space. India's positive relations with Iran, based on historical ties, contrast with U.S. efforts to isolate Iran for its nuclear program. India's friendship with Iran is seen as a potential obstacle to U.S.-India ties, but it is not a strategic alliance. Despite concerns in Congress about India's defense relations with Iran, New Delhi is unlikely to abandon its ties with Tehran, especially in energy commerce. The U.S. worries that India's energy dealings with Iran could financially benefit a country the U.S. seeks to isolate. India's plans to seek energy resources from Iran have raised concerns as it could financially benefit a country the United States seeks to isolate. Despite opposition from the Bush Administration, Indian firms have secured long-term contracts for Iranian gas and oil. India supports the construction of a pipeline to deliver Iranian natural gas through Pakistan. Some analysts suggest that India's pursuit of closer relations with Iran may be driven by geostrategic motives beyond energy security. Additionally, there are reports of Iranian naval ships visiting India's Kochi port for \"training,\" which Indian officials downplay while Secretary Rice challenges the report's accuracy. The United States has expressed concerns to India about their relationship with Iran, particularly regarding the proposed gas pipeline. Despite US opposition, India's ties with Iran are based on historical, civilizational, and multifaceted connections, with cooperation in energy, trade, commerce, and technology. Relations were further strengthened through regular exchanges, with high-level meetings and institutional linkages between National Security Councils. Iranian leaders seek new allies to counter US isolation efforts. Iranian leaders reciprocate New Delhi's favorable view and insist that warming U.S.-India relations will not weaken their own ties with New Delhi. However, signs show that New Delhi intends to align its Iran policy more closely with the United States, despite a significant constituency in India urging resistance to U.S. pressure. Top Indian leaders maintain that friendly ties with Tehran will continue alongside a growing U.S.-India partnership, but some observers see this rhetoric as conflicting with recent developments. The Indian government aligns with international efforts to address Iran's nuclear program, despite challenges from its traditional nonaligned stance and domestic political forces wary of closer ties with the United States. India's closer relations with the United States should not harm ties with Iran. The Indian government has tried to balance its relationship with both countries, with the opposition party supporting its stance on Iran's nuclear program. Despite initial reports suggesting India would oppose Iran's nuclear program at the U.N. Security Council, India ultimately voted with the majority (including the U.S.) on an IAEA resolution in 2005, leading to criticism from opposition parties and analysts. In January 2006, the U.S. ambassador to India linked progress on U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation with India's upcoming IAEA vote. New Delhi rejected attempts to link the issues, but on February 4, 2006, India voted with the majority in referring Iran to the Security Council. Some saw India's IAEA votes as a strategic choice to strengthen its partnership with Washington despite opposition. In July 2006, the House passed legislation (H.R. 5682) for U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India, emphasizing India's cooperation with U.S. policy towards Iran. The Senate version (S. 3709) had no mention of Iran. The resulting \"Hyde Act\" required India to participate in U.S. efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. Congressional conferees deemed India's participation critical. In recent years, there have been occasional revelations of Indian transfers to Iran of technology that could be useful for Iran's weapons of mass destruction programs. Some Indian individuals have been sanctioned by the Bush Administration under the Iran Non-Proliferation Act. In 2004, Indian nuclear scientists Dr. Chaudhary Surendar and Dr. Y.S.R. Prasad were sanctioned under the INA for allegedly passing heavy-water nuclear technology to Iran. Sanctions against Surendar were lifted in December 2005. Two Indian chemical companies were also sanctioned in December 2005 and two more in August 2006 for transactions with Iran. India imposed restrictions on nuclear-related exports to Iran in February 2007 in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1737. Since the formation of an Indo-Iran Joint Commission in 1983, defense and military relations between India and Iran have remained at a steady but relatively low level. India did not provide significant military assistance to Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988. Iran turned to India in 1993 for help developing batteries for Kilo-class submarines purchased from Russia, as the Russian batteries were not suitable for the warm waters of the Persian Gulf. Expectations have been raised for further expansion of Iran-India military ties since 2003. Iran-India military ties were expected to expand under the 2003 \"New Delhi Declaration,\" but the cooperation has stalled and not evolved into a strategic alliance. The cooperation represents good relations and a chance to enhance power projection in the region. Major new deals have not materialized, but Iran sought Indian advice on operating its missile systems. Iran sought Indian advice on operating its missile systems, refitting tanks, and upgrading fighters. Joint naval exercises have been held, with a joint working group formed in 2007 to implement agreements. India imports Iranian crude oil, dominating their commercial relations. Trade between the two countries exceeded $9 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2007. In the fiscal year ending March 2007, India-Iran trade exceeded $9 billion. India, a major gas importer, is building energy ties with Iran, including a $22 billion deal for 5 million tons of Iranian LNG annually. This deal may conflict with U.S. policy under the Iran Sanctions Act, which imposes sanctions on investments over $20 million in Iran's energy sector. India's investment in Iran's energy sector includes purchasing 100,000-150,000 barrels of Iranian oil daily and supplying refined gasoline. The proposed Iran-India gas pipeline project involves companies like ONGC, GAIL, Indian Oil Corporation, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation, with a potential extension to China. The project, valued at $4 billion-$7 billion, has commitments from Iran, India, and Pakistan. The Iran-India gas pipeline project, valued at $4 billion-$7 billion, is tentatively scheduled to begin construction later in 2007 and be completed by 2010. Pakistani President Musharraf stated in January 2006 that the project is feasible even without India's participation. Various issues have been resolved since January 2007, including a pricing formula and the split of gas supplies between India and Pakistan. However, unresolved issues such as the pipeline route, security, transportation tariffs, and related matters are still being discussed. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the project, but no violation of ISA has been directly stated. India and Iran are cooperating to secure their interests in Afghanistan, both supporting the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. They aim to prevent a Taliban return to power and have provided economic aid to the Afghan government. Pakistan sees India's presence in Afghanistan as a security threat due to \"strategic encirclement.\""
