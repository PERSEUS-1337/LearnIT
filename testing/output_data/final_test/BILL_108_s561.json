    "content": "The Act titled \"State Water Sovereignty Protection Act\" defines the term \"State\" to include various territories. It allows the United States to use state law for acquiring and exercising water rights. The \"State Water Sovereignty Protection Act\" allows the United States to be subject to state laws when appropriating or acquiring water rights, and to be joined in administrative or judicial proceedings related to water rights to the same extent as private individuals. The \"State Water Sovereignty Protection Act\" requires the United States to adhere to state laws in water rights proceedings and allows for review of judgments in the same manner as private individuals. Federal land withdrawals do not imply reserved water rights. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF WATER IN A STATE. The text states that each State has the authority to regulate water within its borders, including in interstate commerce. The United States can only manage and control water within a State in compliance with the State's laws. Private parties can sue the United States for relief related to water management. Private entities can seek injunctive relief against the United States under State laws regarding water management. In administrative or judicial proceedings under this Act or the McCarran Amendment, the United States can be charged costs and fees like a private person. The Act does not allow water appropriation that conflicts with international agreements involving the United States or affects rights under treaties, compacts, or obligations to Indian tribes. It does not modify other Acts. The Act does not affect section 208 of the Act of July 10, 1952, the Submerged Lands Act, or the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act."
