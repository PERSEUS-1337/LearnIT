    "content": "Congress has long deliberated on drinking water quality and infrastructure, which have been brought to the forefront of national attention by events like elevated lead levels in tap water in Flint, MI, hurricanes damaging water infrastructure, and local contamination events. The nation's drinking water infrastructure is deteriorating, posing threats to public health and increasing maintenance costs. The American Water Works Association reported that much of the infrastructure was built in the 19th and 20th centuries and is nearing the end of its useful life. The U.S. drinking water infrastructure is deteriorating and in need of substantial funding for improvements and replacements. The EPA estimated that $472.60 billion is needed over the next 20 years for compliance and safe drinking water provision. 12% of this funding is for statutory compliance, while the majority is for ongoing investments in repairing aging infrastructure. The survey reported that costs to replace aging drinking water infrastructure and expand water service will exceed $1 trillion over the next 25 years. Small community water systems face financial challenges in financing infrastructure improvements, with potential triple household water bill increases. Older cities may struggle with declining populations and utility revenues for repairs. The America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 addresses financing concerns for aging drinking water infrastructure, which could triple household water bills. The act includes provisions for water resource development, USACE projects, hydropower activities, and EPA water infrastructure. Title II and IV of the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 address EPA water infrastructure programs and provisions for drinking water. Title II is a comprehensive reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act, promoting compliance, reauthorizing funds for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, assisting disadvantaged communities, and improving consumer confidence. It also authorizes grant programs to reduce lead contamination in school drinking water and enhance public water system resilience. Title IV covers various water quality and infrastructure issues. Title IV of AWIA addresses water quality and infrastructure issues by authorizing and revising activities and programs for EPA and other federal agencies. It extends, authorizes, and amends drinking-water-related activities and provisions, including a water efficiency program and revisions to the WIFIA program. Amendments to the Clean Water Act are included to address stormwater management. The report provides legislative background on AWIA, revisions to SDWA, federal financial assistance for drinking water improvements, assistance for drinking water repairs in disaster areas, revisions to federal water infrastructure financial assistance programs, and provisions addressing water efficiency. Appendices include tables of plans, reports, and regulations required by AWIA, cross-references of provisions, and summaries of other EPA-related provisions not discussed in the report. During the 115th Congress, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act (H.R. 3387) was considered to address technical, managerial, and financial challenges in small and disadvantaged communities. The bill aimed to improve water systems' capacity, consumer confidence, and access to financial assistance for infrastructure improvements. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act aimed to address challenges in small communities by improving water systems' capacity and access to financial assistance for infrastructure improvements. Congress also considered bills reauthorizing appropriations for drinking water infrastructure assistance and revising water infrastructure programs. The House incorporated provisions from various bills into S. 3021, which passed in September 2018. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act, passed in September 2018, was signed into law as P.L. 115-270 on October 23, 2018. It amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to improve water systems, regulate contaminants, and establish new grant programs for infrastructure. The Drinking Water System Improvement Act, signed into law in October 2018, aims to regulate contaminants in public water systems, promote compliance through assistance programs, and enhance preparedness for emergencies. It establishes federal-state partnerships for implementation and enforcement, with EPA setting national regulations for over 90 contaminants that may affect human health. EPA's regulations cover disinfectants, microorganisms, radionuclides, organic and inorganic chemicals. The SDWA Amendments of 1996 reauthorized appropriations for most programs through FY2003. The DWSRF program provides federal financial assistance for drinking water infrastructure improvements. EPA is authorized to make annual grants to states for their state revolving loan fund. States must provide a 20% match and can use the financing for projects to comply with federal drinking water standards. The DWSRF program offers low-interest loans for public water system projects to comply with federal drinking water standards and address health risks. States can provide additional subsidization to disadvantaged communities. Congress has appropriated over $23.33 billion for the program from FY1997 to FY2018, with annual appropriations ranging from $820.0 million to $1.39 billion. AWIA Section 2015(a) makes significant revisions to the DWSRF program, expanding eligible uses of funds and providing more flexibility to states. It allows funds to be used for replacing or rehabilitating aging water systems, addressing 66.1% of the estimated infrastructure needs. These changes aim to make DWSRF assistance more accessible to public water systems. Section 2015 of AWIA expands the DWSRF program, allowing funds to be used for replacing aging water systems and increasing assistance for disadvantaged communities. It increases the portion of a state's capitalization grant that can be used for subsidization to 35% and extends the amortization period for loans to disadvantaged communities to 40 years. Additionally, it extends the repayment and amortization period for all projects financed by the DWSRF. The AWIA extends the repayment and amortization period for projects financed by the DWSRF, allowing for the initial payment to be made 18 months after project completion. It also authorizes extending the amortization period from 20 to 30 years. EPA is required to include the cost to replace lead service lines in the drinking water infrastructure needs survey every four years. This requirement was not previously included in the survey, but AWIA now specifies that it must be included to the extent practicable. The AWIA requires lead lines to be included in the needs survey, potentially affecting states' DWSRF grants. It also mandates EPA to gather information on DWSRF administration and report to Congress on best practices. In 1996, Congress added source water assessment provisions to SDWA to encourage protection of drinking water sources. States were authorized to fund these activities from their DWSRF grants. AWIA Section 2015(f) removes fiscal year limitations on using capitalization grants for source water assessments. States can now use a portion of their grants for assessments or updates. The 1996 SDWA amendments required assessments for modified monitoring requirements but did not allow funding for source water protection plans. AWIA Section 2002 authorizes states to fund surface drinking water source protection efforts from a 10% set-aside of their DWSRF grants. Compliance with cross-cutting requirements is mandatory for DWSRF financial assistance recipients. AWIA specifies cross-cutting requirements for DWSRF-financed projects, including the use of American iron and steel and compliance with Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law. Section 2022 of AWIA renews the American iron and steel requirement for FY2019-FY2023. Previous legislation also mandated American iron and steel use for specified fiscal years. The WIIN Act amended SDWA to require American iron and steel for FY2017 projects. AWIA Section 2023 reauthorizes DWSRF capitalization grants for FY2019-FY2021 with appropriations totaling approximately $1.17 billion in FY2019, $1.30 billion in FY2020, and $1.95 billion in FY2021. Congress has consistently required the use of American iron and steel for DWSRF-financed projects through appropriations acts since FY2014. Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements have also been applied to DWSRF-funded projects since 2009. AWIA reauthorizes DWSRF capitalization grants for FY2019-FY2021 with appropriations totaling approximately $1.17 billion in FY2019, $1.30 billion in FY2020, and $1.95 billion in FY2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 included $1.16 billion for DWSRF capitalization grants in FY2019. AWIA addresses drinking water infrastructure issues by revising grant programs to reduce lead in school drinking water, support state responses to contamination, assist disadvantaged communities, and improve drinking water systems for Indian tribes. Section 2006 of AWIA revises a grant program to address lead contamination in drinking water at schools. The WIIN Act established the Voluntary School and Child Care Program Lead Testing Grant Program, providing funds for lead testing. The WIIN Act authorized $20.0 million annually for FY2017-FY2021, with a $5.0 million increase to $25.0 million in AWIA. The 115th Congress appropriated $20.0 million for FY2018 for this grant program. Section 2006 of AWIA amends the Voluntary School and Child Care Program Lead Testing Grant Program to prioritize low-income areas for grants and provide technical assistance for lead contamination remediation. Technical assistance includes identifying sources of lead contamination, grant programs for remediation, financing options, and organizations to assist in eliminating lead contamination. Section 2006(b) of AWIA establishes the Drinking Water Fountain Replacement for Schools program, prioritizing grants based on economic needs for water fountains manufactured before 1988. The program authorizes an annual appropriation of $5.0 million for FY2019-FY2021. AWIA Section 2005 introduces the Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program for small and disadvantaged public water systems to enhance resilience to natural hazards. Eligible projects include increasing water use efficiency. The Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program authorizes appropriations of $4.0 million for FY2019 and FY2020. It also adds an EPA-administered grant program to assist underserved communities in responding to contamination threats. EPA can make grants to states to help communities facing imminent contamination risks. Grant recipients found responsible for contamination may have to repay funds. EPA will recover funds from grant recipients responsible for contamination addressed by the grant program. SDWA Section 1459A authorizes $60.0 million for grant programs for small and disadvantaged communities. AWIA Section 2001 establishes a grant program at EPA for public water systems serving federally recognized Indian tribes, with $20.0 million in appropriations. Eligible projects aim to improve water quality, pressure, or services in specific river basins, with one project required to serve multiple tribes. The SDWA authorizes EPA to make grants to primacy states and territories for the public water system supervision program. Congress has continued to appropriate funds for this program, with about $101 million annually since FY2014. States also use set-asides from DWSRF grants and other resources to support the program. In 2013, state drinking water administrators estimated a $308.0 million per year funding gap for the PWSS program. The PWSS program has faced a funding gap due to increased workload for water system supervision. The AWIA reauthorizes appropriations for FY2020 and FY2021, increasing the authorized appropriation to $125.0 million. Provisions in AWIA aim to improve consumer access to compliance data and transparency of drinking water quality information. This includes notifying consumers more frequently about their drinking water quality and expanding monitoring requirements for unregulated contaminants. The AWIA requires public water system operators to include additional information in the annual consumer confidence report, such as lead exceedances and treatment techniques. This expands the information captured in the report to provide more transparency on drinking water quality. Additionally, operators of large public water systems must produce and distribute consumer reports more frequently. The AWIA requires public water system operators to provide consumer confidence reports annually or biannually, with the option to transmit them electronically. It also mandates the development of a strategic plan to improve monitoring data accuracy and availability. Additionally, the act authorizes a monitoring program for unregulated contaminants in public water supplies, requiring EPA to promulgate rules every five years for monitoring up to 30 unregulated contaminants. The AWIA mandates a monitoring program for unregulated contaminants in public water systems, requiring monitoring for up to 30 contaminants to inform EPA's regulation decisions. Funding of $10.0 million annually for FY2019-FY2021 was reauthorized for this program. The unregulated contaminant monitoring program funding expired in FY2003, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for it. AWIA now includes public water systems serving 3,300-10,000 individuals in the monitoring requirements, with $15.0 million authorized annually from FY2019 through FY2021. This expansion aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of unregulated contaminants in public water supplies, as over 5,000 systems serve this population range. The 1996 SDWA amendments authorized programs to assist public water systems with compliance, including technical assistance and operator certification. AWIA also authorizes new programs to enhance public water system capacity to comply with SDWA, with a focus on monitoring unregulated contaminants and encouraging consolidation of systems. The 1996 SDWA amendments authorized programs to assist public water systems with compliance, including technical assistance and operator certification. AWIA also amends SDWA capacity development provisions to include encouraging public water systems to develop asset management plans, which can help lower operation and maintenance costs. EPA has provided support for water systems choosing to develop asset management plans. EPA and USDA support small water utilities with asset management. SDWA Section 1420 now requires states to show progress in promoting asset management plans for public water systems. EPA will review and update asset management materials every five years. Asset management assistance aims to enhance the economic sustainability of public water systems facing technical, managerial, and financial challenges. Options like consolidation or ownership transfer to address these issues are suggested by EPA. The SDWA allows noncompliant public water systems to consolidate with other systems or transfer ownership as a way to improve compliance. This restructuring can help build capacity and provide relief from enforcement actions for specified violations for up to two years if approved by EPA or primacy states. The SDWA allows noncompliant public water systems to consolidate or transfer ownership to improve compliance. Section 2009 of AWIA allows public water systems to submit a plan for a contractual agreement with another system to manage noncompliance. Section 2010 authorizes primacy states or EPA to require assessments for consolidation or ownership transfer, proportionate to system size. Consolidated systems are eligible for financial assistance from the DWSRF and owners/operators have limited liability protection. The AWIA provides limited liability protection for owners or operators with a state-approved consolidation plan for public water systems. This plan identifies liabilities from violations and assets, limiting liability to assets and identified liabilities. Section 2003 defines intractable water systems serving fewer than 1,000 individuals that have been abandoned due to various reasons. EPA, USDA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are directed to conduct a study on these systems. The AWIA directs EPA, USDA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study on intractable water systems and barriers to delivering potable water. Section 4304 addresses concerns about replacing retiring water sector employees by establishing a water-specific workforce development grant program. Studies estimate that 30%-50% of water sector employees will retire in the next 10 years, highlighting the need for workforce development. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also recommended that EPA take steps to address water sector workforce development and succession planning. Section 4304 of the AWIA establishes the Innovative Water Infrastructure Workforce Development program, authorizing grants for various activities to support workforce development in the water sector. It also allows the use of DWSRF set-asides for source water assessment and protection activities, reauthorizes appropriations to a source water program, and revises notification requirements. AWIA Section 2016 reauthorizes $5.0 million in annual appropriations for FY2020 and FY2021 to support the source water protection partnership petition program. SDWA Section 1454 allows states to establish this program for public water system operators and community members to prevent source water degradation. AWIA Section 2018 amends EPCRA to enhance awareness among community water system operators of hazardous substances released into drinking water sources. EPCRA Section 312 requires facilities to report hazardous chemicals stored on-site to emergency response agencies. Section 304 addresses notification of releases of hazardous substances. EPCRA Section 325 authorizes EPA to fine facility owners for non-compliance with emergency planning and release notification requirements. AWIA Section 2018 amends EPCRA Section 304 to require SERC to notify state drinking water agencies of hazardous substances releases. AWIA Section 2018 amends EPCRA to authorize community water systems operators to request information on hazardous chemicals from SERC or LEPC. AWIA Section 2013 addresses water system resilience to natural and intentional threats, replacing SDWA Section 1433. Prior to AWIA, SDWA Section 1433 required water systems to assess vulnerabilities to intentional acts. AWIA Section 2013 requires water systems to assess vulnerabilities to terrorist or intentional acts and prepare emergency response plans. Stakeholders suggest including risks of extreme weather events in assessments. EPA provides tools and training to increase resilience to weather events. Public water systems must assess risks of natural hazards and malevolent acts, evaluate infrastructure resilience and management practices, and develop emergency response plans. Systems serving 3,300+ people must review assessments every five years and coordinate with LEPC. Assessments and response plans are voluntary for systems serving fewer than 3,300 people. Section 2013 of the AWIA requires public water systems to certify assessments and submit them to the EPA by specific deadlines based on community size. It allows the use of third-party technical standards for assessments and plans to ease compliance. $25.0 million is authorized annually for FY2020 and FY2021 for EPA grants to improve system resiliency. EPA must provide guidance and technical assistance for assessments and emergency response planning. Section 2017 of AWIA adds SDWA Section 1459D, requiring EPA to review technologies for drinking water system integrity, contamination, alternative water sources, and source water protection. The review includes cost, efficacy, and availability evaluations, focusing on distribution systems, intelligent systems, point-of-entry devices, and real-time monitoring. EPA is mandated to provide technical assistance and grants for public water systems serving fewer than 3,300 individuals. The AWIA Section 2019 authorizes $10.0 million in FY2019 for addressing water distribution systems, monitoring contaminants in real-time, and non-traditional water sources. GAO is required to report to Congress on duplicative state requirements for federal cross-cutting requirements. Small water systems lack technical expertise to apply for federal financial assistance for aging infrastructure. Compliance with federal cross-cutting requirements is burdensome for public water systems. Section 2020 of AWIA authorizes $100.0 million for grants to public water systems in disaster areas, providing additional subsidization regardless of disadvantaged status. Eligible systems serve disaster areas or underserved areas, with projects aimed at restoring or improving compliance with national drinking water standards. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program, authorized by the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects, including drinking water and wastewater projects. Puerto Rico is exempt from the 20% state-match requirement for funds received under this program. States must submit a supplemental intended use plan for access to these subsidies, which aim to improve compliance with national drinking water standards and expand service to underserved areas. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program provides credit assistance for water infrastructure projects, including drinking water and wastewater projects. WIFIA-financed projects generally do not need to be associated with SDWA compliance or public health goals. Projects eligible for WIFIA assistance must cost $20.0 million or more, with assistance generally not exceeding 49% of project costs. Congress appropriated funds for EPA's subsidy costs of WIFIA loans and administrative purposes. In FY2018, Congress provided $63.0 million for the EPA-administered WIFIA program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $55.0 million for WIFIA projects, with an estimated leverage of $5.50 billion in credit assistance. EPA began issuing loans in 2018. The Act also included $60.0 million for EPA's subsidy costs and $8.0 million for program administration. Section 4201 of AWIA removes the pilot designation from WIFIA, reauthorizes appropriations, and increases funding for administrative purposes. AWIA prohibits repayment of WIFIA assistance from federal grants for CWSRF and DWSRF. The AWIA authorizes an additional $5 million for WIFIA to provide credit assistance to state finance authorities for combined projects eligible for CWSRF and DWSRF funding. State financing authorities can use WIFIA assistance to cover 100% of project costs under certain conditions. The additional $5 million appropriation is contingent on CWSRF and DWSRF funding levels meeting specific criteria and EPA receiving at least $50 million in WIFIA appropriations. AWIA clarifies that state finance authorities cannot pass WIFIA application fees on to parties utilizing credit assistance. Projects now require only one letter of credit from rating agencies. EPA must review and approve WIFIA projects from state finance authorities within 180 days. EPA can enter agreements with other agencies to administer the WIFIA program. This may help prevent duplication of administrative functions. AWIA establishes the WaterSense program at EPA, similar to DOE's EnergyStar program, to promote water-efficient products and services. The program sets specifications for earning a WaterSense label, requiring products to reduce water use. The WaterSense program, established by AWIA at EPA, aims to promote water-efficient products and services by setting detailed performance criteria for water efficiency. EPA is required to review and update these criteria every six years. The program also includes oversight responsibilities for auditing the use of the WaterSense label and managing the accreditation process for certification bodies. EPA and DOE are directed to coordinate to prevent duplicative efforts. Section 2007 of AWIA directs EPA to administer a competitive grant program to accelerate the development of innovative water technology that addresses drinking water supply, quality, treatment, or security. Priority is given to projects that provide additional drinking water supplies with minimal environmental impact. Eligible grant recipients include research institutions, regional water organizations, and nonprofit organizations. The EPA administers a grant program for innovative water technology, with recipients including research institutions, water organizations, and nonprofits. Grants can be used for developing, testing, or deploying water technologies. The maximum award is $5.0 million per recipient. The program is authorized $10.0 million annually for FY2019 and FY2020. The AWIA passed by the 115th Congress includes amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act focusing on water infrastructure affordability and system improvements. The amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) focus on drinking water infrastructure affordability, compliance capacity, and sustainability. New competitive grant programs aim to help communities afford improvements for compliance with federal standards and protect public health. Other programs address sustainability, resiliency, lead in school drinking water, and response to contamination events. These revisions also aim to facilitate access to financial assistance through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). AWIA's DWSRF revisions authorize the use of funds for source water protection, financing flexibility for water systems, infrastructure replacement, and subsidies for disadvantaged communities. AWIA also expands water infrastructure assistance through revisions to the WIFIA program, allowing for broader project eligibility."
