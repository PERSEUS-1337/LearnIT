The agency must consult with stakeholders and government bodies, identify the need and legal authority for rulemaking, and explain the public need for preempting or regulating over local governments. The agency shall include a legal analysis in the preamble, identify regulatory alternatives considered, and select the alternative based on specific criteria. In rulemaking, agencies must provide detailed explanations for selecting adopted alternatives, estimate costs, and identify impacted entities and anticipated impacts. The agency must summarize any analysis or evaluation conducted under specific laws or provide an explanation if not done. They should estimate the direct and indirect benefits of the rule in monetary, quantified, or qualitative terms. The agency also needs to state if the rule was reviewed by an official in the Executive Office of the President.

The agency must describe any significant substantive changes made to the rule after the public comment period and review by officials in the Executive Office of the President. The agency must provide a reasoned statement on how the estimated benefits of the rule justify its costs and any other impacts, as required by law. If qualitative benefits are used to justify the agency's action, they must also be described. The agency may issue a rule without providing certain information if it finds good cause, stating reasons for the omission in the preamble and making efforts to provide the information before the rule's effective date. SEC. 4. PUBLIC NOTICE. Each agency must annually publish statistics in the Federal Register, including the number of proposed, interim final, and final rules, distinguishing discretionary rules from those mandated by law. The notice should also include the number of pages for each rule category and identify significant and major rules.

DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"agency\" is defined as per section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code, and \"rule\" as per section 551(4) of title 5, United States Code. A \"significant rule\" refers to any agency rulemaking action likely to have a substantial impact on the economy or interfere with actions of another agency.

The Act will become effective 90 days after its enactment."
