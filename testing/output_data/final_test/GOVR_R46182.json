    "content": "As Congress considers reforms for Social Security, there is a discussion on targeted enhancements for vulnerable groups like widows. Concerns about benefit adequacy and equity for widows have been raised due to reduced income after a spouse's death and potential medical expenses. Today's widows, who typically outlive men, face financial challenges. The report discusses benefit equity concerns for widows in Social Security, highlighting the disparity in benefits between one-earner and two-earner couples. It suggests providing equal benefits for equal contributions to address the changing marital and work patterns since the program's inception in the 1930s. Social Security provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers, their family members, and the family members of deceased workers. Workers need 40 earnings credits to become eligible for benefits. Policy levers may be modified to aid widows, with legislative proposals and literature highlighting projected effects on program solvency and distributional effects. Other reform options indirectly benefit widows. Monthly benefits for retired workers are based on career-average earnings, with full benefits available at the full retirement age (FRA). Spouses and widows of retired workers may receive spousal and survivor benefits, respectively, based on the retired worker's primary insurance amount (PIA). Benefits can be claimed as early as age 62 or delayed up to age 70 for increased credits. Survivor benefits for spouses and former spouses of fully insured deceased workers are subject to adjustments based on age, earnings, and Social Security benefit eligibility criteria. The surviving spouse must be aged 60 or older (or 50 with a qualifying disability) and must not have remarried before age 60 to receive benefits. Surviving spouses and divorced widows can receive survivor benefits at age 50 if disabled, or at age 60 if not disabled, based on the deceased worker's PIA. If eligible for both retirement and survivor benefits, the widow receives the higher amount. If a widow's own worker benefit is lower than the deceased spouse's worker benefit, she receives her own worker benefit plus a reduced widow benefit. Monthly benefits are adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. Widow benefits are payable in the month of the deceased spouse's death. The widow's benefit is influenced by both her claiming age and the deceased spouse's claiming age. A widow who claims at full retirement age receives 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA, while claiming before FRA results in reduced benefits. A widow claiming at age 60 or 50 (if disabled) receives 71.5% of the deceased worker's PIA. The widow's benefit is influenced by both her claiming age and the deceased spouse's claiming age. If the deceased worker claimed reduced benefits before the FRA, the widow benefit will be reduced as well. Conversely, if the deceased worker claimed benefits after the FRA, the widow benefit will increase. The widow receives the smaller of the two benefit amounts in cases of reduction. About 52.2% of nondisabled widow beneficiaries had their benefits reduced by claiming benefits before their own FRA. About 23.1% of widows had their benefits reduced because their deceased spouse claimed benefits before the FRA, and about 4.1% had their benefits reduced because both the widow and the deceased spouse claimed benefits early. The total survivor benefits paid are capped at 150% to 188% of the deceased worker's PIA. If benefits exceed this maximum, each person's benefit is reduced proportionately. Widows who claim benefits before the FRA and are working may face reductions due to the retirement earnings test and government pension offset. In December 2018, 3.91 million individuals received Social Security widow benefits. Social Security widow benefits account for 6.2% of all Social Security beneficiaries, with women making up 96.3% of widow beneficiaries. In December 2018, $5.26 billion was paid in widow benefits, with an average of $1,388 per month for nondisabled widows and $747.41 per month for disabled widows. Concerns have been raised about benefit adequacy and equity for widows receiving Social Security benefits. Benefits for widows are a concern due to potential income reduction after the spouse's death, high medical expenses, and unequal benefits for one-earner couples compared to two-earner couples. More equitable program rules are needed to ensure equal benefits for equal contributions. The widow's Social Security benefit may decrease significantly after the spouse's death, leading to potential financial challenges. Factors such as lost pension income, depleted assets from medical expenses, and increased life expectancy contribute to high poverty rates among widows. Concerns about the adequacy of Social Security benefits in widowhood persist, with varying benefit reductions depending on the relative earnings of the husband and wife. In a single-earner couple, spouse A receives a Social Security benefit of $1,770 per month, while spouse B receives a spouse benefit of $885 per month. The combined retirement benefit for the couple is $2,655. After the worker's death, the widow (spouse B) receives a widow benefit equal to 100% of the deceased worker's benefit. For a two-earner couple with equal earnings, their combined benefit is $2,240. Upon the death of spouse A in a two-earner couple with unequal earnings, spouse B continues to receive a worker benefit increased by the widow benefit to equal $1,770 per month, or 100% of the deceased worker's benefit. The widow's monthly benefit is 61% of the combined couple's benefit while both were alive (or a 39% reduction). The reduction in benefits upon the death of a spouse is based on the difference in consumption needs between a single person and a couple. Poverty thresholds for one-person and two-person families show that a single person needs less income to sustain the same standard of living as a couple. Social Security widow benefits may not be sufficient to sustain consumption, especially with reduced benefits and potential loss of private pension payments. Reforms have aimed to provide widows with continued pension payments, but at a reduced rate. Pension income for widows can decrease significantly, with few pensions offering cost-of-living adjustments. End-of-life medical expenses can deplete savings, especially for those in the lowest income bracket. Women generally live longer than men, leading to longer retirement periods. The remaining life expectancy at retirement has increased significantly across birth cohorts, with women projected to live longer than men. However, life expectancy gains are more pronounced for those in higher income brackets, leading to a growing gap in life expectancy by income. In 2017, a higher percentage of individuals aged 60 or older living below the federal poverty threshold were widows compared to the overall population. In 2017, among individuals aged 60 or older, widows had a poverty rate of 13.7%, compared to 9.5% for all individuals. Poverty rates were lower for those receiving Social Security benefits, but still relatively high for widows at 10.1%. Never-married individuals had the highest poverty rate among Social Security beneficiaries aged 60 or older at 19.8%. In 2017, older women, especially widows, had higher poverty rates than older men. Widowed women aged 60 or older had a poverty rate of 14.6%, compared to 10.5% for men. Receipt of Social Security benefits reduced poverty, but widows remained more vulnerable than widowers across all subgroups. The poverty statistics show that Social Security benefits reduce poverty overall and narrow the gap between widows and widowers. Young widows (aged 60-64) have a higher poverty rate (19.5%), while older widows (aged 75 or older) have moderately higher poverty rates (10%-11%). White, Asian, and non-Hispanic widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits have lower poverty rates (around 9%) compared to black and Hispanic widows (20.4% and 19.6%, respectively). Better-educated widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits have lower poverty rates. Among widows with any earnings in 2017, the poverty rate was 0.9%. In 2017, widows experienced a 35% to 40% income reduction upon their spouse's death, leading to increased poverty rates. A significant fraction of older adults living alone, including widows, have income above the poverty threshold but below long-term economic stability levels. Around 16.7% of widows aged 60 or older and 18.3% of widows aged 60 or older receiving Social Security benefits lived in near poverty in 2017. Changes in family structure and work patterns over the past 80 years are not reflected in current Social Security rules, leading to concerns about benefit equity. Some two-earner couples with higher earnings receive only slightly higher benefits than traditional one-earner couples. Spouses with no labor market earnings receive relatively generous benefits, resulting in traditional one-earner couples receiving higher benefits than two-earner couples with identical earnings. The examples in Table 6 show different scenarios of couples' earnings and Social Security benefits. Example 1 is a one-earner couple, Example 2 is a two-earner couple with lower benefits, and Example 3 is a two-earner couple with higher benefits. The current Social Security rules do not reflect changes in family structure and work patterns, leading to concerns about benefit equity. Researchers, advocates, and policymakers are exploring ways to modify Social Security benefits to help widows, such as adjusting policy levers like the fraction of the deceased worker's PIA received by the surviving spouse, credits for delayed claiming, benefits for disabled widows, and the lump-sum death benefit. Another approach is to create an alternative widow benefit based on a percentage of the couple's combined earnings. The alternative widow benefit is proposed as a percentage of the couple's combined Social Security benefits, with the widow receiving the higher amount between this alternative benefit and the current-law widow benefit. The widow(er)'s limit reduces the widow benefit by up to 17.5%, ensuring it does not exceed the deceased worker's reduced benefit amount. This aims to provide incentives for married workers to delay claiming Social Security benefits. The widow(er)'s limit reduces benefits for widows, affecting about 27% of Social Security nondisabled widow beneficiaries aged 65 or older. Eliminating this limit could increase total widow benefit payments by 5% and improve benefit adequacy for those experiencing the maximum 17.5% reduction. Eliminating the widow(er)'s limit could substantially improve benefit adequacy, with only 14% of increased payments going to widows in poverty and 40% to widows near poverty. Adjustments could target widows in or near poverty, but would affect fewer widows. Other options focus on cases where the worker dies before the FRA. This change would provide better survivor protection for widows under Social Security. Two bills, S. 345 and H.R. 4123, introduced in the 116th Congress aim to provide credits or increased benefits for widows who delay claiming or suspend receipt of benefits on their deceased spouse's work record. S. 345 proposes to increase benefits for widows based on delayed claiming or suspension beyond age 60, up to 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA. The bills S. 345 and H.R. 4123 in the 116th Congress aim to increase benefits for widows who delay claiming on their deceased spouse's work record. The proposed increase would be based on delayed claiming or suspension beyond age 60, up to 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA. Additionally, under H.R. 4123, monthly widow benefits would be further increased for those who delay claiming or suspend benefits beyond their FRA, up to age 70. The OCACT estimated that S. 3457 would worsen the Social Security program's actuarial balance by 0.02% of taxable payroll and benefit about 400,000 widow beneficiaries in 2018. H.R. 4123's effects are not available, but both bills aim to improve benefit adequacy for widows. Additionally, three bills in the 116th Congress would adjust parameters for disabled widow benefits. The bill aims to enhance eligibility for disabled widow benefits by removing age requirements and increasing benefits to 100% of the deceased spouse's PIA. This would impact about 600,000 widow beneficiaries and worsen the Social Security program's actuarial balance by 0.02% of taxable payroll. The bills H.R. 4122 and H.R. 4125 aim to improve benefit adequacy for disabled widows but do not address equity concerns with current-law widow benefits. The lump-sum death benefit for surviving spouses has remained at $255 since 1954, leading to a significant erosion in its real value over time. Various proposals have been suggested to modify or eliminate this benefit. Several proposals have been made to modify or eliminate the lump-sum death benefit, including increasing it. However, even a substantial increase would only provide partial relief for end-of-life expenses. An alternative approach is to calculate an alternative widow benefit as a percentage of the widow's own worker benefit. This would address adequacy concerns but not target those in poverty or alleviate equity concerns. The alternative widow benefit is proposed as a percentage of the widow's own worker benefit or the deceased spouse's PIA. It aims to increase benefit adequacy and equity, potentially capping the benefit to target low- and moderate-income widows. Current-law spouse benefits may be reduced to offset costs, and the widow's own worker benefit would be adjusted for claiming before the FRA. Some proposals include the spouse benefit in the calculation, while others focus solely on the widow's benefit. The alternative widow benefit aims to improve benefit adequacy and equity by using the widow's own worker benefit or the deceased spouse's PIA. It may eliminate the widow(er)'s limit and target low- and moderate-income widows. Some proposals include the spouse benefit in the calculation, while others focus solely on the widow's benefit. The alternative widow benefit calculation considers various scenarios for different types of couples, such as single-earner and two-earner couples, to determine the widow's benefit amount based on full retirement age claims. The alternative widow benefit proposal increases the widow's benefit amount for different types of couples, including those with unequal earnings. For example, in a two-earner couple scenario, the widow benefit would increase from 61% to 75% of the combined couple's benefit, with a smaller percentage increase compared to couples with equal earnings. The monthly widow benefit would also increase under the proposal. The alternative widow benefit proposal aims to improve benefits for different types of couples, with a focus on two-earner couples with equal earnings. Excluding the spouse benefit in the calculation could enhance benefit equity by allowing the widow's own worker benefit to contribute equally. However, without a cap, higher-earning couples would benefit the most. Imposing a cap on the alternative widow benefit could target increases to lower-income widows for better benefit adequacy. The alternative widow benefit proposal suggests setting a cap based on the PIA of a career average earner to improve benefit adequacy and equity without reducing benefits for anyone. This proposal could be applied to new and current widow beneficiaries without the need for a transition period. Changes to the Social Security program to offset the alternative widow benefit's cost could involve raising revenue (e.g., increasing payroll tax) or reducing costs (e.g., spouse benefits). Policymakers need to consider the exact formulation of the benefit to determine the most appropriate approach. Three bills in the 116th Congress include provisions for the alternative widow benefit, with financial effects estimated by OCACT. Further analysis is needed to refine formal proposals. OCACT updates alternative widow benefit estimates annually based on Trustees Report assumptions. The latest estimates reflect the 2019 Report and propose a benefit of 75% of the couple's combined worker benefits. Actuarial adjustments would apply to the widow's own benefit and the deceased spouse's PIA. The alternative widow benefit proposal would cap benefits based on a hypothetical worker's PIA, resulting in a 4% decrease in long-range actuarial balance. The changes are not significant enough to impact the year of reserve depletion, estimated to be 2035. Estimates from SSA's Office of Research show the proposal's distributional effects on current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older. The ORES MINT estimates from the 7 (MINT7) microsimulation model show changes in benefits, household income, and poverty for current-law beneficiaries aged 60 or older in 2030, 2050, and 2070. Among these beneficiaries, 8% will experience higher benefits under the alternative widow benefit proposal, with gains concentrated among those in poverty and the bottom two-fifths of the household income distribution. In 2030, beneficiaries aged 60 or older, especially those in poverty, will see a 17% median benefit increase under the alternative widow benefit proposal. The poverty rate is estimated to decrease by 10.2% among all beneficiaries in this age group. By 2070, 43% of current-law widow beneficiaries aged 60 or older are expected to receive a benefit increase, with gains concentrated among the lowest income quintiles. In 2070, gains relative to payable benefits are significantly larger compared to 2030 and 2050. The alternative widow benefit proposal has limitations as it requires a qualifying marital history to receive benefits, excluding never-married women with high poverty rates. Additionally, both members of a couple would need sufficient work history to qualify for benefits under this proposal. The alternative widow benefit proposal may not improve benefit adequacy for nonworking survivors in single-earner couples and could result in reduced or lost Supplemental Security Income payments for some widows, leading to lost eligibility for other means-tested programs. Policymakers should consider offsets or exclusions to prevent loss of eligibility. Other proposed policy changes could benefit widows who are part of targeted groups. The Special Minimum Benefit (SMB) for workers with many years of low earnings is based on years of coverage, not lifetime earnings. In December 2018, 35,505 beneficiaries received the SMB, with an average monthly benefit of over $900. A worker needs at least 11 years of coverage to qualify for the SMB, and the maximum benefit is obtained with 30 years of coverage. Proposals to enhance the SMB aim to increase retirement income and reduce poverty among older women and widows. Some proposals aim to reform the Special Minimum Benefit (SMB) to help a larger group of workers with low earnings and substantial work histories. Suggestions include tying the SMB to wage growth, reducing the earnings required for coverage, allowing partial years of coverage, and linking the SMB amount to a fraction of the federal poverty threshold. However, concerns are raised that workers with shorter careers are at higher risk of poverty in old age and may not benefit from these reforms. Options to address this group include creating a new basic minimum benefit or revising the Social Security benefit formula to increase benefits for low earners and improve progressivity. Older women and widows are particularly affected by these proposals. Recent research suggests that women's labor force participation patterns are changing, with higher employment levels early in life, delayed motherhood, and longer work lives. The fraction of women quitting their jobs around childbirth has decreased, while paid leave uptake has increased. Cohorts of women born in the 1950s and later are expected to have more work experience and higher earnings. Divorced individuals can claim Social Security benefits if the marriage lasted at least 10 years. Divorced spouses are entitled to the same benefits as married spouses, but a higher percentage of divorced individuals aged 60 or older are in poverty. The poverty rate among divorced individuals aged 60 or older was 17.6% in 2017, with a higher rate among divorced women. Studies show an increase in the number of divorced women aged 50-69 not eligible for Social Security benefits due to shorter marriages. The age of first marriage has increased since the 1950s, while divorce rates doubled in the 1960s-1970s. Reducing the duration-of-marriage requirement for benefits has been suggested to alleviate poverty among this group. Increasing life expectancy has led to a greater reliance on Social Security benefits, especially among low-income divorced widows with shorter marriages. Poverty rates among older women also increase with age, with young widows aged 60-64 facing even higher rates. The poverty rate is higher among young widows aged 60-64. Proposals include increasing Social Security benefits for low-income beneficiaries and providing a delayed annuity for older beneficiaries below a minimum benefit level. Increasing benefits by 5% for beneficiaries aged 85 or older could reduce poverty. Proposals to enhance Social Security benefits for older beneficiaries, such as the Consumer Price Index for Americans 62 years and older (CPI-E) and providing earnings credits for caregiving responsibilities, could benefit widows who have taken time out of the workforce to care for children or elderly parents. Women are more likely than men to experience workforce interruptions while raising children, with lower labor force participation rates for mothers compared to fathers. Women caregivers, especially mothers with children aged 6 to 17, are more likely than men to provide care, spend more hours caregiving, and are less likely to be in the labor force. Options to support caregivers include providing dropout years for Social Security benefits, earnings credits tied to caregiving years, and supplementing benefits for caregivers in low-income households. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 provided paid parental leave for certain federal employees. Employer provision of paid family leave in the private sector is voluntary, with only 18% of private-industry employees having access to it. Five states have active programs for paid family leave, with four more in development. Five states currently have active programs for paid family leave, with four more programs awaiting implementation. Several bills in the 116th Congress aim to establish a national paid family leave program, potentially through the Social Security program."
