    "content": "SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS. Health care business is defined as any entity primarily offering facilities and services for diagnosis or treatment of injury, disease, surgical, drug treatment, psychiatric, or obstetric care. This includes general or specialized hospitals and ambulatory services. The curr_chunk describes various types of health care institutions, including ancillary ambulatory, emergency, surgical treatment facilities, hospices, home health agencies, and long-term care facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and domiciliary care facilities. The curr_chunk defines a 'patient' as any person receiving services from a health care business. The curr_chunk expands the definition of 'patient' to include any written document or electronic record related to a patient. The curr_chunk focuses on the disposal of patient records. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for the disposal of patient records by a health care business in case of bankruptcy under chapter 7, 9, or 11 of title 11, United States Code. If the trustee lacks funds for storage as required by law, they must request permission from appropriate Federal or State agencies to deposit the records with them. If no agency agrees within 60 days, the trustee must take alternative action. The trustee must publish notice and attempt to notify patients directly regarding the claiming or disposing of patient records if they are not claimed within 60 days after notification. The trustee must destroy unclaimed patient records within 90 days by shredding or burning written records, or destroying electronic records so they cannot be retrieved. Title 11, United States Code, amended to include a new section after section 350. SEC. 3 amends Section 503(b) of title 11, United States Code to include actual costs of closing a health care business, such as disposing of patient records. SEC. 4 appoints an ombudsman to act as a patient advocate. The court appoints an ombudsman to represent patients' interests in health care businesses under chapter 7, 9, or 11 of title 11, United States Code. The ombudsman monitors patient care quality, reports to the court every 60 days, and advocates for patients. The ombudsman appointed by the court monitors patient care quality in health care businesses under chapter 7, 9, or 11 of title 11, United States Code. If the ombudsman finds a significant decline in patient care, they must notify the court immediately. Patient-related information obtained by the ombudsman is kept confidential. The appointment of an ombudsman under section 331 is amended in terms of compensation. The ombudsman's role is to monitor patient care quality in healthcare businesses under specific chapters of the United States Code. If a decline in patient care is found, the court must be notified promptly. In section 704(a) of title 11, United States Code, amendments are made to ensure the transfer of patients from a closing healthcare business to a similar one nearby with reasonable quality of care. This is to be done with all reasonable efforts. Section 1106(a)(1) of title 11, United States Code, is amended to include \"704(10)\" in addition to \"704(9)\"."
