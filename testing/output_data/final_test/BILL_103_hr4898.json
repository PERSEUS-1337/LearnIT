    "content": "SECTION 1. PROCEDURES AT TIME OF BIRTH. The amendment to Section 466(a)(5)(C) of the Social Security Act requires birthing centers to follow the same procedures as hospitals for paternity establishment. This includes using the same materials, providing training to personnel, and requesting the father's name and social security number at the time of admission for the birth certificate. The Social Security Act now requires birthing centers to include parents' names and social security numbers on a child's birth certificate. SEC. 2. PATERNITY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AFFIDAVITS. Establishment of National Affidavit and Signed Affidavit Conclusively Used to Establish Paternity under the Social Security Act, allowing for a written voluntary acknowledgement of paternity to create a legal finding without further action or through a court or administrative agency. The Congress encourages States to develop procedures in public hospitals and clinics to facilitate the acknowledgement of paternity within a specific time frame after genetic testing is conducted. AFDC benefits are dependent on cooperation in establishing paternity. Section 402(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to state that aid under the State plan shall not be payable to a family applying for aid with respect to a dependent child whose paternity has not been established, unless certain conditions are met. This includes cases where the child was conceived as a result of rape or incest, or if efforts to establish paternity would result in physical danger to the relative claiming such aid. The amended Section 402(a) of the Social Security Act specifies that aid under the State plan will be payable to a family if the paternity of a dependent child has not been established, under certain conditions. If the relative claiming aid alleges potential fathers and the State does not disprove it, the family will receive aid and be eligible for medical assistance. The burden of proving paternity lies with the relative claiming aid. The amended Section 402(a) of the Social Security Act allows for proving paternity of a dependent child by a deceased individual, following State-established procedures. SEC. 4 amends the Social Security Act to increase the paternity establishment percentage based on the State's performance. SEC. 5 focuses on prenatal establishment efforts by States. Section 466(a)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act is amended to require State officers to inform unmarried pregnant women that they must identify the prospective father to be eligible for aid, and to encourage the woman to have the father acknowledge paternity."
