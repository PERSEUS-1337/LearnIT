Sagebrush habitat in the West is shrinking and fragmenting due to various factors like urbanization, climate change, and energy development, posing challenges for species like sage grouse. The Endangered Species Act is often controversial due to competition for resources between humans and listed species. Sagebrush habitat is shrinking due to urbanization, climate change, and energy development, impacting species like sage grouse. Various petitions have been filed under the ESA to protect different populations of sage grouse, with the Fish and Wildlife Service proposing listing the Gunnison grouse as endangered in 2013. The ESA aims to prevent extinction of plants and animals. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to protect plants and animals from extinction by creating a list of endangered and threatened species. It prohibits taking these species and destroying their critical habitats. The decision to list a species is based on criteria such as habitat loss, over-harvesting, disease, and regulatory protection. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) manages most species under the ESA. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is responsible for determining whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). FWS relies on scientific and commercial data to make this decision, and may list a species independently or in response to a citizen petition. Deadlines are imposed by statute for FWS to make decisions on petitions, with a final decision required within one year of the 12-month notice. FWS may also determine that a listing is \"warranted but precluded\" due to limited resources. The ESA authorizes listing distinct population segments (DPS) of vertebrates, which are portions of a species separated by genetic and range distinctions. To be designated a DPS, a population must be discrete and significant. Species with a warranted but precluded determination are ranked based on priority for listing, with each species given a listing priority number (LPN) by FWS. The FWS assigns a listing priority number (LPN) to species, indicating the importance of listing for their survival. The lower the number, the higher the priority. The ESA does not restrict activities for species with a warranted but precluded determination. The Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) policy encourages nonfederal landowners to protect vulnerable species. The Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) policy incentivizes nonfederal landowners to manage their property to benefit vulnerable species before they are listed under the ESA. The goal is to prevent the need for listing by improving land management practices, with the assurance that federal policy changes will not impose additional burdens on cooperating landowners. The Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) policy incentivizes landowners to manage their property for the benefit of vulnerable species. In exchange, the Fish and Wildlife Service issues incidental take permits, excusing landowners from prosecution if their actions harm a listed species. The sage grouse is a large North American game bird with a low reproductive rate, making it difficult for populations to recover from low numbers quickly. Sage grouse have a low reproductive rate and struggle to recover from low numbers quickly. They feed on sage leaves, other plants, and insects, with young grouse relying on insects for growth. Male grouse gather in leks in open sagebrush areas to attract females with elaborate displays. Female sage grouse choose mates at leks, then nest alone. They are vulnerable to habitat changes like grazing and development, facing threats from predators and invasive species. Grouse escape predators through concealment or short flights. Cheatgrass is a major threat to sagebrush habitat, spreading quickly after grazing or road development. The increase in fires in sage grouse habitat over the past decade is concerning, with drought and climate change exacerbating cheatgrass invasion. Development activities like coal bed methane production introduce standing water, attracting mosquitoes that can carry diseases. The West Nile Virus is a fatal threat to sage grouse, with the virus reported in their habitats across multiple states. Fragmented habitats and human activities like transmission lines pose additional dangers to the grouse population. Sage grouse, once abundant in 16 states, now only inhabit parts of 11 states due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The sage grouse's current range spans 11 states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, and California. The population has declined significantly, with estimates ranging from 69% to 99% from historic times. Habitat loss, primarily due to fragmentation, is a major threat to the species' viability. Only two areas in the range provide sufficient intact sagebrush habitat, both of which are heavily fragmented and projected to experience further fragmentation. The sage grouse's habitat is heavily fragmented and facing further fragmentation, leading to population declines and local extirpations. The genus Centrocercus includes two recognized species: the Gunnison grouse and the sage grouse. The understanding of relationships among these birds has expanded in recent years. The American Ornithological Union (AOU) recognized a second species, the Gunnison grouse, in the genus Centrocercus, which includes the sage grouse. Some argue for recognition of subspecies and distinct populations for protection under the ESA, but the FWS generally does not recognize proposed subspecies. The AOU stopped distinguishing categories below the species level in 1983, making it challenging to determine taxonomic distinctions at the subspecies level. In 2004, FWS found substantial evidence to list the sage grouse, but in 2005, listing was deemed unwarranted. The decision was challenged, leading to a court ruling that FWS did not use the best science as required by the ESA. The sage grouse was found to be warranted for listing in 2010, but precluded by higher priorities. In 2010, FWS determined that listing the greater sage grouse was warranted but precluded by higher priorities. FWS assigned the species a listing priority number of 8. In 2011, a court settlement required FWS to make a decision on listing the sage grouse by the end of FY2015. Despite legal challenges, the court upheld FWS's decision process as not arbitrary or capricious. Scientists later identified the sage grouse in the Four Corners area as a distinct species. In the Four Corners area, scientists identified the Gunnison grouse as a separate species from the sage grouse due to differences in size, markings, behaviors, breeding habits, and genetic distinctiveness. The AOU recognized the Gunnison grouse as Centrocercus minimus in 2000, and the International Ornithological Congress named them \"Gunnison grouse\" in 2006. This species is now confined to seven states. The Gunnison grouse is now limited to seven populations in Colorado and a few birds in Utah, representing only 7% of its historic range. The majority of the population is in the Gunnison Basin, with smaller populations serving as a genetic diversity reserve. Populations have declined, but the extent is uncertain. In 2000, citizen organizations petitioned for the Gunnison grouse to be listed as a candidate species. The Gunnison grouse was designated as a candidate species, with listing determined to be warranted but delayed due to resource constraints. Legal actions were taken to push for a listing decision, resulting in a determination in 2013 to propose the species as endangered. The Institute for Wildlife Protection petitioned to list an eastern subspecies of sage grouse under the ESA, but FWS found no evidence of a distinct population segment. A western subspecies of sage grouse was recognized in 1957, with differences in appearance but no genetic distinction from other sage grouse. The subspecies designation is now considered \"invalid\" by ITIS. The Institute for Wildlife Protection petitioned to list an eastern subspecies of sage grouse under the ESA, but FWS found no evidence of a distinct population segment. A western subspecies of sage grouse was recognized in 1957, with differences in appearance but no genetic distinction from other sage grouse. ITIS now considers the subspecies designation \"invalid.\" Populations in northern California and western Nevada are thought to represent an intermediate form between the proposed western and eastern subspecies of sage grouse. The question of the validity of a western subspecies was not litigation-free. In 2003, in response to a petition to list a western subspecies, and after suit was filed to compel a response, FWS issued a statement. In response to a petition to list a western subspecies of sage grouse, FWS issued a 90-day finding stating there was not enough evidence to support the subspecies designation. The Ninth Circuit later deemed this finding arbitrary and capricious. FWS reconsidered the subspecies listing in 2010 but ultimately concluded that the evidence did not support recognition of a western subspecies. The remaining sage grouse in the Columbia River Basin were designated as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) by FWS in 2001, totaling around 1,000 birds in two populations in Washington. The Columbia River Basin DPS consists of two subpopulations in Washington, with roughly 650 birds in Douglas County and 350 birds at the U.S. Army Yakima Training Center. The sage grouse population has significantly declined from historic levels, with estimates showing a decrease of 66% to 99%. Despite being considered for listing, FWS gave the DPS a low priority due to species in more urgent need of protection. In 2002, the Columbia River Basin sage grouse population was considered at risk due to threats from military training and encroaching agricultural lands. Despite the threats not being imminent, the population's priority was raised from 9 to 6. In 2012, the population was designated as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) with a low priority number of 6. The decision on whether to list the Columbia River Basin DPS was to be made by the end of FY2015. Some groups argue that the sage grouse population near Mono Lake may also constitute a DPS. The Bi-State population near Mono Lake in California and Nevada was initially referred to as the Mono Basin population. In 2006, it was designated as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) due to genetic differences. Despite this, the decision to list the population under the Endangered Species Act was not made after considering various criteria. In 2010, the Bi-State DPS was determined to warrant listing but was precluded with an LPN of 3, indicating higher priority. The LPN remained 3 in 2012, and a decision on listing was to be made by the end of FY2013. Consideration for listing includes the adequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms and conservation programs at various levels. The federal role in managing sage grouse and Gunnison grouse is limited until the species is listed under federal law. The Bureau of Land Management manages a significant amount of sagebrush habitat, with efforts to accelerate development for energy projects creating conflicts. Special status species under BLM policy include sage grouse and Gunnison grouse. The Bureau of Land Management manages sage grouse and Gunnison grouse as special status species to minimize the need for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The policy aims to conserve and recover ESA-listed species and their ecosystems, aligning closely with statutory obligations. This marks a shift from previous policy language that included additional responsibilities for protecting at-risk species. The Bureau of Land Management's policy aims to prevent the need for listing special status species under the Endangered Species Act. The new language allows BLM to prioritize management of sensitive species based on various factors, including financial resources. The policy is applied in BLM land use planning, with goals for conservation efforts and public participation. The Habitat Conservation Strategy aligns with existing laws like the ESA and Federal Land Policy. It aims to harmonize BLM land use planning for sagebrush habitat. Additionally, the Gunnison Sage Grouse Conservation Plan was developed to increase the population of the grouse in phases over 15 years, starting in 2005. The plan involves multiple stakeholders in the area. The FWS found that BLM policies did not provide sufficient protection for the sage grouse, especially in the area of energy development. BLM's inconsistent application of authorities was exacerbating threats to the species, leading FWS to reject relying on BLM's policies to avoid listing the species under the ESA. The District Court for Idaho has also ruled that BLM does not adhere to its own laws for protecting the bird. The District Court for Idaho has found that BLM does not follow its own laws for protecting the sage grouse in resource management plans and grazing permit renewals. This raises concerns about the adequacy of BLM's policies in providing sufficient protection for the species, potentially impacting the need for additional federal protection under the ESA. The court supported BLM's fire management amendments to resource management plans, finding that BLM adequately considered impacts on sage grouse. Energy development in the Powder River Basin was challenged for not considering adverse effects on sage grouse and prairie dogs. The court held that BLM's system of developing a programmatic environmental impact statement was adequate. In 2010, the District Court for the District of Columbia also found that BLM adequately considered sage grouse impacts from oil and gas development in southwest Wyoming. The Forest Service, although managing less sage grouse habitat, includes sagebrush in its grazing lands. The Forest Service has a Sensitive Species Policy to protect species showing a decline in population or habitat. They aim to prevent species from becoming threatened or endangered due to their actions. The policy also aligns with Department of Agriculture regulations to avoid actions that may harm species. However, the impact of the policy on sage grouse protection is uncertain according to the FWS. The Forest Service's Sensitive Species Policy aims to protect species at risk, but its impact on sage grouse protection is uncertain. FWS found insufficient information to evaluate the efficacy of Forest Service policies on sage grouse habitat protection. Some states list sage grouse as a game species but have conservation plans in place to prevent further population declines. Washington lists the bird as threatened, while also allowing hunting. Other states like California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming, and Montana have conservation plans in place. The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) has addressed sage grouse health and signed Memoranda of Understanding with federal agencies. Some local governments have taken conservation measures to avoid potential restrictions on land use. Discussions of state and local conservation plans are included in the report. The goal of a conservation agreement like a CCAA with FWS is to provide protection for a species to avoid federal listing. Courts look for enforceable protections, sufficient measures to maintain populations, and existing plans for protection. Challenges to listing decisions have not deemed voluntary state actions as enough to prevent federal listing. The Ninth Circuit found that federal land in the grizzly bear's range made the voluntary state measures sufficient for removal from the threatened species list. Adequacy of measures is determined by their ability to maintain populations without the need for listing. Size of protected areas and types of measures taken are factors considered by courts. The Northern District of California found that state plans for steelhead trout were voluntary and not sufficient to prevent further decline. The federal plan only covered 64% of habitat. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a plan for grizzly bears, with force of law on federal lands, was adequate as federal lands constituted 98% of the grizzly's primary conservation area. Courts require regulatory mechanisms to be in place, not future or speculative, with a two-year record for conservation agreements to be sufficient. The loss of habitat in sagebrush territory due to development, fire threats, and climate change poses a risk of extinction for sage grouse. Despite petitions and litigation, the listing of sage grouse and Gunnison grouse under the ESA has been warranted but precluded. States are taking action to protect sage grouse to prevent listing that could hinder development in the western United States. Congressional pushes for energy development may impact conservation efforts. The state of Wyoming is implementing a policy to protect sage grouse in Core Population Areas from conflicting with energy development, including oil, gas, wind farms, and solar collectors. The policy aims to direct energy production to areas with high yields and low sage grouse populations, while also approving certain energy corridors through core habitat areas with established construction dates. The state of Wyoming is implementing a policy to protect sage grouse in Core Population Areas from conflicting with energy development. Construction within established dates is allowed in habitat areas. Wyoming has no general description of its sage grouse plan under the 2013 Sage Grouse Executive Order, but has published FAQs. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department determines if a project complies with the SGEO and may provide recommendations on minimizing impacts to the bird. The proponent should complete the Density and Disturbance Calculation Tool review process again if there are changes to the project. Suitable sage grouse habitat is defined. Suitable sage-grouse habitat is defined as areas within the mapped occupied range with 5% or greater sagebrush canopy cover, riparian or wet meadow habitats within 275 meters of sagebrush, reclaimed habitat with native grasses and forbs, or areas with specific vegetation criteria. The grass/forb habitat should be at least 60 meters away from 5% or greater sagebrush cover. Transitional sage-grouse habitat must have a minimum of 5% sagebrush canopy cover with associated grasses and forbs by 2021. Surface disturbance includes anthropogenic development activities or wildfire events that remove sagebrush vegetation or sage-grouse habitat. Linear features like wind turbines, power lines, and pipelines are exempt from DDCT calculations. De minimis activities exempt from plan requirements include existing animal husbandry and farming practices, recognized grazing operations, construction of small reservoirs, and drilling of water wells beyond a certain distance from leks. The construction activities allowed within 0.6 miles from leks include water tanks, windmills, solar water pumps, agricultural and residential electrical distribution lines, agricultural water pipelines, and pole fences with specific requirements such as escape ramps, raptor perching deterrents, and visibility markers. Construction activities allowed near leks include water tanks, windmills, solar water pumps, electrical distribution lines, water pipelines, and pole fences with specific requirements. Other permitted activities include irrigation, spring development, herbicide use, road maintenance, cultural resource surveys, and emergency response. Core population areas defined in 2011 differ from those mapped in 2008. The stipulations regarding activities concerning sage grouse are complex and include general and industry-specific guidelines. These guidelines aim to preserve suitable sage-grouse habitat while allowing development in core areas without causing population declines. Specific industry stipulations supplement the general guidelines, with detailed information provided in Attachment B of the governor's executive order. The Gunnison grouse's range is in the Gunnison Basin. The Gunnison grouse's range is in the Gunnison Basin in western Colorado and eastern Utah. Conservation plans at various levels address threats such as habitat loss, low genetic diversity, and impacts of urban development. The most significant threat is the permanent loss of sagebrush habitat. In 2005, a Rangewide Conservation Plan was completed to address these issues. The conservation plan for the Gunnison sage grouse aims to protect their habitats by addressing threats like habitat loss, grazing management, wildfires, and impacts from mining and energy production. In Colorado, the species is not listed as threatened or endangered but is considered a game bird with conservation agreements in place. The Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) for the Gunnison grouse aims to protect their habitat on private lands to prevent listing as endangered. Participating landowners will implement conservation measures outlined in the Rangewide Conservation Plan, including modifying grazing practices and habitat improvement. The CCAA provides regulatory assurances and security for landowners against incidental takes. The Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) for the Gunnison grouse provides security for landowners against future land use restrictions if the species is listed under the ESA. Colorado will also take conservation steps, such as monitoring predators and managing recreational uses. Local efforts in Gunnison County include legislation addressing habitat issues. The 2007 resolution addressed various activities that could disturb the Gunnison Sage-Grouse, including domestic pets, lighting, noise, recreation, fencing, utility lines, and land use projects. It added maps for Gunnison Sage-Grouse Lek and Occupied Habitat to be considered for Land Use Change Permit applications. The lek map shows private lands within 0.6 miles of known leks, while the Occupied Habitat map defines suitable habitat used by the grouse in the last 10 years. The county adopted the Gunnison Basin Sage-Grouse Strategic Plan in 2009, which references the Rangewide Conservation Plan as the primary document for conservation efforts. The county requires land use change permits for projects within a 0.60-mile radius of a Gunnison Sage-grouse lek. Projects impacting wildlife will be referred to CDOW for consultation. Construction and recreational activities will be limited during mating, nesting, or brood rearing. Conservation easements must mitigate adverse impacts to satisfy county law."
