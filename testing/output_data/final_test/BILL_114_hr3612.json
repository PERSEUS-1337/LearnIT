The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas faces challenges due to the high caseload of border-related crimes, particularly at the Wood Courthouse in San Antonio, which lacks adequate security features and is in disrepair, jeopardizing human health and safety. The Wood Courthouse in San Antonio, originally built for the 1968 World's Fair, has undergone multiple renovations to accommodate the increasing number of judges and staff. The workload of the Western District has grown due to a rise in criminal cases, including drug trafficking and gang activity along the border. The courthouse's inadequate security features pose a risk to human health and safety. The Wood Courthouse in San Antonio lacks adequate security features, exposing judges, marshals, staff, and jurors to defendants charged with violent crimes. Concerns include inadequate vehicle gates, substandard cell block doors, lack of fencing, and a deficient intrusion detection system. The Wood Courthouse in San Antonio has serious security lapses, including inadequate segregation of prisoners, limited space for attorney-client meetings, insufficient operations area for deputy marshals, and obsolete equipment in the control room. This compromises the safety of judges, staff, and jurors who often encounter criminal defendants in the corridors. The Wood Courthouse in San Antonio has serious security issues, including inadequate prisoner segregation, limited space for attorney-client meetings, and obsolete equipment. The 1968 theatre design of the building cannot be reconfigured to address security problems. Environmental contamination and deteriorated drinking water facilities pose urgent public health concerns, with high levels of lead and bacteria found in the building's drinking water sources. Water sampling revealed that 7 out of 25 samples had unacceptable levels of lead, 2 samples had high levels of iron, and 3 samples had high levels of bacteria. The Federal Occupational Health office confirmed that 8 water fountains or faucets were unacceptable due to lead, iron, or both. Lead is toxic and can cause health issues in adults and developmental delays in children. The source of contamination in the Wood Courthouse is unknown, but tests show the drinking water source is not contaminated. Contamination may be from pipes within the building or connecting to the underground water main. The Wood Courthouse has serious HVAC deficiencies with 14 air handlers, some of which are broken or original equipment from 1968 or 1975. The thermostats have not worked for over 4 years, causing wild temperature fluctuations. Leaking pipes in the crawl space below the courthouse lead to water accumulation, impacting the building's air quality with mold from the air handlers and duct systems. The Wood Courthouse is impacted by mold in the air handlers and duct systems, with exposed electrical wires in the crawl space. There is a lack of proper ventilation systems, posing a risk of infection for prisoners with airborne diseases. Federal branches agree that a new courthouse should replace the Wood Courthouse to ensure justice is served effectively. The Wood Courthouse is in need of replacement to ensure justice is served effectively and to protect the safety and health of all involved in Federal judicial matters. Emergency appropriations of $135,000,000 are designated for the construction of a new courthouse for the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The funds may be derived from the Assets Forfeiture Fund and the Federal Buildings Fund, as designated by Congress as an emergency requirement. Additionally, a real property exchange is mentioned in the following section. The courthouse construction funded by $135,000,000 for the United States District Court in Texas will involve a property exchange between federally owned land and city-owned land in San Antonio. The exchange will include the Wood Courthouse, Spears Judicial Training Center, and the San Antonio Police Headquarters Site. The Administrator of General Services must submit a progress report on the implementation of sections 2 and 3 of the Act to Congress within 6 months of its enactment."
