    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The commission is required to develop and administer the California Advanced Services Fund program to promote high-quality advanced communications services for all Californians, aiming to provide broadband access to at least 98 percent of households by December 31, 2015. The commission prioritizes infrastructure projects for last-mile broadband access to unserved households. Applicants can demonstrate actual broadband service levels in the project area. Accounts within the fund include Broadband Infrastructure Grant, Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant, Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan, and Broadband Public Housing. The Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account receives $10 million from the surcharge collected by the commission. Interest earned on the fund is also deposited back into the fund. The commission can collect up to $315 million by imposing a surcharge, with a limit of $100 million before January 1, 2011, and an additional $215 million after that date. The collection of the additional sum is capped at $25 million per year from 2011 to 2020, unless a higher amount is deemed necessary. All funds in the California Advanced Services Fund are available to the commission for the program, including development and administration costs. Entities eligible for funding under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 can apply for the program administered by the commission. Incumbent local exchange carriers regulated under a rate of return structure can recover California infrastructure investments for broadband and voice services not covered by grant funds. Entities eligible for funding under the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 can apply to provide broadband access to unserved or underserved households through the commission's program. Eligibility requirements include providing last-mile broadband access to households without existing broadband providers and complying with program requirements. The commission's program for providing broadband access to underserved households includes requirements for existing providers to upgrade services before new funding is approved. Applicants must demonstrate actual levels of broadband service in the project area, and local governmental agencies are eligible for infrastructure grants only if no other eligible entity applied for the project. The commission will establish a service list for interested parties to be notified of California Advanced Services Fund applications. Moneys in the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account will be available for grants to eligible consortia for broadband deployment activities, excluding capital costs. Eligible consortia may include representatives from various organizations and are not required to have a specific lead fiscal agent. The Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account provides financing for broadband facilities not funded by grants. The commission sets interest rates based on market surveys. Terms like \"publicly subsidized\" refer to housing developments receiving financial assistance from various sources. A \"publicly supported community\" is a multifamily housing development owned by a public housing agency or a nonprofit organization that has received public funding to subsidize housing for low-income residents. The Broadband Public Housing Account allows grants and loans for publicly supported communities to connect to broadband networks. Up to $20 million is available for this purpose, with eligibility contingent on not denying access to willing broadband providers. The Broadband Public Housing Account provides up to $5 million for grants and loans to publicly supported communities to increase broadband adoption rates. Communities must have access to broadband services or will have access when funding is implemented. They can also contract with nonprofit or public agencies for assistance. Projects for funding will be approved in a way that reflects the statewide distribution of publicly supported communities. When reviewing project applications, the commission considers funding availability, contributions from broadband providers, other public or private programs, and applicant participation in available programs. Match funding may be required, but funding won't be denied solely for receiving funds from another source. The commission will transfer $20 million from the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account and $5 million from the Broadband Revolving Loan Account to the Broadband Public Housing Account for funding purposes. Any unawarded funds in the Broadband Public Housing Account by December 31, 2016, will be transferred back to the respective accounts. Transfers will only occur if the commission can collect funds exceeding the total amount authorized. The commission will conduct financial and performance audits of the California Advanced Services Fund to ensure proper fund usage and effectiveness. Interim findings will be reported to the Legislature by April 1, 2011, and April 1, 2017, with final findings due by April 1, 2021. The reports will also include updates on broadband maps and job creation data. The reporting requirement will be inactive after January 1, 2022. The commission will submit a report to the Legislature annually starting from January 1, 2012, detailing the funds spent from the California Advanced Services Fund, recipients of the funds, geographic regions affected, expected benefits, broadband adoption levels, and use of funds to match federal funds. The California Advanced Services Fund will provide updates on expenditures and broadband adoption levels, as well as the status of the fund balance and projected collections through 2020. A report must be submitted in compliance with government codes, with a deadline of January 1, 2021. This act is deemed urgent for the preservation of public peace, health, or safety. The Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account requires immediate funding to continue broadband deployment activities. Deployment could cease if funding is not made available soon."
