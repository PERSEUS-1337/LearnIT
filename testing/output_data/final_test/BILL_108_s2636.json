    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anti-phishing Act of 2004\". Congress finds that American society is increasingly dependent on the Internet for various purposes. To ensure the Internet remains trustworthy, users should be able to trust the origin of communications and hyperlinks. Internet users are vulnerable to scams like phishing, which can lead to financial loss and identity theft. Phishing scams involve false e-mail return addresses, stolen graphics, and other tactics to trick users into revealing personal information. This information is then used to create fake identification documents or unlawfully obtain money or property, victimizing individuals and the online community. SEC. 3. CRIMINAL OFFENSE. Sec. 1351 of Chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, addresses internet fraud. It prohibits creating a fake website or domain name to deceive individuals into providing personal information, punishable by fines or imprisonment up to five years. The section prohibits fraudulent activities related to identity theft and online scams, including falsely representing a legitimate business, linking to fake websites, and soliciting personal information. Violators may face fines or imprisonment for up to five years. The Trademark Act of 1946 defines terms related to internet and electronic mail messages, including 'Internet', 'electronic mail message', 'initiate', 'procure', and 'recipient'. The term 'recipient' is defined in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 'Internet information location tool' is defined in the Communications Act of 1934, and 'means of identification' is defined in section 1028 of title 18. The chapter analysis for chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include these definitions. \"1351. Internet fraud\" is a section in the United States Code related to online fraudulent activities."
