    "content": "The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology was established in 1986 by the White House OSTP. It emphasizes regulating GE products based on their characteristics, not production method. Three lead agencies involved are APHIS, FDA, and EPA. APHIS oversees importation regulations. APHIS regulates the importation, interstate movement, and field testing of GE plants and organisms that are or might be plant pests under the Plant Protection Act of 2000. GE plants that are or might be plant pests are considered \"regulated articles\" under APHIS regulations. Authorization must be obtained prior to import, interstate movement, or environmental release, including field testing. The USDA published rules under the PPA to regulate outdoor uses of transgenic plants, finalized in June 1987. The regulations cover plants engineered with DNA sequences from certain genera to prevent pest risks. Developers need APHIS authorization for introducing regulated plants into the environment. Developers follow APHIS guidance on testing and movements to ensure that genetically engineered (GE) plants do not pose risks to agriculture, human health, or the environment. GE crops are typically developed under the notification option, which is less rigorous than permitting. After a GE variety is approved for trial release, developers petition APHIS for \"deregulated status\" to commercialize the plant. Once deregulated, the GE plant is no longer regulated by APHIS. The deregulation process involves assessing the plant's environmental impact, including impacts on the human environment. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to prepare a detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The \"human environment\" includes socioeconomic impacts. Agencies may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) if unsure of the significance of environmental impacts. Based on the review, the agency may decide an EIS is needed or issue a \"finding of no significant impact\" (FONSI). Monsanto Corporation petitioned APHIS for deregulated status for herbicide-tolerant GE alfalfa and sugar beet varieties. In 2004 and 2005, Monsanto petitioned APHIS for deregulation of Roundup Ready alfalfa and sugar beet. APHIS conducted environmental assessments for both crops, which were challenged in lawsuits for being inadequate. Alfalfa is a major crop in the US, harvested annually on nearly 23 million acres. Alfalfa is a widely grown crop in the US, mainly in the West and Midwest states. It is primarily used for livestock feed, with some also grown for seed production. Weed management is a significant concern for alfalfa producers, and Monsanto has developed genetically engineered varieties tolerant to glyphosate herbicide. Genetically engineered alfalfa developed by Monsanto is tolerant to glyphosate herbicide, allowing growers to apply it after weeds have germinated without harming the plant. Concerns about weed-tolerance and glyphosate toxicity persist, with APHIS regulating the release of genetically engineered organisms. Field trials for GE alfalfa were authorized in 1998, with protocols including buffer zones and confinement of flowering plants to prevent pollinators from accessing them. From 1999 to 2005, APHIS authorized 297 field trials for GE alfalfa, with protocols including confinement of flowering plants in cages to prevent pollinators from accessing them. Monsanto and Forage Genetics International submitted a petition in 2003 for deregulated status of two lines of GE alfalfa, leading to APHIS reviewing the environmental implications and deciding that an EIS was not required. After reviewing public comments on the draft EA, APHIS decided to deregulate GE alfalfa and issued a FONSI, stating that an EIS was not necessary due to the lack of plant pathogenic properties. A legal challenge led to a court directing APHIS to prepare an EIS, which was published on December 16, 2010 after receiving 244,000 comments. The final EIS examined three possible outcomes for GE alfalfa. On January 27, 2011, Secretary Vilsack announced that APHIS granted full deregulation to GE alfalfa, stating that it posed no greater plant pest risk than conventional varieties. This decision was based on the Plant Protection Act, which deemed any option other than full deregulation inconsistent. Growers are now free from regulatory control over GE alfalfa. Growers of GE alfalfa are still bound by non-regulatory restrictions imposed by Monsanto's technology use agreement, including managing hay to prevent seed production and harvesting early. Representatives of agricultural associations opposed partial deregulation, citing concerns about trade agreements. At a forum in 2010, Members queried Secretary Vilsack about deregulation of GE alfalfa. The Center for Food Safety criticized APHIS's decision and vowed to continue legal challenges. CFS claimed the Final EIS was deficient in assessing impacts of GE alfalfa, including liability, herbicide use, and harm from herbicide-resistant weeds. Weed management is a significant issue for sugar beet growers as well. In 2000, large sugar-using food companies were concerned about consumer acceptance of GE-derived sugar, leading to reluctance from growers to plant them. However, by 2005, most sugar processors were less worried about consumer resistance, and growers were eager to plant herbicide-tolerant varieties. GE sugar beets were deregulated in 2005 and have since been widely commercialized in the United States, accounting for about 95% of sugar beet production in the 2009/2010 crop year. Sugar beets are grown in 11 states across five regions of the United States. GE sugar beets have been approved for feed, food, and cultivation in various countries including Canada, Japan, and parts of the European Union, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, Russia, China, Singapore, and the Philippines. APHIS issued an EA-FONSI for the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant sugar beets in 2005, leading to their deregulation under 7 C.F.R. Part 340. Following a court challenge, APHIS announced its intent to prepare an EIS for further study. APHIS announced its intent to prepare an EIS for the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant sugar beets. The proposed scope of the study includes management practices, production levels, potential impacts on livestock and food/feed, differences in weediness traits, occurrences of weeds, and cumulative impact on glyphosate-resistant weeds. Sugar beet seed is primarily grown for cultivation. GE sugar beets grown in Oregon's Willamette Valley could cross-pollinate related crops like Swiss chard and table beets, posing a risk of biological contamination. This could have a significant economic impact on organic farmers if their crops are contaminated by a GE variety. The court emphasized the importance of evaluating the environmental consequences of actions that affect the availability of non-genetically engineered crops and food. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact, consider adverse effects, and explore alternatives, including socioeconomic impacts. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary for analyzing environmental impacts on the human environment. NEPA established an interdisciplinary approach for planning and decision-making, with the Council on Environmental Quality overseeing regulations. Agencies follow NEPA regulations and prepare their own guidelines for environmental reviews, which can be in the form of an EIS, EA, or CE. EIS requires the most scrutiny and public input, while EA determines if significant impacts warrant an EIS. CE is used for actions with no significant impacts. The federal District Court for the Northern District of California found that the environmental reviews prepared by APHIS for deregulating determinations on alfalfa and sugar beets were inadequate. In the case of GE alfalfa, the court determined that APHIS failed to thoroughly assess the environmental consequences, specifically regarding gene transmission and contamination prevention measures. Despite APHIS's conclusion of no significant impact, evidence suggested otherwise. The court found APHIS's environmental review for deregulating GE crops inadequate as it did not consider measures to prevent contamination or cumulative impacts of multiple herbicide-resistant crops. The court agreed with plaintiffs that increased herbicide use on GE crops could lead to pollution and herbicide-resistant weeds, impacting not just alfalfa but also soybean and corn. APHIS's argument that harm would be economic was rejected. The court rejected APHIS's argument that harm from GE alfalfa would be economic and outside the scope of NEPA. Economic effects could include revenue loss for alfalfa export due to contamination. The court held that economic harm was a direct result of unintentional genetically modified alfalfa, making it appropriate to review under NEPA. The court directed APHIS to prepare an EIS due to substantial questions regarding the environmental impact of GE alfalfa deregulation. Additionally, the court halted planting of GE alfalfa after March 30, 2007, and prohibited its sale. The court halted planting of GE alfalfa after March 30, 2007, and prohibited the sale of GE seed. This injunction returned GE alfalfa to its regulated status, rejecting proposed restrictions by APHIS. The plaintiffs sought a complete ban on GE alfalfa but did not seek a preliminary injunction, allowing some growers to plant GE alfalfa. The court's decision on the injunction for planting GE alfalfa was appealed, with the Supreme Court finding the injunction too broad. The lower court's ruling was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the district court had overstepped its authority. The court must consider four factors when deciding on an injunction as a remedy. The Supreme Court found the injunction for planting GE alfalfa too broad, stating that it was premature and overstepped the lower court's authority. The Court considered four factors when deciding on the injunction as a remedy, but none supported issuing it. The Court rejected the injunction on partial deregulation of GE alfalfa, stating that it was unnecessary and premature. The injunction had prevented APHIS from imposing restrictions on planting and harvesting, which could have addressed potential harms. The Court also dismissed the injunction on new planting of GE alfalfa for similar reasons. The Supreme Court rejected the injunction on new planting of GE alfalfa, stating that a partial deregulation decision could have allowed planting under certain conditions. The Court suggested that a partial deregulation process with imposed restrictions on planting and harvesting could have been a more suitable remedy instead of a full deregulation. The dissenting opinion in the 7-1 Supreme Court decision disputed the authority of the Court over the issue of partial deregulation of GE alfalfa. Justice Stevens argued that the environmental threat posed by GE alfalfa was novel and that halting deregulation did not prevent the use of alfalfa, but rather regulated its use. The dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court decision disputed the authority of the Court over partial deregulation of GE alfalfa, addressing environmental impacts and genetic contamination concerns. Following an EIS, APHIS fully deregulated GE alfalfa, leading to a legal challenge by the Center for Food Safety. The Ninth Circuit upheld APHIS's decision, stating that the Plant Protection Act did not apply to GE alfalfa. Senator Leahy and Representative DeFazio opposed the APHIS FONSI regarding GE alfalfa, citing evidence of contamination from major seed exporters and expressing concerns about export market losses, damage to organic dairy producers, and the development of herbicide-tolerant weeds. The letter to Secretary Vilsack expressed concerns about GE alfalfa contamination and the need for APHIS to adopt statutory mandates to minimize risks. Representatives Jenkins, Herger, and Courtney also urged partial deregulation of GE alfalfa while the final EIS is pending. Members requested partial deregulation of GE alfalfa from APHIS while the final EIS is completed. They argued for an interim permit to allow planting in fall 2010, citing a Supreme Court ruling on injunctions. A forum was held by the House Committee on Agriculture with Secretary Vilsack discussing options for promoting \"coexistence\" among GE alfalfa growers and organic growers. Members of the committee queried Secretary Vilsack on his authority to partially deregulate GE alfalfa, citing concerns about environmental impacts and gene transmission to related crops. The district court's reasoning in the GE sugar beet case was similar, emphasizing the need for an EIS before deregulation. The court found that the EA for GE sugar beets violated NEPA due to APHIS's failure to consider gene transmission. Despite no injunction being granted, the court allowed continued deregulation of GE sugar beets, citing industry standard adoption and lack of non-GE seed availability. The court denied the injunction for plaintiffs due to delay and potential harm. In August 2010, the court vacated APHIS's deregulation decision on GE sugar beets, halting unregulated planting. The court criticized APHIS for treating environmental review as a formality and suggested they could have conducted it during a nine-month delay. The federal court ruling vacated the deregulation of GE sugar beets, citing potential environmental harm and economic impacts. The decision did not restrict growers' ability to harvest or processors to convert existing GE sugar beets. APHIS may consider a partial deregulation order with regulatory restrictions for planting GE sugar beets. APHIS issued permits to sugar beet seed producers for seedling production in fall 2010, with restrictions on flowering or transplanting without additional approval. The Center for Food Safety sued to stop the permits, arguing that the permits violated NEPA by not considering the environmental consequences of the entire life cycle of the plants. The court agreed, stating that APHIS improperly segmented the environmental review by isolating the permits for planting seedlings. APHIS improperly segmented the environmental review, leading to a court order to uproot seedlings. The Ninth Circuit issued a stay, finding no likely injury from genetic contamination due to the biennial growth pattern of sugar beets. APHIS published a draft EA on partially deregulating GE sugar beets for crop production, ultimately deciding to partially deregulate root crop production but not seed crop production. The partial deregulation of GE sugar beet root crop production was an interim measure effective through December 31, 2012. A lawsuit was filed challenging the environmental effects of increased herbicide use on GE crops and questioning the predictability and control of sugar beet seed production. The case was transferred to the D.C. District Court, where sugar processors also filed suit to eliminate the interim measure. The lawsuit filed by sugar processors in the D.C. District Court aims to remove interim conditions on sugar beet root and seed crops imposed by APHIS. The plaintiffs seek a court declaration that the EA is legally sufficient to potentially block a NEPA challenge. The cases of GE alfalfa and sugar beets showcase the regulatory complexities of commercializing these GE varieties through the APHIS deregulation process. The development of new GE plant varieties, such as corn expressing industrial chemicals, raises concerns about cross-pollination with crops meant for human consumption. Herbicide-tolerant GE varieties have led to the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds. The industry is responding with new stacked GE varieties to address weed resistance. The industry is developing new \"stacked\" GE varieties to address weed resistance by combining tolerance to multiple herbicides in a single seed. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the current regulatory structure, with proposed revisions by APHIS in 2008. The public comment period for these changes was extended to June 29, 2009, marking the first revisions to regulations established in 1987. APHIS proposed new regulations for genetically engineered organisms that may not fit the plant pest definition but could still pose environmental or physical harm. The regulations would oversee GE organisms based on known risks of parent organisms, traits of the GE organism, or potential unknown risks. GE seedlings, tubers, cuttings, bulbs, and spores would also be regulated. APHIS plans to reorganize permit application and evaluation procedures by discontinuing the notification procedure. APHIS proposes new regulations for genetically engineered organisms, discontinuing the notification procedure and establishing a new petition procedure for conditional exemptions. The permitting system is based on risk factors related to plant persistence and potential harm from the GE trait. Plant species are grouped into risk categories for persistence and harm. Other changes include remediation authorities for non-compliance. Proposed regulatory changes by APHIS include remediation authorities for non-compliance and responses to low-level presence of regulated plant materials in commercial seeds. Reactions to the revisions were mixed, with opposition from biotechnology industry representatives and NGOs regarding the expansion of APHIS authority to regulate GE organisms. Public meetings were held to discuss controversial changes such as the scope of regulatory changes and environmental release of GE crops producing pharmaceutical compounds. Industry representatives and the Center for Food Safety (CFS) opposed proposed regulations on GE organisms, arguing over the voluntary approach and potential impact on international trade. CFS expressed concerns about the removal of established criteria for regulation. Advocacy groups urged a halt in approving GE crops until regulatory changes were made. Congress generally supported plant biotechnology development. In the 112th Congress, Members of the House Agriculture Committee expressed support for full deregulation of genetically engineered (GE) crops during a forum on January 20, 2011. Legislative activity in the 111th Congress focused on the relationship between GE varieties and herbicide resistance in weeds, with bills like the Genetically Engineered Safety Act of 2010 (H.R. 5578) and the Genetically Engineered Technology Farmer Protection Act (H.R. 5579) addressing regulations and protections for farmers. In response to cases of GE alfalfa and sugar beets, Congress proposed bills to protect farmers from economic harm and require labeling of genetically engineered food. Legislative proposals were made to streamline the review process for GE plants under the Plant Protection Act in the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, bills were proposed to protect farmers from economic harm due to vacated regulatory decisions on GE crops. The provision requiring the Secretary to grant permits in such cases was passed in the FY2013 appropriations bill."
