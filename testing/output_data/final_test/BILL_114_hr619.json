    "content": "The Act titled \"Collaborative Academic Research Efforts for Tourette Syndrome Act of 2015\" aims to expand, intensify, and coordinate activities related to Tourette Syndrome within the National Institutes of Health programs. The Act aims to expand NIH programs for Tourette syndrome research, including data collection on incidence, prevalence, and comorbid conditions in the US. The Act expands NIH programs for Tourette syndrome research by collecting data on medical and social services availability, and establishing Collaborative Research Centers for conducting research on the syndrome. The Act expands NIH programs for Tourette syndrome research by establishing Collaborative Research Centers to conduct basic and clinical research on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the syndrome. These centers will focus on developmental neurobiology, neuroscience, genetics, psychology, and pharmacology. Additionally, they will provide services to make individuals aware of research opportunities. The Collaborative Research Centers for Tourette syndrome established under the Act may provide referrals for health services and patient care costs required for research. The Secretary will consider availability and access to clinical services when awarding grants and contracts to applicants meeting scientific criteria. These centers can utilize single facilities for collaborative research. The Collaborative Research Centers for Tourette syndrome can use single facilities or form a consortium of institutions and patient advocacy groups to maximize services and coverage. Eligibility requirements must be met to participate. The Secretary will provide support for a certain number of centers based on availability of funds. The Secretary will establish 4-6 centers in different regions of the US, encouraging consortium formation for multi-state coverage. Support for these centers may be provided under this section. The Secretary may establish centers for research on Tourette syndrome symptoms and treatments, with grants awarded based on competitive peer-reviewed research on symptomology and treatment efficacy for specific patient groups. The period of support for these centers may not exceed 5 years, with possible extensions after review by a scientific peer group. The Secretary may designate funding for research on Tourette syndrome symptoms and treatment efficacy for specific patient subpopulations within the National Institutes of Health programs."
