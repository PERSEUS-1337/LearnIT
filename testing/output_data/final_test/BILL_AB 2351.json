    "title": "AB 2351",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's housing crisis, emphasizing the importance of affordable housing options like mobilehome parks. Local governments require tools to preserve these parks and address policy barriers hindering their control. Repeal of Section 798.17 of the Civil Code is necessary to support the preservation of affordable mobilehome parks. Repeal of Section 798.17 of the Civil Code exempts rental agreements in mobilehome parks from local rent control ordinances, allowing the terms of the agreement to prevail over conflicting provisions. If no new agreement is made, the last rental rate becomes the base rent for rent regulation purposes. In rental agreements entered into after January 1, 1993, a provision must be included notifying homeowners that the agreement is exempt from local rent control ordinances. The agreement must be over 12 months in duration and for the homeowner's personal residence. The homeowner has 30 days to accept or reject the rental agreement. They can void the agreement within 72 hours of signing if provided a copy, or within 72 hours of receiving an executed copy if not provided one. If the homeowner rejects or rescinds a rental agreement, they can opt for a 12-month rental agreement instead. The new agreement must have the same terms and conditions as the original one for the first 12 months. The management can offer gifts to homeowners who sign a rental agreement under this section. With respect to exempt spaces in a mobilehome park, no fees or exactions can be imposed for rent control purposes. Management must provide written notice to homeowners of their right to inspect and void the rental agreement within 30 days. Failure to provide this notice makes the agreement voidable at the homeowner's discretion. Acknowledgment of the notice must be in writing. Section 798.17.5 of the Civil Code prohibits automatic extension or renewal of rental agreements after January 1, 1993. Local governments can enact rent control ordinances for mobilehome parks under certain conditions."
