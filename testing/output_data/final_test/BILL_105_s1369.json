    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Truancy Act of 1997\". Congress finds that in 1994, there was a significant increase in truancy cases, with 36,400 cases processed formally. Among individuals aged 16 through 24 in 1993, 11 percent had not completed high school and were not enrolled. The economic and social costs of addressing youth at risk of leaving the educational system are a burden on government and private resources. Truancy is seen as the first sign of a young person losing their way. High school drop-outs face long-term disadvantages, being more likely to rely on welfare and be unemployed. In 1993, a significant number of youth in adult prisons had not completed high school. Truancy leads to increased use of foster care and court systems, and is linked to higher crime rates, including daytime burglaries. Truancy prevention programs reduce daytime burglary rates by up to 75% and increase school attendance. The goals of this Act are to prevent and reduce truancy through the establishment of truancy prevention and crime control demonstration projects. The Secretary will provide grants to partnerships involving schools, law enforcement, and youth organizations to prevent truancy. Grant funds can be used for programs like using officers to pick up truant students and take them to assessment centers. Applications for grants must be submitted with project descriptions. The Secretary will award grants to partnerships focusing on truancy prevention. Projects must describe methods to involve parents, sanctions for truant students, incentives for parental responsibility, initiatives to address truancy causes, and linkages with law enforcement. Priority will be given to partnerships in poverty-stricken areas. The Secretary will award grants to partnerships focusing on truancy prevention in urban and rural areas that meet specific criteria determined to contribute to the goals of the Act. SEC. 6. EVALUATIONS AND REPORTS. Each partnership receiving a grant must evaluate the project and submit reports to the Secretary on truancy prevention, increased school attendance, and reduction in juvenile crime. The Secretary will also report to Congress based on these evaluations. The Secretary will submit interim and final reports to Congress based on evaluations of projects assisted under the Act, including recommendations for legislative action. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $80,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and necessary sums for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, with funds remaining available until expended."
