    "content": "In recent decades, federal programs like crop insurance, noninsured crop disaster assistance, and emergency disaster loans have helped farmers manage crop losses. Congress has also provided ad-hoc emergency crop disaster assistance when needed, offering financial support to producers facing significant weather-related production losses. The SURE program, authorized in the 2008 farm bill, aimed to provide a pre-designed program for farmers to incorporate into their risk management planning. However, the program design has affected the timeliness of payments, with payments based on whole-farm crop revenue rather than crop-specific losses. Under the new disaster program, farmer payments are now based on whole-farm revenue rather than individual crop losses. The program compares a farmer's revenue from all crops in all counties to a guaranteed level of revenue, taking into account expected yields and prices. If actual farm revenue falls below the guaranteed level, the producer receives a payment. The SURE program requires farmers to purchase insurance on all crops in their farming operation to offset losses with revenue gains. Payments are limited to ensure the guaranteed level does not exceed 90% of expected farm income. If crop insurance is not available, producers must purchase NAP coverage. Non-eligible crops are not considered under SURE. The SURE program requires farmers to have insurance on all crops to offset losses with revenue gains. Eligible farmers must have a financial interest in crops located in a secretarial-declared county, with at least a 10% yield loss on a significant crop. SURE payments are made when an individual producer's program guarantee total exceeds farm revenue by 60%. The SURE program requires farmers to have insurance on all crops to offset losses with revenue gains. Eligible farmers must have a financial interest in crops located in a secretarial-declared county, with at least a 10% yield loss on a significant crop. SURE payments are made when an individual producer's program guarantee total exceeds farm revenue by 60%. The guaranteed revenue level in the SURE program is the sum of a farm's crop insurance guarantees increased by 15%, and NAP guarantees increased by 20%, designed to fill the gap left by insurance or NAP coverage. The SURE program requires farmers to have insurance on all crops to offset losses with revenue gains. Payments are calculated based on the program guarantee exceeding farm revenue by 60%. The guarantee is determined by a formula involving factors like NAP price, acreage, and yield. The total farm revenue includes crop values, government payments, and salvage value. The government payment sum equals 15% of direct payments plus 100% of all other payments\u2014counter-cyclical payments, average crop revenue election payments, loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, net crop insurance payments (indemnities minus premiums), NAP payments, and other disaster payments. Disaster payments under SURE arrive well after the crop loss because some of the data needed to computed payment rates become available more than one year after harvest. The USDA publishes season-average prices for farm revenue calculations after the market year ends. Crop disaster payments are delayed for over a year, while crop insurance indemnities are typically paid within a month. SURE payments for 2008 crops have income limits, with a change in limits starting from crop year 2009. In crop year 2009, the income limit is $500,000 for average adjusted gross nonfarm income. Total payments per person may not exceed $100,000 for SURE and three livestock-related programs under the 2008 farm bill's Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance programs. The authorizing statute for SURE has been amended twice since the 2008 farm bill was enacted, with changes made to eligibility requirements for the SURE program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the \"buy-in\" deadline for 2008 crops, allowing all producers to potentially receive higher SURE payments. The SURE program helps fill gaps in other government commodity and risk management programs, with low costs to farmers and no impact on other program decisions. Interest in SURE may have increased demand for crop insurance and NAP coverage. The SURE program may have increased demand for crop insurance and NAP coverage, leading to more U.S. crops being covered. Farmers choosing higher insurance coverage also increased their SURE guarantee. SURE formulas consider indemnities, government payments, and ad hoc disaster payments to avoid double payments. The program, along with four other disaster programs, receives funding from the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund established in the 2008 farm bill. The Trust Fund is funded by U.S. Customs receipts collected on certain goods. The 2008 farm bill established the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund to fund five disaster programs, with estimated costs totaling $3.8 billion over four years. The Trust Fund can borrow from the Treasury if needed. The SURE program, along with other disaster programs, receives funding from the Trust Fund and is expected to cost additional funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is expected to cost an additional $674 million, with $500-$600 million for higher SURE program benefits for the 2008 crop and the rest for crop insurance subsidies. USDA estimated total SURE payments at $3.4 billion for 2008-2011, less than previous ad hoc disaster programs. SURE payments for 2008 and 2009 losses totaled $2.8 billion as of December 13, 2011. SURE payments for 2008 and 2009 losses totaled $2.8 billion by December 13, 2011, with about one-third attributed to changes under ARRA. Payments were distributed to 2,157 counties for 2008 losses, with supplemental payments roughly proportional to crop insurance indemnities at the state level. In 2008, SURE paid $0.24 for every dollar of crop insurance indemnities, with states like Iowa, North Dakota, and Texas receiving the highest payments. Farmer signup for 2008 crop losses began in January 2010, with payments starting shortly after. SURE program signup for 2008, 2009, and 2010 crop losses began in January 2010 and November 2011, respectively. USDA faced challenges in program administration and software development for issuing producer payments. The manual process was initially used until software integration was completed. The USDA faced challenges in processing applications for the SURE program in January 2010 due to the manual process used before software development. Issues with farm units and determining prices for guarantee calculations were also highlighted. The USDA encountered challenges in processing SURE program applications in January 2010 due to manual processes. Difficulty in determining average prices for guarantee calculations was also noted, especially for minor or thinly traded crops. FSA state committees have experience in developing prices for NAP crops using various sources. Accounting for different insurance products, such as adjusted gross revenue, poses challenges in determining farmer guarantee levels. The USDA uses a combination of data from individuals and substitute data to determine revenue guarantees for crops. For \"value loss\" crops like ornamental nursery, SURE payment eligibility is based on inventory before and after a disaster. Congress will likely review the effectiveness and cost of the SURE program in the next farm bill debate. The SURE program's cost and effectiveness are being questioned due to high initial payments and lack of baseline funding. Congress may need to find new funding or budget offsets for reauthorization. The whole-farm approach in managing farm-level risk is a primary policy concern. SURE payments have supplemented crop insurance indemnities as intended in certain parts of the country, such as the Corn Belt and Great Plains. However, some farmers have complained that the whole-farm approach reduces the likelihood of disaster payments for diversified operations. Producers in regions like the South find SURE less effective due to lower levels of crop insurance coverage. Farmers in North Dakota are generally satisfied with SURE payments. The SURE program has been effective in supplementing crop insurance indemnities in certain regions like the Corn Belt and Great Plains. Farmers in North Dakota are satisfied with SURE, especially when combined with crop insurance benefits. There is a question about the overlap in federal payments and farm risk reduction programs like ACRE, SURE disaster payments, and crop insurance indemnities. SURE minimizes overlap by accounting for these programs. The program design includes different loss triggers for producers depending on their location in disaster-declared counties. Producers in these counties only need to show a 10% yield loss on one crop to qualify for a SURE payment, while those in other counties must show a 50% yield loss. The SURE program may only address \"shallow loss\" in certain counties due to different yield loss requirements. Concerns have been raised about the unpredictability of SURE payments based on the disaster designation process. USDA proposed changes in 2010 to simplify the process and address these issues. The SURE program faces concerns about the unpredictability of payments due to the disaster designation process. Proposed changes aim to simplify the process and address issues such as the lower yield loss requirement for larger acreage. Adjusting revenue determination could reduce bias and overall program costs. Some producers with high Counter-Cyclical Program yields face perpetual losses under the current SURE formula due to factors like irrigation. Concerns remain about the time lag between actual losses and government payments, as seen in past unsuccessful attempts to provide ad hoc assistance. Livestock program payments are more streamlined and arrive more quickly compared to SURE payments. Some suggest using crop insurance \"harvest prices\" for faster disaster payments, while others propose reimbursing producers for high input costs. Rice farmers note SURE lacks coverage for certain losses. SURE, similar to crop insurance, does not cover increased harvest costs for rice farmers affected by downed rice due to excessive rain or flooding in 2009. This limitation can lead to some farmers not qualifying for SURE payments, potentially increasing farm business risk. Analysts suggest that SURE may favor farmers with a single crop in a single county, while planting multiple crops in different locations adds diversity to a farm. The SURE program, similar to crop insurance, may not cover increased harvest costs for rice farmers affected by natural disasters. Planting multiple crops in different locations can reduce farm risk and increase eligibility for SURE payments. However, concerns exist about the program criteria encouraging risky behavior and the impact of funding on its future. The SURE program, along with other disaster programs, faces challenges in funding extension beyond September 30, 2011. Policymakers will need to find new funding or budget offsets to continue these programs in the next farm bill, with an estimated cost of $1 billion per year. This task may be difficult in a tight budget environment."
