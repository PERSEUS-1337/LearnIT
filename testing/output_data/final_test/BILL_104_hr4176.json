The tax credit for health insurance costs is subject to a phaseout based on adjusted gross income exceeding specific thresholds. For joint filers, the applicable dollar amount is $40,000, and for other taxpayers, it is $25,000. If income exceeds these amounts by less than $10,000, the credit is reduced proportionally.
