According to findings by Congress, 1-2 million American women have received silicone breast implants over the last 35 years primarily for breast augmentation or reconstruction surgery. Women with breast cancer seek access to silicone implants for treatment options and need complete information on potential health risks. The rate of implant rupture and silicone leakage is not definitively established. According to studies, up to 70 percent of silicone breast implants may leak. A 1997 Mayo Clinic study found that 1 in 4 women needed additional surgery within 5 years of receiving implants. Local changes in breast tissue and various complications have been reported post-implantation. Research on silicone breast implants in various fields is deemed inadequate for conclusive determinations. The epidemiology of silicone breast implants is inconclusive due to limitations in research methodology and data analysis. Concerns remain about potential connective tissue or autoimmune diseases from exposure to silicone. Independent scientists have called for more research on the association between atypical connective tissue disease and silicone implants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of silicone breast implants, including concerns about mammograms and breastfeeding with implants. Studies suggest a possible link between breast feeding with implants and issues with the child's esophagus. The Act aims to promote research on the health effects of silicone breast implants, including concerns about mammograms and breastfeeding. It also ensures accurate information for women and doctors regarding the availability of silicone breast implants for various purposes. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand activities related to silicone breast implant research at the National Institutes of Health. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for silicone breast implant research, who will work with various Institutes including the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Study sections will be established for this research. The Director of NIH will establish a study section to review research grant applications on silicone breast implants for quality assurance. Additionally, a clinical study will be conducted to understand the health implications, including a case-controlled study involving women with implants for at least 8 years. The Director of NIH will conduct a study focusing on women with silicone breast implants for at least 8 years, evaluating disease presentation, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities compared to controls with saline implants. An annual report will be submitted to Congress on the study results. Expansion and intensification of activities regarding silicone breast implants at the FDA. The FDA is expanding and intensifying activities related to silicone breast implants. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs is ensuring accurate information availability and timely reporting of problems with silicone breast implants. This includes updating materials, clarifying reporting procedures, and making aggregate data public upon request. The FDA is enhancing oversight of silicone breast implants, requiring manufacturers to update package inserts with accurate information, including rupture rates. They must also amend study protocols to provide informed consent documents early on and educate patients on how to report issues through the Medwatch program. The FDA is requiring manufacturers of silicone breast implants to update package inserts with accurate information, including rupture rates. They must also amend study protocols to provide informed consent documents early on and educate patients on how to report issues through the Medwatch program. Additionally, women who withdraw from a study or have concerns are encouraged to submit a Medwatch form to report problems and reasons for withdrawing. The informed consent document will now include the clinical trial's inclusion criteria and a toll-free Consumer Information number."
