    "content": "Policymakers have options like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade to reduce CO2 emissions from the U.S. electricity sector. A federal clean energy standard (CES) could also be considered, requiring utility companies to provide a set amount of electricity from clean sources. The electric power sector accounts for 41% of U.S. CO2 emissions, with transportation and buildings/infrastructure sectors making up the rest. Various CES policies have been proposed in the past, but none have become law. S. 2146 proposes a Federal Clean Energy Standard focused on CO2 emission reductions in the U.S. electric power sector. This bill aims to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act by adding a new section titled \"Federal Clean Energy Standard.\" The concept of a clean energy standard was initially proposed by President Obama in 2011, and S. 2146 was introduced in the Senate in 2012. The proposed bill, titled \"Federal Clean Energy Standard,\" aims to create a market-oriented standard for electric energy generation that promotes clean energy innovation in the U.S. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 outlines compliance requirements, eligible electricity generation types, and mechanisms for compliance. Utility companies in all U.S. states, except Alaska and Hawaii, are required to comply with the standard. Utility companies in the U.S. states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, must obtain a certain percentage of electricity sales from clean energy generators. Compliance with the Clean Energy Standard (CES) is based on annual electricity sales, with thresholds decreasing annually from 2015 to 2025. This exempts the majority of utility companies from CES requirements. Starting in 2015, approximately 300 utility companies in the contiguous 48 United States would need to comply with the Clean Energy Standard (CES), representing 81% of national electricity sales. By 2025, the number of companies required to comply would increase to nearly 500, covering around 87% of national electricity sales. S. 2146 would mandate non-exempt utilities to obtain a percentage of their electricity sales from qualified clean energy generators. The Clean Energy Standard (CES) mandates non-exempt utilities to obtain a minimum of 24% clean energy by 2015, increasing by 3% each year until reaching 84% by 2035. Utilities can deduct hydropower and nuclear power generation from their sales base if generated before 1992. This deduction may benefit utilities with significant hydropower and nuclear power portfolios. The Clean Energy Standard (CES) requires utilities to have a minimum percentage of clean energy, with deductions allowed for hydropower and nuclear power generated before 1992. This deduction can benefit utilities with substantial hydropower and nuclear power portfolios, reducing the amount of qualified clean energy needed for compliance. Electric utilities must comply with CES requirements by generating or purchasing qualified clean energy. S. 2146 defines clean energy as electricity generated from various sources including renewable energy, natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, and waste-to-energy. It also includes electricity from facilities using combined heat and power or non-biomass energy sources emitting less than 0.82 metric tons of CO2 per MWh. Electricity generation from facilities that capture and store CO2, regardless of the placed-in-service date. Approximately 1.1 million MW of electricity generation capacity exists in the lower 48 United States, with 93% qualifying as \"clean energy\" capacity, mainly from natural gas facilities. Natural gas generation is only eligible for partial CES credits based on CO2 emissions per MWh produced. The Clean Energy Standard (CES) in the United States awards credits based on CO2 emissions per MWh of electricity produced. Qualified clean energy capacity is spread across the country, with utility companies having two compliance options: submit clean energy credits or make alternative compliance payments to the Secretary of Energy. Clean Energy Credits are issued to qualified electricity generation facilities based on their CO2 emission intensity compared to a pulverized coal plant. The exact basis of this CO2 intensity metric is unspecified. The CES awards credits based on CO2 emissions per MWh of electricity produced. The formula for calculating CES credits for qualified generators is provided. CES credits can be used for compliance, sold, or held in reserve. The basis of the CO2 intensity metric is unspecified in the bill. The proposed bill introduces a Federal Clean Energy Trading Program for CES compliance. CES credits can be used for compliance, sold, or held in reserve. Non-exempt utilities have the option of making alternative compliance payments instead of generating or purchasing CES credits. The ACP design element in S. 2146 sets the initial ACP level at three cents per kilowatthour in 2015, increasing 5% per year. A State Energy Efficiency Funding Program would distribute 75% of all ACP collections to states for energy efficiency initiatives. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems may qualify for CES compliance. CHP systems, unlike other generators, produce both electricity and heat for on-site use. S. 2146 mandates CHP systems to be over 50% energy efficient, with at least 20% of energy in electricity and thermal forms. CES credits for CHP owners are based on electricity generation, CO2 intensity, on-site electricity use, and annual compliance. Gross CES credits are calculated similarly, with a portion based on on-site electricity consumption. The bill S. 2146 mandates CHP systems to be over 50% energy efficient and provides specific definitions for renewable biomass. It requires the Secretary of Energy to issue interim carbon intensity regulations for biomass and commission a study by the National Academy of Sciences to assess total lifecycle emissions from biomass-derived electricity. The EPA led efforts to quantify lifecycle emissions for biofuel feedstock in response to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Debate arose within the biofuel community regarding the accuracy of emissions calculations. Non-exempt utilities failing to meet CES requirements would face civil penalties. 29 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, had established binding renewable portfolio standard policies by April 2012. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies encourage renewable electricity projects by requiring a percentage of electricity from renewable sources. Each state's RPS varies in requirements and compliance dates. A federal Clean Energy Standard (CES) may impact state RPS policies, but S. 2146 clarifies that states can still enforce their renewable energy laws. Integrating energy efficiency and thermal sources into a federal CES is of interest. Technologies reducing electrical load can help reduce CO2 emissions. The bill S. 2146 requires reports on evaluating technologies for reducing electrical load to cut CO2 emissions and on natural gas conservation. EIA analyzed the potential impact of the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 on the U.S. electricity sector, showing changes in the projected fuel mix. The Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 (S. 2146) would reduce electric sector CO2 emissions by 44% in 2035 compared to EIA's reference case scenario. EIA's analysis compares two scenarios with policy parameters defined in the CES to show potential changes in the electric power sector. In 2035, under the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012 (S. 2146), coal electricity generation would decrease by 54%, nuclear power would increase by 62%, and non-hydro renewables would increase by 34%. Natural gas generation is expected to modestly increase by 8%, with no carbon capture and sequestration projects for CES compliance. EIA projects a 4% increase in U.S. electricity prices in 2025 and an 18% increase in 2035 under S. 2146. Exempting certain utilities from CES compliance could lead to regional price disparities. Non-exempt utilities may see prices 3% to 30% higher by 2030. Alternative compliance payments are minimal. S. 2146 integrates policy elements for the Clean Energy Standard. The proposed Clean Energy Standard policy in S. 2146 raises questions about the carbon intensity metric for fossil energy generators and the determination of partial CES credits. Non-exempt electric utilities selling electricity in a State must comply with annual CES requirements under the bill. The proposed Clean Energy Standard policy in S. 2146 requires non-exempt electric utilities selling electricity in a State to comply with annual CES requirements. The calculation of total electricity sold by a utility should include sales by all affiliates and associated companies. Future debates may focus on defining \"clean energy\" based on carbon dioxide emissions at the point of electricity generation. The proposed Clean Energy Standard policy in S. 2146 focuses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions at the point of electricity generation. However, it does not consider potential emissions or environmental impacts throughout the entire lifecycle of energy sources. Different opinions exist on whether the entire lifecycle should be considered when defining clean energy. Nuclear power offers carbon-free electricity but raises concerns about waste disposal and weapons proliferation. Natural gas emits less CO2 than coal but has environmental issues. Non-hydro renewable electricity, except biomass, is considered the cleanest power generation source, but concerns exist regarding endangered species, animal habitat, land use, and other issues."
