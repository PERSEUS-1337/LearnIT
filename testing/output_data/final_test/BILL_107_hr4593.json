    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Assuring Honesty and Accountability Act of 2002\" and includes an extension of discretionary spending caps. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to allocate budget authority and outlays for defense and nondefense categories for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. For fiscal year 2004, the budget authority and outlays are allocated as follows: $400,502,000,000 for defense and $380,305,000,000 for nondefense. For fiscal year 2005, the allocation is $421,498,000,000 for defense and $387,960,000,000 for nondefense. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the budget authority and outlays for the discretionary category are as follows: $837,672,000,000 and $854,020,000,000 for 2006, and $870,178,000,000 and $877,248,000,000 for 2007. The Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by striking subsection (b). SEC. 3 amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 by removing the date restriction. SEC. 4 introduces automatic budget enforcement measures on the floor. Sec. 316 prohibits any bill or resolution in the House of Representatives or the Senate that would waive or alter spending limits set forth in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. It also restricts any action that would alter the balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard or directed scoring. In the House of Representatives or the Senate, it is not allowed to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that affects the budget in a way that increases the deficit or reduces the surplus after the first 5 fiscal years covered in the budget resolution. Additionally, in the House of Representatives, it is prohibited to consider any rule or order that waives the application of this restriction. The House of Representatives has specific rules regarding points of order, including the requirement to specify precise language and the process for consideration. Points of order must be debated for 10 minutes by each Member and decided without intervening motions. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to address waiver and appeal procedures in the Senate, with specific changes to subsections (c)(1) and (d)(2). The table of contents is also updated to reflect these amendments. Upon the enactment of a bill providing new budget authority for the Department of Defense for the war on terrorism, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget will adjust discretionary spending limits by the amount allocated, not to exceed $10 billion. Additionally, there is a disclosure requirement for interest costs. SEC. 5 amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require disclosure of interest costs for proposed measures. SEC. 6 focuses on accountability in emergency spending. The OMB Emergency Criteria defines an emergency as a situation requiring new budget authority for the prevention or response to loss of life, property, or national security, which is unanticipated, sudden, and urgent. The OMB Emergency Criteria defines an emergency as a compelling need requiring immediate action, unforeseen and temporary in nature. Guidelines for its application must be developed within 5 months of the Act's enactment. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 amended the budget process to include a reserve fund for emergencies and detailed justifications for emergency budget requests. Additionally, a separate House vote on emergency designations was introduced. The Rules of the House of Representatives have been amended to allow for the removal of emergency spending designations from bills in the Committee of the Whole. The Committee on Rules must report any waivers of points of order related to emergency spending designations. Committees must notify of emergency legislation. When a committee reports a bill providing budget authority for an emergency, the accompanying report must identify the provisions and outlays for the emergency, along with reasons why it meets the definition of an emergency according to guidelines. Section 7 amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by applying budget act points of order to unreported legislation. Section 8 requires budget compliance statements. SEC. 8 amends Clause 3(d) of rule XIII by adding a new subparagraph for budget compliance statements prepared by the Committee on the Budget chairman. It assesses if bills comply with budget requirements. SEC. 9 amends rule XIII of the House of Representatives to require justification for waivers of certain sections of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. SEC. 10 addresses CBO scoring of conference reports. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include conference reports in the budget process and determine direct spending in bills, joint resolutions, or conference reports. The amendment also requires inclusion of information in the joint explanatory statement of managers for conference reports. The joint explanatory statement of managers for conference reports must be timely submitted before the report is filed."
