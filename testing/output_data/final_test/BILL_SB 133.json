    "title": "SB 133",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 1.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code introduces Voluntary Occupancy Tax Collection, defining terms like \"Participating platform\" as a platform responsible for collecting and remitting transient occupancy tax on rental transactions for tourist or transient use. The curr_chunk defines \"Participating jurisdiction\" as a city, county, or city and county that allows a participating platform to collect and remit transient occupancy tax on rental transactions for tourist or transient use. It also defines \"Operator\" as a person offering a unit for tourist or transient use through a platform. The curr_chunk defines \"Personally identifiable information\" as operator information and identifiable transaction-level records, including taxpayer or operator identifying details and rental transaction specifics. The curr_chunk defines a \"Platform\" as a marketplace facilitating rental for compensation and a \"Transient occupancy tax\" as a tax on short-term lodging. On July 1, 2017, participating platforms must collect transient occupancy tax on rental transactions for units offered for tourist use. The platforms will remit the tax to the jurisdiction as per local ordinances. The Controller will establish procedures for platforms to notify if they elect to participate. Platforms and jurisdictions have specific deadlines to elect to participate in the transient occupancy tax program. Platforms must notify the Controller by March 1, 2017, while cities and counties must do so by April 30, 2017, using established procedures. An election made under this section is effective upon receipt by the Controller until discontinued by the platform or city, county, or city and county. A city, county, or city and county's election is not effective for a platform that notifies the Controller before June 15, 2017, that it will not collect and remit transient occupancy tax. The Controller will publicly identify platforms and jurisdictions that have provided notifications by May 31, 2017. On or after July 1, 2017, a platform can elect to become a participating platform by notifying the Controller. The election is effective six months after receipt and until discontinued by the platform. The Controller will publicly identify platforms that have provided notification. A participating platform can discontinue its status by notifying the Controller using specified procedures. The discontinuation is effective six months after the election date. The platform can also stop collecting and remitting transient occupancy tax in any jurisdiction that amends its tax rules. A participating jurisdiction can elect to discontinue its status by notifying the Controller before June 30 of any year. The election is effective on January 1 of the following year, except if a participating platform notifies the Controller before November 15 that it will not collect and remit transient occupancy tax. The Controller will publicly identify platforms and jurisdictions that provide notifications. The Controller will review tax collection by platforms annually and submit reports to participating jurisdictions. The report will include findings and aggregate tax amounts collected. The participating jurisdiction must identify errors in tax collection not remediated within 90 days. The platform's response to these errors must also be included in the report. The Controller can request personally identifiable information from a platform for verifying geographic boundaries and tax remittance, but cannot disclose this information to a jurisdiction or publicly. When requested, the Controller allows authorized officers to examine records related to audits of collections by participating platforms, excluding personally identifiable information. This access is limited to records obtained during reviews of transient occupancy taxes collected within the jurisdiction. The Controller allows authorized officers to examine audit and review reports from participating platforms. Appeals can be made within 60 days of the final report, with the Controller's General Counsel issuing a determination within 90 days. The Controller can recover audit costs from the platform being reviewed. This section does not apply to non-participating jurisdictions. It does not limit the authority of cities, counties, or city and counties to regulate operators as long as the regulations do not discriminate against transactions through a platform. Participating platforms collecting transient occupancy tax are subject to audit by the Controller, not by participating jurisdictions. Compliance with audit parameters exempts platforms from providing personally identifiable information to jurisdictions unless ordered by a court. This chapter does not change regulations in non-participating jurisdictions. The chapter does not alter legal duties for platforms to collect transient occupancy taxes in non-participating jurisdictions. Section 1 imposes limitations on public access rights, as per the California Constitution. People who rent units through platforms have a right to privacy in their personally identifiable information. Limiting disclosure of this information in records obtained by the Controller balances public disclosure with privacy interests."
