    "content": "\"Death is inevitable and affects everyone differently. End-of-life care must consider ethical and policy issues like personal choice, cost, and quality of care. Changes in demographics and history have influenced the experience of death in the U.S.\" The older U.S. population has grown, leading to changes in causes of death and advances in medicine. In the early 20th century, life expectancy was 49.2 years, but by 2004 it had increased to 77.8 years. Cultural notions of death and challenges in the healthcare system are also discussed. Since the early 1900s, average life expectancy in the U.S. has increased by 28.6 years to 77.8 years, largely due to reductions in child mortality. Improvements in preventing chronic diseases and medical interventions have also contributed to this increase. Disparities in longevity still exist among different demographic groups. The aging population may require long-term care services for various health issues. The past century has seen a significant growth in the elderly population, particularly those aged 65 and older. The aging of the baby boom generation has accelerated this trend. Most deaths in the U.S. now occur among the aged, with 7 in 10 deaths happening in this age group. As the population ages, the number of elderly patients receiving end-of-life care is expected to increase. Changes in leading causes of death have also impacted how people experience death, shifting from infectious diseases to other health issues. In the early 21st century, Americans are living longer with chronic conditions or degenerative diseases, leading to death from diseases like heart disease, cancer, and stroke. These chronic conditions require continuing health care and can be resource-intensive, generating significant costs for treatments and end-of-life care. In the early 21st century, end-of-life care in the United States has shifted towards deaths occurring in acute care settings, with a majority of deaths happening in hospitals (58%), followed by deaths at home (22%) and in nursing homes (20%). The dying process is characterized by a gradual onset of disease leading to a decline in health and functional independence, resulting in a longer and less predictable duration of death. The location of death varies based on the underlying cause, with dementia patients often dying in nursing homes. However, there is a trend towards more people dying at home with the availability of home hospice services. Family members report a more positive dying experience when their loved ones pass away at home with hospice care compared to institutional settings like hospitals or nursing homes. The increase in deaths in institutional settings reflects medical advances that extend life, creating fear of prolonged and difficult dying. Finding the balance between treatment and non-treatment is challenging for health providers and policymakers due to technological advancements in healthcare. Public attitudes have shifted towards active participation in end-of-life medical decision-making, influenced by the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The distribution of expensive healthcare resources and regional spending variations further complicate policy discussions. Further complicating the policy discussion on end-of-life care is regional variation in spending intensity, with some suggesting provider reimbursement drives spending. Americans are unique in believing death is negotiable, but conversations about death are often avoided. Changing attitudes towards death includes the concept of achieving a \"good\" death, free from pain and suffering. The U.S. health care system may hinder the concept of a \"good\" death by using combative language towards death and disease. Health care providers often view death as an enemy to be fought against, leading to a perception that allowing death is a loss or failure. The mission to vanquish death is often futile, but patients are determined to postpone it. Some may want providers to fight disease and death, while others may benefit more from enhancing their quality of life and transitioning into death. A 1997 IOM committee found serious problems in end-of-life care, including errors of omission and commission in providing effective pain relief and comfort. End-of-life care encompasses health care for individuals with serious or terminal illnesses, focusing on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Palliative care and hospice care are forms of end-of-life care, with hospice specifically for those nearing the end of life. Palliative care is a medical specialty that focuses on relieving suffering and improving the quality of life for patients with serious illness. It does not aim to cure the illness but can be provided alongside curative treatment. The World Health Organization defines palliative care as an approach that enhances the quality of life for patients and their families facing life-threatening illness. Palliative care is delivered by an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals in various settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. The prevalence of hospital palliative care programs in the United States has increased steadily since 2000. The prevalence of hospital palliative care programs in the United States has increased steadily since 2000, with 40% of hospitals offering a palliative care program in 2006 compared to 25% in 2000. There is wide variation in access to palliative care services based on factors such as hospital size, public versus for-profit status, and medical-school affiliation. The medical community has shown interest in advancing training and education in palliative care, with recommendations for changes in education to ensure practitioners are well-equipped to care for dying patients. The American Board of Medical Specialties established Hospice and Palliative Medicine as a new medical subspecialty in 2006. In 2006, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education approved an accreditation process for hospice and palliative care fellowship programs. Hospice care is a form of palliative care focused on terminally ill patients, providing comfort care at the end of life. The first hospice program in the US opened in 1974 in New Haven, Connecticut. In the late 1970s, the U.S. Department of Health published a report endorsing hospice care for terminally ill patients and their families. The Health Care Financing Administration initiated hospice demonstration projects to evaluate cost-effectiveness. In the early 1980s, Medicare coverage for hospice care was established under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Eligibility requires certification of terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care is available for terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of six months or less. Most states offer Medicaid coverage for hospice care, and it can also be covered by private health insurance or paid for out-of-pocket. In 2007, 1.4 million patients received hospice services, with 39% of all deaths in the US that year being under hospice care. In 2007, Medicare hospice covered 84% of hospice patients, with other payment sources covering the rest. Hospice care can be provided in various settings like private residences, nursing homes, or assisted living facilities. According to NHPCO, most hospice patients die in their own residence or a residential care facility, with a small percentage passing away in a hospice facility. The average length of stay for hospice patients was 67.4 days in 2007, with a median stay of 20.0 days. Medicare hospice beneficiaries typically have episodes lasting less than six months, but there has been an increase in longer episodes. The length of stay for Medicare hospice beneficiaries has been increasing, with some staying up to 212 days. Factors influencing length of stay include disease progression, timing of referral, and access to care. Hospice care offers various services to improve quality of life, provided by a team of healthcare professionals, family caregivers, and volunteers. Services include nursing care, counseling, medical equipment, and therapy. In the 1970's, terminal cancer patients were the largest percentage of hospice admissions, but over the past three decades, the proportion of non-cancer admissions has increased. In 2007, almost six in ten hospice patients had a non-cancer related primary diagnosis such as heart disease, dementia, or lung disease. Hospice care provides various services including nursing care, counseling, medical equipment, and therapy, as well as respite care for family caregivers and bereavement support. From 1999 to 2005, the fastest growing non-cancer diagnoses in hospice care were Alzheimer's disease, debility not otherwise specified, adult failure to thrive, and senile dementia. These diagnoses were associated with very long lengths of stay. In 2007, over half of hospice patients were female (53.9%) and the majority were 65 years of age and older (82.8%), with 36.6% being 85 years and older. 5% of patients reported being of Hispanic or Latino origin, while almost 20% were minorities. Hospice organizations can be independent or freestanding agencies. In 2007, the majority of hospices were free-standing or independent agencies (58.3%), with others being hospital-based (20.8%), home health-based (19.7%), or nursing home-based (1.3%). The number of hospice providers increased from 3,000 in 1997 to 4,700 in 2007, with most recent growth in small free-standing and for-profit providers. Nearly half of hospice providers had a not-for-profit tax status (48.6%), while 47.1% were for-profit, and 4.3% were government-run programs. According to 2006 data from MedPAC, 68% of hospice providers are certified to participate in Medicare. Family caregivers provide emotional support, personal care, and medication assistance to loved ones in end-of-life care. Research shows caregiving can be demanding, but there is limited data on effective supportive interventions. Some caregivers may feel relief after the death of their family member. Hospice services like respite care, counseling, and bereavement support can help caregivers before and after the death. Costs of end-of-life care can be covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, out-of-pocket, or other sources. About one-fourth of total Medicare spending is for the last year of life. End-of-life care includes acute care in a hospital or palliative care in a hospice. The setting for care may depend on the predictability and timing of death. The majority of Medicare end-of-life costs are from inpatient hospital expenditures, with 56% of costs falling under this category. There is variation in end-of-life care costs by setting and geographic region. Terminally ill individuals may choose hospice care over curative treatment, while those with acute medical conditions may undergo aggressive procedures before death. In the period of 2001 to 2005, 56% of Medicare end-of-life costs were in acute care hospitals, including inpatient facility charges, physician visits, procedures, and tests. Other care settings like outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities, home health, and hospice accounted for smaller shares of end-of-life costs. Inpatient hospital services also make up a significant portion of total Medicare spending. Medicare spending in 2007 may not accurately reflect end-of-life hospital expenses but rather expensive care typically provided in a hospital setting. Individual spending varies based on factors like disease nature, access to care, social support, and personal beliefs. Hospice care has been shown to be 10-17% less costly than intensive hospital care in the last six months of life. The study found that savings from hospice use decrease when health care spending is viewed over an individual's last full year of life, ranging from 0% to 10%. This is due to expensive cancer treatments and high medical costs from chronic degenerative diseases. Hospice spending per user increased by nearly 8% between 2004 and 2005, while overall spending on hospice care grew by 18%. This increase cannot be fully explained by Medicare enrollment or costs. During the period 2001 to 2005, Medicare enrollment increased 1.7% and per capita spending increased 6.9%. Hospice expenditures rose due to longer stays, influenced by changes in patient mix with conditions like Alzheimer's disease and congestive heart failure. Geographic variation in end-of-life care costs is attributed to physician practice patterns rather than disease prevalence among chronically ill patients. During 2001-2005, Medicare spending for end-of-life care varied across states. Thirteen states exceeded the national average of $46,412, with some states spending over 20% more. Factors like hospital beds and physician availability influenced higher spending rates, known as \"supply-sensitive\" care. The study found significant geographic variation in utilization and costs of healthcare services, particularly in the last six months of life. Hospital length of stay varied greatly between regions, with no clear correlation between increased utilization and higher quality care or better health outcomes. These findings support previous research on the relationship between patient preferences and end-of-life care spending. In a study, authors found no statistical relationship between patient preferences and regional variation in end-of-life care spending. Laws have been developed at the state level to address end-of-life care decisions, with all 50 states and the District of Columbia passing laws on the matter. State laws vary regarding advance directives, which are statements indicating a person's medical treatment wishes in case of future incompetence. Oregon is the only state to legalize physician-assisted suicide. Advance directives include living wills and health care powers of attorney. Federal laws also address advance directives under Medicare and Medicaid. Advance directives, such as living wills and health care powers of attorney, can address medical questions during periods of incompetence, including terminal illness. Living wills specify the type of medical care desired or withheld when a patient cannot communicate, and physicians must honor these instructions or transfer the patient to another who will. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) requires certain healthcare providers participating in Medicare and/or Medicaid to follow specified advance directive laws. This document identifies a health care proxy for the patient when they are unable to make health decisions. Federal law defers to state law for end-of-life care decisions, but Congress has passed laws related to advance directives for providers receiving federal funding or military personnel. The PSDA mandates Medicare and Medicaid participating providers to have written policies on advance directives, including informing individuals of their rights to make medical decisions and documenting if they have an advance directive. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) requires Medicare and Medicaid providers to have written policies on advance directives, including informing individuals of their rights and ensuring compliance with state laws. Payment for prepaid organizations is contingent on meeting these requirements. Additionally, hospitals and nursing homes must distribute information about advance directives based on specific medical events. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) mandates that healthcare providers inform individuals about advance directives at specific medical events. Non-compliance may result in payment withholding for Medicare-certified providers. Medicaid law does not have a similar requirement. State laws allowing objections based on conscience supersede the PSDA. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) requires healthcare providers to educate individuals about advance directives and their right to make healthcare decisions. A 1995 GAO report found that providers generally comply with PSDA requirements, but there may be challenges in documenting whether a patient has an advance directive. The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) mandates healthcare providers to inform individuals about advance directives. Challenges may arise in documenting a patient's advance directive status. Other laws, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, address advance directives and end-of-life care planning. The law defines \"end-of-life planning\" as information on preparing advance directives and physician willingness to follow them. In a Senate hearing, a witness mentioned the minimal requirement of providing patients with more information. In cases where no advance directive is completed or state law does not cover a specific medical circumstance, individuals may still make decisions leading to a patient's death. This was seen in the Cruzan v. Missouri Department of Health case, where Nancy Cruzan was in a persistent vegetative state and artificial nutrition was deemed necessary. Despite Missouri's Living Will statute not being in effect at the time, it did not allow for the withdrawal of nutrition or hydration tubes. The Missouri legislature did not allow for the withdrawal of nutrition or hydration tubes even with the patient's written consent. The Cruzan case presented legal issues to the Supreme Court regarding Nancy Cruzan's right to consent to withdrawal of nutrition and hydration, and the standard of proof required to show her intent. The Supreme Court ruled that clear and convincing evidence of her wishes was necessary, and as her guardians lacked sufficient proof, the nutrition and hydration could not be withdrawn. Under the Cruzan case, the Supreme Court presumed that individuals have a right to refuse medical treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. This has raised public awareness about advance directives, although the majority of adults have not established a health care proxy or power of attorney. Only 37% of adults had established a health care proxy or durable power of attorney for health care, and 36% had created a living will. Older adults were more likely to have an advance directive, such as a health care proxy (51%) or living will (47%). Those in excellent or very good health were most likely to have completed an advance directive. Having advance directives for all patients could help resolve end-of-life care issues, but there can be blurred boundaries in following individuals' treatment wishes. The clear-cut presumption to follow individuals' treatment wishes can become blurred due to various factors such as incapacity to create advance directives, lack of awareness by emergency providers, unavailability of advance directives in unfamiliar facilities, conflicting desires for treatment, legal restrictions on certain treatments, and potential disagreements with family members leading to legal actions against healthcare providers. Patients may also change their preferences after executing an advance directive. The topic of end-of-life care and the challenges it poses for the healthcare system have been discussed in the medical ethics arena for years. Ethics committees play a role in helping resolve ethically difficult situations, including those that may arise at the end of life in healthcare institutions. Ethics committees in healthcare institutions play a role in resolving ethically difficult situations, including those at the end of life. Membership typically includes healthcare providers, clergy, ethicists, lay persons, and lawyers. Consultations may be requested by health professionals, patients, or family members for input on difficult decisions or disagreements, resulting in non-binding recommendations. Ethics consultations in healthcare institutions provide non-binding recommendations to resolve conflicts and difficult decisions, potentially reducing hospital days and treatment costs for patients in the ICU. Despite the widespread availability of consultation services, many doctors are hesitant to seek ethics help. Questions remain about ethicists' training and performance, with training typically covering healthcare facility practices, ethics committees' roles, relevant laws, and regulations. Ethics committees play a crucial role in healthcare, providing training in medical ethics and discussing relevant laws and regulations. Training covers ethical principles like autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Debates exist on training and accreditation requirements for committee members. End-of-life care is a critical aspect of healthcare services, presenting challenges and opportunities for quality measurement. End-of-life care quality measurement and improvement focus on palliative care, patient and family satisfaction, patient wishes, spiritual needs, living will documentation, and family presence at death. Initiatives aim to enhance hospice and palliative care quality through consensus-based measures and patient empowerment. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is working to improve end-of-life care by empowering patients, updating conditions of participation for hospice providers, and incorporating quality improvement activities. Patients are now required to be more involved in developing their care plan, reflecting a shift towards patient-centered care. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is updating conditions of participation for hospice providers to improve end-of-life care. Patients are now required to be actively involved in developing their care plan, including the ability to refuse treatment and choose their own physician. Hospice providers must assess their quality performance and involve physicians in improvement activities. The Medicare program has implemented a quality reporting program for physicians to move towards value-driven healthcare. The Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) evolved from the Physician Voluntary Reporting Program (PVRP) in 2006. PQRI offers a 2.0% annual bonus payment for meeting quality measure reporting requirements. CMS started collecting quality data from Medicare physicians in 2007. The program includes geriatrics measures, such as advance care plans. The geriatrics measures in the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative include assessing if patients aged 65 and older have an advance care plan or surrogate decision maker documented in their medical record. If not documented, physicians are prompted to discuss reasons with the patient. The development of clinical practice guidelines in palliative and hospice care was undertaken by the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP) and the National Quality Forum (NQF), resulting in two key documents. The NCP focuses on education and dissemination of these guidelines to healthcare professionals and the public. The National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP) and the National Quality Forum (NQF) developed clinical practice guidelines to improve palliative care programs, establish national goals, and ensure quality palliative care across different settings. The NQF initiated a project to endorse a framework for quality palliative and hospice care practices. The NQF's work aims to establish quality measures for palliative care, potentially impacting areas like reimbursement and regulation. As the population ages, Congress may need to consider expanding federal support for end-of-life care research and programs. The federal government may need to consider increasing support for research and programs on end-of-life care, which could involve funding new or existing programs. There are differing opinions on whether the federal government should provide additional assistance to states or individuals and families in planning and delivering end-of-life care services. Some believe the federal government has limited responsibility in this matter. Congress may ultimately decide against providing additional federal assistance. Policymakers are considering expanding the federal government's role in end-of-life care by focusing on training health professionals, end-of-life care planning, support for family caregivers, and other policy issues. Emphasis is placed on educating health professionals about palliative care, pain management, and decision-making support services. Health professionals need to focus on improving pain and symptom management, as well as communication skills for discussing end-of-life decisions with patients and families. Training and education can help physicians feel more comfortable addressing death, care expectations, and patient preferences. Policymakers are considering various initiatives, such as federal grant programs, to enhance palliative care training for healthcare providers. Some policymakers propose grants for research on palliative care and end-of-life topics, incentives for training in palliative care, education for nursing staff in long-term care, and consumer education on advance directives. Individuals may have misconceptions about advance directives, such as the need for a lawyer to draft them or the difficulty in changing decisions. Doctors may not always be aware of a patient's advance directive. Medicare and Medicaid only require certain providers to note if a patient has one. Advance directive content is governed by state laws, with variations in recognition across states. Policymakers suggest public information campaigns to educate individuals on end-of-life care planning. Physicians treating severe illnesses like cancer may be hesitant to discuss end-of-life care planning. One way to encourage end-of-life care planning is by requiring conversations between patients and health professionals. Studies show that such discussions lead to less aggressive medical care and earlier hospice referrals, improving patient quality of life near death. Policymakers are considering federal legislation to address these issues. Policymakers are considering federal legislation to improve end-of-life care decision making, including enhanced communication between health professionals and patients, inclusion of advance directives in medical records, and state portability of advance directives. Other proposals include standardized treatment preference documents, national public education campaigns, and a Department of Health and Human Services website for information and access to advance directives. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is developing a website to provide information and store advance directives for end-of-life care. A 2007 GAO study highlighted the importance of family caregiver support and communication in end-of-life care programs. State programs offer services such as respite care and bereavement support, but face challenges in targeting rural residents due to travel distances and limited community options. The federal government has established the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) to assist family caregivers of older adults. The program provides funding for services such as individual counseling, support groups, and respite care. Policymakers have suggested increasing funding for the NFCSP to meet the growing demand from caregivers. Other proposals include workplace accommodations for employed caregivers and tax credits for family caregivers. Funding for the NFCSP in FY2008 is $153.4 million. Policy issues related to improving end-of-life care services have been raised by stakeholders, covering topics such as funding for research, provider reimbursement, and quality of care. Some of these issues include developing new research for improved practices, modifying reimbursement policies to incentivize physician communication, allowing Medicare hospice beneficiaries to receive curative care alongside hospice benefits, integrating Medicare and Medicaid services for coordinated care, and addressing quality of care concerns. The provision of high quality end-of-life care involves coordinating care across different settings, addressing quality of care at the end of life, developing requirements for medical ethics committees, and enforcing prescription drug abuse regulations. It is a complex issue for policymakers due to varying preferences for treatment, cultural and spiritual attitudes towards death, and the need for care coordination and communication among health providers, individuals, and families. Public policy aiming to improve end-of-life care should address various issues such as training for health professionals, care planning, and support for family caregivers. Research on costs, service delivery, and quality measures can help policymakers enhance care at the end of life."
