    "content": "In recent years, congressional attention has focused on the roles and responsibilities of U.S. ambassadors serving as Chiefs of Mission in U.S. embassies abroad, especially after the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya in 2012. The debate on interagency reform for missions abroad highlights the need for better coordination among U.S. agencies, a key responsibility of ambassadors. The State Department and USAID's 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review emphasized the importance of equipping ambassadors for their roles. Congressional interest also stems from their role in selecting U.S. ambassadors. This report discusses the role and effectiveness of U.S. ambassadors and Chiefs of Mission (COM) abroad, focusing on their authority in coordinating interagency activities and overseeing U.S. forces in their assigned countries. It addresses common questions about COM authority and congressional concerns about its effectiveness and potential improvements. The report will be updated as needed. The \"Chief of Mission,\" or COM, is the title given to the principal officer in charge of each U.S. diplomatic mission abroad. This includes U.S. ambassadors leading embassies and other diplomatic personnel who may fill in when no ambassador is present. The President appoints ambassadors with Senate confirmation, and in the absence of a presidentially appointed ambassador, a career U.S. foreign service officer can be appointed as a charg\u00e9 d'affaires. The COM, appointed by the President, serves as the President's personal representative in leading diplomatic efforts for a specific mission abroad. Their role has expanded since World War II to oversee nearly all U.S. government activities in their assigned country, excluding military operations. The State Department/USAID 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) emphasizes the role of ambassadors as CEOs of multi-agency missions, leading and overseeing civilians from various federal agencies in foreign policy and assistance work. The QDDR aims to enhance the knowledge and skills of Chiefs of Mission (COMs) and their ability to lead country teams, recognizing the expertise civilian agencies bring to diplomacy and development efforts. The QDDR emphasizes the importance of government agencies working together overseas under Chief of Mission authority to build lasting relationships with foreign counterparts. Secretary of State Clinton announced that Chiefs of Mission would play a role in integrating country-level strategic plans and budgets. The authorities and responsibilities of COMs are outlined in the Foreign Service Act of 1980. COM authority is established through executive orders and directives, shaped by the President's constitutional powers in foreign affairs. State Department regulations emphasize the President's letter of instruction as key in determining a COM's authority. FSA 1980 outlines the three main components of COM authority: responsibilities, duties, and powers. The COM's authority is based on executive orders and directives, with the President's letter of instruction being crucial. FSA 1980 defines the three main components of COM authority: responsibilities, duties, and powers, including supervision of all Government executive branch employees in the country of assignment. The Chief of Mission (COM) is responsible for keeping informed about Government activities in the country of assignment and ensuring compliance of all executive branch employees with directives. One of the main duties of the U.S. Chief of Mission is to promote U.S. goods and services for export. The COM has authority over personnel in foreign countries, with the obligation for all executive branch agency employees to comply with applicable directives. The Chief of Mission (COM) must ensure compliance with directives by all executive branch employees in a foreign country. The COM is responsible for keeping the chief of mission informed about activities and operations of employees in that country. COM authority is limited to executive branch agencies, not including representatives of the judicial and legislative branches. The Chief of Mission (COM) is responsible for ensuring compliance with directives from the President's Letter of Instruction at each U.S. mission abroad. The Letter of Instruction and Section 207 of FSA 1980 outline the COM's authority and responsibilities, which do not contradict each other. Differences include personnel excluded from COM authority, such as VOA correspondents and staff of international organizations. The Chief of Mission (COM) is responsible for coordinating all U.S. government activities in a host country and being informed of all activities by U.S. government personnel. Executive orders have expanded the authority of COMs, dating back to concerns after World War II. President Truman's Executive Order 10338 directed the Chief of Mission to coordinate activities under the Mutual Security Act of 1951. The Chief of Mission (COM) oversees U.S. government activities in a host country under the Mutual Security Act of 1951. Executive orders have granted COMs broader authority over U.S. government agencies' activities in each country. Executive Order 10893 of 1960, still in effect, outlines the COM's responsibilities. The Chief of Mission (COM) has broad authority over U.S. government activities in foreign countries, as outlined in Executive Order 10893 of 1960. National Security Decision Directive 38 of June 1982 requires COM approval for changes in staff at diplomatic posts. The COM is responsible for coordinating and supervising agency functions in their respective countries. The President requires the Secretary of State to direct each Chief of Mission (COM) to review staff elements every five years and resolve disputes through NSDD-38 process. Mission structure agreements are often outlined in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the COM and U.S. government agencies. The Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and Foreign Affairs Handbook (FAH) detail COM authority based on legislative and executive directives. The Chief of Mission (COM) has overall authority over U.S. diplomatic missions abroad, determining the mission's structure and integrating all activities within a host country. They supervise attach\u00e9s from other executive branch agencies, including Department of Defense attach\u00e9s, under the President's Letters of Instruction and E.O. 10893. The COM, as the President's representative, is supervised by the Secretary of State and supported by the regional Assistant Secretary of State. The Chief of Mission (COM) has authority over U.S. diplomatic missions abroad, coordinating activities within a host country. The Secretary of State ensures security for all U.S. government personnel, including branches of government, under the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. The COM is responsible for personnel security, except for VOA personnel and those under a GCC. A memorandum of understanding between the State Department and DOD in 1997 addresses the security of DOD personnel in foreign countries. Additional memoranda of agreement must be executed in each country to define security responsibilities. The Chief of Mission (COM) oversees U.S. diplomatic missions abroad and coordinates activities within a host country. The COM has authority over personnel security, except for VOA personnel and those under a GCC. The NSDD-38 process ensures that the COM approves all changes in agency operations in a host country. The COM must approve entry into a host country for all personnel, including those on temporary duty. The COM maintains supervisory authority over all personnel operating in a foreign country or at a U.S. mission abroad. The Chief of Mission (COM) oversees U.S. diplomatic missions abroad and has authority over personnel security. The COM must approve all changes in agency operations in a host country, including additions or subtractions of personnel. Contractors working for commercial firms in a host country are not under COM authority, but any engagement changing an agency's presence requires COM approval. Common questions about COM authority are addressed, including its extent over Department of Defense personnel and in countries without a U.S. embassy. The COM's authority extends to all DOD personnel in a country except those under a GCC's command. An ambassador is responsible for overseeing in-country military personnel through various statutes and directives. Section 207 of the FSA 1980 places executive branch personnel under COM authority, with specified exclusions. The relationship between COMs and military personnel may vary due to different perceptions of responsibilities. The COM's authority extends to military personnel such as Marine security guards, Defense Attach\u00e9, and personnel in Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs) under specified provisions of the FAA and AECA. The FSA 1980 exclusion is reiterated in the Presidential Letter of Instruction received by each ambassador. Additional provisions of law create overlapping COM responsibilities for certain military personnel stationed abroad. The FAA 1961 places military personnel serving in a SCO under COM supervision. NSDD 38 of June 1982 requires COM approval for changes in staff at diplomatic posts. The COM is responsible for coordinating DOD recommendations on military assistance and training programs with political and economic considerations. Special COM authorities are conveyed by presidential order or directive, such as NSPD-36 of May 11, 2004. NSPD-36 of May 11, 2004, assigned the Secretary of State and the U.S. Central Command with overseeing assistance for Iraq and coordinating efforts to train Iraqi security forces. The Chief of Mission provides policy guidance to the Commander, ensuring close cooperation between them. COMs do not have authority over GCCs, but they are expected to maintain a cooperative relationship. Executive branch agencies with employees in a foreign country must keep the COM informed. The Chief of Mission provides policy guidance to the Commander, ensuring close cooperation between them. COMs do not have authority over GCCs, but they are expected to maintain a cooperative relationship. Executive branch agencies with employees in a foreign country must keep the COM \"fully and currently informed with respect to all activities and operations of its employees in that country,\" as directed by legislation and presidential directive. Communication is expected to flow both ways, with differences of opinion to be reported to Washington.

Communication is expected to flow both ways, with differences of opinion to be reported to Washington. Abroad, DOD personnel under COM authority may be delegated to the GCC if negotiated in a memorandum of agreement. SOF forces deployed under the GCC are not subject to COM authority but may operate under it depending on the activity being performed. The Special Operations Command (SOCOM) commander, not a GCC, may lead special operations missions under the President's or Secretary of Defense's direction. These missions are outside COM or GCC authority, with the relationship clarified in the President's directive. The COM serves as the President and Secretary of State's representative on the ground, impacting military activities. The Secretary of State is responsible for coordinating U.S. government activities abroad, including military assistance. The Chief of Mission (COM) is sometimes seen as best-placed to carry out these responsibilities, but there is inconsistency in practice. Congress has mandated a COM role in specific military activities, such as requiring approval for Special Operations Forces to support foreign forces. Special Operations Forces can provide support to foreign forces combating terrorism with approval. SOCOM Directive 350-3 requires coordination with ambassadors and State for training events. Congress exempted Voice of America correspondents from COM authority in 2002, allowing them journalistic independence. Decisions on news coverage should adhere to journalistic standards of objectivity and independence, regardless of diplomatic relations or geographic constraints. Despite limited access, countries with severed ties may still have authorized COMs overseeing diplomatic relations and U.S. government activities. Despite limited access, authorized COMs oversee diplomatic relations and U.S. government activities in countries with severed ties. In some cases, ambassadors cover multiple states and exercise COM authority over several countries simultaneously. Online websites also serve as virtual diplomatic posts to extend U.S. diplomatic presence to countries without physical representation. In cases of irregular government changes or collapses, COM's authority remains unchanged under U.S. law. Diplomatic relations are maintained between states, not governments, even in the absence of a clear government. COM establishes communication guidelines in line with U.S. non-recognition policies during political upheavals in foreign countries. In accordance with U.S. policy, government representatives must follow guidelines. COM authority in a country continues unless there is a permanent withdrawal of ambassador, closure of diplomatic facilities, and evacuation of personnel. The President decides to close a U.S. diplomatic mission in emergency situations or when diplomatic relations end. The President has the final decision to close any U.S. diplomatic mission. U.S. ambassadors and charg\u00e9s d'affaires in Iraq and Afghanistan had COM authority during conflicts, coordinating with the GCC. A non-permissive security environment in a conflict zone may limit a COM's options. When Congress declares war or armed conflict exists, the ambassador or COM must act accordingly. When Congress declares war or armed conflict exists, the ambassador or COM must act accordingly, with the President having the final decision to close any U.S. diplomatic mission. The COM authority does not extend to the legislative branch, but State Department guidelines emphasize the COM's role as the President's representative to a foreign government. Coordination with the COM is necessary for any relations with a foreign government, as seen in historical examples like Ambassador Joseph Grew leaving Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The State Department's Bureau of Legislative Affairs informs U.S. missions abroad of planned visits by Members of Congress and their staffs. The COM advises on local conditions for congressional travel and is responsible for their security in the host country. An MOU between the State Department and the GAO places GAO personnel under the COM's authority for overseas activities. The State Department's 2010 QDDR emphasized the importance of capable COMs acting as CEOs of U.S. embassies. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of individual ambassadors and COMs in managing their embassies and exerting their authority. Congress plays a role in setting standards and providing resources for COMs. Weaknesses in COM leadership and management were identified by the State Department's Office of Inspector General in a 2012 report, leading to reduced productivity and morale at diplomatic posts abroad. These weaknesses are related to basic leadership and management principles, hindering COMs from effectively coordinating activities of U.S. government agencies in a country. Former U.S. ambassador highlighted the challenge of COMs asserting and protecting their authority over other executive branch officials. The State Department's Office of Inspector General identified weaknesses in COM leadership and management in a 2012 report, hindering their ability to coordinate activities of U.S. government agencies in a country. Former U.S. ambassador highlighted the challenge of COMs asserting and protecting their authority over other executive branch officials, as their authority can easily be undermined by actual practices. The State Department's Office of Inspector General identified weaknesses in COM leadership and management in a 2012 report, hindering their ability to coordinate activities of U.S. government agencies in a country. Various proposals have been made to improve COM authority, including selecting potential ambassadors with interagency experience and enhancing COM education and training at the Foreign Service Institute. This includes a new handbook on COM interagency leadership and emphasizing COM authority in coordinating and supervising all U.S. government activities related to a mission. The State Department's Office of Inspector General highlighted deficiencies in COM leadership and management in a 2012 report, impacting their ability to coordinate U.S. government agencies in a country. Recommendations include selecting ambassadors with interagency experience, improving COM education and training, and implementing a performance assessment system to monitor COM performance. However, doubts remain about the effectiveness of these measures without support from officials in Washington to overcome agency interests and pressures on a country team.

Recommendations include selecting ambassadors with interagency experience, improving COM education and training, and implementing a performance assessment system to monitor COM performance. It has been suggested that documents on COM authority be provided to all regional assistant and deputy assistant secretaries to improve relations between Department bureaus in Washington and COMs in the field. U.S. ambassadors and others exercising COM authority are by law the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy coordination in their respective countries. The U.S. Chiefs of Mission play a crucial role in overseeing activities and managing representatives from various U.S. government entities in their respective countries. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of current efforts to improve COM coordination, including the adequacy of training for new ambassadors, the need for interagency experience for prospective COMs, and the sufficiency of leadership training courses for effective management at the COM level. Members of Congress may need to assess these issues to ensure better interagency coordination. State Department leaders must ensure that leaders and managers at the COM and Deputy COM level, agency representatives on country teams, and their supervisors in Washington understand and comply with their obligations to the COM."
