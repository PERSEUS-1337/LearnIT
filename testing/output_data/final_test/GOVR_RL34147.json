    "content": "The U.S. EPA regulates hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), with states having the option to enforce stricter standards. Household hazardous waste, including electronic waste (e-waste), is a focus for many states. E-waste refers to obsolete or broken electronic equipment like TVs, computers, laptops, cell phones, and gaming systems. State and local agencies are concerned about landfill disposal or incineration due to hazardous constituents. Recycling e-waste involves sorting for reusable devices, demanufacturing for resale of component parts, and extracting materials like metals and glass. The challenge of financing e-waste collection and recycling programs is a concern for many states. Legislation has been enacted in 14 states to regulate e-waste recycling and disposal practices, leading to potential compliance issues for electronics manufacturers and retailers. Congressional hearings in 2005 addressed e-waste issues, resulting in the formation of the Congressional E-Waste Working Group. The E-Waste Working Group was established to address the e-waste management issue at a national level. With increased state legislative activity, stakeholders are calling for federal legislation on e-waste management. The report discusses key issues leading to state action, common elements in state waste laws, and an overview of enacted state laws. The volume of e-waste in the US is growing due to rapid technological advances in electronics. EPA's 2007 study aimed to gather more data on electronic products in the US. In 2007, EPA completed a study on electronic products in the US. The study found that almost half of products sold between 1980 and 2004 were still in use, while 42% were recycled or disposed of, and 9% were in storage. EPA estimated that 1.9 to 2.2 million tons of electronics became obsolete in 2005, with 1.5 to 1.9 million tons discarded in landfills. E-waste comprises about 2% of municipal solid waste, but this percentage is expected to grow as consumers replace old electronics. The increased use of flat-screen televisions and computer monitors has led to concerns about the growing volume of e-waste. States and waste management agencies are interested in diverting these items from landfills due to their potential for reuse or recycling. E-waste contains toxic components like lead, mercury, and other heavy metals, making proper disposal essential. Hazardous materials like mercury, lead, and flame retardants are commonly used in electronic devices to ensure consumer safety. When e-waste is disposed of in landfills or incinerated, these toxic components can be released into the environment. Recycling options are crucial to minimize the disposal of hazardous substances and prevent pollution. The cost of state recycling programs includes expenses for collecting, transporting, and sorting devices, as well as recycling fees charged by recyclers and refurbishers. These costs are higher than the revenue generated from recycled commodities or refurbished units. Recyclers must handle hazardous components and comply with strict regulations under RCRA for hazardous waste storage, transportation, and disposal. Some stakeholders suggest increasing volume to lower processing costs for electronics recycling. Redirecting household e-waste could provide a steady supply for recyclers. Consumers face cost and inconvenience barriers to recycling electronics, with some manufacturers offering free recycling while others charge fees for drop-off or shipping. Many stakeholders believe that e-waste recycling should be made convenient and inexpensive for consumers. Pilot programs have shown success in providing free and convenient recycling services. States are looking to establish e-waste management programs to secure financing for collection, transportation, and recycling. The National Electronics Product Stewardship Initiative (NEPSI) was formed in 2001 by stakeholders to develop a system for maximizing the collection, reuse, and recycling of used electronics. Various groups have debated the best approach to managing e-waste, with a consensus that infrastructure for recycling has not kept pace with the growth of e-waste. NEPSI was formed in 2001 to maximize collection, reuse, and recycling of electronics. By 2004, the group was divided on financing a nationwide recycling system, with one camp supporting a consumer-paid advance recycling fee and the other advocating a \"producer pays\" model. States have implemented their own e-waste management laws due to the absence of federal legislation. Fourteen states have enacted laws ranging from banning landfill disposal of CRTs to implementing collection and recycling programs. These laws typically cover specified electronic devices, outline financing for recycling programs, and include criteria to minimize environmental and health impacts. State e-waste management programs aim to minimize impacts on human health and the environment by setting restrictions on products that can be lawfully sold. Covered electronic devices (CEDs) include CRTs in computer monitors and televisions above a designated screen size. CEDs may also include desktop computers, flat panel monitors, laptops, combination units, and peripheral devices. State e-waste management programs regulate the sale of electronic devices like keyboards, printers, fax machines, DVD players, cell phones, etc. The funding for e-waste collection and recycling programs is a contentious issue, with options including consumer-paid or producer-paid systems. Managing orphan waste, which is e-waste without a clear responsible party, is also a key consideration. Orphan waste, e-waste with no identifiable manufacturer, poses a challenge in e-waste management programs. Washington State found over 1,200 orphan brands in its e-waste stream. One financing method is the advanced recycling fee (ARF) paid by consumers at the point of sale for designated electronics. The ARF proceeds fund the state's e-waste collection infrastructure. The ARF is a fee paid by consumers at the point of sale for designated electronics to fund the state's e-waste collection infrastructure and recycling programs. The suggested ARF ranges from $6 to $10 per device and can be managed by a state commission or a third-party organization. Retailers may keep a percentage of the fee for administrative costs, and the ARF approach is favored by certain electronics manufacturers. Some stakeholders support the ARF system for electronics, arguing it would create sustainable funding for recycling, be simple to implement, and raise consumer awareness. Opponents believe it may not work for online sales, lack incentives for eco-friendly products, and risk funds being diverted for other uses. Manufacturers would need to finance recycling programs under this approach. To implement a collection and recycling program for e-waste, companies can use an extended producer responsibility (EPR) model where they finance their share of waste recycling. This approach is supported by environmental organizations, retailers, and manufacturers with existing recycling programs. Manufacturers implementing their own recycling programs have flexibility in design, making them more likely to create products easier to recycle. Opponents argue that assigning recycling costs to manufacturers could lead to costly sorting and increased consumer costs. State e-waste programs aim to reduce landfill disposal by implementing various collection and recycling criteria to protect human health and the environment. Maryland has a unique producer-pays model where manufacturers pay a flat fee to sell their products, funding a grant program for e-waste recycling. Other states do not specify collection methods but share the goal of reducing e-waste, particularly CRTs. Some states have banned the disposal of CEDs in landfills or incinerators to promote e-waste recycling. States like Arkansas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island have implemented landfill or incineration bans without funding collection programs. In some cases, a landfill ban precedes the establishment of a recycling program, while in others, a recycling program must be in place before the ban takes effect. Consumers are not required to recycle, placing the responsibility on municipal governments to manage e-waste properly. The Department of Commerce reports that a significant amount of e-waste is sent overseas for recycling due to higher costs in the United States. States with disposal bans on CRTs may export e-waste if recycling infrastructure is lacking. Recyclers often export e-waste to countries like China. Some states ban e-waste exports to countries like China over concerns of inadequate recycling practices and worker protection. State programs aim to prevent harmful disposal methods by setting recycling standards through their environmental protection agencies. Some stakeholders oppose the use of UNICOR in e-waste recycling programs due to unfair competition and health and safety concerns for inmate workers. Some states have banned the use of prison labor in their recycling programs. Most state e-waste laws require manufacturers to meet conditions before selling products in the state, including labeling devices with the manufacturer's information. Manufacturers must register with the state, pay fees, and provide varying information in their registrations. State e-waste laws may require registration for e-waste collectors, transporters, and recyclers to receive payment. Some laws align with the RoHS Directive, banning certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Manufacturers must comply with these regulations when selling products. Manufacturers selling electronic equipment in EU member states were required to substitute hazardous substances by July 6, 2006. It is likely that manufacturers selling products in the United States will also meet the RoHS Directive requirements. California is the only state with RoHS-like provisions in its e-waste law, prohibiting the sale of electronic devices that do not meet the directive. Other states may follow suit, making retailers responsible for enforcing the law by not selling non-compliant electronic devices. State e-waste laws aim to regulate the sale of certain electronic devices to promote recycling. Arkansas enacted the Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act in 2001, applying to various electronic equipment. Each state has different methods to achieve their recycling goals. The Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act in Arkansas prohibits the disposal of electronic equipment in landfills and requires state agencies to sell, reuse, recycle, or donate surplus electronics. Funds generated from selling surplus electronics are allocated to a Computer and Electronics Recycling Fund for research and development grants. California's Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003, enacted on September 24, 2003, requires consumers to pay an electronic waste recycling fee when purchasing certain electronic devices. The law aims to establish statewide contracts for recycling businesses and promote efficient collection and processing of electronic equipment. The Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003 in California requires consumers to pay a recycling fee for certain electronic devices. The fees are transferred to the Board of Equalization, which then deposits the money into an account managed by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB). The CIWMB distributes the funds to approved recyclers or manufacturers collecting and recycling CEDs. Additional requirements include labeling of CEDs, restrictions on exporting CED waste, banning the sale of certain electronic devices, and prohibiting landfill disposal of CRTs. Connecticut enacted an e-waste recycling law in 2007, requiring manufacturers to participate in a program for collecting and recycling electronic devices by January 2009. Manufacturers must register with the state Department of Environmental Protection, pay an annual fee for the recycling program, and cover the costs of recycling. Municipalities must also provide for the collection of electronic devices, which will then be transported to and recycled by approved recyclers. Connecticut's e-waste program requires manufacturers to register, pay fees for recycling, and cover transportation costs. Retailers must label devices, provide recycling information, and ban export of collected devices posing risks. A landfill disposal ban will be in effect by January 2011. Maine enacted the Act to Protect Public Health and the Environment in 2011, requiring manufacturers to pay for the recycling of waste televisions and computer monitors. Municipalities must ensure recycling of these devices by July 20, 2006. Beginning January 1, 2006, consolidation facilities in Maine were tasked with counting household-generated waste televisions and computer monitors, providing annual accounting to the state Department of Environmental Protection by March 1 of each year, and submitting recycling costs to manufacturers. Additionally, all CEDs sold in the state must meet specific requirements. Maine's e-waste program requires CEDs sold in the state to have a visible manufacturer label. Retailers cannot sell non-compliant devices. Recyclers must meet environmental guidelines. A ban on landfill disposal of mercury products and CRTs is in place. Maryland's Electronic Recycling Program started in 2005 and applies to manufacturers of certain display devices. Maryland's e-waste program requires manufacturers of certain display devices to register with the state and pay a registration fee. Fees collected are used to fund local recycling plans. Retailers must sell only CEDs from registered manufacturers. Maryland's e-waste program requires manufacturers to register and implement their own takeback program. A ban on landfill disposal of CRTs has been in effect since 2000. The state offers free electronics recycling for municipalities and enacted a law in 2007 for e-waste recycling, including computers, peripherals, and video display devices. Manufacturers must register with the state starting July 1, 2007. Starting July 1, 2007, manufacturers in Maryland must register and pay a registration fee based on the number of units sold. They also need to pay for collection and recycling of their e-waste, meet specific recycling goals, and pay a variable recycling fee based on the weight of CEDs sold. Minnesota is the only state with mandatory recycling goals, requiring manufacturers to recycle 60% of the total weight of CEDs sold in the state in the first year, increasing to 80% in subsequent years. In Minnesota, retailers must report the number and type of video display devices sold, CEDs must be labeled with manufacturer's name, manufacturers and recyclers must register with the state, manufacturers must report non-compliant CEDs, recyclers cannot use prison labor, and there is a ban on landfill disposal of CRTs. New Hampshire banned landfill disposal and incineration of video display devices on July 1, 2006. The ban defined video display devices as components of TVs or computers larger than four inches diagonally. New Jersey enacted the Electronic Waste Recycling Act on January 13, 2008, applying to computers, monitors, portable computers, and televisions sold to consumers starting February 1, 2009. Beginning February 1, 2009, CED manufacturers in New Jersey must register with the state DEP and pay a $5,000 fee annually. They must participate in a statewide CED collection and recycling program based on their return share in weight. Manufacturers must label their products with their brand, and retailers can only sell CED that is properly labeled and compliant with the law. Retailers in New Jersey must post DEP-provided recycling information for CEDs, follow recycling criteria, and meet performance requirements. Manufacturers and retailers must comply with RoHS requirements by January 1, 2010. CED recycling programs are prohibited from using prison labor or exporting CEDs unsafely. North Carolina's Solid Waste Management Act of 2007 includes provisions for managing CEDs. The law in New Jersey requires manufacturers of computer equipment to register with the state, pay fees, and label their products for sale. They must also submit a recycling plan within 120 days of registration. Manufacturers in New Jersey must submit recycling plans that include take-back programs, financing details, and transportation methods for discarded equipment. They can collaborate with other manufacturers for these plans. The law requires environmentally sound management practices for recycling, annual reports on recycling rates, and registration with the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources for public education and technical assistance. Oregon passed its e-waste recycling law on June 7, 2007, requiring manufacturers to finance recycling services for televisions, computer monitors, and computers. Manufacturers can create their own take-back program or participate in a common program, covering collection, transportation, and recycling costs. Registration with the state and an annual fee based on market share are also mandatory. Oregon's e-waste recycling law mandates manufacturers to finance recycling services for certain electronic devices. The state Department of Environmental Quality will oversee the program, including maintaining a list of registered manufacturers, establishing a state contractor program for recycling, and setting recycling fees. Retailers must provide information on recycling options to consumers at the time of sale. Manufacturers are required to label their products with their brand before selling in the state. Rhode Island prohibits the landfill disposal of certain electronic devices under the Electronic Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling Act. The law requires proper labeling of consumer electronic devices (CED) by manufacturers and retailers. The ban on landfill disposal took effect on January 1, 2010, with provisions for postponement in areas lacking adequate recycling systems. The prohibited devices include desktop computers, monitors, laptops, televisions, and similar video display devices with screens larger than four inches diagonally. The law in Rhode Island prohibits landfill disposal of certain electronic devices, including CEDs, with a ban effective since January 1, 2010. After July 1, 2008, CEDs must be recycled or disposed of as hazardous waste. The state Department of Environmental Management is required to develop a plan for collection, recycling, and reuse of covered electronic products, with progress reports due to the general assembly. Texas also enacted an e-waste recycling law for computer equipment in June 2007. Texas's e-waste program requires manufacturers to provide a free recycling program for computer equipment. Manufacturers must label their products, retailers can only sell labeled products from registered manufacturers, and recycling standards must be followed. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality oversees the program and educates the public on recycling options. Washington passed its e-waste recycling law in 2006, applying to CRTs, flat panel computer monitors, and desktop or laptop computers. Manufacturers must finance and implement a recycling program according to state requirements, with the option to propose their own plan for approval. Registration and annual fees are mandatory for manufacturers. Manufacturers in Washington must pay annual administrative fees and apportioned costs for the Standard Plan by January 1, 2008. The state's Department of Ecology must report to the legislature by April 1, 2010, on orphan waste collection. If over 10% of products collected are orphaned, recommendations for reducing them or alternative financing methods are required. Additional elements include labeling CED products with the manufacturer's brand and establishing performance standards for CED processors. The management of CED processors in Washington includes financial assurances for proper closure, consumer information on recycling locations, and registration requirements for collectors, transporters, and recyclers. The use of federal or state prison labor for CED processing is prohibited."
