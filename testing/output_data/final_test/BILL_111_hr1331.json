The mortgagor must withdraw all or substantially all equity in the property subject to the existing mortgage to be refinanced.

The maximum loan amount for the insured mortgage shall not exceed the applicable dollar limit. The refinanced mortgage must have a fixed interest rate for the entire term and a maturity of at least 30 years. The Secretary may establish an exit fee.
