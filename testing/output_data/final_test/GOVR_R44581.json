    "content": "Human trafficking involves the exploitation of men, women, and children for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. It is a global issue that victimizes millions of people and generates billions of dollars in criminal profits. Despite international efforts, human trafficking persists in almost every country. The State Department releases an annual report on international human trafficking, known as the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. The TIP Report categorizes countries into four tiers based on their efforts to address human trafficking. Only 19.5% of countries were fully compliant with minimum standards, with the rest varying in their level of effort. Tier 3 countries, the least compliant, included Burma, Djibouti, Haiti, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Suriname, and Turkmenistan. The 2016 Global Slavery Index report estimated that 45.8 million individuals worldwide were exploited through human trafficking, forced labor, debt bondage, forced marriage, or sexual exploitation. This report provides country-by-country estimates of modern slavery, in contrast to the TIP Report which categorizes countries based on government efforts. The 2016 Global Slavery Index reported countries with high prevalence and absolute numbers of modern slavery, including North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia, India, Qatar, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Eritrea, Equatorial Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 2014 UNODC report highlighted human trafficking in New Guinea, Guinea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan. It identified 124 countries with trafficking victims from 152 nationalities between 2010 and 2012, cautioning that the actual prevalence is likely higher than reported. Operations ranged from individuals exploiting others to sophisticated transnational criminal syndicates. The ILO estimated that 20.9 million people were subjected to forced labor in 2012, generating $150 billion in illegal profits annually. Two-thirds of this came from commercial sexual exploitation, with key sectors including construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. The U.S. government has been actively involved in combating human trafficking. The U.S. government has played a leading role in combating human trafficking through various legislative acts, including the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its subsequent amendments. Other related legislation includes the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. Additionally, international aspects of human trafficking have been addressed through appropriations and the International Megan's Law. Several legislative acts have been enacted to combat human trafficking, including the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its amendments. Other related legislation includes the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. Additionally, international efforts have been made through appropriations and the International Megan's Law. Various administrations have also taken steps to enhance U.S. responses to human trafficking, such as issuing executive orders to prohibit products produced by forced or indentured child labor and combat trafficking in persons. President Obama highlighted the fight against human trafficking as a key human rights cause at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2012. The U.S. Department of State leads federal efforts in combating human trafficking, with the Secretary of State chairing the President's Interagency Task Force on Trafficking in Persons. The State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons administers anti-trafficking grants and prepares the congressionally mandated TIP Report annually. The J/TIP Office is one of seven units reporting to the Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. Established in 2000, it is led by Susan Coppedge and advises the Secretary of State on human trafficking, coordinates foreign assistance programs, and oversees the annual TIP Report publication. In FY2015, J/TIP awarded over $18 million in grants to combat human trafficking. J/TIP supports the Secretary of State in addressing human trafficking priorities, liaises with the legislative branch, and coordinates with international organizations. Secretary Kerry convened the PITF meeting in January 2016, where officials provided updates on anti-trafficking activities. He committed to raising human trafficking issues in bilateral meetings and addressing supply chain transparency. The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reported that human trafficking has been a national intelligence collection priority since 2012. The State Department addresses human trafficking issues through various bureaus and offices, such as the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Affairs (DRL) and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). DRL leads efforts to address human rights issues, including child soldiers, and publishes annual Country Reports on Human Rights. The U.S. government addresses human trafficking issues through various agencies, including the State Department, USAID, and other departments like Labor, Justice, Defense, and Treasury. USAID administers foreign assistance for anti-trafficking projects and released a Counter-Trafficking in Persons Policy in 2012. In 2012, USAID released a Counter-Trafficking in Persons Policy and in 2013, a Field Guide. DOL supports projects addressing exploitative child labor and releases updated lists of products produced by forced or indentured child labor. DOJ provides international technical assistance on human trafficking with funding from the State Department and USAID. The Attorney General reports to Congress on U.S. government activities to combat trafficking in persons. DOD has increased efforts to raise awareness about human trafficking among its workforce. The Treasury Department administers country-specific sanctions programs targeting individuals involved in child soldier recruitment in certain countries. The U.S. government is party to treaties related to human trafficking, requiring countries to criminalize trafficking, protect victims, prosecute traffickers, and prevent exploitation. The U.N. Trafficking Protocol, adopted in 2000, has led to more countries enacting laws against human trafficking, with 30 countries passing new legislation in 2015. In 2015, 30 countries passed new laws to combat human trafficking. The U.N. member states agreed on Sustainable Development Goals to address trafficking of women and children, modern slavery, forced labor, and human trafficking. The U.N. Security Council discussed human trafficking in armed conflict, including sexual exploitation in peacekeeping missions and enslavement by groups like ISIS. Victim identification and support were highlighted at the World Humanitarian Summit in May 2016. The State Department has been reporting on government responses to human trafficking in its TIP Report since 2001, categorizing countries into Tier 1 (best), Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List, and Tier 3 (worst). Only Tier 1 countries fully comply with the TVPA's minimum standards. The annual TIP Report also includes a list of countries involved in recruiting child soldiers, with Tier 3 countries facing potential restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. The report is due to Congress each year on June 1. The State Department issues an Interim Assessment each February to evaluate anti-trafficking progress in higher risk countries. The 2016 TIP Interim Assessment report was submitted to Congress on March 2, detailing each country's efforts to combat human trafficking. The report assesses accomplishments and challenges equally, making it hard to predict the countries' tier rankings in the subsequent report. The 2016 TIP Report by the Department of State reviewed 185 countries and three \"special cases\" based on their efforts to address human trafficking. Tier 1 countries are fully compliant with U.S. standards, while others vary in compliance levels. The United States is among Tier 1 countries, with new additions like Colombia, Cyprus, and Lithuania. Seventy-eight countries, or 42.2% of those listed in the 2016 TIP Report, are ranked as Tier 2, indicating significant efforts to comply with minimum standards. Thirteen countries are new to Tier 2, while two were downgraded from Tier 1. Tier 2 Watch List countries are at risk of falling to Tier 3 for not meeting minimum standards. The 2016 TIP Report highlights countries' commitments to take additional steps, with some countries being upgraded from Tier 3 to Tier 2 Watch List. Countries on Tier 2 Watch List may face demotion to Tier 3 after two years, with the possibility of a waiver for up to two more years. After four consecutive years on the Tier 2 Watch List, a decision must be made on whether to upgrade to Tier 2 or downgrade to Tier 3. Seven countries have reached the maximum of four consecutive years on Tier 2 Watch List. In 2016, 27 countries were identified as Tier 3 in the TIP Report for not complying with minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking. Some countries previously on Tier 2 Watch List were also included. Tier 3 countries face foreign assistance restrictions unless the President determines aid is in the U.S. national interest. For FY2016, aid restrictions were fully waived for 13 countries, partially waived for 8 countries, and restricted for 2 countries based on U.S. anti-trafficking requirements. In 2016, the State Department identified 10 countries that recruit or use child soldiers in their armed forces. These countries include Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The countries are subjected to selected security assistance as required by law. Presidential determinations for FY2017 are expected to be announced in the fall of 2016. Listed countries are subjected to security assistance restrictions unless the President determines aid is in the U.S. national interest. For FY2016, restrictions were waived for three countries (DRC, Nigeria, Somalia) and partially waived for South Sudan. Presidential determinations for FY2017 are expected in fall 2016. The 2016 TIP Report covers government actions from April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016, based on various sources. Tier rankings are country-specific with State Department discretion. The report is produced by the State Department's J/TIP Office. The State Department's J/TIP Office plays a central role in drafting the TIP Report, requesting information from U.S. overseas posts and NGOs. Drafting occurs between mid-February and end of March, with disagreements occasionally requiring resolution before publication. The J/TIP Office plays a key role in drafting the TIP Report, with tier-ranking disputes being resolved before publication. In 2015, there were 17 countries with disputes, and the J/TIP Office had the worst ratio of wins in its history. Countries like Malaysia, Cuba, China, India, Uzbekistan, and Mexico received better rankings than recommended. In 2016, some tier rankings were also disputed, but specific countries were not disclosed publicly. In 2016, the TIP Report faced disputes over tier rankings, with some countries criticizing the methodology. Countries like Belarus, Burma, Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea, and Rwanda were critical of their rankings, while others saw the report as a credible indicator of efforts to combat human trafficking. The TIP Report ranking methodology has been criticized for bias towards wealthier countries. Malaysia's tier ranking was debated in 2015, with concerns over political motivations linked to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiations. The 2016 TIP Report was released, with Malaysia remaining on the Tier 2 Watch List for a second year. Critics questioned the State Department's rankings, but praised its portrayal of human trafficking issues in Burma and Uzbekistan, both rated Tier 3. In congressional testimony, a civil society organization commended the State Department for its efforts. The State Department received praise for keeping Qatar on the Tier 2 Watch List, but faced criticism for ranking Thailand on the same list instead of Tier 3. Some believed Thailand's upgrade was premature and could be influenced by political objectives, such as support on disputes with China and joining the TPP. There were concerns that this decision could impact the European Union's review of Thailand's illegal fishing and labor practices. The State Department faced criticism for not including Afghanistan on its list of countries using child soldiers, despite reports of abuse by the Afghanistan Local Police. This decision was questioned by observers and led to calls for reform of the ranking system. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 defines countries that receive Tier 3 ranking in the TIP Report as ineligible for certain U.S. aid. The President can waive restrictions on aid if it promotes U.S. national interests. The decision on FY2017 funding to address human trafficking internationally is expected in the fall. In FY2016, $72 million was allocated by Congress for international efforts to combat human trafficking, with $12 million for J/TIP personnel and administrative costs and $60 million for anti-trafficking programs. J/TIP awarded over $18 million in grants and cooperative agreements to NGOs in FY2015. In FY2015, J/TIP awarded over $18 million in grants to NGOs and international organizations. Additionally, funding was allocated for efforts to combat human trafficking in Guatemala and child trafficking through child protection compacts. The End Modern Slavery Initiative Act of 2015 could provide an additional $60 million. The End Modern Slavery Initiative Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-113) would provide $25 million in addition to the $60 million already appropriated for anti-trafficking purposes. This funding would support grants to reduce modern slavery globally through the newly envisioned End Modern Slavery Initiative Foundation. The act also included provisions related to international human trafficking, such as reporting requirements and prohibitions on certain uses of funds. Training of foreign security forces and justice-sector officials would address gender-based violence and human trafficking issues. The curr_chunk discusses funding and legislation related to combating human trafficking and gender-based violence, including the certification requirements for Central American countries. It also mentions the State Department's budget request for FY2017 and lists bills in the 114th Congress related to trafficking in persons. The curr_chunk provides information on various bills that have become law, including the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. It highlights specific provisions and committee reports related to these laws. Several bills have become law, including the Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act (P.L. 114-26), the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of 2015, the Human Trafficking Prevention Act, and the Trafficking Prevention in Foreign Affairs Contracting Act. These bills address various issues such as human trafficking prevention and federal contractor requirements. Several bills related to combating human trafficking have passed the House and Senate, including the Human Trafficking Prioritization Act, Strategy to Oppose Predatory Organ Trafficking Act, and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Other pending bills include the Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act.
