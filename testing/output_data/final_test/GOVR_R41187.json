    "content": "The federal government uses two definitions of poverty: the statistical definition maintained by the Census Bureau for estimating the number of poor people and distributing federal funds, and the \"federal poverty guidelines\" by the Department of Health and Human Services for determining income eligibility for programs. The U.S. poverty measure has been in place for over 40 years, evolving alongside the \"Great Society\" and \"War on Poverty\" programs. The measure of poverty in the United States is considered flawed and outdated. A 1995 report by the National Academy of Sciences recommended revamping the statistical measure of poverty. Since then, extensive research has been conducted to develop and test new methods based on the panel's recommendations. The NAS panel's recommendations for a new poverty measure are being considered for implementation by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) will be developed to supplement the current official poverty measure in the United States. The NAS panel's recommendations for a new poverty measure are being considered for implementation by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This includes the development of a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to supplement the current official poverty measure in the United States. The recommendations aim to address flaws in the current measure and create a more accurate representation of poverty in the country. In the post-World War II era, poverty in the United States was not well understood due to the lack of an accepted measure. Awareness grew in the late 1950s, with concerns raised about economic inequality and poverty by economists like John Kenneth Galbraith. In his book \"The Affluent Society,\" Galbraith discussed poverty in the context of an affluent society, where poverty was no longer a widespread affliction but more of an afterthought. He identified two categories of poverty: case poverty, related to individual characteristics, and insular poverty, where entire communities are considered poor. Galbraith believed economic growth alone couldn't eliminate poverty. He argued for investments in people and communities as a remedy. Lampman's 1959 study challenged Galbraith's view on the decline of very poor. Lampman defined low-income cutoff as $2,500 for a family of four in 1957. Lampman established an annual low-income cutoff of $2,500 in 1957 dollars for a family of four, adjusting it for different family sizes. By 1957, 19% of the population fell below this standard, projected to decrease to 10% by 1977. Walter Heller used Lampman's study to shape themes for Hubert Humphrey's campaign, later becoming head of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Kennedy Administration. Michael Harrington's book, The Other America: Poverty in the United States, published in 1962, highlighted poverty in America, estimating 40 to 50 million Americans were poor. Official government estimates did not exist at the time. Harrington relied on Lampman's work for his estimates. A New Yorker article in January 1963 brought the idea of poverty amid plenty to a mass audience. Senator John F. Kennedy also addressed poverty during his presidential campaign. Senator John F. Kennedy addressed poverty in West Virginia during his presidential campaign, promising government efforts to tackle unemployment and poverty in the state. He focused on improving living conditions for the elderly, widows, and child survivors. President-elect Kennedy appointed economist Walter Heller to lead the Council of Economic Advisors amidst an economic recession. Walter Heller, leading the Council of Economic Advisors, emphasized government's role in promoting social welfare through education and training. The 1962 Economic Report highlighted the importance of economic growth in reducing poverty, especially for marginalized groups. In 1962, discussions were held regarding tax cuts and fiscal stimulus in the CEA and with the President. President Kennedy sought facts and figures on the poverty problem in the United States from Heller, who brought Lampman onto the council. Lampman's analysis was less optimistic about economic growth's role in reducing poverty for marginalized groups. In 1963, Lampman's analysis highlighted a slowdown in reducing poverty through economic growth. The CEA shifted focus to targeted approaches for those not benefiting from economic growth. This led to the development of an anti-poverty program, with President Kennedy emphasizing the need for a national assault on poverty. President Johnson continued the anti-poverty planning initiated by Kennedy, announcing a \"War on Poverty\" in his State of the Union Address. He emphasized the need for a comprehensive program to address poverty, following through on the proposed tax cut and expanding existing policies. President Johnson declared a \"War on Poverty\" in his State of the Union Address, aiming to assist American families struggling with inadequate incomes. The 1964 Economic Report highlighted the tax cut and anti-poverty measures proposed by the President, with the goal of eliminating poverty. By signing the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, President Johnson took significant steps towards addressing poverty, creating the Office of Economic Opportunity to oversee these efforts. The Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) was tasked with administering anti-poverty programs and adopted a different measure of poverty than the CEA's 1964 report. The CEA used a $3,000 annual income cutoff for families and $1,500 for individuals, while the OEO did not adjust for family size in their poverty measure. The CEA report referenced an SSA study that included adjustments for varying family sizes and compositions. The SSA study used a poverty standard with adjustments for farm and non-farm families. For a non-farm family of four, the annual income poverty cutoff was $3,165, close to the CEA's $3,000 cutoff. The CEA acknowledged that a more refined analysis would be needed to account for factors like family size, age, and location. The poverty income cutoff used in the CEA study was considered a reasonable approximation for understanding the poverty population and identifying necessary programs, although it was not suitable for determining eligibility for benefits or program participation. The CEA report referenced a study by Mollie Orshansky, an analyst at SSA, who developed food budgets for low-income families based on nutrition standards. Orshansky used two food plans to estimate costs for low-income families in her 1963 study. Orshansky developed poverty income cutoffs for low-income families based on two USDA food plans, the \"Low Cost\" and \"Economy\" plans, using a factor of three to estimate basic food needs. The poverty income cutoffs for a two-parent family with two children were $3,995 under the \"Low Cost\" plan and $3,165 under the \"Economy\" plan. Orshansky developed poverty income cutoffs based on the \"Low Cost\" and \"Economy\" USDA food plans, with 124 different thresholds for various family sizes and compositions. The poverty thresholds varied by age, sex, and family head's sex, with separate definitions for farm and non-farm populations. Orshansky estimated that a quarter to a third of US children were poor based on pre-tax money income. The OEO adopted the SSA/Orshansky poverty measure in 1965 for planning and administrative purposes. The OEO adopted the SSA/Orshansky poverty measure in 1965, based on lower income thresholds defined by Orshansky using the \"Economy\" food plan. This resulted in a poverty income cutoff of around $3,130 for a family of four in 1963. The OEO referred to this as the \"Second Generation Definition\" of poverty and began using uniform guidelines for income eligibility in funded programs by 1967. The CEA also started using the SSA/Orshansky poverty measure in 1966. The CEA began using the SSA/Orshansky poverty measure in 1966, based on the lower \"Economy\" food plan. They provided estimates of the number and percent of poor persons from 1959 to 1964, showing a decrease in the percent of persons considered poor. The federal government now uses two definitions of poverty - a statistical definition maintained by the Census Bureau and poverty guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services for administrative purposes. The Census Bureau adopted the SSA/Orshansky poverty definition in 1968 for federal need-tested programs. The Bureau of the Budget directed federal agencies to use Census Bureau poverty statistics and thresholds, with modifications, in 1969. Other poverty measures can be developed for research purposes as long as they are clearly distinguished. The Bureau of the Budget policy directive established the Census Bureau poverty measure as the official U.S. statistical measure of poverty in 1969. The directive was reissued in 1978 as OMB Statistical Policy Directive No. 14, with minor modifications. The Census poverty measure is used to calculate official estimates of the number and characteristics of individuals living in poverty. The Census poverty measure is used to determine the number and characteristics of the poor population and distribute federal funds. The Economic Opportunity Act Amendments of 1972 introduced the concept of a \"poverty line\" linked to the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds. The Economic Opportunity Act Amendments of 1972 introduced the concept of the official poverty line, requiring agencies to annually revise it for changes in consumer prices. The Census Bureau poverty thresholds are recognized as the official poverty line, established by the OMB. The Office of Economic Opportunity developed the procedure for computing poverty income guidelines in 1973, continued by the Community Services Administration. The HHS took over the responsibility of maintaining and updating the poverty guidelines after the CSA was abolished in 1981. The poverty income guidelines are used to determine eligibility for federal programs and are based on the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds, adjusted for inflation. The poverty guidelines set by the HHS are based on the CPI-U and adjusted for family size. They differ from the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds by being adjusted for Hawaii and Alaska. The guidelines for 2009 are shown in Table 1. The definition of poverty has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. The poverty guidelines set by HHS are based on CPI-U and adjusted for family size. Changes to the poverty thresholds have been technical in nature, including using the Economy Food Plan, adjusting thresholds based on CPI, raising farm thresholds, and using CPI-U for updates. The Census Bureau measures poverty based on 48 separate thresholds for families of varying size and age-composition. For example, in 2008, the poverty threshold for a four-person family was $21,834. Weighted average poverty thresholds are based on the average thresholds for families of varying size and composition. The poverty thresholds used by the Census Bureau are based on standards from the mid-1950s to early 1960s and are adjusted for changes in prices. These thresholds serve as an \"absolute\" measure of poverty, with a family considered poor if its pre-tax cash income falls below the corresponding threshold based on size and composition. The weighted average poverty threshold for a four-person family is used to develop HHS poverty income guidelines. The Census Bureau uses poverty thresholds based on mid-1950s to early 1960s standards, adjusted for price changes. A family is considered poor if its pre-tax cash income falls below the threshold based on size and composition. Federal assistance like food stamps and housing subsidies are not included in the official poverty measure. Experimental measures of poverty have been developed to consider noncash benefits and taxes' impact on family income. The federal government uses the Census Bureau's poverty thresholds to determine poverty levels for funding allocation and program eligibility. Congress has delegated the responsibility of setting the official poverty line to the Office of Management and Budget, as stated in the OBRA of 1981. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to update poverty income guidelines annually based on the official poverty line established by OMB. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for setting the official poverty line, with the Secretary of HHS required to issue revised guidelines annually. Congress has not adopted a new poverty measure but has initiated studies on how to improve poverty measurement. For example, an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 required the Assistant Secretary of Education to explore this issue. The Assistant Secretary of Education in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare supervised a study on improving the poverty measure for financial assistance. An interagency task force submitted a report to Congress in 1976, evaluating methods for developing a poverty measure. The report did not make specific recommendations for changing the current poverty measure. Congress also instructed the Department of Commerce to research the value of noncash benefits for families below the poverty line. The 1995 NRC report recommended changes in how poverty is measured in the US, stemming from concerns of the Joint Economic Committee and House Subcommittee. Legislative proposals in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to create a new poverty measure by instructing the Census Bureau. The 110th and 111th Congress proposed creating a new poverty measure based on NAS panel recommendations. The Office of Management and Budget suggests developing a Supplemental Poverty Measure using these recommendations. Experts believe the current poverty measure is outdated and needs revision to better reflect social conditions and policy effects on low-income populations. The NAS panel on Poverty and Family Assistance made 27 recommendations for revising the poverty measure, guided by principles of public acceptability, statistical defensibility, and feasibility. Recommendations focused on setting and updating poverty thresholds and defining family resources. Extensive research has been conducted to test methods since the panel's recommendations were issued. The 2004 NRC-sponsored workshop by the NAS Committee on National Statistics reviewed research on revising the U.S. poverty measure based on the 1995 NAS panel recommendations. The current official poverty measure was developed in the 1960s using data on food consumption, and experts are working to devise a new measure in line with the panel's recommendations. The poverty line in the U.S. is based on the average family spending one-third of its pre-tax income on food. This measure, established in 1969, is adjusted annually for price changes but reflects living standards from the 1950s. The poverty line in the U.S. is based on the average family spending one-third of its pre-tax income on food. The current measure is considered an \"absolute\" poverty measure and is not adjusted for changes in living standards. A new approach is recommended by a majority of the NAS panel to establish poverty thresholds based on a budget standard that includes basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter, with additional allowances for other necessities. The NAS panel recommended recalibrating spending on basic necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities for a family of four based on recent consumer spending data. The median reference family spent $15,344 on these items, with recommended spending for poverty thresholds ranging from $11,950 to $12,719. The NAS panel recommended recalibrating spending on basic necessities for a family of four based on recent consumer spending data. The poverty threshold for a four-person reference family in 1992 dollars would range from $13,742 to $15,899, compared to an official poverty threshold of $14,228 in 1992. The poverty thresholds developed as part of a research project include mortgage interest payments as part of shelter expenses. Mortgage principal payments should be included in setting poverty thresholds that include shelter expenses, as they are a nondiscretionary expenditure many homeowners face. An alternate set of poverty thresholds constructed at the BLS include mortgage principal payments as part of shelter expenses. The BLS developed alternative poverty thresholds, one excluding mortgage principal payments back to 1989 and the other including mortgage principal payments back to 1996. These thresholds rose faster than official poverty thresholds from 2000 to 2008, with the NAS-based thresholds diverging from official thresholds after 2000. The NAS-based thresholds reached $24,755 in 2008, 13.4% above the official poverty threshold of $21,834. The NAS-based poverty thresholds, including mortgage principal payments, were estimated to be $27,043 in 2008, 23.8% above the official poverty threshold of $21,834. These thresholds are more sensitive to price changes affecting family consumption, reflecting changes in prices for necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities. The NAS-based poverty thresholds are sensitive to price changes affecting family consumption, reflecting changes in prices for necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities. Increases in home energy prices would impact the thresholds based on changes in spending on heating, cooling, or lighting homes. If spending on necessities decreases overall, poverty thresholds would also decrease. The NAS-based poverty thresholds are influenced by price changes for basic needs like food, shelter, home energy, and clothing. The change in poverty thresholds aligns with the CPI-U index. Shelter prices started rising in 1996, leading to an increase in poverty thresholds. Food prices and home energy costs have also risen more than non-necessities recently. This has resulted in changes in families' spending on essentials like shelter, utilities, and food. The NAS panel considered developing a \"two-index\" poverty measure to address medical needs, but faced challenges in determining adequate health insurance for different groups. They recognized the variability of individuals' medical needs compared to other basic necessities like food and shelter. The panel recommended developing a \"medical care risk index\" separate from a measure of economic poverty to account for the economic risk of not affording needed medical care. They suggested considering medical out-of-pocket expenses in the new poverty measure. The panel recommended including medical out-of-pocket expenses (MOOP) in the new poverty measure, subtracting them from resources. Poverty thresholds would be based on expenditures for food, clothing, shelter, and utilities among reference families of four, scaled for varying family sizes and compositions to reflect economies of scale. The NAS panel recommended a two-parameter scaling procedure for poverty thresholds based on the number of adults and children in a family. Children were considered to consume 70% as much as adults, and adjustments were made by summing the number of adults and \"adult-equivalent\" children. The Census Bureau has adopted modifications to the NAS panel recommendation for adjusting experimental poverty thresholds, using a refined methodology developed by one researcher. The method of adjustment reconciles a weakness in the original recommendation by accounting for differences between singles, childless couples, and single- and two-parent families. The refined methodology uses a three-parameter scale to address these issues. Some experts suggest further research to explore additional factors for adjusting poverty thresholds, such as children's ages and the value of household production by stay-at-home parents. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show official and alternate poverty thresholds based on family size and composition, with adjustments made using a refined NAS-based methodology. The NAS panel recommended adjusting poverty thresholds for geographic cost of living differences, but data limitations and measurement issues hindered the development of such measures. CPI data only reflect price changes within limited metropolitan areas, not rural areas, and do not account for price level variations across regions. The NAS panel recommended adjusting poverty thresholds for geographic cost of living differences by using housing costs as the largest component. They suggested developing housing-cost indexes for nine geographic regions and different population size categories within regions to account for variations in prices over time and across areas. The current research focuses on improving the estimation of geographic cost-of-living differences in housing and other components of the poverty budget. Poverty status is determined by comparing families' income against poverty thresholds based on total cash pre-tax income. The official method counts various sources of income, but there are criticisms of the current measure. The current poverty definition fails to consider various forms of government assistance and taxes, making it unable to measure the impact of government programs on poverty. Non-cash benefits like food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit are not counted as income under the official poverty definition. The NAS panel recommended expanding the definition of resources for defining poverty by including near-money non-medical in-kind benefits like food stamps, subsidized housing, and deducting out-of-pocket medical expenditures. They also suggested deducting income taxes, social security payroll taxes, child care costs, and work-related expenses for each working adult. The NAS panel recommended expanding the definition of family units for poverty measurement to include unmarried cohabiting couples and conducting research on resource sharing among household members. The Census Bureau is working on valuing non-cash benefits and consulting with experts to address technical issues. The Census Bureau has been consulting with academic experts and issuing technical reports since the early 1980s on poverty measurement. They have published historical data series and alternative poverty estimates, including taxes, non-cash benefits, and means-tested programs. The Census Bureau has been consulting with academic experts and issuing technical reports since the early 1980s on poverty measurement, including taxes, non-cash benefits, means-tested programs, and employer-provided benefits. The NAS panel recommended including family resources in developing a new poverty measure to ensure consistency. The NAS report recommended discontinuing alternative poverty measures without consistent thresholds. The Census Bureau still publishes various experimental measures incorporating different approaches and methodologies. No single preferred measure has emerged, with various issues and approaches identified in developing one. The Census Bureau has developed alternative poverty measures, including official estimates and experimental NAS-based estimates. These measures are based on the CPS/ASEC survey and reference a family of four. However, the needs of different family types may vary, leading to potential inaccuracies in poverty thresholds. The NAS panel recommended valuing homeownership as a service equivalent to rent, to adjust resources for aged persons and avoid inaccuracies in poverty thresholds based on family types. More research is needed to develop a rental equivalency measure. The NAS panel recommended adjusting resources for homeowners and conducting more research to develop an appropriate adjustment. Alternative approaches for valuing homeownership in a poverty measure have been explored, but a clear consensus on the best way to proceed has not been reached yet. The panel also suggested subtracting work-related expenses and work-related child care expenses from family resources for estimating poverty. The Census Bureau imputes child care expenses for families with no nonworking parent based on 85% of weekly median child care expenses. The approach assigns 85% of weekly median child care expenses based on the number of children under age 12 and under age five in paid child care. Annual expenses are calculated based on the parent working the fewest weeks, capped not to exceed their annual earnings. A flat amount is deducted for work-related expenses, considering tradeoffs between housing and commuting costs. Poverty thresholds are geographically adjusted for area cost-of-living differences. The cost adjustment for families in different housing-cost areas is the same, but it may not accurately reflect actual expenses. By assigning a flat expense for work-related transportation, the discrepancy between housing and transportation costs can be balanced out within a metropolitan area. This approach may result in lower implied housing allowances for those in high-cost areas close to their place of employment. The Census Bureau uses a flat deduction for work-related expenses in estimating poverty measures, which may not fully adjust for actual commuting expenses. This deduction helps adjust resources for workers but may not accurately reflect expenses within or across different geographic areas. The NAS panel recommended subtracting federal and state income taxes for poverty determination. The NAS panel recommended subtracting federal and state income taxes from family resources to determine poverty. The Census Bureau estimates families' taxes using a tax model based on IRS rules and SOI data, imputing necessary variables for tax simulation not collected on the CPS. Additionally, estimated property taxes for homeowners are used for tax deductions. The tax model uses AHS data to estimate tax deductions by calculating federal and state income taxes, determining filing status, AGI, taxable income, and tax liability. It also considers state income tax provisions for lower income families. States have varying tax policies such as personal property taxes, sales taxes, and income taxes. The Census Bureau's poverty measures do not account for all taxes, including local taxes. There are ongoing discussions on how to incorporate medical expenses into poverty measures, with recommendations for a separate measure for medical risk and deducting medical out-of-pocket expenses. The panel recommended deducting medical out-of-pocket expenses from families' resources when determining poverty status, as medical expenses can impact meeting basic needs. Census Bureau surveys like CPS/ASEC used for estimating poverty lack questions on medical spending, requiring dedicated surveys like MEPS to capture this data. The Census Bureau researchers have used two methods to incorporate medical out-of-pocket spending into experimental poverty measures. One method involves subtracting out-of-pocket medical expenses from family income, while the other method incorporates estimated medical expenditures based on family characteristics. The Census Bureau uses the MOOP-MIT approach to adjust poverty thresholds based on estimated medical out-of-pocket spending, family health insurance coverage, and health spending patterns from the MEPS. This method accounts for differences in expected medical costs for various segments of the population. The Census Bureau adjusts poverty thresholds based on estimated medical out-of-pocket spending and health insurance coverage using the MOOP-MIT approach. Issues arise regarding area cost-of-living adjustments in poverty measures. The Bureau has experimented with poverty estimates with and without geographic cost-of-living adjustments, following NAS-panel recommendations. Cost-of-living indices are computed for metropolitan areas using a modified method developed by HUD for Fair Market Rents. The Housing and Urban Development (HUD) developed Fair Market Rents (FMRs) based on housing costs at the 45th percentile. Index values were grouped into six population size categories within nine Census divisions. The values were adjusted for the share of housing in the budget and normalized to a value of 1.00 for national estimates of the total poor population. The Census Bureau refined its approach in developing national estimates for the total poor population, ensuring consistency with or without geographic adjustments. Variations in housing costs within Census divisions posed challenges in applying cost-of-living adjustments, leading to discrepancies in poverty thresholds and the number of poor individuals in certain states like Maine. The Census Bureau refines its approach in developing area cost-of-living adjustments using HUD FMRs for non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. FMRs represent gross rent at the 40th percentile for standard quality rental housing. The Bureau aggregates FMRs to create average indexes by state and metropolitan status, with 100 indexes in total. Some experts argue against making geographic adjustments to poverty calculations. Experts argue against making geographic adjustments to poverty calculations based on the use of HUD Fair Market Rents (FMRs). FMRs only measure market rents, not total housing costs, and may bias rents towards recent movers. State minimum FMRs raise FMRs substantially in some non-metropolitan counties and do not account for differences in housing quality between markets. Analysts suggest more work is needed to create accurate area cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue against using HUD Fair Market Rents for geographic adjustments to poverty calculations. More work is needed to create accurate area cost-of-living adjustments that consider factors beyond just rental housing costs. Census Bureau and BLS researchers have explored alternate approaches using American Community Survey data to estimate geographic cost indexes for different locations. The ACS geographic housing adjustment, similar to the FMR adjustment, is applied to 44% of the poverty threshold for shelter and utility costs. Another method uses BLS CPI data and ACS housing cost estimates to calculate Regional Price Parities for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. These adjustments affect state poverty rates when comparing official and alternative poverty measures. The CPS/ASEC is the official source for poverty estimates and has been improved over the years to include questions on in-kind benefits, insurance coverage, health status, child care spending, and medical out-of-pocket expenses. The Census Bureau is exploring the effectiveness of these new questions in capturing accurate information. The Census Bureau uses imputation techniques to address survey content shortcomings, such as medical expenses and child care costs, in order to improve NAS-based poverty estimates. While additional survey questions may help, developing NAS-based estimates from other federal surveys is challenging due to data limitations. The American Community Survey (ACS) is the preferred data source for state and substate poverty estimation, but implementing NAS-based methodologies on the ACS poses challenges. NAS-based poverty estimates for 2008 using alternative measures are presented in Table 5, based on two versions of poverty thresholds. The table illustrates the effects of different approaches to devising a NAS-based poverty measure, showing the sequential effects of adding income sources or subtracting expenses to estimate individuals' poverty status based on their families' net income relative to poverty thresholds. There is no consensus on a preferred measure or precise methods for its construction. The effects of adding resources and subtracting expenses on poverty rates are shown, including the impact of taxes, refundable tax credits, stimulus payments, state income taxes, work-related expenses, SNAP benefits, and medical expenses. In 2008, an estimated 39.8 million people, or 13.2% of the population, were considered poor under the official poverty definition. This includes the effects of adding resources and subtracting expenses, such as taxes, refundable tax credits, stimulus payments, state income taxes, work-related expenses, SNAP benefits, and medical expenses. Additionally, housing subsidies, school lunch, and energy assistance are not adequately accounted for in the poverty thresholds. In 2008, an estimated 39.8 million people (13.2% of the population) were considered poor under the official poverty definition. Alternative poverty thresholds show 47.1 million people (15.6%) as poor without mortgage payments, and 53.3 million (17.7%) with mortgage principal included. The FCSU thresholds increase poverty rates among persons aged 65 and older, with 13.8% considered poor without mortgage principal and 16.7% with it included. No adjustment has been made for the value of owner-occupied housing, which could reduce poverty rates, especially for the elderly. Federal tax credits offset federal and state income and FICA taxes, reducing poverty rates. After taxes and credits, poverty rates are estimated at 12.6% under official thresholds, 15.1% without mortgage principal, and 17.3% with mortgage principal. Elderly poverty rates are minimally affected by taxes, while children and non-aged adults see declines in poverty. One-time federal stimulus payments in 2008 further reduced poverty. Work-related expenses increase the number of poor persons. Children are the group most likely to be poor, with 19.3% estimated to be in poverty under an expanded resource definition. This rate is similar to the official poverty rate based on pre-tax cash income alone. Including mortgage principal increases the child poverty rate to 22.3%. In contrast, the aged poverty rate is 13.7% under an expanded resource definition that excludes medical expenses. The poverty rate for the aged increases when medical expenses are included in the poverty measure, surpassing the child poverty rate. Subtracting out-of-pocket medical expenses from income raises the elderly poverty rate from 13.7% to 21.0% without mortgage principal, and from 16.7% to 24.9% with mortgage principal included. The aged poverty rate increases when out-of-pocket medical expenses are included, surpassing the child poverty rate. The elderly poverty rate more than doubles the official rate, raising new social policy concerns. Table 6 shows poverty rates by state under different measures, including NAS-based rates with and without geographic adjustments for cost-of-living differences. Estimates are based on 2008 data and represent poverty rates for 2007. The NAS-based measures are updated by the Consumer Expenditure Survey, subtracting out-of-pocket medical expenses from income. Before applying area-cost-of living adjustments, poverty rates under the NAS-based definition are generally higher than under the \"official\" definition in most states. However, poverty rates are lower under the NAS-based definition in only two jurisdictions (District of Columbia and Massachusetts), likely due to a greater role played by in-kind or tax benefits in reducing poverty in these states. Comparisons should be made across measures by state to illustrate the relative effects of alternative measures on each state's poverty rate. Table 6 illustrates how using Fair Market Rent (FMR) to adjust for area cost-of-living differences can significantly impact states' poverty rates. For example, California's poverty rate nearly doubles from 12.7% to 23.5% under the FMR-adjusted NAS-based measure, moving the state from 21st to 2nd place in terms of the highest poverty rate. In contrast, West Virginia's poverty rate decreases from 14.8% to 11.5% under the same measure. Under the FMR-adjusted NAS-based measure, West Virginia's poverty rate is estimated at 11.5%, significantly changing its ranking from 7th to 35th highest poverty rate. The use of FMRs for adjusting poverty thresholds has been questioned for its correlation with other well-being indicators. Table 7 presents correlations among different poverty measures and other well-being indicators, showing how closely related they are. Correlation coefficients range from +1.0 to -1.0, with a correlation close to 0 indicating little to no relationship. Positive correlations mean variables increase together, while negative correlations mean one variable increases as the other decreases. The table shows correlations between different poverty measures and well-being indicators at the state level. The NAS-based measure without a cost-of-living adjustment has a high correlation of 0.94 with the \"official\" poverty measure. Adjusted NAS-based measures have lower correlations, ranging from 0.75 to 0.40. The \"official\" poverty measure and the unadjusted NAS-based measure show a stronger relationship to health and education indicators than the adjusted NAS-based measures. The correlations between poverty measures and well-being indicators at the state level show that the \"official\" poverty measure and unadjusted NAS-based measure have a stronger relationship to health and education indicators compared to adjusted NAS-based measures. Life expectancy at birth is inversely correlated with poverty rates, with over half the variance in life expectancy across states accounted for by poverty rates under the \"official\" measure. However, correlations with area cost-of-living adjustments are not as expected. The correlation between poverty measures and well-being indicators at the state level shows that adjusted NAS-based measures do not perform as well as the \"official\" or unadjusted NAS-based measure in terms of their relationship to other indicators of well-being. Adjusting a poverty measure for area cost-of-living differences weakens its empirical relationship to other social indicators of individual well-being. These findings suggest the need for further research into the relationship between poverty and other social indicators at the state level. Further research has been conducted on the relationship between poverty and social indicators at the state level following the NAS panel's recommendations for a new U.S. poverty measure. Various experimental poverty measures based on NAS panel recommendations have been published, showing significant variations from the official poverty measure in terms of the number of individuals below the poverty line. The Measuring American Poverty Act of 2009 proposes a new \"modern\" poverty measure based on NAS recommendations, to coexist with the current \"official\" poverty measure. This legislation aims to update how poverty is measured without affecting eligibility for poverty-based programs. The Department of Commerce, in cooperation with the BLS, is developing a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) based on NAS panel recommendations. President Obama's OMB Chief Statistician formed a Technical Working Group to assist in developing the new statistic. The President's FY2011 budget proposal includes funding for this initiative. The President's FY2011 budget proposal includes funding to assist the Census Bureau in creating a new statistic, the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). The SPM, still in development, will accompany the Census Bureau's release of 2010 income and poverty statistics. It is considered an experimental measure and a \"work in progress\" by the Working Group. The goal is to improve data and methods over time to develop the new statistical measure.
