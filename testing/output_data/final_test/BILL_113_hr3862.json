The Clean Water Affordability Act of 2014 establishes an Integrated Permitting Process under Section 402(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. This process includes defining publicly owned permittees as treatment works or municipal separate storm sewer systems and requires the Administrator to establish a comprehensive planning approach for their obligations. The Integrated Permitting Process under the Clean Water Affordability Act of 2014 allows publicly owned permittees to implement obligations based on financial capability, prioritizing cost-effective and environmentally beneficial outcomes, considering preexisting obligations, and enabling compliance. The Clean Water Affordability Act of 2014 allows publicly owned permittees to implement innovative approaches to meet obligations, accounting for changes in treatment methods, regulatory requirements, and financial capability. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act address the duration of permits. The Clean Water Affordability Act of 2014 allows permittees to implement innovative approaches to meet obligations, with amendments addressing permit duration. Permit term can exceed 5 years with an approved integrated plan.

Definitions in this section include the meaning of terms like Administrator, Affordability, Financial capability, and Guidance as outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator will update the guidance on financial capability assessment and schedule development within a year of the Act's enactment to meet specified criteria. The guidance on financial capability assessment will be updated by the Administrator to focus on local economic conditions, regional systems, site-specific factors, and not rely solely on prescriptive formulas. The financial capability assessment should consider economic measures in context, not as a strict threshold. It should also factor in the community's economic outlook and essential investments in water quality improvements when developing implementation schedules. Environmental improvement implementation schedules should be structured to mitigate adverse impacts on distressed populations from the costs of improvements. Implementation schedules should consider local community financial conditions and economic impacts. Permittees should be allowed up to 30 years to implement water quality-related improvements in cases where costs place a high financial burden. Environmental improvement implementation schedules should consider local financial capability and may be modified in appropriate cases. Factors for determining financial capability may vary across regions and localities. The residential indicator should be revised to consider costs imposed on ratepayers for essential utilities, quantify local community-imposed costs in regional systems, assess impacts on communities with different economic conditions, consider industrial and population trends, and recognize prevailing economic concerns. The consideration of affordability factors such as shelter costs, essential utility payments, State affordability criteria, and State and local tax efforts should be included in determining the median household income of a service area. Additionally, low-income ratepayer percentages and impacts on program delivery, such as water quality infrastructure market, should be taken into account. The updated guidance should allow for reconsideration and modification of financial capability determinations and implementation schedules if all parties agree that changes are needed or if economic circumstances have changed since the effective date of the plan. The Administrator must apply these criteria when making decisions. The Administrator will apply updated guidance, including criteria, to determine affordability, financial capability, and economic impact for programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Upon completion, the Administrator will publish and submit the updated guidance to relevant committees. SEC. 4. CAPITALIZATION GRANT AGREEMENTS amended to require states to use at least 15 percent of capitalization grants for assistance to small municipalities meeting affordability criteria. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to extend the repayment period for loans to the lesser of 30 years or the project's design life. Additionally, states can provide additional subsidization, including principal forgiveness, to municipalities receiving assistance under the Act. States can offer additional subsidization, such as forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, and grants, to municipalities that meet affordability criteria or demonstrate significant hardship for ratepayers in the residential user class. States can establish affordability criteria to assist in identifying municipalities that would have a significant hardship raising revenue for eligible projects without additional subsidization. Criteria may include income data, population trends, and whether the project is in an economically distressed area. States can establish affordability criteria to assist in identifying municipalities that would have a significant hardship raising revenue for eligible projects without additional subsidization. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 allows states to use existing affordability criteria or establish new ones with assistance from the Administrator. A State must allocate 20-30% of received capitalization grants to provide extra subsidization to eligible recipients."
