The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow residents to receive advance earned income payments from a State Advance Payment Program instead of from an employer. States can participate in this program by submitting plans that meet certain requirements designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary must approve a State plan within 90 days of submission or provide reasons for disapproval. Administrative costs for a State Advance Payment Program can be matched under specific acts. Designations under this paragraph are effective after December 31, 1996, and the Secretary can revoke a State's designation. The Secretary can revoke a State's designation if they are not complying with the plan. State plans must identify the responsible agency, describe payment procedures, and explain how information on earned income will be obtained. The curr_chunk describes how State residents will be selected for advance earned income payments, how eligibility will be verified, and the State's commitment to providing necessary information. The curr_chunk outlines the State's commitment to providing written statements to residents and the Secretary regarding advance earned income payments, as well as assessing the development and implementation of State Advance Payment. The State commits to sharing findings and lessons from its State Advance Payment Program with other interested States. The method for determining the amount of advance earned income payments to residents must align with subsection (c), with the option to apply special rules if elected by the State. The State can elect a percentage between 60-75% for advance earned income payments and use the credit percentage for qualifying children instead of the specified percentage. Timing of payments can be based on payroll periods, a statewide schedule, or other reasonable basis determined by the State. The State's plan allows advance earned income payments to residents on a calendar-quarter basis. These payments are treated as withholding and fica taxes, not included in gross income, and made from deducted amounts.

The State Advance Payment Program allows individuals to receive advance earned income payments by certifying the number of qualifying children they have and providing necessary information to the State. Technical assistance will be provided by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services. Annual reports will be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury detailing resident participation in State Advance Payment Programs, filing of tax returns, accurate reporting of advance earned income payments, and repayment of excessive payments. The reports will also estimate unreported advance earned income payments by responsible State agencies. The authorization of appropriations for technical assistance, reports, and grants to support State Advance Payment Programs totals $1,400,000 for fiscal years 1997 through 2000."
