The office was moved to the Department of Education in 1979 but was eliminated in 1981. The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 was enacted to renew the federal role in environmental education and reestablish an office within the EPA. The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 renewed the federal role in environmental education by authorizing EPA to collaborate with various entities to educate the public about environmental issues and promote environmental careers. The program aims to increase public knowledge and skills to make informed decisions and protect the environment primarily through grants. The National Environmental Education Act of 1990 authorized EPA to award grants for environmental education projects in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. The program focuses on educating students, training teachers, and developing curricula. Congress has continued to fund the program annually without reauthorizing legislation, allocating around $9 million each year. Congress has appropriated approximately $9 million annually for the environmental education program, with the exception of $5.6 million in FY2007. Funding was returned to previous levels in FY2008 at $8.9 million. Despite continued funding, the President has proposed to eliminate the program's funding in his annual budget requests since FY2003, citing a \"Results Not Demonstrated\" rating by OMB as justification. OMB has raised concerns about the lack of performance metrics for grant activities supported by the program. Opponents of the President's proposal to eliminate the environmental education program's funding argue that the lack of performance metrics for educational activities is not unique to EPA's program. Critics point out that grant awards have had a national impact with minimal funding relative to EPA's total budget, and activities supported by grants have garnered significant state and local support. Despite OMB's concerns, Congress has continued to fund the program each year under the National Environmental Education Act. The National Environmental Education Act established programs for developing environmental curricula, training teachers, providing fellowships, and selecting individuals for environmental awards. EPA consults with advisory councils and task forces to coordinate efforts with federal programs. An office of environmental education was created within EPA to implement these programs. The National Environmental Education Act established an Environmental Education Division within the EPA to train education professionals in developing and teaching environmental curricula. The act directs EPA to award an annual grant for the Environmental Education and Training Program, with 25% of funding reserved for this purpose. Participants include teachers, administrators, staff of educational institutions, state and local environmental agencies, tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations. The University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point is involved in implementing this training program. The University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point has been implementing the Environmental Education Grant Program since October 2000 under an agreement with the EPA. The program supports activities to educate students, train teachers, and increase understanding of environmental issues. Eligible applicants include educational institutions, state and local agencies, tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations. EPA reserves 38% of the program's funding for grants, with a limit of $250,000 per grant. 25% of grants must be awarded for amounts of $5,000 or less to ensure a greater number of recipients. However, meeting this requirement for smaller grants has become increasingly impractical due to inflation. Since 1990, the Environmental Education Grant Program has seen an increase in grant amounts due to inflation. Recipients are required to provide 25% matching funds, but many contribute more. EPA has awarded $42 million for over 3,200 projects nationwide. The program also includes the National Network for Environmental Management Studies to encourage students to pursue environmental careers. The EPA awards approximately 40 fellowships annually to students at over 400 universities to encourage environmental careers. They also administer the Presidential Environmental Youth Awards Program for elementary and secondary students, with recipients receiving national recognition. Additionally, the EPA created four national awards in 1993 to honor contributions to environmental education and training. The EPA established a National Environmental Education Advisory Council and a Federal Task Force on Environmental Education under Section 9 of the act. The council consists of members representing public and private expertise in environmental education and training, consulting with EPA and reporting to Congress periodically on the quality of environmental education. The task force coordinates EPA's environmental education and training activities with related federal programs, while the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation promotes cooperation between public and private sectors for environmental education and training. The National Environmental Education and Training Foundation was established as a private, nonprofit organization to support environmental education and training. It operates priority programs focusing on public health, \"green\" business, environmental literacy, and weather. The foundation awards grants for innovative activities, presents achievement awards, and supports research projects on public perception of the environment and pollution control regulations. EPA is required to ensure the foundation's activities adhere to its policies. The National Environmental Education and Training Foundation supports environmental education and training through grants and programs. There is controversy over the role of the federal government in environmental education, with some critics concerned about misinformation in textbooks and curricula. EPA guidelines prohibit the use of environmental education grants for projects that promote specific measures or present scientifically inaccurate data. The National Environmental Education Act does not require EPA-funded activities to adhere to guidelines prohibiting advocacy or biased viewpoints. There is debate over the federal government's role in environmental education, driven by public demand for better understanding of complex environmental issues. Some educators question whether federal agencies like the EPA should have a more prominent role in addressing these issues. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to expand the federal role in environmental education by creating an Office of Environmental Education within the Department of Education. This would administer new grant programs to supplement EPA's existing efforts. The No Child Left Inside Act of 2008 aimed to authorize a new grant program focusing on achieving academic standards in environmental education. The House floor debate resulted in three amendments to the bill, expanding grant eligibility to include municipalities, allowing instruction in environmental justice issues, and specifying activities involving state and local park departments. H.R. 3036 would create a new role for the Department of Education and reauthorize funding for EPA's program, requiring integration of activities like research, technology-based teaching, interdisciplinary instruction, and outdoor learning. H.R. 3036 would establish new \"accountability\" requirements for EPA's existing program and proposed Department of Education program, including indicators of program quality aligned with environmental education goals and academic outcomes. Other bills in the 110th Congress also address environmental education. Two bills in the 110th Congress focus on environmental education in the contexts of environmental justice and climate change. The Getting Youth Re-invested in Environmental Education Now Act (H.R. 5902) aims to support the development of environmental justice curricula and provide career development opportunities to students in urban communities. The Climate Market, Auction, Trust, and Trade Emissions Reduction System Act of 2008 (H.R. 6316) would establish a Citizen Protection Trust Fund to offset the effects of climate change. The Climate Market, Auction, Trust, and Trade Emissions Reduction System Act of 2008 proposes a trust fund supported by revenues from a cap and trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A fixed percentage of these revenues would go towards environmental education, divided equally among EPA, the Department of Education, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill does not specify how these funds would be used for environmental education."
