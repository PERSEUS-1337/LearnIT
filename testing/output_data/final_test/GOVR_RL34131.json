    "content": "The federal government, including the Corps, is protected by sovereign immunity, which can be waived by Congress in specific circumstances. The FTCA and FCA govern lawsuits against the government for flood damages, with the FTCA waiving immunity if a federal employee's harmful act causes damage. The FTCA and FCA often overlap as defenses in claims, with courts first determining immunity before considering liability claims. The FTCA creates liability for injury, loss of property, or personal injury caused by a government employee's negligent act within their scope of duty. Exceptions, like the discretionary function exception, prevent the government from being sued for certain claims. The Supreme Court has clarified the discretionary function exception of the FTCA in cases like Dalehite v. United States, United States v. Varig, and United States v. Gaubert. The Court defined discretion as including decisions made by executives in establishing plans and operations. The discretionary function exception applies when the challenged conduct involves judgment based on public policy, while claims related to mandatory functions required by statute are actionable under the FTCA. The FTCA allows claims for non-performance of mandatory functions required by statute, while discretionary actions are protected from liability. Courts determine which part of government actions are mandated by Congress and which involve discretion. The discretionary function exception broadly prevents claims against the government for negligent design or construction of projects. In Vaizburd v. United States, plaintiffs alleged damage to their property from a Corps project to reduce storm damage. The court found that the Corps exercised discretion in the design, planning, and implementation of a project to reduce storm damage and protect the shoreline. Despite potential negligent design or implementation, the discretionary function exception may preclude any claim against the United States due to the Corps' choice and judgment in how to implement the project. In United States v. Ure, the government's decision to use cost-effective materials for a project was protected under the discretionary function exception. Similarly, in Valley Cattle Co. v. United States, the government's choice to build infrastructure to withstand certain levels of storms, despite the possibility of stronger storms, was also covered by the discretionary function exception. The plaintiff argued that the government was negligent for only preparing for a \"two-year storm\" despite knowing stronger storms occurred. The court ruled that the government's decision to plan for a two-year storm was protected under the discretionary function exception, even when delaying project improvements. In National Union Fire Insurance v. United States, the Corps' choice to delay a small improvement to a breakwater was deemed immune from liability, despite prior awareness of issues. The court found the government liable for failing to maintain a flood control project, ruling that the discretionary function exception did not apply in this case. The exception only protects government decisions based on public policy considerations, and operating the project incorrectly was not part of the Corps' mandated policy to prevent flooding. In recent cases, courts have ruled that government project maintenance involves public policy considerations. The National Park Service's failure to maintain a road was deemed discretionary, as agencies can prioritize tasks based on staffing and funding. Similarly, NPS trail maintenance was also considered discretionary, allowing agencies to balance public policy with resource constraints. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FCA) provides immunity to the federal government from liability for damages caused by floods or flood waters, extending to agencies like the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation. The breadth of FCA immunity has sparked controversy and litigation, with a nuanced application despite broad language. Congress enacted the FCA in response to the 1927 Mississippi River flood to fund large projects. After the devastating 1927 Mississippi River flood, Congress enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FCA) to fund flood control projects while limiting government liability. The FCA's immunity provision allowed the government to assist in preventing flood damage without being liable for all damage. The Supreme Court broadly applied Section 702c immunity in United States v. James, ruling that the government was not liable for wrongful death claims related to federal flood control projects. The Court emphasized that the purpose of the act was to limit federal liability for flood control projects. The court ruled in United States v. James that federal flood control projects are immune from liability. The project must have flood control as one of its purposes for Section 702c immunity to apply. There is disagreement among courts on the level of connection a federal project must have to flood control to invoke immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case of Hiersche v. United States in 1992, where the family of a diver sued the government for wrongful death. Justice Stevens discussed Section 702c immunity and suggested that Congress should address the issue. The Supreme Court highlighted the outdated nature of the immunity doctrine in flood-control projects, urging Congress to reconsider the harsh immunity provisions. Congress has the authority to redefine protections under the FTCA and FCA related to federal immunity for flood damage. In 2001, the Supreme Court revisited Section 702 immunity in Central Green Company v. United States, stating that the James decision's reference to flood control projects was not binding. The Court emphasized that the character of the waters causing damage, not the project's purpose, determines immunity under \u00a7 702c. This ruling shifted the focus away from flood control projects when considering immunity claims. The court refused to grant Section 702c immunity for a wrongful death claim where the victim died after driving into a lake created by a flood control project. The victim's family argued government negligence in road design leading drivers into the lake. The court ruled that immunity does not apply without a direct link to floods or floodwaters causing injury or death. In 2003, spillway gates at Fort Loudoun Dam were opened for flood control, leading to boating accidents. Government immunity was granted due to flood control activity. Legal claims post-Katrina questioned if breaches were due to storm surge or faulty design. Studies suggest both factors played a role, with most breaches caused by overtopping. Some New Orleans floodwall breaches occurred before surge exceeded protection. The New Orleans floodwall breaches during Hurricane Katrina were caused by a combination of storm surge and faulty design. Litigation against the federal government and contractors is ongoing, consolidated under In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consolidated Litigation. The city's location below sea level and surrounded by water puts it at risk of flooding from various sources, including the Mississippi River, coastal storms, and heavy precipitation. The Hurricane Protection System in New Orleans, consisting of levees and floodwalls, was designed to protect the city from river and coastal storms. The infrastructure was a combination of federal and local investments, with some parts still under construction when Hurricane Katrina struck. Maintenance of the levees and floodwalls is the responsibility of local governments and levee districts. Since the 1965 Lake Pontchartrain Act, over 20,000 acres of coastal wetlands have been lost due to storm damage reduction projects in Louisiana. The Corps of Engineers may face liability issues as storm reduction projects may have reduced protective wetlands. Media reports suggested the Corps was planning hurricane protection projects in the New Orleans region in 2002, potentially indicating a decision to design a new system. The failure of the Hurricane Protection System in New Orleans raises questions about whether the levees and floodwalls were exceeded or poorly designed, constructed, or maintained. The Hurricane Protection System in New Orleans failed due to structural issues, leading to flooding from Lake Pontchartrain and other stormwaters. Despite being designed for a Category 3 hurricane, Hurricane Katrina's storm surges exceeded expectations, causing breaches in approximately 50 locations. Evidence suggests that some levees/floodwalls were breached before reaching their design capacity. The Corps commissioned an extensive report after Hurricane Katrina, which found that multiple levees and floodwalls in New Orleans failed due to various factors such as differences in materials, design conservativeness, and construction errors. The 17th Street and London Avenue levees experienced foundation failures before reaching their intended protection levels. The failures of levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina were attributed to factors such as design flaws and construction errors. The storm surges in the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal exceeded design levels, with walls subsiding contributing to overtopping. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet may have enhanced the storm surge, allowing waters from Lake Borgne to amplify the surge level and velocity in New Orleans. The Hurricane Protection System failures during Hurricane Katrina were attributed to factors such as design flaws and construction errors. The connection between the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and Lake Borgne amplified surge levels and velocity in New Orleans, increasing pressure on the levees. To determine liability under the FTCA, the court would apply the Gaubert test to assess if policy decisions and government discretion played a role in building the system. The Corps had responsibility for the Hurricane Protection System during Hurricane Katrina, with ongoing construction. Design and construction revisions were made for various reasons, requiring a balance of policy factors. Liability for maintenance of the system is a complex issue, with courts inconsistent on whether maintenance is discretionary. The Corps' ongoing evaluation of a new Hurricane Protection System could support the argument that public policy considerations were taken into account. Responsibility for maintaining levees and floodwalls was unclear, with discretionary immunity not applying if maintenance protocols were not followed. The district court has recognized the FTCA's exemptions for discretionary actions. The district court has recognized that the FTCA's discretionary function exception applied to alleged negligence related to dredging of the 17th Street Canal. Challenges related to Corps actions have been barred under the FTCA, except for maintenance and operation of MRGO, where the court found the government did not meet the Gaubert test. The Corps failed to comply with its duty under the National Environmental Policy Act regarding the MRGO causing environmental changes. The application of FTCA's discretionary function exception to claims related to contractors remains uncertain. Even without discretionary function immunity, plaintiffs would still need to overcome FCA's Section 702c immunity. The Corps may be immune from claims related to floodwaters released due to the Hurricane Protection System. The district court found the Corps immune from liability for damages. The district court found that the Corps was immune from liability for damages related to levee breaches in New Orleans caused by floodwaters. However, immunity does not apply to damages caused by negligence in the operation and maintenance of MRGO. The court found that the Corps is immune from liability for levee breaches in New Orleans caused by floodwaters, but not for negligence in operating MRGO. Section 702c immunity does not apply to damages unrelated to flood control projects. The court ruled that Section 702c immunity only applies to damages caused by floodwaters related to a flood control project, not for negligence in operating MRGO. To prove government negligence, plaintiffs must show duty, breach, harm, and injury. The government can still avoid liability by claiming an act of God, like a hurricane. The act of God defense, such as a hurricane, may apply to levees and floodwalls that failed due to overtopping from high storm surges during Hurricane Katrina. Some failures were also due to subsidence. Plaintiffs may argue that the storm surge was worsened by MRGO. Government liability may be reduced if not solely responsible for damages. The court found negligence in the maintenance and operation of MRGO, attributing it as a substantial cause for levee breaches and subsequent flooding. The court found the Corps negligent in maintaining MRGO, leading to levee breaches and flooding. Severe storms and high water levels caused major floods in the Mississippi River Basin. The Corps prepared to activate the floodway system to protect Cairo, IL. The Mississippi River Training Project (MRTP) includes a floodway system designed to divert floodwaters and protect against flooding. Activating the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway raised questions of liability and remedies for affected landowners. Congress authorized the MRTP in response to the 1927 flood to prevent future damage and maintain navigation of the river channel. The MRTP includes four floodways: Birds Point-New Madrid, Morganza, West Atchafalaya, and Bonnet Carre. In 2011, the Corps breached the Birds Point-New Madrid levee to protect Cairo, IL, and opened floodgates on the Morganza and Bonnet Carre floodways to prevent flooding in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This was only the second time the Birds Point-New Madrid and Morganza floodways were used since their completion in 1933 and 1953. The activation of the Bonnet-Carre floodway in 2011 was the ninth use since its completion in 1932. The decision to activate the floodway system at Bird's Point-New Madrid raised questions about the Corps' authority to purposely flood some lands to save others. The detonation of the levee was expected to flood 130,000 acres in Missouri, protecting either an Illinois town or Missouri farmland and residences. Missouri filed a lawsuit challenging the Corps' authority, but the court rejected the challenge. The court relied on a 1984 case precedent from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to find that the Corps' decision to operate the floodway at Bird's Point-New Madrid could not be reviewed by courts. The Eighth Circuit explained that Congress authorized the construction of levees and their artificial breaching when water levels exceeded certain thresholds, requiring a high degree of deference to the Corps' decision due to its technical expertise. Therefore, the district court refused to bar the Corps from artificially crevassing the levee in response to the 2011 floods. The Corps' decision to divert floodwaters through the MRTP floodway system during the 2011 floods led to property owners suffering flooding to their land, homes, and farms. Property owners affected by the floodway system were entitled to compensation for the loss of possession or use of their property through the acquisition of flowage easements. Acquisition of these rights could occur through various legal methods, including acquiring title to the property or obtaining a right-of-way. Acquisition of flowage easements from property owners allows the government to operate levees without liability for resulting damages from floodway operation. Property owners are compensated for future flood damages by selling flowage easements to the government, transferring property rights in the same manner as property title. Owners who agree to not hold the government liable for flood damages bind subsequent owners to the same promise. The government acquires flowage easements from property owners to operate levees without liability for flood damages. Subsequent owners are bound by this promise, as they have notice of the risk when purchasing the property. Questions of liability have been raised regarding the sufficiency of these easements, but the failure to obtain easements for all affected property does not justify barring floodway operation. The court noted that landowners had legal remedies for flood damage, including seeking compensation from the government. Some landowners argue that the easements acquired by the Corps were insufficient for the flood's force and magnitude, raising concerns about excess sediment and debris deposition. Legal challenges related to the 2011 flood focus on the scope of easements and potential compensation for damage caused by the Corps' operations. The legal challenges related to the 2011 Mississippi floods have focused on the Corps' authority regarding the MRTP and floodway easements. Courts have emphasized Congress's deference to the Corps' discretion in MRTP operations, making it difficult to challenge under the FTCA. The Corps would likely be able to defend challenges under the discretionary function exception of the FTCA due to the recognition of their judgment in operating the system. The FCA granted immunity to the government, including the Corps, for damages caused by floods. The Corps could avoid liability for flood damage based on the character of the waters and the purpose of their release. In the case of the 2011 floods, Section 702c immunity would likely apply due to the floodwaters being diverted through the floodway as part of the MRTP."
