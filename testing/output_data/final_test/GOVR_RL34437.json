The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures price for WTI approached $100 per barrel in December 2007. Refinery capacity utilization rates were around 90% for most of the year, and oil supply disruptions from Nigeria, Venezuela, and the Persian Gulf were a concern. Despite weakening product demand and narrowing refinery margins, the oil industry saw record revenues and profits totaling approximately $1.9 trillion in 2007. In 2007, the oil industry saw record revenues of $1.9 trillion, with 78% coming from the top five companies. Profits totaled over $155 billion, with 75% earned by these companies, led by ExxonMobil. Despite overall strong financial results, some firms underperformed compared to industry leaders. This report analyzes the industry's profit performance in 2007, emphasizing the need to consider long-term trends. The oil industry's financial performance is cyclical, with periods of high earnings followed by sharp declines. Integrated oil companies operate in both upstream and downstream segments. The five largest companies, known as super-majors, dominate the industry. ExxonMobil is the largest company, with profits surpassing its competitors. Projections of future industry performance based on current trends may not be reliable. In 2007, integrated oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and BP saw revenue growth driven by higher crude oil prices. Despite declines in oil and natural gas production for some companies, overall revenues increased by 7.1%. The American Petroleum Institute compared oil industry returns to other industries, finding a 7.6% return on revenue for oil and gas companies. The oil and natural gas industries earned 7.6 percent on revenues, compared to 5.8 percent for all U.S. manufacturing industries. This implies a 31 percent margin over other manufacturing industries, but less than the 9.2 percent earned by all U.S. manufacturing industries excluding automobile and auto parts. Return on equity is another measure of profitability used to evaluate the success of companies in earning profit by utilizing invested capital. The integrated oil companies had a strong performance in 2007, with a return of 22.7% and ExxonMobil leading with 33.4%. Upstream activities drove most of the companies' net income growth, with 80% of total net income coming from this sector. Oil and gas production declined slightly, with four of the five largest oil producers experiencing a decrease. BP and Shell were the only ones with declining natural gas output in 2007. In 2007, only BP and Shell saw declining output. Financial results for integrated oil companies in downstream activities showed declining net incomes compared to product sales, indicating lower profit margins per barrel of crude oil refined. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had positive net income growth in Q4 2007, while other firms had negative growth or financial losses. Crude oil prices rose rapidly, reaching over $110 per barrel in March 2008, with gasoline prices lagging behind. Weak demand for gasoline in the US was believed to be the cause. In 2007, independent oil and gas producers saw a decline in refining margins despite revenue increases. Their net incomes were lower compared to integrated oil companies, with six out of ten experiencing negative net income growth. Most companies in this category saw production increases, but declining net income was a trend, possibly due to rising oil and gas prices. In 2007, independent oil and gas producers faced declining net income growth despite revenue increases. The companies invested heavily in unconventional oil asset exploration, particularly in shale oil work in Texas, Arkansas, and South Dakota. Valero, the leading independent refiner, accounted for over half of the sector's revenue and two-thirds of its net income. Independent refiners, like Valero, experienced pressure on refining margins similar to integrated oil companies but were unable to benefit from the rising crude oil prices due to their lack of crude oil production. During the second half of 2007, independent refiners faced economic pressure as revenues grew by 53.4% but net incomes declined significantly. Valero, the sector's leading firm, earned 53% of the revenue and 97% of the net income. Rising crude oil costs and weaker demand conditions made it challenging for firms to pass on cost increases to consumers. Valero remained profitable by purchasing lower cost crude oil. Crude oil spot prices reached $110 per barrel in the first quarter of 2008, posing a challenge for refiners if prices remained above $100 per barrel for an extended period. The high price of crude oil above $100 per barrel is expected to result in high profits for oil producing firms, but challenging economic conditions for refiners without their own supplies. Refiners may need to adapt technologies to use lower quality crude oils, which are more readily available at a discount. The industry's profitability also depends on the growth of demand for petroleum products, with U.S. gasoline demand potentially weakening due to high prices. Some projections suggest $4 per gallon gasoline in the second and third quarters of 2008. The high price of crude oil in 2008 is expected to lead to high profits for oil producers, but challenging conditions for refiners. Demand for petroleum products remains strong globally, but a worldwide economic slowdown could slow growth. The industry has been profitable since 2004, but weakening U.S. demand for gasoline is putting pressure on the downstream sector. Despite factors like political uncertainty and tight spare capacity, the price of crude oil is likely to remain high in 2008. The high price of crude oil in 2008 may make it difficult to raise petroleum product prices due to the weakening U.S. economy. New capacity investments in refineries, which could provide gasoline price relief for consumers, are likely to be slowed by the poor profit performance of the refining sector. The need for imported gasoline will remain a key factor in avoiding shortages in the U.S. market."
