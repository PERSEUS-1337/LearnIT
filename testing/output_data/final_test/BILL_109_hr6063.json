    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Remote Monitoring Access Act of 2006\". The Congress finds that remote patient monitoring improves chronic disease management by allowing real-time transmission of health information, reducing the need for frequent physician visits and hospitalizations, and minimizing travel and missed work for patients. Remote management technologies in healthcare are valuable for individuals in rural or underserved communities, reducing access barriers. These technologies are emerging in treating congestive heart failure, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, and sleep apnea. Prompt transmission of clinical data is crucial for timely interventions and reducing hospitalizations. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by a lack of payment incentives. The Act aims to remove barriers in Medicare reimbursement for remote patient management technologies, requiring doctors to be reimbursed for analyzing transmitted data. It also mandates the creation of quality standards for remote patient management services for chronic conditions. The Act aims to remove barriers in Medicare reimbursement for remote patient management technologies, requiring doctors to be reimbursed for analyzing transmitted data. It also mandates the creation of quality standards for remote patient management services for chronic conditions, including coverage of such services under the Social Security Act. The term \"remote patient management services\" refers to monitoring and managing individuals with covered chronic health conditions through technology allowing data transmission for clinical review by physicians. Covered chronic health conditions include heart failure, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia, sleep apnea, and others determined appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary may develop guidelines for billing frequency of remote patient management services based on medical necessity. Quality standards for remote patient management services for covered chronic health conditions will be developed within a year. The Secretary will develop quality standards for remote patient management services for chronic conditions in consultation with physician groups within a year. Payment under the Physician Fee Schedule will be amended to include budgetary treatment for certain services. The Secretary will develop quality standards for remote patient management services for chronic conditions in consultation with physician groups within a year. Payment under the Physician Fee Schedule will be amended to include budgetary treatment for certain services, excluding additional expenditures from section 1861(s)(2)(BB) in the review process for 2008. Additionally, relative value units for remote patient management services will consider costs such as physician time, installation, and information transmittal costs. The Secretary will establish quality standards for remote patient management services for chronic conditions in consultation with physician groups. Payment under the Physician Fee Schedule will be adjusted to cover costs like information transmittal, remote patient management technology, and resource costs for patient monitoring. The level of service intensity will be determined by the frequency of evaluation, time and complexity of evaluation, and possible diagnoses. The amendments made by this section will apply to services provided on or after January 1, 2008, including the consideration of possible diagnoses and management options."
