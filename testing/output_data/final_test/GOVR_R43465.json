Congressional Budget Office projections compare historical program outlays with those under the new dairy programs. The 2014 farm bill made significant changes to U.S. dairy support programs, addressing producer concerns and rising feed costs. It eliminated key provisions from the 2008 farm bill, extended smaller programs, and introduced new ones. A report compares historical program outlays with those under the new dairy programs, discussing potential issues related to the new policies. The shift of federal support from dairy product prices to the dairy operating margin is highlighted, with background on the establishment of federal dairy price supports in 1949 and modifications in subsequent legislation. The federal government indirectly supported the farm price of fluid milk at $9.90 per hundredweight through government purchases of dairy products from processors at set prices. However, milk producers argued that support levels were too low compared to market prices and production costs. After the emergence of the U.S. ethanol industry in 2006, feed costs for dairy producers sharply increased, reaching nearly three times the previous levels by 2012. Rising feed costs accounted for 80% of operating costs in 2011, compared to 71% in the early 2000s. This surge in feed prices, combined with volatile milk market prices, posed challenges for dairy producers. The focus shifted from price supports to protecting the margin between milk prices and feed costs due to volatile market prices and rising feed costs. The Dairy Security Act was introduced in Congress in 2011 as a version of the proposed dairy margin protection program. The 2014 farm bill repealed several previous policies. The 2014 farm bill repealed various dairy programs, including the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) which supported milk prices at $9.90 per hundred-weight. The focus shifted to protecting the margin between milk prices and feed costs due to market volatility and rising feed costs. The Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, established in the 2002 farm bill, provides payments when the price of fluid milk falls below a certain threshold. The Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP) is repealed, which previously offered cash bonuses to U.S. dairy exporters. The Federal Milk Marketing Order Review Commission established by the 2008 farm bill is repealed, along with certain other programs reauthorized by the expired 2008 farm bill. The Dairy Forward Pricing Program allows farmers to enter into forward price contracts with milk handlers for pooled milk used for manufactured products under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. The Dairy Indemnity Payment Program provides payments to dairy producers and manufacturers for contaminated raw milk. The Dairy Promotion and Research Program is funded by a 15\u00a2/cwt. assessment on milk produced in the 48 contiguous states. The Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) regulate milk marketing across state lines in 10 geographically defined fluid milk marketing areas. Dairy processors within each FMMO must pay a minimum price for farm milk. Importers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico pay an assessment rate on imported dairy products. Certain dairy programs operate independently of the 2014 farm bill, including FMMOs established under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. Dairy processors must pay a minimum price for farm milk based on its end use. Dairy Import Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) limit the importation of lower-priced foreign dairy products to protect domestic products. The Dairy Price Support Program, authorized under the 1949 Agricultural Act, is suspended by new farm legislation, requiring USDA to purchase dairy products to raise demand and farm milk prices. The Dairy Product Mandatory Reporting Program requires manufacturers to report price, quantity, and moisture content of dairy products to USDA. The Livestock Gross Margin Insurance for Dairy (LGM-D) provides protection to dairy producers when feed costs rise or milk prices drop. The Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Program, established by the 1990 farm bill, develops generic advertising programs funded by a 20\u00a2/cwt. assessment on milk processed for fluid consumption. The program was approved by a referendum among processors and gained permanent authority in the 2002 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill removed expiration dates related to California dairy producers' petition and approval. The 2014 farm bill removed expiration dates related to California dairy producers' petition and approval for a separate Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO). This allows California to potentially use a Class I quota plan to determine individual producer payments. USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service would need to receive a formal petition and conduct a hearing before California's dairy producers decide whether to adopt an FMMO. The 2014 farm bill introduced new dairy support programs, MPP and DPDP, to replace repealed programs. USDA implemented the Margin Protection Program (MPP) and Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) by September 2014. MPP is a voluntary program for milk producers. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) is a voluntary program for milk producers aimed at providing protection from low operating margins. It creates a timely and transparent measure of an average dairy-production operating margin using USDA-reported monthly national average price data for milk and key feed ingredients. All U.S. dairy producers are eligible to participate in the program. All U.S. dairy producers can participate in the margin protection program. If there are multiple producers in one operation, they are considered as a single entity for program participation. Each dairy operation must register separately. Producers cannot reconstitute operations to receive payments. Commercial milk sales in the U.S. are required for enrollment. Producers must be actively engaged in the dairy business. Operations must comply with conservation provisions. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) for dairy producers requires an annual registration fee of $100, due by the end of the enrollment period. Failure to pay the fee will result in no payments under the program until it is paid. Participation in MPP is voluntary, but once enrolled, dairy operations must participate through 2018 unless there is a change in ownership. The registration period for MPP runs from July 1 to September 30 each year. Once enrolled in the Margin Protection Program, dairy operations must pay a $100 annual administration fee and remain in the program until 2018, unless there is a change in ownership. Enrollment requires completing Form CCC-781 and paying the fee. The default coverage level is $4/cwt with a 90% coverage level, but producers can choose higher levels annually. Producers in the Margin Protection Program can choose higher margin protection levels up to $8/cwt. and PH coverage from 25% to 90%. Premiums vary based on CPH and margin threshold. Enrollment for higher coverage levels must be done using Form CCC-782. Failure to submit CCC-782 results in default Catastrophic Coverage at $4/cwt. margin threshold and 90% PH coverage. Unlike the MILC program, MPP has no cap on payments related to AGI or dairy operation size. Producers in the Margin Protection Program can choose higher margin protection levels up to $8/cwt. Premiums vary based on CPH and margin threshold. Enrollment for higher coverage levels must be done using Form CCC-782. Producers who sign up for MPP are ineligible for the Livestock Gross Margin for Dairy Cattle program. USDA is instructed to determine the ADPM promptly for expedited payments, using NASS full-month price estimates. The Margin Protection Program allows producers to choose higher margin protection levels up to $8/cwt, with premiums based on CPH and margin threshold. Enrollment for higher coverage levels must be done using Form CCC-782. If the ADPM falls below the selected MPP threshold for a consecutive two-month period, a payment will be made on the selected coverage-level portion of a participating producer's PH. The MPP payment rate per cwt is equal to the difference between the selected MPP threshold and the average ADPM. Average margin calculation is available a month after the two-month period ends, with payments starting the following month if triggered. No payment will be made if a producer is in arrears on administration fees or premiums. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) allows producers to choose coverage levels up to $8/cwt, with payments triggered if the Average Dairy Production Margin (ADPM) falls below the selected MPP threshold for consecutive two-month periods. Payments are calculated based on the difference between the selected MPP threshold and the average ADPM, prorated over six two-month periods. Payments continue until the ADPM reaches or exceeds the selected MPP margin threshold. Historical margin levels can help predict future payments. The ADPM has varied between $4/cwt. and $8/cwt. for different two-month periods since January 2000. The national average ADPM during this period was $8.61/cwt. The maximum MPP coverage level is $8.00/cwt., representing 93% of the national average ADPM. Premiums start at $4.50/cwt. and increase with higher coverage levels up to the maximum of $8.00/cwt. No premium is charged for the minimum $4.00/cwt. margin protection. Premiums also vary based on the level of covered production history (CPH). The premium schedule for covered production history (CPH) includes a 25% discount for the first 4 million lbs. in 2014 and 2015. Premium rates vary based on CPH volume and margin protection level selected. The premium schedule for covered production history (CPH) includes a 25% discount for the first 4 million lbs. Dairy producers with CPH above 4 million lbs. are charged lower premium rates on the first 4 million lbs. and higher rates on amounts above that. Premium payments can be made in full by the end of the enrollment period or in tranches, with 25% due by February 1 and the remaining balance by June 1. Failure to pay fees and premiums results in ineligibility for MPP payments until charges are settled. The premium structure encourages participation at the $6.50/cwt. level for CPH exceeding 4 million lbs. The premium structure encourages participation at the $6.50/cwt. level for CPH greater than 4 million lbs. To raise the margin coverage level to $7.00/cwt., an additional $0.54/cwt. of premium must be paid. The total premium cost for insuring 70% of the APH at a margin of $7.00/cwt. would be $40,120, more than double the cost for $6.50/cwt. margin protection. USDA shall establish a Dairy Product Donation Program to address low dairy operating margins and provide nutrition assistance to low-income individuals. The dairy margin program aims to balance milk supply and demand, with a proposed supply disincentive component to reduce supply. However, a new \"demand enhancing\" program called DPDP was introduced to address low dairy production margins. When the actual dairy production margin is $4.00/cwt. or less for two consecutive months, USDA must purchase dairy products at market prices until termination conditions are met. The USDA must consult with organizations to determine types and quantities of dairy products to purchase under the DPDP. Purchased dairy products must be distributed, not stored, to encourage domestic consumption among low-income groups. Public and private nonprofit organizations will assist in distributing the dairy products to individuals in low-income groups without cost or waste. DPDP purchases will be in package sizes suitable for immediate household use. The USDA's Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) requires purchases to be in household-sized packages for immediate distribution. Organizations cannot resell products received. DPDP activities will cease under certain conditions: after three consecutive months of purchases, if the margin exceeds $4.00/cwt, or if U.S. dairy prices are significantly above world market prices. The USDA's Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) will stop purchases if the margin exceeds $4.00/cwt or if U.S. dairy prices are significantly above world market prices. The 2014 farm bill allows USDA to determine termination conditions based on domestic and international prices of cheddar cheese and non-fat skim milk powder. If purchases are suspended due to high domestic prices, margins will be monitored for two months before potential resumption after three months. USDA outlays for dairy support programs have decreased since the 1980 farm bill. Strong dairy product prices are expected in the next few years. The 2014 farm bill will result in additional budgetary outlays compared to the 2008 farm bill. Total projected outlays under the new dairy programs are $402 million over 5 years and $1.162 billion over 10 years. The CBO projects outlays for new dairy programs to be $402 million over 5 years and $1.162 billion over 10 years, continuing a downward trend in program spending. Questions have been raised about implementation, costs, and impact on dairy markets and consumers. The impact of donations on total dairy usage is a key concern. The economic analysis indicates that the new dairy programs offer substantial opportunities for dairy producers to manage their milk-production risk environment. There are concerns about whether the margin protection program will crowd out private sector risk markets. The margin protection program may have a risk reduction effect with a significant federal subsidy component. This could provide production incentives to milk producers, potentially disrupting traditional market signals and favoring \"lumpy\" over \"incremental\" growth. The impact of the Dairy Product Donation Program on dairy markets is currently unknown. The Dairy Product Donation Program's impact on dairy markets is uncertain. Will it stimulate milk production, leading to lower prices and higher program payments in the future? Unlike previous versions, the Margin Protection Program lacks strong production disincentives. Premiums are fixed and do not reflect market risks. The Margin Protection Program (MPP) has fixed premiums and allows producers to choose insurance levels, creating incentives for financial advantage. Using futures contract prices, producers can forecast milk production margins and the likelihood of indemnity payments. To reduce adverse gaming incentives, an earlier sign-up date for coverage decisions, such as 60 to 90 days before the program's start date of January 1, is recommended. The enrollment period for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 is from July 1 to September 30. The enrollment period for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 is from July 1 to September 30. Economic analysis suggests that the net expected benefits under the Margin Protection Program (MPP) closely align with those under the previous MILC program, with slightly less skewed results. Farms with fewer than 100 cows would receive approximately 38% of the expected benefits, while farms with over 1,000 cows would account for approximately 15% of benefits during low margin periods. Higher coverage levels need to be deep in-the-money for payments to be consistent across farm sizes. The 2014 farm bill dairy provisions repealed the Dairy Product Price Support Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program, aligning U.S. dairy programs with WTO commitments. The repeal of DPPSP is expected to significantly reduce annual U.S. domestic support notifications to the WTO. The 2014 farm bill dairy provisions repealed the Dairy Product Price Support Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program, aligning U.S. dairy programs with WTO commitments. This is expected to lower annual U.S. domestic support notifications to the WTO and keep U.S. domestic support outlays below the $19.1 billion ceiling. The repeal of DEIP fulfills a commitment to end agricultural export subsidies, putting pressure on other countries to do the same. U.S. dairy TRQs remain in place and are WTO legal. The 2014 farm bill dairy provisions aligned U.S. dairy programs with WTO commitments, including the repeal of the Dairy Product Price Support Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program. Market incentives are expected to dominate producer decision making in the future, with new dairy programs likely to be implemented during a period of strong milk prices and weak feed costs. The National Milk Producers Federation's Feed the Future proposal was introduced in Congress as The Dairy Security Act. In the 113th Congress, new dairy programs were proposed to replace traditional support programs with margin-based income support programs. The Senate bill included a market stabilization program, while the House bill did not. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) was included in early versions of the House farm bill in the 113th Congress but was later removed through an amendment introduced by Representatives Goodlatte and Scott. The amendment was initially defeated in committee but later passed during the House floor debate. However, the amended farm bill was ultimately rejected by the full House. The House passed a second version of the 2013 farm bill (H.R. 2642) on July 11, 2013, which included the Goodlatte-Scott amendment. The differences between the Senate and House-passed farm bills were resolved in January 2014 with the Agricultural Act of 2014. The dairy supply management debate was settled with the inclusion of the Dairy Product Distribution Program (DPDP) focused on demand enhancement. The conference agreement was approved by the full House and Senate in January and February 2014. The conference agreement on the 2013 farm bill was approved by the full House and Senate in January and February 2014, and signed into law by the President on February 7, 2014."
