    "content": "The Supreme Court established its authority of judicial review in the early history of the United States, notably in the 1803 case Marbury v. Madison. Through judicial review, the Court can invalidate unconstitutional governmental actions by interpreting the Constitution. The Constitution requires interpretation through methods of constitutional interpretation and construction, as many provisions are broadly worded. For example, the Second Amendment's ambiguity led to a divided 2008 Supreme Court decision on whether the right to bear arms applies to all citizens or only militia members. The Constitution requires interpretation to resolve ambiguities and address fundamental questions left unaddressed by the drafters. This includes determining the meaning of ambiguous provisions and providing principles to govern future conduct. The Supreme Court relies on various methods of interpretation to derive meaning from the Constitution, sparking debates on which sources to consult. Judicial review involves unelected judges overturning laws, leading to concerns about political bias influencing decisions. Constitutional scholars have developed theories to guide Justices in making principled judgments in constitutional adjudication. Professor Richard Fallon categorized \"interpretivists\" into originalists and moderate interpretivists based on their approach to the Constitution's text and intent. Originalists prioritize the original understanding and specific intent of the framers, while moderate interpretivists consider contemporary understandings and general intent in constitutional interpretation. The debate over the sources of the Constitution's meaning continues, with originalists emphasizing the original public meaning of the Constitution, while others focus on interpretive methods that ensure government functions properly and protect minority rights. Key methods of constitutional interpretation have influenced the Justices in their decision-making. Key methods of constitutional interpretation have guided the Justices in their decision-making and influenced constitutional dialogue. This report categorizes various methods used when interpreting the Constitution, such as textualism, original meaning, judicial precedent, pragmatism, moral reasoning, national identity, structuralism, and historical practices. The report discusses examples of Supreme Court decisions demonstrating the application of these methods and presents arguments both in support of and in opposition to their use by the Court. The Court relies on various sources for interpreting the Constitution, including the text itself, debates, prior decisions, pragmatic and moral considerations, and congressional practices. Justices must exercise discretion in choosing sources. Understanding these methods can help Congress uphold the Constitution in their legislative functions. Textualism is a mode of legal interpretation that focuses on the plain meaning of the text of a legal document, emphasizing how terms in the Constitution would be understood at the time of ratification. This knowledge can aid Senators and the Senate Judiciary Committee in evaluating judicial philosophy and assist Members and congressional committees in assessing executive branch officials' interpretations of the Constitution. Textualists focus on the objective meaning of the text of the Constitution, prioritizing the plain meaning of the text and avoiding inquiries into the intent of the drafters. They are cautious of the Court refining or revising constitutional texts and often rely on the text first before consulting other sources to resolve ambiguities or answer constitutional questions. In Trop v. Dulles, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits revoking citizenship as punishment. The Court used textualism along with moral reasoning and historical practices to interpret the Constitution. This approach differs from Justice Black's strict textualist view. Justice Black believed that the Constitution should be interpreted based solely on the literal meaning of its words. He argued that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from passing any law that limits freedom of speech or the press. In Dennis v. United States, he dissented when the Court allowed Congress to criminalize advocating the overthrow of the government, citing that the text of the Constitution should be the only source of its meaning. Justice Black, a proponent of textualism, dissented in cases like Dennis v. United States and Griswold v. Connecticut, arguing that the First Amendment should not be watered down by balancing tests or natural law principles. He believed that the Constitution should be interpreted based solely on the literal meaning of its words. Justice Black, a proponent of textualism, believed in interpreting the Constitution based solely on the literal meaning of its words, rejecting the use of natural law principles to find a \"right to privacy in marital relations.\" He argued that government has the right to invade privacy unless prohibited by specific constitutional provisions, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the text of the Constitution for predictability in judgments and promoting democratic values. Opponents of textualism argue that interpreting the Constitution solely based on its literal words may lead to different interpretations depending on background, especially with broadly worded provisions. They suggest considering values beyond the text, such as moral reasoning or practical consequences, for a more flexible approach that preserves fundamental constitutional principles. Originalist approaches to constitutional interpretation, unlike textualism, consider the Constitution's meaning as understood by the populace at the time of the Founding. Scholars disagree on the exact methodology for interpreting the Constitution, but generally agree that the text had a fixed, public meaning at the time of the Founding that judges should adhere to. The role of judges and Justices is to interpret the original meaning of the Constitution, often by looking at the original intent of the drafters. This can be found in sources like debates in the Constitutional Convention or the Federalist Papers. For example, in Myers v. United States, Chief Justice Taft looked at English common law and the actions of the first Congress to determine the President's removal power. Chief Justice Taft relied on various sources, including the Constitutional Convention records and the actions of the first Congress, to determine the intention of creating a strong Executive. Originalists like Justice Scalia seek to understand the original public meaning of the Constitution by considering the plain text as understood by people at the time of ratification. This approach is similar to textualism but focuses on historical context. The original public meaning approach to understanding the Constitution, as used by Justice Scalia, looks beyond the text to interpret the Constitution based on its original public meaning. In District of Columbia v. Heller, Scalia determined that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess firearms for private use. This approach considers historical sources like dictionaries from the Founding era and state constitutions. Supporters of this approach highlight its long historical pedigree. Proponents of originalism argue that it upholds the democratic will of the Constitution's framers, limits judicial discretion, and ensures certainty in judgments by maintaining a fixed meaning until formally amended. Critics point out the challenge of establishing original meaning, as scholars may not always agree on interpretation. Critics of originalism argue that scholars may not always agree on the original meaning of the Constitution, leading to judges potentially selecting interpretations that align with their political beliefs. They also contend that originalism requires judges to act as historians, a role they may not be suited for. Critics of originalism argue that the theory may not be a practical method of constitutional interpretation due to its inflexibility and potential failure to protect minority rights. They also challenge the exclusive reliance on Article V for constitutional change, citing the difficulty of amending the Constitution through this process. The Constitution's high threshold for formal amendment has led to debates on its adaptability to modern needs. The Supreme Court's prior decisions are a key source of constitutional meaning, providing principles for future cases. Judicial precedent guides the Court's decisions, but Justices have flexibility in interpreting prior rulings. The Supreme Court relies on prior decisions as a key source of constitutional meaning, with some cases playing a prominent role in decision-making. For example, Roe v. Wade was reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and Miranda v. Arizona was upheld in Dickerson v. United States. The Supreme Court upheld Miranda v. Arizona, stating it had become ingrained in police practice and national culture. In Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the Court allowed voters to transfer redistricting authority to an independent commission, interpreting the term \"Legislature\" to include voter referendums. The Supreme Court upheld Miranda v. Arizona as ingrained in police practice and national culture. In Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the Court allowed voters to transfer redistricting authority to an independent commission through a referendum. The Court relied on precedent to support a broader interpretation of the term \"Legislature.\" Some argue that judicial overreliance on precedent can be problematic, as it may perpetuate wrongly decided decisions and hinder the evolution of constitutional norms over time. Critics suggest that strict adherence to precedent can lead to inflexibility in altering rulings, potentially requiring a constitutional amendment to make changes. Disagreements over underlying principles can also diminish the authority of a precedent. Disagreements over underlying principles can weaken the authority of a precedent, especially when it conflicts with basic moral principles. Some argue that reliance on precedent may not always lead to consistency, predictability, or neutrality, as judges can interpret precedents according to their own views. Proponents of original meaning in constitutional interpretation object to precedents that deviate from the Constitution's original intent, allowing mistaken interpretations to persist. Pragmatist approaches to constitutional interpretation focus on the practical consequences of different interpretations, weighing the costs and benefits to society or the political branches. In United States v. Leon, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not always require exclusion of evidence obtained in good faith reliance on an improperly issued search warrant. Justice Byron White's majority opinion in Leon exemplifies this approach. In United States v. Leon, Justice Byron White's majority opinion took a pragmatic approach, stating that the exclusionary rule's purposes would rarely be served by applying it to a good faith violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Court emphasized that a broader exclusionary rule would have significant societal costs by hindering the criminal justice system's ability to convict guilty defendants, outweighing any marginal benefits. Another case where practical consequences were considered is United States v. Comstock, where the Court assessed Congress's power to enact a civil commitment law for convicted sex offenders. The Department of Justice can detain convicted sex offenders indefinitely after serving their sentences if deemed \"mentally ill\" and \"sexually dangerous.\" The Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the authority to enact this law based on implied constitutional powers and Article I, Section 8, Clause 18. Justice Stephen Breyer listed factors supporting Congress's authority in enacting civil commitment laws. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to enact the civil commitment law for dangerous offenders based on pragmatic concerns about public safety and the government's custodial interest. Another approach considered by the court involves judges avoiding ruling on constitutional issues to play a constructive role in decision-making. The Supreme Court's pragmatic approach involves avoiding ruling on political or constitutional questions to preserve institutional capital and allow democratic branches to address issues. In Baker v. Carr, Justice Brennan's majority opinion concluded that a state's apportionment decisions are justiciable matters. Decisions on malapportionment are considered justiciable matters, allowing those harmed to seek redress through the legal system. Pragmatism in constitutional interpretation considers political and economic circumstances to achieve the best outcome, reflecting contemporary values. Critics argue that weighing costs and benefits introduces politics into judicial decision-making, emphasizing that judges should not act as politicians. Some opponents of pragmatic constitutional interpretation argue that judges should not inject politics into decision-making and should focus on interpreting the law rather than what it should be. Another approach involves moral or ethical reasoning, where constitutional text is infused with certain moral concepts like \"equal protection\" or \"due process of law\" related to individual rights and government authority. The Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to protect individual rights, such as in the case of Lawrence v. Texas where a Texas law banning same-sex sexual activity was struck down. The concept of liberty includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and intimate conduct, with the Court emphasizing the government's role in not punishing behavior that does not harm the public. The Court's decision in Bolling v. Sharpe, on the same day as Brown v. Board of Education, held that segregation in public schools violated the Equal Protection Clause. Bolling involved the District of Columbia school system, not subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits deprivation of rights by the federal government. The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, although lacking an explicit Equal Protection Clause, was used by the Court to strike down racial segregation in DC public schools. The Court reasoned that due process guarantees implicitly include equal protection, derived from the American ideal of fairness. Proponents argue that moral principles underlie constitutional text, like the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supporters of moral reasoning in constitutional interpretation believe that it allows for flexibility in incorporating contemporary values and filling gaps in the text to address unforeseen situations. Critics argue that courts should not act as \"moral arbiters\" and that ethical arguments are not objectively based. Critics of moral reasoning in constitutional interpretation argue that ethical arguments are not objectively verifiable and may lead judges to rely on their own policy views, which opponents view as undemocratic. Some suggest leaving moral considerations to the political branches. Another approach, closely related but distinct, is judicial reasoning based on the concept of a \"national ethos.\" This ethos encompasses the unique character of American institutions and the role of the American people within them. The \"national ethos\" approach to ethical reasoning in constitutional interpretation is exemplified in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, where the Court struck down a zoning ordinance that interfered with the American institution of the family. The Court emphasized the importance of the family in American life and tradition, protecting its sanctity as a deeply rooted value passed down through generations. The Court's reliance on national ethos as a rationale is exemplified in cases like West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, where the First Amendment prohibited a state from compelling students to salute the American flag. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the unique form of constitutional government in the United States that avoids government coercion for national unity. The Court highlighted the nation's character reflected in the Constitution, stating that no official can prescribe orthodox beliefs or force citizens to confess their faith. The debate over reliance on the \"national ethos\" in constitutional interpretation is similar to arguments about using moral reasoning. Proponents argue that the \"national ethos\" method allows judges to incorporate contemporary American values into the Constitution's meaning. This approach is seen as more legitimate because it is tied to the identity and values of the United States. One common mode of constitutional interpretation is based on the structure of the Constitution, focusing on the relationships among the three branches of the federal government. Critics argue that this approach involves unelected judges determining the Constitution's meaning based on unverifiable principles, which should be decided by the political branches. The Constitution's structure focuses on the relationships among the federal government's branches, including separation of powers, federalism, and government-people relations. Formalism interprets federal power allocation through the Constitution, as seen in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha. The Court ruled that one house of Congress couldn't unilaterally limit executive branch authority. The Court's decision in Chadha regarding the one-house legislative veto was based on the formalist structural reasoning established by the Constitution. Another example of formalist reasoning in federalism is seen in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, where the Court struck down an Arkansas State Constitution amendment limiting congressional candidates' terms. The Court in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton struck down an amendment to the Arkansas State Constitution, emphasizing the formal structural relationships established by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution. They argued that allowing states to set distinct qualifications for congressional service would undermine the national legislature envisioned by the Framers. The Court did not use a balancing test but focused on the allocation of power between the federal and state governments. Functionalism, unlike formalism, interprets the Constitution's text as outlining the relationship among federal branches at their apexes, leaving the distribution of power below to be determined in practice. This approach, seen in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland, considers balancing competing governmental interests as a key methodology. The Court in McCulloch v. Maryland determined that Congress had the implied power to create a central bank under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement its express powers to tax and spend. The Court emphasized that the terms \"necessary\" and \"proper\" should not restrict Congress's power, examining the Constitution's structure to support its decision. The McCulloch Court determined that Congress had the implied power to create a central bank under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement its express powers. There is a debate among structuralists on whether to use a formalist or functionalist approach when interpreting the Constitution. This debate revolves around fidelity to the Constitution, original meaning, and the allocation of power between branches of government. Formalism in constitutional interpretation focuses on adherence to structural divisions in the Constitution to preserve liberty. An example is the Court's decision in Chadha, which emphasized the importance of following the Constitution's prescribed legislative procedures. This approach contrasts with the functionalist perspective on interpreting the Constitution. The formalist approach to separation-of-powers questions rejects historical practices and balancing tests, while functionalism emphasizes core functions of branches. In Zivotofsky v. Kerry, the Court held that the President has exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, preventing Congress from contradicting the President's policy. The Court upheld the President's exclusive power on recognition, citing the need for a \"single policy\" on legitimate governments to avoid confusion. This functionalist approach in separation-of-powers cases was also seen in Morrison v. Olson, where the Court upheld provisions allowing for appointment of an independent counsel to investigate high-ranking officials. The Court upheld the independent counsel's authority to investigate high-ranking officials for violations of federal laws, providing significant independence from the President. The decision, in a 7-1 ruling, determined that the special prosecutor's jurisdiction did not impermissibly interfere with the President's executive authority under Article II. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the majority did not adhere to the Constitution's strict power allocations among branches of government. Structuralism in constitutional interpretation considers the entire text of the Constitution, providing clearer justifications for decisions. It argues for a firmer basis for personal rights compared to textualism or moral reasoning. For example, in Crandall v. Nevada, a state law imposing a tax was struck down. In Crandall v. Nevada, the Court inferred a right to travel among states from the Constitution's structural relationship between citizens and the federal government. Structuralists argue this method provides a firmer basis for establishing constitutional rights like the right to travel, although critics suggest it may not always lead to clear answers. Critics argue that structuralism in constitutional interpretation may not always lead to clear answers. Some believe that determinations about the proper structure established by the Constitution are subjective. While Professor Charles Black emphasized structure as the most important mode of interpretation, others argue it provides \"no firm basis for personal rights\" as personal rights are vulnerable to government manipulation. Judicial precedents are not the only relevant precedents for constitutional interpretation. Historical practices are crucial for constitutional interpretation, serving as a source of meaning in cases involving separation of powers, federalism, and individual rights when the text is unclear. The Court's decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Canning exemplifies reliance on tradition in interpreting the Constitution, such as determining the President's authority for recess appointments based on historical practices. The influence of historical practices on constitutional interpretation is evident in cases like Zivotofsky v. Kerry and Marsh v. Chambers, where the Court relied on long-standing traditions to determine government powers. In Marsh v. Chambers, the Court upheld the state's practice of paying a chaplain with public funds to open legislative sessions with a prayer, citing the long-standing tradition of legislative prayer in the country's history. The debate over historical practices in interpreting the Constitution echoes elements of debates over original meaning and judicial precedent. Functionalists see historical practices as important for constitutional meaning, while formalists view them as irrelevant. They argue that historical practices provide an objective basis for decision-making and stability in the law. This approach is especially significant in cases involving the allocation of power among branches of government. Opposing reliance on historical practices for constitutional interpretation raises concerns about the difficulty in definitively establishing relevant historical practices, potential bias in selecting sources, and the lack of clear interpretation. This debate mirrors discussions on original meaning and judicial precedent, with functionalists valuing historical practices for stability in the law, especially in cases involving power allocation among government branches. Critics argue that relying on historical practices for constitutional interpretation can lead to inconsistent results and legitimize offensive practices like slavery or segregation. This approach may also hinder the protection of minority rights and impede innovation by the political branches. The Court relies on historical practices for constitutional interpretation when exercising judicial review. Understanding these methods aids in interpreting the Constitution for government officials and individuals."
