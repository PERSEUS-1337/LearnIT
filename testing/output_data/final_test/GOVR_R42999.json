Established in 1946 after World War II, UNESCO aims to promote collaboration in education, science, and culture among its 195 member states. With an annual budget of $326 million, its programs cover various issues like literacy, media freedom, ocean management, and environmental preservation. The US played a key role in UNESCO's establishment and has generally supported the organization. The United States has had a mixed relationship with UNESCO, with concerns about politicization and budget discipline leading to its withdrawal in 1984. Since rejoining in 2003, Congress has shown support by providing significant funding. In 2011, UNESCO drew attention when \"Palestine\" was admitted as a member. The United States withheld funding to UNESCO from FY2012 through FY2014, amounting to nearly $80 million per year, or 22% of the annual budget, due to Palestine's admission as a member. The Obama Administration opposes Palestinian membership in UNESCO, advocating for direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians for statehood. The Obama Administration opposes Palestinian membership in UNESCO and believes statehood should be achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Despite this, President Obama requested $80 million in funding for UNESCO in FY2013 and FY2014, but Congress did not enact a waiver to release the funds. Critics argue that waiving the funding restrictions would undermine U.S. credibility and encourage Palestinians to seek membership in other U.N. entities. Congress may consider UNESCO's role in U.S. foreign policy as the debate over funding and participation continues. UNESCO's role in U.S. foreign policy, effectiveness, and reform efforts, as well as the implications of withholding funding. Policy makers are also considering laws restricting funding for U.N. entities admitting Palestine. The pressing question is how the U.S. will engage with UNESCO amid financial withholding and loss of voting rights. UNESCO's programs cover education, natural sciences, social sciences, culture, and communication. UNESCO promotes media freedom, conservation of cultural heritage, and supports member states in educational and cultural programs. It oversees international conventions and commissions, with over 2,000 personnel from 170 countries. The General Conference, composed of representatives from member countries, is UNESCO's primary decision-making body, meeting every two years to determine policies. The General Conference is UNESCO's primary decision-making body, meeting every two years to determine policies, programs, and budget. The Executive Board, composed of 58 member state representatives, implements the program adopted by the General Conference. The Director-General, currently Irina Bokova of Bulgaria, heads the UNESCO Secretariat and is appointed for a four-year term by the General Conference on the recommendation of the Executive Board. The Director-General (DG) of UNESCO is responsible for organizational structures, staff appointments, and negotiations on budgets, resolutions, and programs. The Executive Board and General Conference have committees made up of member countries that address organization functioning and specific issues in education, science, and culture. UNESCO collaborates with over 350 NGOs, 20 foundations, private companies, and intergovernmental organizations through various partnerships and relationships. UNESCO collaborates with over 80 IGOs, including the EU and development banks, through formal agreements. It also partners with other U.N. entities and strengthens relationships through National Commissions in 199 countries, which provide links with NGOs, governments, and the public. Commission members help implement programs, studies, and media outreach. UNESCO's activities are funded through member contributions and partnerships with other organizations. The U.S. contributes the largest share to UNESCO's budget. The decision to admit Palestine as a member has affected UNESCO's budget, leading the U.S. to withhold contributions. Laws enacted in the 1990s prohibit funding to U.N. entities that admit the PLO as a member or grant full membership as a state to any organization lacking statehood attributes. The U.S. suspension of contributions left UNESCO with a $72 million shortfall by the end of 2011, leading to a $188 million funding reduction for the 2012-2013 budget. Director-General Bokova introduced initiatives and funding reductions to cover these budget shortfalls, including launching an Emergency Multi-Donor Fund for UNESCO Priority Programs and Reform Initiatives. UNESCO implemented cost-cutting measures and abolished staff positions to address the financial impact of U.S. withholdings. Despite balancing the books, Director-General Bokova highlighted the ongoing challenge of limited resources to fulfill UNESCO's mission. Fundraising efforts like the Multi-Donor Fund were seen as temporary solutions. Bokova acknowledges that fundraising efforts like the Multi-Donor Fund are not long-term solutions to UNESCO's funding gaps. Some U.S. policy makers support UNESCO's goal of international collaboration in education, science, and communication but have concerns about its efficiency. Critics, including Members of Congress, raise issues of politicization and organizational weaknesses within UNESCO. Efforts are being made to address these concerns through internal evaluations and reform. In October 2011, UNESCO faced controversy over admitting Palestine as a member, with some U.S. officials criticizing it as a political decision reflecting a disproportionate focus on Israel. This move was part of broader efforts by Palestinian leaders to gain international recognition for statehood. President Mahmoud Abbas sought international recognition for Palestinian statehood, leading to a U.N. General Assembly vote in November 2012. The vote changed Palestine's status to a \"non-member observer state,\" with 138 in favor, 9 against (including the U.S.), and 41 abstaining. Concerns have been raised about Syria's membership in UNESCO committees, particularly the CR committee, which assesses countries' compliance with human rights conventions. In January 2012, the United States and other countries tried to remove Syria from the CR committee at UNESCO due to human rights violations. Critics argue that UNESCO's organizational structure hinders its objectives, with concerns about transparency in hiring practices. Syria's term on the committee is set to end in late 2014. Critics of UNESCO's governance structure highlight issues such as favoring geographic representation and gender balance over merit, leading to frustration among staff and hindering effectiveness. They also criticize the organization for lengthy meetings focused on administrative matters, lack of collaboration and communication, and an imbalance between administrative and programmatic costs. The 2012-2013 biennium budget for UNESCO was $653 million, with $57.7 million allocated for education. Staff costs accounted for nearly $32 million, leaving $25 million for education activities. UNESCO's budget has decreased while staffing costs have increased, reducing funding for programs. An Independent External Evaluation report in August 2010 highlighted concerns about UNESCO's effectiveness and programmatic coherence. The Independent External Evaluation report in August 2010 raised concerns about UNESCO's programmatic coherence and effectiveness. It pointed out issues such as weak incentives for collaboration, sectoral budget systems, and the challenge of measuring impact. The report also highlighted the need for more capable and well-resourced regional and subregional bureaus to improve UNESCO's field presence. The Independent External Evaluation report in August 2010 raised concerns about UNESCO's programmatic coherence and effectiveness, highlighting issues like weak collaboration incentives and challenges in measuring impact. The report recommended strategic directions for UNESCO to improve focus, field presence, participation in the U.N. system, governance mechanisms, and partnership strategy. UNESCO member states have implemented various reforms to improve the organization's effectiveness. Despite successful reforms between 1984 and 2003, experts believe additional changes are necessary. The recent reform activities are driven by recommendations from an Independent External Evaluation report, leading to 87 \"action points\" agreed upon by the Executive Board and GC. The Executive Board and GC agreed to 87 \"action points\" for reform, with 70 completed as of September 2013. Activities included adjusting budgeting, reviewing partnerships, and implementing a decentralization strategy in Africa and Arab states. Member states also agreed to a human resources management strategy focusing on talent management and staff capacity enhancement. UNESCO is focused on enhancing staff capacity and creating an enabling work environment. They are also participating in U.N. reform efforts, such as the \"Delivering as One\" initiative. The success of these reform efforts depends on effective implementation by UNESCO and its member countries. The United States, while generally supportive of UNESCO, has also been critical of the organization. The United States, including some Members of Congress, has been critical of UNESCO, leading to a nearly 20-year withdrawal in 1984 and subsequent rejoining in 2003. The U.S. engages with UNESCO through its Mission in Paris, working on policy priorities like combating illiteracy, water resource management, climate change, and preserving world heritage sites. The U.S. also supports the U.S. National Commission to UNESCO, involving experts from various sectors. The United States is withholding contributions to UNESCO due to the decision to admit Palestine as a member. U.S. laws prohibit funding to U.N. entities that grant membership to groups without internationally recognized statehood attributes. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-246) prohibits funds for the United Nations or its specialized agencies if they grant the Palestine Liberation Organization the same status as member states. The United States opposed Palestine's admission to UNESCO and emphasized support for direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for a sovereign Palestinian state. Despite withholding contributions, the U.S. remains committed to finding ways to support and strengthen UNESCO's work. The U.S. Mission to UNESCO has shifted focus to emphasize U.S. engagement and influence. In late 2013, the U.S. lost its vote in the UNESCO General Conference due to unpaid assessments for 2011 and 2012. Despite this, the Obama Administration officials stated that the U.S. would remain a member and recognized UNESCO as a critical partner. The United States, as a member of UNESCO, is committed to engaging with the organization and maintaining its seat on the UNESCO Executive Board. The U.S. pays 22% of the UNESCO regular budget, approximately $80 million annually, funded through the Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) appropriations account. Additionally, the U.S. makes voluntary contributions to specific UNESCO programs such as the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) and World Heritage Fund through the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account. The United States has withheld funding to UNESCO from FY2012 through FY2014, with the President requesting nearly $80 million in assessed contributions and $880,000 in voluntary funds for scientific, educational, and cultural activities. Congress has not enacted a waiver to waive or modify legislative restrictions on funding. The controversy over Palestinian membership and fiscal austerity may lead policymakers to reconsider U.S. participation and funding of UNESCO. Concerns include the impact of U.S. withholding on influence within UNESCO, such as the inability to vote on key decisions and shape internal policies. Some worry that the financial withholding has negatively impacted key activities, including Holocaust education programs, tsunami early warning systems, and educational programs for women and girls. Analysts note that UNESCO activities funded by voluntary contributions from other countries, not the U.S., are viewed as priorities. The U.S. withholding of funding from UNESCO has raised concerns about the impact on the organization's programs and activities. While some believe it has crippled existing activities, others point out that UNESCO was able to function without U.S. support in the past. The long-term effects of the funding cut remain uncertain. The U.S. withholding of funding from UNESCO has raised concerns about the impact on the organization's programs and activities. UNESCO continues to take actions in response to the funding decrease, including adjustments to the budget and programming. There are questions about UNESCO's ability to solicit extrabudgetary contributions to cover budget shortfalls and when the United States will resume financial contributions. The financial withholding has also raised broader issues about legislative restrictions on U.S. contributions to U.N. entities admitting Palestine as a member. In 2012, then-U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Susan Rice questioned the relevance of 20-year-old restrictions on funding to UNESCO due to changes in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. She suggested that the U.S. should continue funding UNESCO and work from within to influence member states. Conversely, some policymakers argue that withholding funding deters Palestinian membership efforts and support for Palestine in the U.N. Some argue that modifying legislative restrictions to fund UNESCO could encourage Palestine to seek U.N. membership. Others believe the restrictions have hindered Palestine's membership efforts. Critics also question if UNESCO's activities align with U.S. foreign policy interests. Some critics suggest the United States should focus on bilateral projects aligned with its priorities, citing frustration with UNESCO's perceived anti-American leanings and disproportionate focus on Israel. They question UNESCO's effectiveness in addressing global issues and recommend the organization reevaluate its mission to stay relevant in the changing multilateral landscape. Supporters of UNESCO argue that U.S. participation and funding are crucial for influencing the organization's activities and pursuing foreign policy objectives, especially in key regions like the Middle East. They stress the importance of sharing costs and resources with other governments and organizations to maintain influence and prevent other countries from shaping UNESCO programs. Proponents argue that UNESCO's convening power and neutrality enhance its effectiveness in addressing global challenges like coordinating tsunami warning systems and protecting World Heritage sites. However, UNESCO faces challenges in implementing organizational reform due to differing government perspectives on its role in the global framework. These differences lead to disagreements on budgeting, programming, and membership, potentially diluting UNESCO's mandate. UNESCO faces challenges in implementing organizational reform due to differing government perspectives on its role in the global framework. The GC and Executive Board approve new themes and programs without allocating additional resources, leading to weak or duplicated programs. Developing countries, represented by the G-77, often advance their agendas through politicized votes, while developed countries provide the majority of funding. Countries, like the United States, contribute the most funding to UNESCO but lack proportional decision-making power. They may use extrabudgetary funding to influence specific programs or seek assistance from other international organizations for their priorities, potentially undermining UNESCO's authority. Observers note that UNESCO is losing its advantage in the education sector, with some criticizing its leadership. Many argue that the U.S. withholding of funding from UNESCO could drive the organization to reform, but critics believe it has had minimal impact. UNESCO has responded by creating new funding streams rather than implementing substantive change. The future role of UNESCO as a tool of U.S. foreign policy is uncertain, with various events potentially influencing U.S. actions towards the organization. Prospects for U.S. funding of UNESCO may be affected by fiscal austerity. Prospects for U.S. funding of UNESCO may be influenced by fiscal austerity debates and UNESCO's response to the U.S. withholding. Lawmakers may consider restoring funding if UNESCO implements reforms or rescinds Palestine's membership. The U.S. faces the challenge of engaging with UNESCO amid financial withholding and loss of voting rights. Concerns exist about the U.S. losing influence in the organization. Many policy makers are concerned about the United States losing influence in UNESCO due to accumulating arrearages. Some suggest the U.S. should withdraw, while others, including the Obama Administration, believe engagement should continue."
