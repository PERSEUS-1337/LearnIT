Post-classification methods aim to improve accuracy by smoothing model predictions, but they often require an additional neural network, adding overhead. Our proposed approach involves learning deep features directly from neighboring scene images using a siamese network to enhance the discriminative power of convolutional neural networks without the need for a cleanup model. This method leverages semantic coherence between image pairs to enrich the feature vector for predicting labels. The approach proposed involves learning deep features directly from neighboring scene images using a siamese network to enhance the discriminative power of convolutional neural networks without the need for a cleanup model. This method leverages semantic coherence between image pairs to enrich the feature vector for predicting labels. Empirical results show performance gains in prediction accuracy and mean squared error reduction on a disease density estimation task, comparable to existing post-classification methods without implementation overheads. Remote sensing scene image analysis is an important area of research for deep learning algorithms in various applications such as land-use land-cover analysis, urban planning, and natural disaster detection. The formulation in Eq. 1 is inadequate for problems requiring knowledge of neighborhood semantic coherence. Previous studies have addressed leveraging semantic coherence among neighboring scene images as a post-classification task, such as using a second classifier for pixel smoothing. Incorporating structure into image patch prediction involves stacking neural networks to refine predictions made by another classifier. While this method improves model performance, it requires at least two stages of classification tasks. Unlike post-classification methods, this work focuses on improving model accuracy on scene images by considering knowledge of neighboring scenes during the training process. The model training process involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze the conditional co-dependency of scene images. A network architecture with four components is proposed, including a siamese sub-network, a similarity metric learning component, a convolutional network, and a decision layer. The siamese sub-network extracts features from neighboring scene images to evaluate their similarity, enhancing the model's accuracy. The proposed model utilizes a decision layer for classification or regression, outperforming a baseline model. It improves predictive performance with a small training set and is fast to train using a pre-trained model for the siamese sub-network. The model exploits semantic coherence between neighboring tiles to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed model utilizes a CNN architecture to improve prediction accuracy by exploiting semantic coherence between neighboring tiles in aerial scene images. Empirical evidence demonstrates the viability of this approach on a disease density estimation task. A limitation of the SMOTE technique is discovered, highlighting the importance of preserving spatial proximity between scene image data points in deep feature learning over neighboring scene images. The curr_chunk discusses the use of siamese networks to enhance the discriminative ability of CNNs in image classification. Bischof et al. (1992) proposed a model using a multi-layer perceptron to classify satellite images with 'salt and pepper' noise. The network had seven input units corresponding to Landsat TM spectral bands and generated two channels for class prediction and confidence levels. A post-classification smoothing operation was performed using a two-layer NN. The curr_chunk discusses post-classification smoothing using a two-layer NN and the use of texture information to enhance classification accuracy. Mnih (2013) introduces indirect dependencies between model outputs to address issues like disconnected blobs in predicted maps. The architecture involves stacking NNs, with each level cleanup NN taking a patch of the previous map as input and outputting a patch for the next level. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and siamese neural networks (SNN) to improve predictions in deep learning models. The CRF introduces explicit dependencies between neighboring pixels, resulting in a precision and recall improvement of 0.0195. The drawback of post-classification smoothing operations is the need for additional models, making approaches that bypass this requirement desirable. Siamese neural networks (SNN) consist of two shared weight sub-networks that extract features from concurrent inputs to determine similarity based on a distance metric. SNN have been used for remote sensing scene image understanding, with applications in satellite scene image classification to improve discriminative ability. The siamese network extracts features from dual input images to predict labels and measure similarity using a square layer. It enhances feature discrimination by minimizing Euclidean distance for similar pairs and maximizing it for dissimilar pairs. The siamese network aims to separate similar image pairs from dissimilar ones in feature space by minimizing the Euclidean distance between similar pairs and maximizing it for dissimilar pairs. The model optimizes for two objective functions: a distance loss function and a regularization term. The Siamese AlexNet model achieved the highest feature discrimination accuracy gain on the NWPU-RESIC45 benchmark dataset. An end-to-end pipeline is proposed with four components: a siamese sub-network, similarity metric learning function, convolutional network, and decision layer. The siamese sub-network extracts features from scene images and learns a similarity metric. The convolutional network uses the feature vectors to predict a label for image patches. The proposed architecture includes a siamese sub-network using Xception and ResNet-50 models for transfer learning. Xception focuses on space-wise and channel-wise feature representations, outperforming Inception V3, ResNet-152, and VGG-16 in speed and accuracy. ResNet addresses gradient issues with shortcut connections, enabling deeper CNN architectures. The proposed architecture utilizes Xception and ResNet-50 models for transfer learning, enabling deeper CNN architectures for higher accuracy rates. The similarity function evaluates input image pairs to determine similarity, optimizing feature distance between similar images. The distance between image pairs is calculated with a margin \u03c4, separating similar and dissimilar image features. The objective functions are optimized to identify neighboring images that are semantically closest in likeness for feature co-learning. The proposed architecture utilizes Xception and ResNet-50 models for transfer learning to optimize feature distance between similar images. Neighboring images are determined to be closest in likeness for feature co-learning based on Euclidean distance calculations. The architecture utilizes Xception and ResNet-50 models for transfer learning to optimize feature distance between similar images. Neighboring images are determined to be closest in likeness for feature co-learning based on Euclidean distance calculations. In the analysis, only the preceding neighbor to the tile at location i is considered for similarity analysis. The network is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function and features resulting from merging feature vector pairs. The convolutional network consists of three dense layers with feature averaging as the merge operation. The CNN parameters are learned by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the training for a classification task. The CNN parameters are learned by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the training data for a multi-class problem using cross-entropy. Stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches is used for optimization. The implementation includes a fully connected network with a 3-way softmax classifier. The model is also optimized for mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) losses. The method is applied to estimating disease density from satellite scenes. The method applied involves estimating disease density from satellite scene imagery by dis-aggregating epidemic data to 250m 2 grids using population data and creating a weighting scheme. Building concentration data consists of land-use type buildings extracted from satellite imagery. The method involves using housing data from satellite images to train a model for disease density classification. Disease density classes were created by binning normalized data into different categories based on epidemic data. The study involves using housing concentration data from satellite images to classify disease density into high, low, and moderate classes. A learning task is formulated to estimate disease density for a patch of land based on deep features learned from neighboring scene images using a CNN model. The study utilized CNN models, specifically Xception net and ResNet-50, for disease incidence estimation using transfer learning. Regularization methods and hyperparameter values were applied uniformly across network architectures. The model was trained on a combined dataset before evaluation, showing promising results in Table 1. The study used ResNet-50 and Xception net models for disease density estimation from housing satellite scene data. ResNet-50 outperformed Xception on image similarity detection, while Xception performed better on disease density estimation. Both models had low overall performance, with the proposed model consistently outperforming the baseline. The study compared the performance of ResNet-50 and Xception net models for disease density estimation from housing satellite scene data. The model using Xception net achieved higher precision, recall, and f1-score compared to the baseline model. Confusion matrix and AUROC plots showed that the proposed model performed better on medium and low disease density classes but worse on high disease density class. The results from both models were similar to chance, with ResNet-50 performing better overall. The study compared ResNet-50 and Xception net models for disease density estimation from housing satellite scene data. The model using ResNet-50 outperformed the one using Xception net, achieving better MAE and MSE scores. Our proposed model consistently performed better than the baseline, showing improvement in accuracy and regression tasks. However, overall results from our model were poor despite using a siamese network to enhance CNN discriminative power for aerial scene image classification. The poor overall results of our model, with a maximum accuracy of 34 percent, may be attributed to three factors: a small training data set of 12,070 images leading to potential overfitting, an unbalanced data set affecting feature learning, and class imbalance impacting prediction accuracy. Despite the low overall performance of the model, it was shown that improving model accuracy is possible by learning deep features over neighboring scene images in disease density estimation. The challenge was preserving spatial proximity between neighboring tiles, crucial for deep feature learning."
