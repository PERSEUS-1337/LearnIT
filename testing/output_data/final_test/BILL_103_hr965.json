TITLE II--CHILDREN'S BICYCLE HELMET SAFETY\n\nThis title is known as the \"Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1994\" and establishes a program for bicycle helmet safety. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1994 allows the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to grant funds to promote bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16. Grants cover up to 80% of program costs, with recipients responsible for the remaining share. Funds allocated to a subdivision or nonprofit organization for specific purposes can be credited without the need for actual expenditures related to the program. The grant under section 202 can be used to enforce bicycle helmet laws for individuals under 16, provide helmets to those in need, educate on helmet importance, and combine these activities. Grant applications must comply with these purposes before approval. The Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will report to Congress by May 1, 1997, on the effectiveness of the grant program established by section 202. The report will include a list of grant recipients, types of programs implemented, and any recommendations for future changes. Additionally, section 205 addresses standards. Bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after enactment must conform to interim standards (Z90.4-1984, B-90, F 1447) until a final standard is established within 60 days. The final standard for bicycle helmets must include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off, address injury risks to children, and may include additional provisions. Certain sections of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply to this proceeding. The final standard will take effect one year after issuance. The final standard for bicycle helmets, developed under subsection (c), will be considered a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Until the final standard takes effect, non-conforming helmets will be in violation of safety standards. Authorization of appropriations for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration grant program: $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1996, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1997. Definition of \"approved bicycle helmet\" includes meeting interim and final standards."
