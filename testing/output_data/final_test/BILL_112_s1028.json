    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Foreign-Held Debt Transparency and Threat Assessment Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \n\nThe term \"debt instruments of the United States\" includes bills, notes, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or its entities.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress found that on March 16, 2006, the Senate narrowly passed legislation to increase the public debt limit. Then-Senator Barack Obama opposed the bill, stating that raising the debt weakens the country and shows a failure of leadership. The United States is facing a debt problem and a failure of leadership, with the burden of bad choices being passed onto future generations. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of addressing the federal budget deficit for national security, as reliance on foreign creditors weakens the country's ability to protect its security and show leadership. The Federal debt, currently over $14 trillion, is seen as the greatest threat to national security by Admiral Mike Mullen. The Department of the Treasury borrows from the private economy to finance the deficit, adding to the debt. The Federal debt is over $14 trillion, with foreign holdings of US Treasury securities exceeding $3.1 trillion. China is the largest holder with over $1.1 trillion. Efforts to identify the nationality of foreign holders may not accurately reflect the true entities involved. The Department of the Treasury report from February 28, 2011, assigns $732 billion worth of US securities to the Cayman Islands, a major international financial center. Simon Johnson testified that US Treasury data understate Chinese holdings. Dr. Eswar Prasad testified that United States Treasury data underestimate Chinese holdings of US Government debt, suggesting that China's actual holdings are much higher than reported. He also mentioned that China may be using offshore dollars in London-based banks to purchase US Treasury securities. According to Dr. Prasad, China holds over $1.3 trillion in US Treasury securities, making them the largest foreign investor in the United States. This financial power can also influence political and military dynamics, as highlighted in reports by the Heritage Foundation and the Council on Foreign Relations. The United States' reliance on other governments for financing is seen as a strategic vulnerability, with Chinese military officials discussing the use of US Treasury securities to influence US policy. The PLA considers using economic means, such as dumping US government bonds, as retaliation for US arms sales to Taiwan. They also emphasize the importance of nonmilitary deterrence, including economic and technological aspects, to maximize effectiveness. According to reports, a congressional delegation of US Senators visited China and was reprimanded by a Chinese official over the US Federal debt. China's holdings of US Government securities have influenced US national security policy. The Obama Administration officials softened a key national security document to avoid upsetting Chinese officials due to economic ties. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review was altered to downplay China's military buildup. China's significant holdings of US Government debt give them leverage in funding their military programs. China plans to increase its 2011 military budget by 12.7 percent to 601 billion yuan ($91.5 billion), in addition to a 7.5 percent increase in 2010. The Department of Defense estimates China's total military spending for 2009 to be over $150 billion. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 4. The growing Federal debt of the United States could jeopardize national security and economic stability. Dependence on foreign creditors may make the US vulnerable to undue influence. China is the largest foreign creditor. Transparency in foreign holdings of US debt needs improvement, especially regarding China. China's large holdings of US debt could give them leverage to manipulate US policymaking, including the relationship with Taiwan. If displeased, China could destabilize the US economy by rapidly divesting their holdings. China's significant holdings of US debt could threaten the US economy and national security, warranting further analysis and evaluation. SEC. 5. QUARTERLY REPORT ON RISKS POSED BY FOREIGN HOLDINGS OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES. The President must submit quarterly reports on foreign holdings of US debt instruments to congressional committees, including data on creditors' country of domicile and the total amount of debt held. The President must submit quarterly reports on foreign holdings of US debt instruments to congressional committees, including analysis of the purpose and risks posed by each country's holdings. The reports must be made public in unclassified form. The President must make quarterly reports on foreign holdings of US debt instruments public by posting them on the Internet in an unclassified form. SEC. 6. ANNUAL REPORT ON RISKS POSED BY THE FEDERAL DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit an annual report to Congress on the risks posed by the Federal debt, including an analysis of national security and economic stability risks, a determination of sustainability, and recommendations for reducing unsustainable risks. SEC. 7. CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS UNACCEPTABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE RISKS TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. The President must take action within 30 days if foreign country's debt holdings pose a risk to US national security or economic stability. This includes formulating a plan, submitting a report to Congress, and implementing the plan promptly to protect the US long-term interests."
