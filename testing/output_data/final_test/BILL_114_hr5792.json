    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Modernizing Outdated and Vulnerable Equipment and Information Technology Act of 2016\" or the \"MOVE IT Act\". Congress finds that cloud computing, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-145, offers efficient, cost-saving, and powerful computing capabilities that can eliminate duplication, reduce costs, and combat waste, fraud, and abuse in Government services. The Act aims to accelerate the acquisition and deployment of cloud computing services in the Federal Government to address cybersecurity needs and transform service delivery to the public. It supports a Federal certification standard for cloud service providers under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. The Act aims to accelerate the adoption of cloud computing services in the Federal Government to enhance cybersecurity and service delivery. It promotes a certification standard for cloud service providers and provides guidance for agencies migrating to cloud services while ensuring adherence to security practices. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is established to accelerate the adoption of cloud computing services in the Federal Government, enhance cybersecurity, and provide guidance for agencies migrating to cloud services while ensuring adherence to security practices. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requires covered agencies to obtain authorization from the Joint Authorization Board before storing or processing Government information on a Federal information system with any cloud service provider. The Director of National Intelligence can waive requirements for national security systems. The Director of National Intelligence can waive requirements for national security systems if deemed necessary for national security interests. A notification must be submitted to relevant committees within 30 days of exercising the waiver. This section does not limit the Office of Management and Budget's ability to update Federal guidelines on cloud computing security. SEC. 4. EXPANDED INDUSTRY COLLABORATION AND METRICS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FEDERAL RISK AND AUTHORIZATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OFFICE. The Director will work with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Office to create guidelines for submitting authorization applications. These guidelines aim to streamline the accreditation process by providing regular status updates to applicants and offering enhanced training opportunities for agencies and cloud service providers. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program clarifies the role of third-party assessment organizations, the acceptance of certifications from other organizations, and the responsibility of covered agencies in the authorization process. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program requires compliance for contracts and cloud services with covered agencies. The FedRAMP Liaison Group, consisting of cloud service providers, works with the Program Management Office and NIST to facilitate public-private industry collaboration. The FedRAMP Liaison Group, hosted by the General Services Administration, meets regularly to provide recommendations to the Program Management Office and the Joint Authorization Board. The group is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Program Management Office supports covered agencies in their compliance efforts. The Office works with covered agencies to establish authorization to operate, facilitate approval with cloud service providers, and support partnership among agencies. The Director, with NIST and the FedRAMP Liaison Group, sets performance metrics, including time limits for authorizations not exceeding six months. The Director, in collaboration with NIST and the FedRAMP Liaison Group, sets performance metrics for authorization to operate, including time limits not exceeding six months. A report on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Office is required to be submitted to relevant committees within one year of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL BUDGET AUTHORITIES FOR IT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION. The Director, in consultation with the Chief Information Officers Council, will assess cloud computing opportunities and issue policies for standardized security assessment and authorization. Each covered agency will establish an IT working capital fund for modernization expenses, funded through various sources. The IT working capital fund can be established through reprogramming or transfer of funds, or discretionary appropriations, for modernization expenses. The IT working capital fund can be used for replacing legacy systems, transitioning to cloud computing, supporting information security efforts, and enhancing IT capabilities. The IT working capital fund can be used for developmental, modernization, and enhancement activities of information technology. Existing funds cannot be supplanted, and reprogramming of funds must be approved by the Federal Chief Information Officer. The IT working capital fund can be used for IT activities, with reprogramming or transfer of excess amounts over $500,000 requiring approval from the Committees on Appropriations. Any funds deposited into the IT working capital fund must be returned. Any funds deposited into an IT working capital fund must be obligated within 3 years, or they will be rescinded and deposited into the general fund. The head of covered agencies must submit semiannual reports on fund obligation and expenditure to relevant committees. The Comptroller General of the United States shall submit annual reports on the implementation and operation of IT working capital funds, comparing current practices with industry best practices. The Comptroller General of the United States shall submit annual reports on the implementation and operation of IT working capital funds, including details on the fund's use, operation, efficacy in accelerating technology transitions, and recommendations for improvement. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"authorization to operate\" refers to approval and accreditation for cloud computing service providers to offer secure services to covered agencies. \"Cloud computing\" is defined by NIST, and a \"cloud service provider\" offers cloud computing services to commercial and government entities. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program Office, information systems, and information technology. The covered agencies are specified in section 901(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the Director refers to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The curr_chunk defines terms related to technology, legacy information technology systems, national security systems, and third party assessment organizations."
