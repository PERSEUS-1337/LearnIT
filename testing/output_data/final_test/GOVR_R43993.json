    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits can be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit (EB) program. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program, which provided additional weeks of benefits, expired on December 28, 2013. Currently, no state is in an active EB period. For more information on the expired EUC08 program, see CRS Report R42444. The Social Security Act of 1935 authorizes the UC program to provide up to 26 weeks of benefits. Former federal workers may be eligible for benefits through the UCFE program, while ex-servicemembers may qualify through the UCX program. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991 ensures equal treatment for ex-servicemembers in benefit levels and duration. UC benefits are determined by each state, resulting in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month base period. States have varying methods to determine eligibility, with most replacing half of a claimant's average weekly wage. Individuals must have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and be able to work, available, and actively seeking work to receive UC benefits. Eligibility requirements for Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits ensure they go to experienced workers affected by economic conditions. The UC program is funded by federal and state payroll taxes, with a 0.6% net FUTA tax on the first $7,000 of earnings per employee. SUTA taxes fund regular UC benefits and EB payments, with a minimum state tax rate of 5.4% on the first $7,000 of earnings per employee. The state tax rate for Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits must be at least 5.4%, with employer tax rates based on UC payments to former employees. Each state has flexibility in setting its SUTA structure, with higher benefits leading to higher employer tax rates. Funds from FUTA and SUTA are deposited in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The EB program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, may extend benefits based on economic conditions. The President's FY2017 Budget Proposal included potential changes to the EB program. The EB program provides extended benefits when a state's unemployment rates reach certain levels. States can choose optional thresholds for additional weeks of benefits based on IUR and TUR criteria. The President's Budget Proposal for FY2017 includes details on the EB program. The EB program offers extended benefits based on state unemployment rates, with additional weeks available if specific criteria are met. President George W. Bush signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, creating the EUC08 program to provide temporary unemployment insurance extensions. The EUC08 program was created by Congress to extend unemployment compensation during economic slowdowns. It was administered by state UC agencies and was terminated on December 28, 2013, for most states. The sequester order implemented on March 1, 2013, affected some unemployment insurance expenditures, with regular UC, UCX, and UCFE payments not subject to reductions. EB, EUC08, and administrative funding were subject to sequester reductions. The FY2017 sequestration order required a 6.9% reduction in nondefense mandatory expenditures, with no reductions for discretionary programs. EB expenditures were reduced by 6.9% for weeks of unemployment from October 8, 2016, to September 30, 2017. EB was not available in any state during FY2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016, offsetting a 6.8% sequester reduction in non-exempt mandatory programs. In FY2016, there were no sequestration reductions for discretionary programs, projects, and activities. However, if EB benefits had become available, they would have been subject to a 6.8% sequestration reduction. Delayed EB or EUC08 benefit payments in FY2016 would have also been subject to the same reduction. In FY2015, a 7.3% reduction in nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures led to a reduction in EB expenditures. During FY2015, states faced challenges with insufficient funds to pay for unemployment benefits, leading to the need for loans within the UTF framework. California and the Virgin Islands had outstanding loans totaling $3.6 billion by October 18, 2016, which needed to be repaid to avoid interest charges and increased FUTA rates for employers. President Obama's budget proposal for FY2017 aimed to address state and federal financing concerns related to increased state borrowing for UC benefits during the recession. The proposal included reauthorizing the lapsed 0.2% FUTA surtax, increasing the taxable wage base to $40,000, and requiring states to impose a minimum tax per employee starting in 2018. The President's budget proposal for FY2017 aimed to address state and federal financing concerns related to increased state borrowing for UC benefits during the recession. It included requiring states to maintain a UTF account balance of at least 50% of the state's Average High Cost Multiple (AHCM) and altering the rules for calculating the net FUTA rate based on AHCM levels. Additionally, states would have been required to have a maximum duration of at least 26 weeks for the regular UC program and adopt policies to expand access to UC benefits. The President's budget proposal for FY2017 aimed to address state and federal financing concerns related to increased state borrowing for UC benefits during the recession. It included providing up to $5 billion in lump sum payments to states for modernizing state UC laws, with requirements such as broader federal access to UI wage records, e-filing adoption, and maintaining at least 26 weeks of benefits in the regular UC program. States would also need to adopt work incentive and benefit expansion reforms to receive the incentive payment. The work incentive reforms and benefit expansion options proposed included reemployment services, voluntary work-based programs, relocation assistance, and improved data systems. Benefit expansion options included allowing UC benefits during approved training and establishing a maximum weekly benefit amount. The President's budget proposal for FY2017 aimed to improve the Extended Benefits (EB) program by altering the triggers and funding mechanisms. It would have required all EB claimants to receive Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RES/REAs) and provided 100% federal funding if states offered at least 26 weeks of Unemployment Compensation (UC). The President's budget proposal for FY2017 aimed to improve the Extended Benefits (EB) program by altering triggers and funding mechanisms. It would have required all EB claimants to receive Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RES/REAs) and provided federal funding if states offered at least 26 weeks of Unemployment Compensation (UC). Additionally, a new wage insurance program was proposed to replace half of lost wages, up to $10,000 over two years for certain formerly unemployed workers finding lower-paying jobs. Senator Ron Johnson sponsored S. 1356, enacted as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which altered conditions for individuals to receive Unemployment Compensation for Former Servicemembers (UCX). The law prohibits concurrent receipt of UCX and Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance but has exceptions. It doubled the required days of active duty for reserve members to qualify for UCX. Representative Mac Thornberry sponsored H.R. 1735, vetoed by President Obama. Senator John McCain sponsored S. 1376 with similar provisions. Other bills aimed to eliminate double dipping of Social Security Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits. The Preserving and Reforming SSDI (PAR-SSDI) Act of 2016, introduced by Representative David Schweikert, aimed to disqualify SSDI beneficiaries from receiving benefits if they were entitled to Unemployment Compensation (UC), Extended Benefits (EB), or Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) for at least one week in a month. This would also impact the trial work period for SSDI beneficiaries. The Reducing Overlapping Payments Act (S. 343) introduced by Senator Jeff Flake aimed to disqualify individuals from receiving Social Security disability benefits if they were entitled to Unemployment Compensation (UC). The Permanently Ending Receipt by Prisoners Act (H.R. 2503) sponsored by Representative David Reichert required states to use data from the Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS) to confirm eligibility for UC benefits and prevent payments to incarcerated individuals. Representative Kevin Brady sponsored H.R. 2512, the Furloughed Federal Employee Double Dip Elimination Act, clarifying that federal employees receiving back pay after a furlough must repay any unemployment compensation. Representative Steve Pearce sponsored H.R. 1136, the Accountability in Unemployment Act of 2015, requiring drug testing for UC benefits eligibility and imposing penalties for positive tests. Representative Earl Carter sponsored H.R. 2148, the EQUIP Act, requiring UC applicants to undergo a substance abuse risk assessment and controlled substances test. Those who failed would be ineligible for benefits for 30 days. Representative Kevin Brady introduced H.R. 5945, the Ready to Work Act of 2016, aiming to terminate a DOL rule on drug testing for UC applicants. The DOL rule established occupations for drug testing UC applicants under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Bills introduced by Representatives Pascrell and Brownley aimed to extend the work opportunity tax credit for hiring UC exhaustees and veterans. Senator Blumenthal introduced a similar bill to expand and extend the tax credit program. The bill introduced by Representative Barbara Lee and Representative Frederica Wilson aimed to expand the work opportunity tax credit for hiring long-term unemployed individuals and veterans. Representative David McKinley also introduced a bill to create a permanent work opportunity tax credit for hiring in manufacturing facilities. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the Reducing Long-Term Unemployment Act, H.R. 4593, which would suspend employment and railroad retirement taxes for employers hiring unemployed individuals through 2017, with a $5,000 limit per employee. Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman introduced the Investing in Older Americans Act of 2016, H.R. 4973, making the WOTC permanent and expanding it to include older long-term unemployment recipients. H.R. 2509, sponsored by Representative James Renacci, aimed to extend the state UC demonstration projects created by P.L. 112-96 through December 31, 2019, and expand the authority for states to conduct approved demonstration projects. H.R. 2509 aimed to extend state UC demonstration projects and revise project requirements, including transferring evaluation responsibility to DOL and establishing termination procedures. The Opportunity KNOCKs Act sponsored by Representative Rodney Davis aimed to provide EUC08 claimants with work experience placements, wage insurance, and enhanced reemployment services. Additionally, H.R. 2755 sponsored by Representative Tony C\u00e1rdenas focused on allowing UC beneficiaries to participate in job training programs and remain eligible for benefits, including enrolling in coursework for postsecondary credentials. Representative Tony C\u00e1rdenas sponsored H.R. 2755, the American Worker Mobility Act of 2015, which proposed a relocation subsidy of up to $10,000 for long-term unemployed workers. H.R. 2721 and H.R. 3555 aimed to provide federal financing for short-time compensation benefits in states with existing programs, with the option for states without programs to enter into agreements with the Department of Labor for federal reimbursement. The Layoff Prevention Extension Act of 2016, introduced by Representative Rosa DeLauro and Senator Jack Reed, proposed extending federal financing for Short-Time Compensation (STC) programs for two more years. Eligible states could receive up to $700 million in grants, with funds allocated for program implementation, administration, promotion, and employer enrollment. Additionally, the Department of Labor would submit a report to Congress and the President within four years of enactment on the implementation of the provision. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Clean Energy Worker Just Transition Act (S. 2398) to provide additional weeks of unemployment benefits for workers in coal-related industries affected by the rise of alternative energy sources. Representative Evan Jenkins introduced the Creating Opportunities for America's Laid-off (COAL) Miners Act of 2016 (H.R. 5669) to add up to 26 weeks of additional unemployment benefits for affected workers. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard and Senator Patty Murray introduced the Security and Financial Empowerment Act of 2015, H.R. 3841 and S. 2208, respectively, to allow individuals who quit their job due to domestic or sexual violence to be eligible for unemployment benefits."
