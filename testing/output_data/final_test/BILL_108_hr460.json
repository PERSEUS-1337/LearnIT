    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Wildfire Prevention Act of 2003\". Congress finds that there is an increasing threat of wildfire to millions of acres of forest land and rangeland throughout the United States. Forest land and rangeland are degraded due to land management practices that disrupt the occurrence of low-intensity fires. At least 39,000,000 acres of land in the National Forest System are at high risk of wildfire, with most expenditures for wildfire suppression in the interior West. Efforts to suppress wildfires in the interior West during 1990-1994 have led to an increase in the number, size, and severity of wildfires. The population in the interior West grew rapidly in the 1990s. Prioritization of forests and communities for wildfire risk reduction has been inconsistent and insufficient, resulting in funding to areas not prone to severe wildfires. Catastrophic wildfires pose a threat to homes, communities, watersheds, and soils. A 1994 assessment in the interior West highlighted a limited window of opportunity for effective forest management before uncontrollable wildfires cause widespread damage. Catastrophic wildfires can prevent forests from regaining their former health. Healthy forest ecosystems reduce wildfire risk, enhance wildlife habitat, and increase vegetation productivity. Sustaining the long-term ecological and economic health of interior West forests and woodland requires preventing severe wildfires and allowing natural, low-intensity ground fires. More natural fire regimes depend on reducing excess fuels and thinning subdominant trees. Forest ecosystem restoration on a landscape scale is essential for increasing productivity and improving the environment. Restoration on a landscape scale is crucial for improving community protection, minimizing wildfire suppression needs, enhancing resource values, reducing rehabilitation costs, preventing habitat loss, and safeguarding forests for future generations. Despite advocacy for a shift in wildfire policy towards prevention and restoration, Federal land managers are not allocating enough attention and resources to activities that restore forest health and mitigate severe wildfire risks. The Federal wildfire research program is underfunded, hindering the ability to address emerging wildfire problems and lack of a cohesive strategy. Rigorous scientific information is needed for landscape scale restoration treatments, wildfire management technology, and the environmental review process. Collaboration with affected entities is essential. Affected entities collaborate in the development and implementation of wildfire treatment. The purpose of the collaboration among affected entities is to develop and implement wildfire treatment. The Act aims to enhance the capacity for science-based forest restoration to reduce severe wildfires and improve forest health in the interior West. It also focuses on developing knowledge for landscape-scale restoration, understanding the impacts of wildfire control, and requiring Federal agencies to use ecological restoration treatments to reverse declining forest health and reduce wildfire risks. The Act aims to dedicate funds to wildlife prevention activities, restoration treatments, and monitoring wildfire treatments based on adaptive ecosystem management. It also focuses on developing and transferring new management technologies to achieve the goals outlined in the National Fire Plan and other related reports. The Act aims to dedicate funds to wildlife prevention activities, restoration treatments, and monitoring wildfire treatments based on adaptive ecosystem management. It also focuses on providing technical assistance to collaborative efforts for ecologically sound restoration treatments.

The Act defines key terms such as adaptive ecosystem management, affected entities, Institute, and interior West. The curr_chunk defines terms related to land management in the interior West, including the definition of \"interior West,\" \"land manager,\" and \"restoration.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to forest management, including the definitions of \"Secretary,\" \"Secretaries,\" and \"stakeholder.\" SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTES. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall establish 3 Institutes to promote adaptive ecosystem management in the interior West to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health. One Institute will be designated in each of the States, including Arizona. Each Institute in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will conduct research on adaptive ecosystem management to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health in the interior West. This includes providing information on adaptive ecosystem management practices and developing science-based restoration treatments for ecosystems affected by wildfires. The Institutes in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will collaborate with researchers and organizations in the interior West to restore forest ecosystem health and address wildfires. They will submit annual work plans to the Secretary for review. The Institutes in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will collaborate with researchers and organizations in the interior West to restore forest ecosystem health and address wildfires. They will submit annual work plans to the Secretary of the Interior for review, ensuring the proposed work serves the informational needs of affected entities. The Institutes in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado will collaborate with researchers and organizations in the interior West to restore forest ecosystem health and address wildfires. They will submit annual work plans to the Secretary of the Interior for review, ensuring the proposed work serves the informational needs of affected entities. Cooperation between Institutes and Federal Agencies will be facilitated. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, will provide financial and technical assistance to Institutes for prevention activities, ecological restoration for wildfires, and affected ecosystems. They will utilize expertise from the Institutes, encourage Federal agencies to cooperate with them, and promote coordination between Federal programs for ecological restoration, wildfire risk reduction, and wildfire management technologies. The Secretaries may enter contracts, agreements, and transactions, accept funds from other agencies, support internships, encourage education and public information activities, and promulgate regulations under this Act. The Secretaries may promulgate regulations as necessary to carry out this Act. SEC. 7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION. The Secretary must evaluate Institutes every 5 years to ensure their programs meet needs and determine if Federal assistance is warranted. If an Institute does not qualify, it will no longer receive assistance. The Institute will not receive further Federal assistance under this Act until its qualifications are reestablished to the satisfaction of the Secretaries. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $15,000,000 per fiscal year."
