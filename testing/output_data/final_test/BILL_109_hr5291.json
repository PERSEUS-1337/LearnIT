Gangs run by international drug cartels number in the hundreds of thousands across city, State, and national boundaries. Efforts by municipal and State law enforcement have not eliminated this threat to the Nation, law, order, or children. Only the Federal Government can muster the strategy, resources, and intelligence to remove this growing danger in the United States. The national strategy aims to eliminate illegal operations of three international drug gangs posing a significant threat in the United States. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must submit a report to Congress within one year of this Act's enactment. The report will outline a national strategy to eradicate illegal activities of designated National Threat Drug Gangs within four years. It will include a list of these gangs, along with details on their composition, operations, strengths, and weaknesses. The Attorney General will identify the top three international drug gangs as \"National Threat Drug Gangs\" based on their activities with terrorist organizations and the volume of controlled substances they import or distribute in the United States.
