    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 4425 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require pharmacies participating in the Medi-Cal program to charge Medicare beneficiaries a price that does not exceed the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for prescription medicines. Patients must also provide evidence of residency in California. The State Department of Health Care Services will calculate and transmit prices to pharmacies for Medicare beneficiaries, without applying the Medi-Cal drug utilization review process. They will monitor pharmacy participation and conduct outreach programs to inform residents of their right to participate. This includes listing Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for commonly prescribed medicines on their website and providing signage for pharmacies to display to remind Medicare beneficiaries. The State Department of Health Care Services will provide information to pharmacies for Medicare beneficiaries to request prescription charges at the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate. The Senate Office of Research will report any additions of prescription drugs to Medicare benefits to the Legislature for evaluation. This does not apply to prescriptions covered by insurance. This section exempts prescriptions covered by insurance, except for specific medications not on the drug formulary that the patient is willing to pay for out of pocket. Section 4425 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require pharmacies participating in the Medi-Cal program to charge Medicare beneficiaries no more than the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for prescription medicines. The State Department of Health Care Services will set an additional amount to cover electronic transmission charges. Medicare beneficiaries cannot use the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for over-the-counter medications or compounded prescriptions. The State Department of Health Care Services will monitor pharmacy participation and conduct outreach to inform Medicare beneficiaries of their right to participate in the program. This includes providing information on Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for commonly prescribed medicines and displaying signs at pharmacies reminding beneficiaries to ask for the same charge as the reimbursement rate. The Senate Office of Research will report to the Legislature if prescription drugs are added to Medicare benefits. The State Department of Health Care Services will submit a report on the effectiveness of the program by February 1, 2017, including data and strategies to save on prescription drugs for patients. The requirement for submitting a report on the effectiveness of the program by February 1, 2017, is inoperative on February 1, 2021. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code."
