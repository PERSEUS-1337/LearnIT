    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dental Health Improvement Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of oral health to overall physical well-being, noting disparities in access to dental care, especially among low-income individuals and those in underserved areas. The United States Surgeon General reports that millions of Americans lack adequate dental services, with a significant portion of the rural population never having seen a dentist. The aging dental workforce further compounds the issue, with over 20 percent of dentists expected to retire in the next decade. The aging dental workforce is a concern as over 20% of dentists are expected to retire in the next 10 years. This could lead to a shortage of dental graduates to replace them, especially in underserved areas. There are also faculty shortages in dental schools, with approximately 400 vacancies. The National Health Service Corps has placed over 20,000 healthcare providers in difficult-to-place communities, but funding levels for the program are insufficient. The current funding levels for the National Health Service Corps program are inadequate to meet the need for physical, oral, and mental health services in underserved communities. Only about 6 percent of the dental need in designated underserved areas is currently being met by the program, highlighting the critical need for increased funding and outreach to strengthen the dental workforce in these areas. SEC. 3. EXPANDING AVAILABILITY OF DENTAL SERVICES. This section introduces Subpart X - Primary Dental Programs, defining a designated dental health professional shortage area and grants for innovative programs to address the critical need for increased funding and outreach to strengthen the dental workforce in underserved communities. The Secretary can award grants to States to develop innovative programs addressing dental workforce needs in shortage areas. States can use grant funds for loan forgiveness programs for dentists practicing in shortage areas, providing services regardless of patients' ability to pay. The Secretary can award grants to States for various purposes, including recruitment and retention efforts, sliding payment scales for patients unable to pay, grants and loans for practitioners in shortage areas, establishment of dental residency programs, and consultation with State programs. The Secretary can award grants to States for various purposes, including expanding oral health services in designated shortage areas through community-based dental facilities, mobile clinics, and private dental services. Additionally, grants can support the placement and training of dental students and residents. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects of expanding oral health services, including continuing dental education, teledentistry, community-based prevention services, coordination with local education systems, faculty recruitment programs, and the establishment of a State dental officer position. The curr_chunk discusses the application process for states seeking grants to address oral health issues, including requirements for infrastructure and outcome evaluation. The entity receiving a grant must contribute 40% of the grant amount in non-Federal funds. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress after 5 years to assess the impact of the grants on dental services in shortage areas. $50,000,000 is authorized for this program over a 5-year period starting in 2002. The National Health Service Corps is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with various dental associations, is developing a plan to increase dentists' and dental hygienists' participation in scholarship and loan repayment programs under the National Health Service Corps. Amendments are being made to the Public Health Service Act to facilitate this initiative. The National Health Service Corps is implementing a plan to increase dentists' and dental hygienists' participation in scholarship and loan repayment programs. Scholarship programs for dental students must be open to all accredited dental schools and placement is based on community need for dental services. Periods of obligated service can be fulfilled part-time with agreement from both parties. The Health Resources and Services Administration is working to simplify the process of designating areas with dental health professional shortages and revise criteria to better reflect oral health care needs, especially in rural areas. The Health Resources and Services Administration is amending the Public Health Service Act to disseminate information on designation criteria for areas with dental health professional shortages, especially in rural areas. The Health Resources and Services Administration will provide technical assistance to areas, population groups, or facilities interested in applying for dental health professional shortage area designation. SEC. 4. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS RECEIVED UNDER THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS SCHOLARSHIP AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN OTHER PROGRAMS. Section 117(c) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude certain amounts received under the National Health Service Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment programs, as well as other specified State programs. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to amounts received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001."
