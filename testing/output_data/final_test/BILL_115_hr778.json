    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"DAIRY PRIDE Act\" and aims to promote regular intake of dairy products. Congress finds that dairy products are essential for a healthy diet, as stated in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dairy foods provide health benefits such as reducing the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. These foods are rich in nutrients like vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, which are often lacking in the diets of Americans. Dairy foods are important for a healthy diet, providing nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium. However, a large portion of the US population, especially adult females, do not meet the recommended daily intake of dairy. Less than 10 percent of adolescent females and less than 5 percent of adult females consume the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day. The United States falls short of meeting daily dairy intake recommendations. Plant-based milk alternatives have varying amounts of vitamin D and potassium, with lower calcium per calorie compared to non-fat fluid milk. Imitation dairy products lack the same nutrition as real dairy products and can be misleading to consumers. Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading consumers according to FDA regulations. The FDA defines milk as the lacteal secretion obtained from healthy cows, and enforcement against mislabeled plant-based products should be improved to avoid consumer confusion. The purpose of the regulation is to ensure that any food labeled as a dairy product meets the criteria set for dairy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Enforcement measures are in place to uphold this definition. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to define dairy products and establish criteria for their labeling. Dairy products must be derived from hooved mammals' lacteal secretion to be considered as such. Market names for dairy products are specified in regulations to ensure accurate labeling. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidance on enforcement of regulations regarding dairy products within specified timeframes. Additionally, a report to Congress on the enforcement of these regulations is required within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on enforcement actions taken under the amended section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including warnings issued and penalties assessed. If misbranded food is found in interstate commerce, an updated enforcement plan will be included in the report."
