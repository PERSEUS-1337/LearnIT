The Secretary may prescribe regulations for section 30B of the Code, detailing required information for compliance. Employers and employees can use reasonable methods until regulations are in place. The amendments apply to taxable years after December 31, 2001. Small Business Telecommuting Pilot Program. The Administrator will conduct a pilot program in up to 5 regions to promote telecommuting among small businesses, with a focus on outreach to businesses employing individuals with disabilities and disabled American veterans. The pilot program aims to promote telecommuting among small businesses by producing educational materials, conducting outreach, and acquiring telecommuting technologies. Regions with a strong commitment to telecommuting will be given priority consideration for participation. Employers have shown a strong regional commitment to telecommuting. The Administrator will report to Congress within 2 years of funds being allocated for the pilot program, evaluating its results and making recommendations on potential extensions to all Small Business Administration regions. Definitions in this section include the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the term \"disability\" as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the pilot program itself. The pilot program established under this section allows for telecommuting, which is the use of telecommunications to perform work functions, reducing the need to commute. The program will terminate 2 years after funds are appropriated, with an authorization of $5,000,000 for the Small Business Administration."
