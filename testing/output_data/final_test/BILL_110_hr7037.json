    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Activity for Lifelong Energy Act of 2008\". Congress finds that obesity in the United States has reached crisis proportions, with over a third of American adults and 16 percent of children and adolescents being overweight. This poses a significant risk of developing obesity-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, and breathing problems. Obesity and insufficient physical activity are public health problems with wide-ranging implications for the Nation's economy and quality of life. A community-based response can halt the rising tide, with a comprehensive approach showing the greatest promise of success and sustainability. It is important to work for change not only on the individual level but also within communities and across society. Understanding cultural factors is also vital. The obesity epidemic has outpaced Federal support, affecting the preparedness of the United States, including the military. 80 percent of recruits who exceed weight standards leave before completing their first term, increasing recruitment costs. The obesity epidemic affects the readiness of United States military forces and first responders. It increases recruitment costs and threatens long-term welfare. Obesity is not just a public health issue but also a national security issue, impacting the Nation's ability to defend itself. This Act aims to address obesity by promoting physical activity and healthy eating for children and young adults. SEC. 317T introduces a community-based program to promote physical activity, good nutrition, and prevent obesity and chronic disease. The Secretary will provide grants to State health departments to maintain a community action team program. The implementation will be carried out through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in consultation with nonprofit organizations. The Secretary will provide grants to State health departments for community action teams, with funding determined competitively. Grants are limited to $100,000 for management and a minimum of $300,000 for community funding. The State health department will use the grant to establish and implement community action teams that promote healthier lifestyles through physical activity and good nutrition to prevent obesity and chronic disease. Each team will serve for 3 years, with 4 to 8 teams maintained in the State each fiscal year. New teams will be established in communities without one every 2 years. The State health department will establish community action teams in communities without one, providing technical assistance and collecting data on effectiveness. Grant applications must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary, and national activities will be overseen by the Secretary. The Secretary will conduct training institutes for community action teams, provide access to national experts, and disseminate success stories. $40,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009-2013, with $26,450,000 allocated to State health departments through grants. The Secretary will allocate funds for community action teams, State health departments, and management/evaluation purposes. If appropriations are insufficient, the Secretary has discretion to adjust funding. The Secretary may choose to make grants on a competitive basis instead of granting to each State health department that applies."
