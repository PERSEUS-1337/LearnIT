    "content": "Reports by congressional commissions, President Obama's 2010 State of the Union address, and executive orders have increased congressional attention to the threat of bioterrorism. Federal efforts to combat bioterrorism have significantly increased since the anthrax attacks of 2001. The U.S. government has developed these efforts in parallel with defenses against conventional terrorism. Concerns have risen about the adequacy of federal counterterrorism activities in addressing the threat. Experts have varying assessments of the seriousness of the bioterrorism threat. The Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism warns of the likelihood of a terrorist attack using a weapon of mass destruction by 2013, with a higher risk of biological weapons. However, some experts believe the bioterrorism threat is overstated compared to other security challenges. The focus should be on a comprehensive approach to public health and infectious disease threats, rather than solely on bioterrorism defense. The federal government's biodefense efforts are varied, involving multiple agencies with different resources and approaches. Some experts believe certain programs are effective while others are lacking. Collaboration with foreign governments and organizations is seen in nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and disease outbreak detection efforts. The federal government has strengthened export controls on materials for bioterrorism. The Department of Health and Human Services has invested in public health preparedness, response planning, and research on medical countermeasures. The intelligence community gathers and shares information on bioterrorism. The Department of Justice conducts background checks on individuals handling dangerous pathogens. The Department of Homeland Security focuses on preparedness, response, and recovery activities, biosurveillance, and bioforensics capabilities. The EPA explores environmental protection measures. The federal government has invested in expanded biodefense infrastructure, including high-containment laboratories for research and forensics. The Executive Office of the President and other coordinating groups engage in risk assessment and strategic planning for bioterrorism response capabilities. Congressional oversight of the biodefense enterprise is complicated by conflicting views and jurisdictional issues. The Bush Administration identified four \"pillars\" for federal biodefense efforts: threat awareness, prevention and protection, surveillance and detection, and response and recovery. Congressional oversight focuses on individual agency activities and cross-agency themes deemed important. Due to the diversity of efforts, not all aspects can be addressed in this report. This report focuses on strategic planning, risk assessment, surveillance, and the development of medical countermeasures in federal biodefense efforts. It also evaluates the effectiveness of programs and suggests improvements, while acknowledging the roles of state and local governments, private industry, and international partners in bioterrorism defense. The federal government's increased focus on bioterrorism post-9/11 led to the establishment of a homeland security apparatus and the creation of DHS to enhance preparedness, response, and recovery to terrorism. The Bush Administration developed national strategies for biodefense, and agencies created individual strategic plans. The Obama Administration continued this focus by issuing additional measures. The Obama Administration has continued the focus on bioterrorism by issuing additional guidance and directives. Congress has required federal strategic planning activities through various legislation. Critics have pointed out shortcomings in federal efforts at strategic planning. Critics have highlighted deficiencies in federal biodefense strategic planning, calling for clearer goals, metrics, and transparency in government-wide plans. Congress may recommend changes to improve the strategic planning process at the agency or government level. Congress may require the Administration to conduct reviews of biodefense policies and activities, develop new policies based on recommendations, and create implementation plans to align agency activities with strategic goals. This oversight aims to enhance government-wide planning documents and improve coordination for federal biodefense activities. Congressional oversight plays a crucial role in assessing the completeness and effectiveness of biodefense planning, identifying synergies and gaps in agency efforts, and ensuring that resource allocation aligns with congressional intent. Congress can also evaluate the involvement of private industry, states, and international partners in bioterrorism response planning. Experts suggest that streamlining oversight through fewer committees could optimize federal homeland security efforts. Optimizing oversight of federal homeland security efforts by consolidating jurisdiction under fewer committees could lead to more focused and holistic congressional oversight. This centralization may reduce the time spent by homeland security officials testifying before Congress. However, it could also decrease the level of scrutiny on individual agencies and activities. Understanding the risk of bioterrorism is crucial for effective biodefense planning and resource allocation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) plays a role in assessing these efforts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has emphasized the importance of increased risk assessment activities in biodefense to support informed decision-making. Despite challenges such as the difficulty in determining bioterrorism risk and the presence of intelligent adversaries, risk assessment can aid agencies in planning, prioritizing, and investing wisely in biodefense strategies. The Bush Administration recognized bioterrorism risk assessment as a critical component of its biodefense strategy, highlighting the need for informed approaches to mitigate risks effectively. The DHS conducts bioterrorism risk assessments every two years, but other agencies have different approaches. The comparison of these assessments is complicated by various factors, and outside experts criticize DHS for not adequately addressing the decision-making process of intelligent adversaries. The DHS conducts bioterrorism risk assessments every two years, but other agencies have different approaches. Outside experts criticize DHS for not adequately addressing the decision-making process of an intelligent adversary. Congress faces the question of how bioterrorism and other risk assessments should inform agency and government-wide priorities and policies. Options include mandating risk-informed decision making, endorsing a specific risk assessment method, or establishing measures of robustness. Congress could also require agencies to harmonize their risk assessment methodologies or develop a government-wide risk assessment process. Alternatively, Congress could direct agencies to rely less on risk assessments and instead set priorities independently. The Bush Administration prioritized the development and deployment of biosurveillance technologies to quickly identify a bioterrorism attack. Various detection approaches were implemented, including environmental detection and syndromic surveillance. Early detection allows for prompt treatment, increasing the likelihood of individual survival and recovery. The federal government has enhanced public health laboratories to handle potential bioterrorism events and invests in global health activities to identify emerging threats. Biosurveillance technologies were deployed after the anthrax mailings to improve detection efforts. The federal government has increased efforts in biosurveillance technologies following the anthrax mailings. Concerns persist about the effectiveness of detection systems, particularly in comparison to the medical system's innate ability. Technical challenges remain in achieving sensitivity while minimizing false alarms, which can lead to resource consumption and responder opportunity costs. Frequent false alarms may also undermine public trust in alarm systems. The federal government has increased biosurveillance efforts post-anthrax mailings. Concerns persist about detection system effectiveness, technical challenges, and false alarms undermining public trust. Congress may be interested in the slow deployment of environmental detectors and may provide additional funds for completion. Congress may address concerns about the interactions between DHS and local jurisdictions regarding fiscal burdens from a federal program. Questions remain about local jurisdictions' role in responding to positive test results. Additional resources or guidance from Congress could alleviate these concerns. Federal agencies have dedicated resources to developing medical countermeasures for bioterrorist attacks since 2001. The government has periodically reviewed programs in this area. The federal government has invested billions in research for medical countermeasures against potential bioterrorism agents. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with the Department of Defense, play key roles in supporting the development of these countermeasures. Efforts have been made to improve advanced centers for biodefense following a 2010 review. HHS and DOD are urged to create dedicated centers for medical countermeasure development. Critics question the large investment in biodefense, suggesting funds could be better utilized elsewhere. Congress has raised concerns about funding gaps and deficiencies in executive branch management of countermeasure development. Congress established BARDA to fund and coordinate the conversion of research into deployable products. Policymakers must balance funding between research stages, with critics suggesting underfunding of critical development stages. Current fiscal pressures will impact funding decisions, prompting consideration of leveraging efforts from other stakeholders. The federal government may need to reconsider its role in developing bioterrorism countermeasures, potentially shifting towards more industry investment. Congress could explore incentive-based or demand-based approaches to support countermeasure development. The government currently plays a significant role in procuring and stockpiling bioterrorism countermeasures due to the limited market incentives for private sector investment. The federal government has faced challenges in obtaining medical countermeasures due to the small market size, especially when compared to other products like anti-cholesterol drugs. Efforts have been made by the executive branch and Congress to encourage companies to enter the medical countermeasure field, including providing liability protection and guaranteeing a government market. Despite mixed success, HHS has invested in infrastructure for a rapid response to emerging threats like pandemic influenza. The HHS has planned a public-private partnership to create flexible manufacturing infrastructure for countermeasure manufacture. Government efforts to partner with private sector developers have been criticized as underfunded and unclear. Companies are hesitant to develop countermeasures due to liability concerns, leading Congress to enact measures for protection. Think tanks and industry suggest better communication from the government on desired countermeasures. The government faces criticism for diverting funds from countermeasure procurement to other uses, leading to concerns about its commitment to guaranteeing a government market. The GAO warns about unclear expectations for countermeasure and company performance. Congress may use advance appropriations for countermeasure development and consider new manufacturing incentives to attract investors. The government may need to reevaluate procurement prioritization to align with risk assessments and strategic plans. Congress could provide additional funding or new authorities for HHS to support countermeasure recommendations. Distribution of medical countermeasures for bioterrorism remains a challenge, with efforts including stockpiling, alternative distribution mechanisms, and pre-event distribution options. FDA, CDC, state/local governments, and industry play roles in this process. The CDC, state and local governments, and industry partners are key in distributing emergency medical countermeasures. The FDA regulates distribution of pharmaceuticals and biological products, permitting emergency use of unapproved products. The CDC maintains the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and delivers it to state and local governments for distribution. State and local governments develop distribution plans, while industrial partners store some of the SNS. Experts focus on timely distribution to minimize casualties in bioterrorism response. Experts question the federal government's ability to distribute medical countermeasures effectively during emergencies, considering state and local governments' readiness to receive and disseminate stockpiles. Congress may need to decide on alternative distribution mechanisms, weighing the advantages against potential drawbacks. Some suggest granting the FDA new legal authorities for improved distribution. Some experts suggest the FDA needs new legal authorities and policy frameworks to enhance emergency distribution of medical countermeasures. Concerns about potential bioterrorism events have led to long-standing federal preparations, with ongoing debates on the sufficiency and effectiveness of existing programs across multiple agencies. Congress is urged to assess the adequacy of current FDA authorities in addressing emergency distribution issues. Congress continues to influence the federal response to bioterrorism through oversight activities and legislation. Policymakers face difficult choices regarding maintaining, shrinking, or expanding programs to address deficiencies. Augmenting programs may incur additional costs during fiscal challenges, while maintaining or shrinking programs may pose risks in the event of a large-scale bioterror attack."
