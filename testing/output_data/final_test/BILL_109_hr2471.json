Tax incentives not covered by this Act include those dependent on state of incorporation, requiring use of in-state property, reduced due to out-of-state activity, or resulting in loss of compensating tax system. The section outlines conditions where tax incentives may not be valid under the Commerce Clause, including when the tax on interstate commerce exceeds intrastate commerce, reciprocal tax benefits are not offered, or tax incentives earned for one tax cannot be used for another tax. It clarifies that this section does not imply the validity of any tax incentive under the Commerce Clause. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS; RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.
