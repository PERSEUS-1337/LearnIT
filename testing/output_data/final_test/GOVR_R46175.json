    "content": "The Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a conflict with the Kosovo Liberation Army. Kosovo is recognized by over 100 countries, including the US and most EU states. Serbia, Russia, and China do not recognize Kosovo. The US supports Kosovo's state-building efforts and dialogue with Serbia. Kosovo sees the US as a key ally and security guarantor. Congress has been involved in Kosovo-related issues for decades. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation led to debates over military intervention in Kosovo. Congress continues to support Kosovo through various means, including funding levels averaging around $50 million per year since 2015. Key issues in Kosovo include the government collapse in March 2020, managing relations with the ethnic Serb minority, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic growth. The United States may consider supporting the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic ambitions, transitional justice processes, and regional security. Kosovo is a parliamentary republic with a prime minister and an indirectly elected president. The National Assembly has 120 seats, with 20 reserved for ethnic minorities. Albin Kurti is the acting Prime Minister, while Hashim Tha\u00c3\u00a7i serves as president. Domestic politics have been volatile, with government turnover and tension between the president and prime minister. Kosovo recently faced uncertainty when the Kurti government lost a vote of confidence on March 25, 2020. The Kurti government lost a vote of confidence on March 25, 2020, just two months after forming, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The government breakdown raised concerns about the impact on the public health response. Vet\u00ebvendosje and the Democratic League of Kosovo were the top-performing parties in the 2019 parliamentary elections, reflecting voter dissatisfaction with corruption and economic conditions. The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and other former ruling parties, stemming from the KLA resistance, were criticized for becoming entrenched in state institutions. In contrast, Vet\u00ebvendosje, led by Albin Kurti, emerged from a protest movement against government corruption and international missions' failure to establish the rule of law in Kosovo. Vet\u00ebvendosje, known for obstructionist tactics, gained support across election cycles. Vet\u00ebvendosje, led by Albin Kurti, has been criticized for obstructionist tactics and attempting to subvert agreements with Serbia and Montenegro. Despite floating the idea of unification with Albania, it is unlikely to be pursued due to US and EU objections. Analysts praise Kosovo's democratic development since 2008, highlighting its civil society, media sector, and competitive elections. Calls have been made for Kosovo to enforce the rule of law more rigorously. U.S.-based NGO Freedom House urges Kosovo to enforce anti-corruption rules and uphold judicial independence. The Pronto Affair revealed nepotism within the PDK government. In 2018, 11 PDK officials were indicted for offering public jobs to party supporters. The case highlighted systemic abuse of power. In April 2020, 19 individuals, including former ministers, were indicted for abuse of position in a privatization scheme. Kosovo has a significant Serb population living in rural communities. Kosovo Serbs have representation and autonomy under the 2008 constitution, with power-sharing measures to protect minority rights. However, the effectiveness of these measures in integrating Serbs is questioned. Most Kosovo Serbs live in minority-majority municipalities in central and southeastern Kosovo, which do not border Serbia. The situation in northern Kosovo remains a challenge for state building, with 40% of the Serb population living in four Serb-majority municipalities adjacent to Serbia. Pristina struggles to exert full authority in this region, where Serbia retains strong influence through parallel structures for services. Northern Kosovo is a hub for illicit activities due to its grey-zone status. The Serbian List party, closely linked to the Serbian government, dominates elections in northern Kosovo. Opposition Serb politicians face harassment and intimidation, highlighted by the murder of Oliver Ivanovi\u0107 in 2018. Kosovo's economy still struggles to recover from the 1998-1999 war with Serbia, with high unemployment rates, especially among women and youth. Economic challenges hinder upward mobility in the region. Kosovo's economy faces challenges with high emigration rates due to limited upward mobility. GDP growth was 3.8% in 2018 and 4.2% in 2019, but the IMF predicts a 5% contraction in 2020 due to COVID-19. Foreign direct investment was low at \u00e2\u0082\u00ac214 million in 2018, while remittances from citizens abroad were high at \u00e2\u0082\u00ac801 million. Kosovo's main trade partners are the EU and neighboring Western Balkan countries, with trade liberalization agreements in place. Kosovo, a signatory to CEFTA, had exports of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac382 million in 2019, with major markets in CEFTA countries, the EU, India, Switzerland, and Turkey. Top exports include metals, mineral products, plastics, rubber, and prepared foods. Kosovo promotes FDI with its young workforce, natural resources, low corporate tax rate, euro use, and EU market access. Challenges include corruption, weak rule of law, Kosovo-Serbia dispute, and energy supply issues. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. support, but Serbia does not recognize Kosovo. After centuries of Ottoman rule, Kosovo became part of Serbia in the early 20th century. Some Serbian perspectives view Kosovo's incorporation as the rightful return of territory, while Kosovo Albanian perspectives see it as an annexation leading to the marginalization of the Albanian-majority population. Kosovo Albanians sought separation from Serbia in the 1980s, culminating in Kosovo declaring independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. support. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence. In 1989, Serbia imposed direct rule in Kosovo under autocrat Slobodan Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087, leading to repression of Albanians. The Kosovo Liberation Army launched an insurgency against Serbian rule in the late 1990s, prompting heavy force from Serbia. After a NATO air campaign in 1999, Serbia agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo. In 2000, Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087 lost power in Serbia amid mass protests. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 after failed international efforts to broker a settlement with Serbia. The International Court of Justice ruled in 2010 that Kosovo's actions were not against international law. The EU and the US urged Kosovo and Serbia to engage in dialogue for normalization of relations, focusing initially on technical measures. Talks progressed to a political level in 2012. In 2012, Kosovo and Serbia engaged in EU-brokered political talks to normalize relations. Both countries aim to join the EU, motivating their participation in the dialogue. Kosovo also seeks U.N. and NATO membership, with Serbian approval crucial for U.N. membership. The dialogue has resulted in 33 agreements, including the 2013 Brussels Agreement outlining measures to normalize relations. The dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia aims to dismantle Serbian-backed structures in northern Kosovo and establish an Association of Serb Municipalities. Progress has been made in some areas, such as electoral participation and integration of institutions, but lags in others like the energy sector and the ASM. The EU calls for a comprehensive agreement, but key issues remain unresolved, including Serbian recognition of Kosovo and the situation in northern Kosovo. The uncertainty remains on how to address northern Kosovo in a final settlement. The idea of partition has been rejected by the US and EU, fearing it could set a dangerous precedent. Integrating the north into statewide institutions through autonomy measures like the ASM is seen as a potential compromise, but faces resistance in Kosovo. Little progress has been made since late 2015, with concerns that the ASM could undermine state integrity if given significant executive functions and formalized links to Serbia. In 2018, President Tha\u00c3\u00a7i and Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u2021 raised the prospect of redrawing borders as a way to normalize relations. The Trump Administration signaled willingness to consider this proposal, despite opposition from some European allies like Germany and much of Kosovo's political class and population. The dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia has been suspended since late 2018 due to Kosovo imposing tariffs on Serbian goods. Acting Prime Minister Kurti announced the repeal of tariffs on raw material imports from Serbia in March 2020, and later decided to replace tariffs with reciprocity measures. EU officials welcomed the tariff removal, but U.S. officials were dissatisfied with the reciprocity. Kosovo's parties and leaders are divided over lifting tariffs against Serbia. Acting Prime Minister Kurti challenges President Tha\u00c3\u00a7i's leadership in the dialogue. Growing uncertainty over EU membership prospects could impact Kosovo-Serbia negotiations. Transitional justice for the 1998-1999 war remains a sensitive issue. The 1998-1999 war in Kosovo and Serbia is a sensitive issue, with accusations of human rights violations by Serbian forces. Around 13,000 people were killed, half of Kosovo's population was displaced, and 20,000 were victims of sexual violence. The majority of victims were ethnic Albanians. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia tried high-profile cases related to the conflict before closing in 2017. Weak law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Kosovo and Serbia hinder war crimes cases, with critics citing low political will in Serbia. Post-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Serbian governments have been criticized for downplaying Serbia's role in 1990s wars and hindering transitional justice. Transitional justice processes regarding the KLA in Kosovo are also contentious. The Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office were created in 2015 under U.S. and EU pressure to investigate war crimes allegations against some KLA units. The institutions are primarily staffed by international jurists and located in The Hague to avoid witness intimidation and political pressure. Despite controversy in Kosovo, attempts to abolish the Specialist Chambers in 2017 were met with strong opposition from the United States and allies. Over 120 former KLA fighters have been summoned for questioning. More than 120 former KLA fighters have received summons for questioning in 2019, with potential indictments for Kosovo politicians. The EU and NATO have been instrumental in Kosovo's state-building processes, with the EU providing significant financial assistance and overseeing rule-of-law issues through the EULEX mission. Kosovo's EU membership bid involves obtaining candidate status and launching accession negotiations, despite facing challenges from five EU member states that do not recognize it. Kosovo aims to secure visa-free entry into the EU's Schengen area, a status it is currently the only Western Balkan country without. The NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) was launched in 1999 with 50,000 troops to maintain safety and security in Kosovo. KFOR's role now includes supporting free movement of citizens and facilitating Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic integration. The United States is the largest contributor to KFOR, providing about 660 of the 3,500 troops deployed. Any changes to the mission size would require approval from the North Atlantic Council. KFOR continues to play a crucial role in regional security by developing the Kosovo Security Force (KSF) and focusing on emergency response. Kosovo lawmakers amended legislation in December 2018 to gradually transform KSF into a regular army, drawing objections from Kosovo Serb leaders and Serbia. NATO Secretary-General expressed concerns about the timing of the decision and its impact on cooperation with NATO, while the United States supported Kosovo's government decision. The United States supports Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic ambitions and is seen as a security guarantor and critical ally. The Trump Administration is interested in resolving the Kosovo-Serbia dispute and increasing engagement in the Western Balkans. U.S. officials consider the normalization of Kosovo-Serbia relations a strategic priority. In August 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo appointed Matthew Palmer as Special Representative for the Western Balkans. President Trump appointed Richard Grenell as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations. U.S. officials announced new agreements between Kosovo and Serbia in January 2020, focusing on economic growth. Efforts are underway to bring the two parties back to negotiations. The U.S. has taken a more direct role in brokering transportation agreements and normalizing Kosovo-Serbia relations, which is a departure from previous administrations. Some European officials were surprised by the U.S.-brokered agreements in January 2020, emphasizing the EU's role in the normalization process. Analysts believe that U.S. engagement in the Western Balkans is more effective when aligned with European allies. Some observers and Members of Congress are concerned about recent U.S. policies towards Kosovo, including pausing implementation of a $49 million MCC program. Kosovo officials feel pressured by the U.S. to lift tariffs on Serbia without equivalent pressure on Serbia to stop undermining Kosovo's international legitimacy. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations expressed concern over the treatment of the Kurti government and urged greater cooperation with the EU in normalizing relations between Kosovo and Serbia. Acting Prime Minister Kurti alleged U.S. officials aided efforts to unseat his government, but U.S. officials denied brokering a \"secret plan for land swaps.\" The United States provides significant foreign assistance to Kosovo to support agreements from the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue and improve governance. A $49 million MCC Threshold Program focuses on governance and energy efficiency. Kosovo is eligible for a larger Compact Program, but MCC assistance is currently on hold. Cooperation between the United States and Kosovo aims to combat transnational threats and enhance security in the region. In the Western Balkans, Kosovo is a transit and source country for trafficking and smuggling. The United States and EU urge Kosovo to better implement domestic laws to combat these crimes. U.S.-Kosovo security cooperation focuses on combating terrorism and extremism. Kosovo citizens have traveled to support the Islamic State, prompting legal framework tightening with U.S. assistance. The United States has assisted Kosovo in tightening its legal framework to combat terrorism and extremism, providing support to law enforcement and judicial institutions. This includes training for the Kosovo Police's Counterterrorism Directorate and Border Police. In 2019, the U.S. supported the repatriation of Kosovo citizens from Syria who had ties to the Islamic State. Kosovo also has a sister-state relationship with Iowa. In the 116th Congress, there have been several hearings addressing Kosovo, including discussions on wartime victims and Western Balkan issues. Kosovo's sister-state relationship with Iowa stems from a 2011 State Partnership Program between the Iowa National Guard and the Kosovo Security Force. Congressional interest in Kosovo dates back to Yugoslavia's disintegration, with ongoing support for Kosovo's independence and financial assistance. The Senate committees have held hearings on Kosovo's wartime victims and Western Balkan issues, highlighting the country's importance in U.S. foreign policy. Key issues discussed include transitional justice, corruption, human trafficking, foreign assistance, and security in Europe. Kosovo's relationship with the U.S. Congress dates back to Yugoslavia's disintegration, with ongoing support for its independence."
