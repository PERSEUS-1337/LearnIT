    "content": "The Act titled \"Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act of 2006\" addresses the effect of a defendant's death in federal criminal proceedings. The \"Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution Act of 2006\" amends Subchapter A of chapter 227 of title 18, United States Code, by adding a section on the effect of a defendant's death in Federal criminal proceedings. It states that the death of a defendant convicted of a Federal criminal offense does not invalidate a guilty plea, verdict, sentence, or judgment, except as provided in the section. The court shall enter a judgment incorporating the plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the verdict, with the notation that the defendant died before the judgment was entered. If a defendant dies after a plea or verdict but before sentencing, no sentence or penalties may be imposed. The death of a defendant after sentencing terminates any probation, supervision, or imprisonment, and any remaining liability for criminal forfeiture, fines, or special assessments. Restitution is not required if the defendant dies. If a defendant dies after sentencing, all obligations including probation, supervision, imprisonment, criminal forfeiture, fines, and special assessments are terminated. Restitution is not required upon the defendant's death. The death of a defendant after sentencing does not invalidate any restitution ordered or announced. The defendant's guilty plea, verdict, sentence, or judgment can still be used in civil proceedings. After a defendant's death, appeals, motions, and petitions in a criminal case are limited. After a defendant's death, no appeals or challenges to guilty pleas, verdicts, sentences, or judgments can be filed in the case. Any pending motions or appeals will be dismissed due to the defendant's death, except for restitution orders in criminal cases. After a defendant's death, no appeals or challenges to guilty pleas, verdicts, sentences, or judgments can be filed in the case. However, the personal representative, the Government, or any victim of the defendant's crime may pursue appeals, petitions, or motions related to restitution orders in criminal cases. This includes obtaining a final order of restitution, enforcing or challenging existing restitution orders, and challenging or reinstating a verdict. After a defendant's death, the personal representative, the Government, or any victim of the defendant's crime may file appeals, petitions, or motions related to restitution orders in criminal cases. This includes challenging or reinstating a verdict, plea, sentence, or judgment on which a restitution order is based. The appeal, petition, or motion can challenge or reinstate a verdict, plea, sentence, or judgment if shown to be material in a pending civil proceeding. The Government cannot impose collateral consequences on the estate except in certain circumstances. The Government cannot impose collateral consequences on the estate or family members of a deceased defendant based solely on the conviction if the defendant died before exhausting the right to appeal, unless notice is given within 90 days. If notice is given, a personal representative will be appointed for the deceased defendant. If the Government gives notice within 90 days of a deceased defendant's conviction, a personal representative will be appointed, and any filing deadlines against the defendant or family members will be tolled. The death of the defendant cannot be used as a basis for relief in any appeal, petition, or motion. The standards and procedures for any appeal, petition, or motion under subsection (c)(2) will be as provided by law, with the personal representative of the defendant substituted for the defendant. Special procedures apply if continuing litigation is initiated under subsection (c)(2), including notice to the victim and appointment of a personal representative by the district court. The court appoints a personal representative for a defendant if none is appointed, and counsel is provided for the representative if the defendant dies. Deadlines for motions or appeals are tolled during certain periods. During the period after a defendant's death in a criminal case, restitution can be collected from their property if not fully paid. Restitution can be collected from the property of a deceased defendant, regardless of whether it is part of their estate. Restitution protective orders remain in effect after the defendant's death unless modified by the court. The court must take necessary actions to preserve the restitution upon motion by the Government or victims of the defendant's crime. The government can pursue civil forfeiture of property even after the death of an individual, with limitations on the time period extended by 2 years after the individual's death. The government can initiate civil forfeiture proceedings against any property interest alleged to be forfeitable in an indictment, even if the individual has passed away, with a 2-year extension period after death. Definitions for terms like 'accepted', 'announced', and 'convicted' are provided in this section. The text provides definitions for terms like 'direct appeal' and 'returned' in relation to a verdict. It also includes a conforming amendment to the table of sections for chapter 227 of title 18, United States Code. The amendments made by this Act in Federal criminal proceedings apply to cases pending on or after July 1, 2006. If any provision of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the provisions remain unaffected."
