    "content": "The Gas Tax Relief Act of 2005, also known as the \"Gas Tax Relief Act,\" is based on Congress's power to levy taxes as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. It includes a 30-day suspension of fuel taxes on highway motor fuels. The Gas Tax Relief Act of 2005 includes a 30-day suspension of highway motor fuel taxes under Section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code. No tax will be imposed on highway motor fuel during this period, preempting state laws on the matter. The Gas Tax Relief Act of 2005 suspends highway motor fuel taxes for 30 days under Section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code, preempting state laws. Trust funds affected by the tax suspension will receive appropriated amounts to make up for the revenue loss. The Gas Tax Relief Act of 2005 suspends highway motor fuel taxes for 30 days under Section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax suspension date, if tax has been imposed on highway motor fuel under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the fuel is held by a dealer for sale, the taxpayer can claim a credit or refund equal to the tax paid. Claims must be filed within 6 months after the tax suspension date based on a request from the dealer within 3 months after the tax suspension date. The taxpayer can claim a credit or refund for highway motor fuel tax paid before the tax suspension date if held by a dealer for sale. No credit or refund is allowed for fuel in retail stocks. Definitions for \"tax suspension date,\" \"dealer,\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided. Rules similar to subsections (b) and (c) of section 6412 of the Code apply to this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax is imposed on highway motor fuel held by any person on the tax restoration date. The tax is the difference between the tax that would be imposed on the fuel on that date and any tax previously paid on the fuel. Liability for Tax: The person holding the fuel is liable for the tax, to be paid within 45 days after the tax restoration date. The tax restoration date is defined as the first day after the suspension period. Highway motor fuel is defined as per section 4081(f) of the Code. The tax does not apply to fuel held exclusively for exempt uses. No tax is imposed on highway motor fuel held on the tax restoration date by a person if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons. Exempt fuel is not included in this calculation. Person must submit required information to the Secretary. Controlled groups are treated as one person under this section, with the definition of a controlled group based on ownership percentages. Nonincorporated persons under common control are also subject to regulations set by the Secretary. Under regulations set by the Secretary, similar principles to those in subparagraph (A) apply to a group of persons under common control if one or more of them is not a corporation. All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 also apply to floor stock taxes imposed under subsection (a) to the same extent."
