    "content": "The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that police can enter and search a home without a warrant if they believe evidence is being destroyed inside, rejecting limitations on the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. One dissenting justice expressed concern about potential Fourth Amendment violations in drug cases. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, emphasizing the importance of probable cause. The Supreme Court ruled that police can enter a home without a warrant if they believe evidence is being destroyed, citing \"exigent circumstances.\" In a case involving a drug arrest in Lexington, KY, the issue of inexcusable exigencies arose when police failed to obtain a warrant before making an arrest. The police officers followed a drug dealer into an apartment complex breezeway where they detected the smell of burnt marijuana coming from one of the apartments. They kicked in the door of the apartment, found King and two others with drugs and paraphernalia, and arrested them. King later pleaded guilty to drug possession and trafficking. The Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the trial court's denial of King's motion to suppress evidence obtained after a warrantless search. They adopted a two-part test to determine if exigent circumstances justified the search, focusing on police intent and foreseeability of creating the circumstances. The Kentucky Supreme Court adopted a two-part test to determine if exigent circumstances justified a warrantless search in the case of King. The officers failed the second test as it was reasonably foreseeable that their actions would create the exigent circumstances of evidence destruction. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider when lawful police action impermissibly creates exigent circumstances. The United States Supreme Court considered the question of when lawful police action impermissibly creates exigent circumstances that preclude warrantless entry. The Court ruled that if the police did not create the exigency by violating the Fourth Amendment, warrantless entry to prevent evidence destruction is allowed. The Court found unpersuasive the various lower court justifications for restricting the exigent circumstance exception. The Court rejected arguments to restrict the exigent circumstance exception based on bad faith, reasonable foreseeability, sufficient time for a warrant, deviation from police procedures, threat of imminent entry, and Court precedent. It stated that officers' motives do not invalidate justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment. The Court found the reasonable foreseeability and deviation from preferred police practice tests unacceptable, and disagreed with the idea that the exception should be unavailable if officers had probable cause and time for a warrant. The Court disagreed with the idea that the exigent circumstance exception should be unavailable if officers had sufficient probable cause and time to secure a warrant. King argued that law enforcement officers create an exigency when their actions suggest imminent entry, but the Court dismissed this, stating that officers' ability to respond to an exigency cannot depend on such subtleties. The Court disagreed with the notion that the ability of law enforcement officers to respond to an exigency should not depend on subtle actions. In a case similar to King, Johnson v. United States involved a warrantless search based on hearing movement in a hotel room. The Kentucky Supreme Court had wrongly imposed a \"foreseeability\" limitation on warrantless searches under exigent circumstances, which the US Supreme Court reversed. Justice Ginsburg dissented, stating that an expedient knock should not override the warrant requirement. Ginsburg dissented, emphasizing the importance of respecting the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment. The Court did not address the existence of sufficient exigent circumstances in the case. The lower courts' concern about police-created exigencies may lead to a higher threshold for exigency in the future."
