    "content": "The federal income tax system benefits low-income families through refundable tax credits like the EITC and ACTC. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act primarily benefits higher-income individuals and families, with minimal impact on overall tax policy. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had a small impact on poverty compared to the previous federal income tax system. New tax legislation, such as the Economic Mobility Act of 2019, aims to provide additional tax benefits to lower-income families by increasing the EITC for childless workers and making other tax credits refundable. Policymakers are interested in using the tax system to reduce poverty and support low-income working families with children. The report analyzes the impact of income tax on reducing poverty, comparing pre- and post-TCJA effects. It discusses federal income tax provisions affecting low-income individuals, highlighting changes under the TCJA. Observations on the benefits and limitations of the federal income tax system in reducing poverty are also provided. The report analyzes the impact of federal income tax on families' poverty status, specifically the immediate effects of the TCJA. It focuses on how tax provisions affect families rather than individual taxpayers. Poverty analysis is conducted at the family level, while changes in the tax system pre- and post-TCJA are discussed in terms of taxpayers. The report focuses on analyzing the impact of federal income tax on families' poverty status, particularly the effects of the TCJA. Poverty analysis is conducted at the family level, considering all members living together related by blood or marriage. The Supplemental Poverty Measure is used to assess the poverty impact of the federal income tax on families. The impact of federal income tax on poverty is analyzed using the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) to assess the economic well-being of low-income individuals. The TRIM3 model is used to estimate the impact of income taxes owed or refundable credits received on families' poverty status, both pre- and post-TCJA. Other taxes like payroll and excise taxes are not considered in these analyses. The poverty estimates in this report are calculated using the TRIM3 model, based on data from 2017. The estimates under old and new income tax systems are described in past tense for ease of reading. The federal income tax can impact a taxpayer's disposable income and poverty status, especially when refundable tax credits exceed income taxes owed. Details on the methodology can be found in Appendix A. When a taxpayer receives refundable tax credits greater than the income taxes they owe, they have a negative tax liability and an increase in disposable income. Conversely, if a taxpayer owes federal income tax, they have a positive tax liability and reduced disposable income. Understanding how income taxes are calculated, especially for poor families, is crucial in assessing tax liabilities. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made significant changes to the federal tax code, affecting individuals, including low-income taxpayers. These changes are temporary and set to expire in 2025. Taxpayers calculate their income tax liability by totaling their income from various sources to determine their gross income. Certain types of income are excluded from the tax code. The income tax code excludes certain types of income received by lower-income individuals from gross income, such as public assistance payments and noncash benefits. Taxpayers then subtract deductions and exemptions to calculate their taxable income, with most low-income taxpayers using the standard deduction. The TCJA did not make changes to the exclusion of public assistance. The TCJA almost doubled the standard deduction in 2018, ranging from $6,500 to $13,000 depending on filing status. It also effectively eliminated the personal exemption of $4,150 per person. These changes result in many low-income taxpayers having little to no taxable income and income tax liability. Many low-income taxpayers have little or no taxable income and pay taxes at the lowest marginal rate of 10%. Taxpayers calculate their tax liability by applying marginal tax rates to their taxable income and can subtract tax credits to determine their final tax liability. The 10% tax bracket was unchanged by the TCJA. The TCJA reduced marginal tax rates above the 10% bracket. Tax credits can be nonrefundable or refundable, with nonrefundable credits capped at tax liability. Refundable credits are not limited by tax liability, benefiting low-income taxpayers. The EITC and ACTC are major refundable tax credits for low-income working taxpayers. The EITC amount is based on earned income, marital status, and qualifying children. The maximum EITC amount in 2018 ranged from $520 to $6,444. The TCJA did not change the EITC itself but adjusted the rules for inflation. The TCJA did not alter the EITC itself but changed the rules for adjusting it for inflation, resulting in a slightly smaller EITC. The child tax credit was increased from $1,000 to $2,000 per child under the TCJA, with the maximum amount of credit that could be claimed as the ACTC also increasing. The formula for calculating the ACTC was adjusted post-TCJA. While many low-income taxpayers benefited from these changes, the poorest taxpayers received a larger benefit. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) resulted in varying impacts on taxpayers, with the poorest taxpayers receiving a more modest increase of up to $75. The overall impact on tax liability depends on individual circumstances and interactions with different provisions. While the TCJA lowered tax liabilities on average, individual taxpayers may have experienced unchanged, increased, or decreased tax liabilities. Many poor families did not owe federal income taxes under the pre-TCJA system and received a net benefit from refundable credits. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had varying impacts on taxpayers, with the poorest receiving a modest increase of up to $75. Many poor families did not owe federal income taxes before the TCJA and received a net benefit from refundable credits, resulting in their after-tax income being greater than their before-tax income. Approximately 21.4 million families, equaling 46.5 million individuals, were in poverty before income tax deductions. Figure 1 illustrates the share of families with positive tax liability, zero tax liability, or those who received a net benefit from refundable tax credits. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had varying impacts on taxpayers, with the poorest receiving a modest increase of up to $75. Many poor families did not owe federal income taxes before the TCJA and received a net benefit from refundable credits. Approximately 21.4 million families, equaling 46.5 million individuals, were in poverty before income tax deductions. The majority of poor families had zero tax liability or received a net benefit from refundable tax credits. Poverty rates were compared before and after the policy change to assess its impact. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had varying impacts on taxpayers, with the poorest receiving a modest increase of up to $75. Poverty rates were compared before and after the policy change to assess its impact on poverty. Poverty status is determined based on available financial resources before and after federal income tax liabilities are subtracted from disposable income. If the income tax boosts income enough to lift a poor family above the poverty threshold, they are then counted as nonpoor due to the pre-TCJA income tax. The pre-TCJA income tax system reduced poverty rates, with a net reduction of two percentage points. Child poverty decreased by nearly 30%, while poverty among nonaged adults in families with children decreased by a quarter. Post-tax poverty rates for nonaged adults in families with no children were higher than pre-tax rates for this group. The pre-TCJA income tax system reduced poverty rates, with a net reduction of two percentage points. Poverty rates for nonaged adults in families with no children were higher post-tax. The antipoverty effect of the federal income tax was concentrated among individuals living with workers and children. The poverty gap is a metric used to understand poverty and measure the impact of policies. It is the difference between the poverty threshold and a family's disposable income. The larger the poverty gap, the poorer the family. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty threshold and a family's disposable income. It is used to measure poverty and policy impact. The aggregate poverty gap before the pre-TCJA income tax was $150.8 billion, and after it was $138.1 billion. The tax reduced the aggregate poverty gap by $12.7 billion, benefiting families with children and at least one worker. The pre-TCJA income tax slightly increased the aggregate poverty gap for families without children or aged adults. Many poor families under the post-TCJA income tax did not owe federal income taxes and received a net benefit from refundable credits. The TCJA provided relatively small benefits to poor families, with approximately 21.4 million families in poverty before income tax deductions. The analysis in Figure 4 shows that pre- and post-TCJA, there were similar trends in income tax liabilities for poor and nonpoor families. There was a slight decrease in families with positive tax liability and an increase in families with zero tax liability for both groups. The share of poor families with negative tax liability remained unchanged, while nonpoor families saw a small increase. Figure 5 compares the share of poor families with different tax liabilities before and after TCJA, showing a modest impact on poor families owing taxes. The TCJA had a modest impact on the tax liabilities of poor families with children, leading to a decrease in those owing taxes and an increase in those with zero tax liability. However, the share of poor families benefiting from refundable tax credits decreased. Overall, the TCJA reduced overall poverty rates by 1.6%, with the impact concentrated among certain groups. The TCJA reduced poverty rates among children and nonaged adults in families with children by about 2.4% and 1.9% respectively. The impact was concentrated among families with workers, where poverty fell by nearly 25%. The TCJA reduced poverty rates among children and nonaged adults in families with children by about 2.4% and 1.9% respectively. The post-TCJA income tax reduced the aggregate poverty gap from $150.8 billion to $136.9 billion, with the majority of the reduction occurring among families with children and workers. The post-TCJA income tax substantially reduced the poverty rate but had limited effects on the aggregate poverty gap compared to other low-income assistance programs like SNAP. Only SNAP had a comparable reduction in the overall poverty rate. The income tax showed limitations in helping the poorest families. The income tax has limitations in helping the poorest families, as shown by three low-income assistance programs reducing the poverty gap more effectively. Nontax programs provide significant financial assistance to the very poor, while income tax benefits are mainly for families with earned income. Despite providing monetary benefits to low-income families, the income tax is less effective in reducing overall poverty compared to other assistance programs. The income tax is less effective than needs-tested programs in helping the poorest families move out of poverty, as shown by its impact on reducing the aggregate poverty gap. The impact of the income tax on poverty was marginally changed by the TCJA, with the poverty rate falling from 14.5% before taxes to 12.3% after the post-TCJA income tax. The aggregate poverty gap also decreased from $150.8 billion before taxes to $136.9 billion after the post-TCJA income tax, benefiting individuals in families with workers and children. This analysis underscores the importance of the tax system in poverty reduction but also highlights its limitations. The income tax reduces poverty through refundable tax credits like the EITC and ACTC, benefiting families with workers and children. However, these credits do not help those who do not work and are received annually, limiting their effectiveness in meeting basic needs. The National Academy of Sciences proposed converting the child tax credit into a monthly child allowance to reduce child poverty. However, the IRS may struggle to efficiently pay out tax benefits like the EITC and child tax credit on a more periodic basis. Despite these challenges, the income tax remains a popular way to provide aid to the working poor, especially those with children. Legislative proposals like the Economic Mobility Act of 2019 aim to expand refundable tax credits such as the EITC. The proposed legislation, H.R. 3300, aims to expand refundable tax credits like the EITC and ACTC to help working families with children. It includes increasing the childless EITC and ACTC amounts, shifting eligibility to include poor families with children that do not have a worker, and increasing the EITC for taxpayers without custodial children. The report uses TRIM3 estimates and ASEC data to analyze how federal income tax impacts poverty. TRIM3 is a microsimulation model funded by HHS and maintained by the Urban Institute. Poverty is measured using the Census Bureau's SPM. ASEC is a household survey conducted by the Census Bureau annually. The ASEC is a survey conducted by the Census Bureau annually, capturing information on work experience and income in the prior year. It is used to estimate poverty measures at the national level, but not all states. Estimates in the report are weighted to be representative of the U.S. household population. The ASEC survey conducted by the Census Bureau annually provides estimates on work experience and income, weighted to represent the U.S. household population. Sampling and nonsampling errors can affect the accuracy of the data. Tax information necessary for determining SPM poverty status is estimated using the TRIM microsimulation model. The Census Bureau uses a different microsimulation model for its reports on SPM poverty. The TRIM model determines tax eligibility and benefit amounts based on policy rules. It uses data from the ASEC survey to place individuals into tax filing units and identify qualifying children for tax credits. The estimates in this report are based on the 2016 federal income tax module. The TRIM3 model uses ASEC data to determine tax eligibility and benefit amounts based on policy rules, including qualifying children for tax credits. It also incorporates IRS data through a statistical match to estimate federal income tax liability. Limitations in the estimates stem from underlying ASEC data constraints. The TRIM3 model, based on ASEC data, has limitations in estimating federal income tax liability for very-high-income taxpayers and tends to underestimate refundable tax credits. For example, the TRIM3 estimate of the EITC for 2016 was $39.2 billion, while the IRS reported $66.7 billion claimed. The Urban Institute, in partnership with the Congressional Research Service (CRS), revised TRIM3's federal income tax module to reflect the TCJA provisions. This included adjustments for new tax brackets, marginal tax rates, suspension of personal exemption, increased standard deduction, and limitations on itemized deductions. The TCJA brought changes to the federal income tax code, including limits on SALT deductibility, revised child tax credit rules, and other adjustments. Some changes not modeled were alimony treatment, mortgage interest deduction, and elimination of the individual mandate for health insurance. Inflation adjustment was made to post-TCJA tax parameters. The 2018 TCJA parameters were adjusted to 2016 dollars using the chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U). This adjustment reflects the impact of the post-TCJA tax code as if it were enacted in 2016. The Supplemental Poverty Measure was created to address limitations of the official poverty measure, such as not accounting for taxes and noncash government benefits. The analysis does not consider noncash government benefits like food benefits from SNAP or housing benefits. It uses TRIM3 estimates for TANF, SSI, and SNAP instead of ASEC amounts to address underreporting. Child care expenses are deducted as a work expense, with TRIM3's estimate including copayments for families receiving CCDBG subsidies. The Census Bureau caps child care expenses at the lower-earning parent's earnings, while this analysis deducts all child care expenses as work-related. The analysis deducts all child care expenses as work-related expenses of the family before federal income taxes are subtracted from financial resources. It provides estimates of individuals and families in poverty using the TRIM3 microsimulation model. Additionally, it describes how major federal income tax provisions affecting low-income taxpayers were modified by the TCJA. The TCJA made significant changes to federal income tax provisions for low-income taxpayers, including doubling the standard deduction and suspending the personal exemption. This resulted in higher deduction amounts for unmarried single filers, head of household filers, and married joint filers in 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended the personal exemption, reducing it from $4,150 per person in 2018 to $0 until 2025. The combination of the standard deduction and personal exemption is known as the 0% bracket. The increase in the standard deduction and elimination of the personal exemption result in a higher tax entry point for some families, while larger families will have a lower tax entry point under the new tax law. Under the new tax law, the tax entry point has changed, resulting in more income being subject to federal income tax for some families. For example, a married couple with two children previously had a tax entry point of $29,600 in 2018, but now it is $24,000. This means that more of their income, such as $12,000 out of $36,000, is now taxable. The federal income tax code has seven marginal tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%, with different income ranges for each rate based on filing status. The federal income tax is a progressive tax with marginal rates based on taxable income. Changes to marginal tax rates are in effect from 2018 to 2025. For example, a married couple with two children and $36,000 income would have had $6,400 taxable income in 2018. After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2018, a family with two children and $36,000 income would have had $12,000 taxable income subject to a 10% marginal rate, resulting in $1,200 tax liability before credits. Taxpayers can subtract eligible tax credits, including the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit (ACTC), which is calculated based on earnings above a threshold. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made changes to the child tax credit and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), including a new requirement for providing the child's Social Security number to claim the credit. These changes are in effect from 2018 through 2025. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) made changes to the child tax credit, doubling it for many middle-income families. The income phaseout thresholds were raised, making middle- and higher-income families eligible for the credit. Low-income families saw a smaller increase. For example, a married couple with two children and $25,000 income would see their credit increase from $2,000 to $2,900. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) increased the child tax credit for many middle-income families, doubling it and raising income phaseout thresholds. The EITC was not directly changed, but a new inflation index will slow its growth over time. In 2018, the EITC amounts were reduced slightly, with larger reductions expected in the future due to the slower inflation adjustment. Over time, changes will lead to higher marginal tax rates for low-income taxpayers as wages outpace C-CPI-U, potentially pushing them into higher tax brackets."
