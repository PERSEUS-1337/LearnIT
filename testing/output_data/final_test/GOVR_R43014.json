    "content": "International trade is crucial for the U.S. economy, with goods trade totaling $4 trillion in 2014. The smooth flow of legal cargo through U.S. ports is essential for economic security. Balancing trade facilitation, enforcement of trade laws, and import security is a key challenge in U.S. import policies. U.S. Customs and Border Protection manages the import process at the border, handling about 30.4 million imports. In FY 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection managed 30.4 million import entries through over 300 U.S. POEs, with the majority coming through land and maritime flows. The report discusses CBP's role in the U.S. import process, including legislative developments and the tension among import policy goals. Congress plays a direct role in defining CBP's international responsibilities. The final section highlights policy issues for Congress to consider in oversight of CBP's international trade functions and funding, including trade facilitation benefits, enforcement of intellectual property laws, cargo scanning practices, and customs data system modernization. Import policy aims to balance trade facilitation, enforcement of laws, and modernization of customs data systems. Trade facilitation aims to streamline the flow of goods across borders, reducing trade costs. It involves advanced customs rulings, efficient procedures, eliminating red tape, clear information, and cooperation between border agencies. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, accounting for a significant portion of economic activity. While trade may initially impact certain sectors negatively, it ultimately promotes efficiency, reduces costs for consumers, and drives economic growth through competitive advantage. Trade facilitation is crucial for the U.S. economy, aiming to streamline the flow of goods across borders and reduce trade costs. The production of goods is increasingly organized into global supply chains, with intermediate components playing a significant role in imports and exports. The United States prioritizes trade facilitation in organizations like the WTO and WCO, as well as in FTA negotiations, to ensure a rules-based and efficient approach to goods crossing borders. The United States plays a key role in negotiating trade facilitation agreements to expedite the clearance of merchandise entries and ensure effective customs controls. There is a tension between promoting efficient trade flows and enforcing trade laws to protect consumers and businesses. U.S. trade laws aim to enforce health and safety standards, as well as patent, trademark, and copyright laws. The U.S. import policy aims to enforce trade laws, protect businesses through patent, trademark, and copyright laws, and collect revenue through tariffs and duties. Import security is also a priority to prevent the entry of weapons of mass destruction, illegal drugs, and other contraband, with additional responsibilities placed on customs officials after 9/11. Import security has become a central feature of U.S. trade policy post-9/11, with customs officials tasked to prevent illegal flows and weapons of mass destruction from entering the country. The U.S. and its partners in the WCO have adopted new security protocols for tracking, inspecting, and screening containerized imports and exports, creating tension between trade facilitation and enforcement. This complexity makes implementing import policy a challenging task for CBP. Import policy is a complex task for CBP, balancing import security, trade facilitation, and enforcement. Some criticize CBP for prioritizing security over trade facilitation, leading to burdensome paperwork for U.S. importers. Infrastructure issues at land ports of entry, especially at the U.S.-Mexico border, result in long wait times for trade. Several studies have estimated the economic consequences of border crossing delays at the U.S.-Mexico border, including billions of dollars in lost economic output, wages, jobs, and tax revenues. There are concerns about potential terrorist attacks at ports of entry, urging CBP to prioritize security measures. Some Members and manufacturers criticize CBP for not adequately inspecting cargo containers, investigating duty evasion, and enforcing intellectual property rights. Balancing trade facilitation, law enforcement, and import security is crucial for homeland security and public safety. Several bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress to reauthorize CBP's customs-related activities, including S. 1269, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, and related bills H.R. 1907 and H.R. 1916. S. 1269 was incorporated into H.R. 644 and passed by the Senate and House in 2015. The House and Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 644 in 2015. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner planned to have a conference on the customs bill to be signed into law by the President. Title I of H.R. 644 would require CBP to collaborate with the private sector and federal agencies to ensure trade benefits, establish performance measures, conduct facilitation and trade enforcement functions, and hold joint educational seminars with ICE for enforcement personnel at POEs. Title I of H.R. 644 mandates collaboration between CBP, private sector, and federal agencies to enhance trade benefits, establish performance measures, and conduct joint educational seminars with ICE at POEs. It authorizes existing CBP programs like ACE and ITDS, COAC, CEEs, and targeting groups to focus on Priority Trade Issues. GAO and CBP must report on trade enforcement improvements, merchandise tracking, and drawback simplification. Senate version includes authorization for CTG and NTAGS. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 644 establish a Commercial Targeting Division (CTG) and National Targeting and Analysis Groups (NTAGS) to target priority trade issues (PTIs). They authorize the National Targeting Center to perform similar functions and require CBP to strengthen internal controls, develop criteria for assigning importer-of-record identification numbers, and enforce controls over new importers. Additionally, CBP must collect additional information on imports. The House-passed version of H.R. 644 includes requirements for CBP to collect information on nonresident importers and for customs brokers to collect importer identity information. It also mandates the establishment of priority trade issues (PTIs) such as Agriculture, antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD), Import Safety, Intellectual Property (IPR), Textiles and Wearing Apparel, and Preference Programs. Additionally, Title II addresses import health and safety by establishing an interagency import safety working group chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Title II of H.R. 644 establishes an interagency import safety working group chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a joint import safety rapid response plan. It also requires joint exercises and training for CBP port personnel in enforcing import health and safety laws. Title III addresses intellectual property rights enforcement by allowing CBP to share information with rights holders to identify violations of copyrights or trademarks. Title III of S. 1269, H.R. 1907, and H.R. 1916 focuses on enforcing copyrights and establishing a National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center within CBP. Title IV and V address antidumping and countervailing duty evasion, with a key difference between the Senate and House versions being the investigation deadlines and requirements for CBP. The Senate version requires CBP to investigate allegations within specific deadlines, while the House version grants the Department of Commerce authority for investigations. H.R. 1916 assigns primary investigative duties of AD/CVD evasion to CBP and establishes a Trade Remedy Law Enforcement Division. Additionally, the House version authorizes increased data sharing for enforcement actions against evasion and requires CBP to cooperate with foreign customs officials. Title V of both versions of H.R. 644 aims to amend AD and CVD laws by expanding methods for determinations in investigations. It clarifies that the ITA can use the highest applicable dumping or subsidy rate if exporters fail to cooperate. The amendment also expands calculation methods for AD/CVD rates. Title V of H.R. 644 clarifies ITA's calculation methods for AD/CVD rates and limits the number of exporters for duty rate calculations. It amends the definition of \"material injury\" for USITC investigations to consider various factors beyond domestic industry profitability. Title V of both bill versions would revise the \"captive production test\" used by USITC to assess injury for components in downstream finished goods. It also addresses trade enforcement priorities by requiring the Administration to identify and consult with Congress on strategies to address issues impacting U.S. economic growth. The bills authorize the Administration to reinstate WTO concessions suspension under certain conditions. The bills propose the suspension of concessions under Article 22 of the WTO dispute settlement agreement and establish a Trade Enforcement Trust Fund for enforcing U.S. trade agreements. Additionally, measures are outlined to stop illegal honey transshipment and enhance detection and seizure of cultural and wildlife materials by CBP and ICE. The Senate version of the bill includes provisions to enhance enforcement of intellectual property rights, establish the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, address currency undervaluation issues, and require investigation of alleged undervaluation in AD/CVD cases. The House and Senate versions of the bill aim to address currency manipulation by engaging with other countries and establishing an Advisory Committee on Exchange Rate Policy. The Senate version also includes provisions for a process to consider duty suspensions and reductions in a miscellaneous trade bill. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 644 address miscellaneous customs provisions, including raising the de minimis value for unaccompanied cargo to $800 and requiring DHS to consult with Congress on trade policies. Other provisions include adding terrorism offenses as grounds for removing a customs broker's license and reducing record-keeping burdens on U.S. goods entering without improvement abroad. The Senate and House versions of H.R. 644 focus on customs provisions, such as raising the de minimis value for cargo to $800 and requiring DHS consultation on trade policies. They also eliminate the exception for goods made with convict, forced, or indentured labor and provide offsets by extending customs user fees. The U.S. Customs Service, established in 1789, was responsible for collecting customs tariffs, a major revenue source for the government. The U.S. Customs Service, established in 1789, collected customs tariffs, a significant revenue source for the government. Key laws like the Tariff Act of 1930, Customs Simplification Act of 1953, and Reorganization Plan of 1965 authorized trade functions. Recent customs legislation focuses on trade facilitation, enforcement, and import security post-9/11. The Homeland Security Act placed the Customs Service under the Department of Homeland Security, with Customs and Border Protection as the lead agency since 2003. The USCS's trade functions were reorganized in 1993 with the Customs Modernization and Informed Compliance Act. The Security and Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 addressed trade facilitation and enforcement by reorganizing DHS's trade functions. The Mod Act amended sections of the Tariff Act of 1930 related to trade enforcement. The Mod Act, developed in collaboration with the Industry Group, aimed to modernize USCS's commercial operations, improve compliance with customs laws, and provide safeguards for importers. It shifted from an \"agency-centric\" to a \"shared responsibility\" approach, requiring CBP to inform importers of their rights and responsibilities, and importers to be aware of their legal obligations and make duty determinations. The Mod Act requires importers to be aware of legal obligations, exercise reasonable care in classifying merchandise, and may seek a customs ruling from CBP. It shifted USCS's focus to data collection and post-entry enforcement, freeing up resources for modernizing the import process. Title IV of the SAFE Port Act streamlined customs operations, designated a senior official for coordination of trade functions, required consultation with the business community, and established the Office of International Trade within CBP. Title IV of the SAFE Port Act authorized the establishment of the International Trade Data System (ITDS) to align customs requirements and facilitate international trade. ITDS is an intergovernmental project to standardize trade enforcement data collection and distribution among federal agencies. Following the 9/11 attacks, the focus shifted to homeland security, leading to the reorganization of law enforcement resources into the Department of Homeland Security. Several laws enacted between 2002 and 2007 emphasized import security in U.S. trade policy, with funding allocated for programs like the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and CBP's air and marine interdiction program. The Trade Act of 2002 introduced new requirements for importers and exporters to submit advance cargo manifest information before cargo arrives at a U.S. port of entry. This information is used by CBP for security purposes, including detecting terrorists and illicit narcotics at U.S. borders and seaports. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) expanded DHS's authority to collect advance cargo data for risk-based targeting through the Automated Targeting System. It established new security requirements for U.S. and foreign ports, required security and incident response plans for certain ports and vessels, and created a grant program to help ports implement security plans. The MTSA established security requirements for U.S. and foreign ports, including the use of Transportation Worker Identity Credential (TWIC) cards for secure area access. DHS assesses and notifies foreign ports lacking counter-terrorism measures, and can restrict entry of vessels from non-compliant ports. Vessels operating in U.S. waters must adhere to specific security measures. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 required certain vessels in U.S. waters to have an automatic identification system and mandated the development of a long-range automated vessel tracking system. It also established the Directorate of Homeland Security within DHS to oversee border and transportation security, including preventing terrorist entry and ensuring efficient flow of traffic and commerce. Title IV of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the U.S. Customs Service and the office of the Commissioner of Customs within DHS. It specified the retention of certain customs revenue functions by the Secretary of the Treasury, with the authority to be delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The act also mandated the transfer of agencies, personnel, assets, and obligations to the new Department of Homeland Security through a reorganization plan submitted by the President. The President submitted an initial plan in November 2002, which was later modified to rename the USCS to CBP and the Bureau of Border Security to ICE. The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 added security requirements to the import process and mandated the implementation of a maritime intelligence system. The Department of Transportation was required by Section 808 of a law to conduct investigations, fund pilot programs, and award grants to enhance CBP's investigative ability with equipment to detect nuclear, chemical, or biological materials. The law also mandated DHS to report on cargo import security issues, including costs of inspections, progress on radiation detectors at U.S. seaports, and evaluation of cargo inspection targeting. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted the need for a strategic plan for maritime and surface transportation security in the United States. In response, Congress passed the SAFE Port Act and the 9/11 Act to enhance port security measures, including deadlines for implementing a vessel tracking system. The SAFE Port Act set deadlines for implementing a vessel tracking system, issuing TWIC cards, and implementing TWIC readers. It also required radiation detection scanning for all containers entering U.S. ports by December 31, 2008. Title II focused on international supply chain security and included provisions for screening cargo through CBP's Automated Targeting System and requiring advanced electronic cargo data. The SAFE Port Act authorized DHS to require advanced electronic cargo data to improve ATS targeting and established the Container Security Initiative (CSI) to identify and inspect maritime containers posing security risks. It also authorized the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) for trade-related firms to secure their supply chain integrity. The SAFE Port Act authorized DHS to establish the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) for trade-related firms. The act required DHS to conduct pilot programs for scanning cargo containers in foreign seaports and to screen 100% of containers imported into the United States for high-risk cargo. The 9/11 Act of 2007 mandated 100% scanning of air cargo and maritime containers bound for or within the United States by specific deadlines. This included scanning high-risk containers through NII and radiation detection equipment before arrival or loading onto vessels in foreign ports. Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, CBP enforces trade laws and security measures, emphasizing risk management by collecting advance information to evaluate cargo for security risks. The 9/11 Act of 2007 mandated 100% scanning of air cargo and maritime containers, including high-risk containers, before loading onto vessels in foreign ports. CBP's trade strategy focuses on assessing cargo for import security risks and enforcing trade laws, targeting high-risk imports while expediting processing for lower-risk imports. The strategy includes layered enforcement throughout the import process to create multiple opportunities for risk assessment and enforcement activities. The import process involves three main stages: 1) Pre-entry paperwork and risk-based screening, 2) Entry documents filing and scanning at U.S. ports, and 3) Entry summary filing for customs duties calculation. This process aims to interdict illegal imports through various security measures. The import process begins with pre-entry paperwork and risk-based screening, where importers submit electronic cargo manifests to CBP. This information is used to pre-clear cargo for admission and target certain cargo for security and enforcement. Cargo may undergo security scanning and inspections in foreign ports before arriving at a U.S. port of entry. Cargo may be subject to import security scanning and inspections in foreign ports before being loaded on U.S.-bound ships or upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. CBP utilizes trusted trader programs like C-TPAT to manage risks, allowing certain import-related businesses to secure their supply chains and receive expedited processing. Under the Trade Act of 2002, importers and carriers must provide DHS with electronic manifest and other data before goods arrive in U.S. ports. Carriers must provide detailed information about the goods, shippers, consignees, carrier, and arrival details. Specific filing requirements vary by mode of entry and country of origin. Maritime cargo has additional reporting requirements under the SAFE Ports Act and CBP's \"10 + 2\" filings. Under the Trade Act of 2002, importers and carriers must provide DHS with electronic manifest and other data before goods arrive in U.S. ports. Carriers must provide detailed information about the goods, shippers, consignees, carrier, and arrival details. Specific filing requirements vary by mode of entry and country of origin. Maritime cargo has additional reporting requirements under the SAFE Ports Act and CBP's \"10 + 2\" filings, which include 10 data elements from importers and 2 data elements from carriers. The importer data elements must be provided 24 hours prior to lading, while carrier data elements include the vessel stow plan and daily messages on container status changes. Under the Trade Act of 2002, importers and carriers must provide DHS with electronic manifest and other data before goods arrive in U.S. ports. Carriers must provide detailed information about the goods, shippers, consignees, carrier, and arrival details. Specific filing requirements vary by mode of entry and country of origin. Maritime cargo has additional reporting requirements under the SAFE Ports Act and CBP's \"10 + 2\" filings, which include 10 data elements from importers and 2 data elements from carriers. The importer data elements must be provided 24 hours prior to lading, while carrier data elements include the vessel stow plan and daily messages on container status changes. CBP officers screen imports by comparing cargo and conveyance information against intelligence from CBP's National Targeting Center (NTC) and other intelligence and law enforcement databases. The ATS assigns every incoming container a risk-based score related to weapons of mass destruction, narcotics, and other contraband, as well as for the potential for commercial fraud, and other customs violations. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 authorizes programs for radiation detection and NII scanning in foreign ports. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) tests CBP's ability to scan 100% of cargo containers in certain ports using radiation portal monitors and NII imaging systems. CBP officers review scanning data to determine containers for secondary inspections conducted by host-state law enforcement agencies. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 authorizes programs for radiation detection and NII scanning in foreign ports. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 amended the SAFE Port Act to require 100% of maritime containers imported to the US to be scanned by NII and radiation detection equipment before being loaded onto a US-bound vessel. The program initially operated in multiple foreign ports but was scaled back and currently only operates in Port Qasim. In 2012 and 2014, DHS Secretaries extended the deadline for 100% scanning of maritime containers, citing high costs and inefficiency. They instructed CBP to focus on refining security strategies instead. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) involves partnerships with CBP, ICE, and law enforcement agencies. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) is a partnership program involving CBP, ICE, and law enforcement agencies in CSI countries. CBP officers at the National Targeting Center\u2013Cargo (NTC-C) review advanced sea cargo data to identify high-risk containers for radiation detection and NII scanning within CSI ports. The program is operational in 58 foreign seaports in 30 countries, targeting approximately 80% of U.S. incoming maritime containerized cargo. Approximately 80% of U.S. incoming maritime containerized cargo passes through CSI ports in 30 countries. Only 1% of this cargo is scanned using radiation detection technology and NII scanning before being shipped to the United States. CBP officers reviewed over 11 million bills of lading and conducted examinations of high-risk cargo in FY2013. Imported goods are not legally entered until authorized by CBP and duties are paid, with options for entry for consumption, bonded warehouse storage, or in-bond transport to another port of entry. Importers must file entry documents within 15 days of shipment arrival at a U.S. port of entry, including entry manifest, right to entry evidence, and commercial invoices. A bond must be posted with CBP to cover duties and taxes. An entry summary must be filed within 10 days for goods to be released from CBP custody. The CBP officers at U.S. ports make a preliminary determination about cargo admissibility within 10 days of entry. The SAFE Port Act mandates 100% radiation scanning of cargo containers before release, with drive-through portals scanning containers for a few seconds each. Radiation alarms can be triggered by various materials, including naturally occurring radiation in granite. As of August 2012, CBP reported that containerized cargo entering through Northern and Southwest border land ports and containerized sea cargo is scanned through radiation portal monitors (RPMs). International rail cargo is mainly scanned with portable hand-held scanners, and radiation scanning may only be triggered when NII scanning indicates a cause for alarm. CBP's radiation portal monitors may not detect certain nuclear materials when lightly shielded. The GAO identified problems with the acquisition of RPMs by CBP and DHS's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. CBP's Advanced Targeting Unit selects high-risk containers for NII scanning. The majority of cargo containers entered by ship between FY2005 and FY2013. Between FY2005 and FY2013, the majority of cargo containers entered by ship or truck, with secondary inspection rates varying by mode of entry. Rail containers had the highest inspection rate at 91%, followed by trucks at 28%, and maritime containers at 5%. Overall, 25% of incoming containers were subject to secondary inspection in FY2011, with differences in NII scanning percentages possibly due to port infrastructure and shipping processes. Sea ports are larger facilities compared to land ports, leading to containers flowing in multiple directions before reaching their final conveyance. Maritime cargo, truck, and rail shipments differ in terms of regularity and processing time. Maritime containers often contain multiple shipments, making NII scanning more time-consuming. The flow of maritime shipping is less regular compared to land-based modes, with surges of incoming containers that must be quickly processed. Despite the majority of cargo not being scanned before entering the US, NII scans take less than a minute per container, but evaluating images and comparing them to cargo manifests is labor-intensive. The process of scanning cargo manifests is labor-intensive and time-consuming, with CBP targeting certain containers for trade enforcement inspections based on risk scores and intelligence. Increased scanning may slow down the flow of goods in and out of the United States, as the majority of cargo entries are lawful. Trade enforcement examinations focus on product safety, intellectual property violations, counterfeit goods, labeling violations, and circumvention of duties. Trade enforcement inspections by CBP focus on ensuring correct classification and accurate weighing of goods for duty assessment, addressing labeling violations, anti-dumping and countervailing duty circumvention, and detecting trade-related fraud. CBP's trade enforcement efforts target five priority trade issues: antidumping and countervailing duties, import safety, intellectual property rights, textiles and apparel, and trade agreements. These issues are central to CBP's trade enforcement strategy. According to CBP, PTIs are central to their trade enforcement strategy, with a focus on identifying threats and vulnerabilities in duty collection. Trade enforcement examinations can be time-consuming, especially for containers with diverse contents, requiring physical unpacking and inspection. In some cases, other federal agencies may be involved for inspections of certain goods. Trade enforcement examinations are crucial for determining the admission and classification of goods. Importers are responsible for storage and transportation costs related to these examinations. C-TPAT membership offers benefits such as reduced storage costs for large shipments subject to secondary inspection. Approximately 2% of cargo containers seeking entry into the US underwent physical examination at a port of entry, with half of these examinations being trade-related. This led to 157,905 trade-related seizures during FY2005-FY2013. During FY2005-FY2013, there were 157,905 trade-related seizures, with most related to intellectual property violations (77%) and import safety violations (16%). Importers must provide detailed entry summary documentation within 10 days for admissible cargo, pay storage and transportation costs, and settle customs duties and fees before taking possession of goods. CBP programs aim to facilitate lawful trade. CBP programs like \"Simplified Entry\" aim to facilitate lawful trade by reducing administrative burden for importers and providing necessary documentation for CBP officials. The process allows for streamlined data submission to identify potential risks early in the import process. CBP's \"Simplified Entry\" program aims to reduce administrative burden for importers by allowing streamlined data submission to identify potential risks early in the import process. The program, initially piloted in December 2011 for air cargo, has evolved to include all self-filers with Tier-2 or higher C-TPAT status and importers using customs brokers. By September 2013, over 159,000 simplified entries had been filed for more than 1,100 importers. In November 2013, the program was renamed \"ACE Cargo Release Test\" and opened to more importers without the C-TPAT requirement. Eligible applicants are now accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. In February 2014, CBP expanded the test to include cargo entries by ocean and rail, and limited truck entries at 10 POEs in May 2014. To streamline post-entry processing, CBP established Centers of Excellence and Expertise (CEEs) since October 2011, serving as industry-specific points for certain businesses enrolled in trusted trader programs. The Centers aim to align customs practices with modern business demands and facilitate trade in targeted industries. The 10 CEEs operating as of November 2012 include Electronics in Los Angeles and Pharmaceuticals, Health, and Chemicals in New York. In 2012, Centers of Excellence and Expertise were established in various cities for different industries to reduce cargo delays, costs, and improve predictability. An Account Executive pilot program was also implemented for trusted partners in the electronics industry. The Centers promote information sharing between industry representatives and CBP. The Centers of Excellence and Expertise support improved information sharing between industry representatives and CBP to enhance trade enforcement efforts. In-bond transportation allows goods to flow efficiently into the United States by being transported between U.S. POEs for various purposes without immediate duty payment. Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Seattle are the top field offices for processing in-bond shipments. The in-bond system provides flexibility to the trade community to avoid port congestion, although a 2007 GAO report raised concerns about CBP. The 2007 GAO report raised concerns about CBP's lack of information on in-bond shipments, limited analysis, and unreconciled cargo. Regulatory flexibility in the in-bond system creates challenges for CBP to track shipments, leading to vulnerabilities for contraband entry. Proposed changes by CPB in 2012 aim to address these issues. Proposed changes to the in-bond process include electronic filing, 6-digit HTS classification, 30-day arrival time, and safety disclosure. CBP has not announced adoption yet. Concerns raised about duplicative information requirements. Importers have 180 days to challenge CBP after entry. Importers have up to 180 days from the date of entry to challenge CBP's assessment of duties owed. CBP makes a final determination of duty rate and amount, known as liquidation, where importers pay additional duties or receive refunds. CBP and other agencies may conduct enforcement activities post-entry, including audits to ensure compliance with trade laws. Liquidation is the final computation of duties on entries, usually within one year, but can be extended for various reasons. Liquidation of duties by CBP may be suspended in certain cases, such as pending court cases or ongoing AD/CVD investigations. The suspension ends after an administrative review, and final duties are collected. During a Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigation on CBP's collection of AD/CVD duties, it was found that the long lag time between cash deposit of estimated duties and the collection of final duties (averaging 3.3 years) made it difficult for CBP to collect. CBP requires import records to be kept for five years and conducts regulatory audits to ensure compliance. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducts risk-based evaluations called Focused Assessment (FA) audits to assess a company's transactions. These audits analyze internal controls to predict compliance and address any identified risk areas. Quick Response Audits (QRAs) are single-issue audits focused on specific objectives, such as unlawful transshipments or intellectual property rights. Both types of audits may lead to enforcement actions and penalties for violations of U.S. trade laws. Parties can make prior disclosures of violations, including undervaluation, inaccurate descriptions, duty evasion, and improper country of origin declarations. The CBP allows parties to make prior disclosures of violations, like inaccurate descriptions or duty evasion, to be eligible for reduced penalties. Reauthorization of CBP's trade functions has been a topic of recent legislative proposals, focusing on trade facilitation, enforcement, and security goals. These issues are also addressed in customs reauthorization bills in the 114th Congress. Some in Congress prioritize trade facilitation in U.S. customs law and CBP's import policies. Legislative attention is on authorizing CBP trade facilitation programs, trusted trader benefits, and reducing wait times at ports-of-entry. Pilot programs like Simplified Entry and Centers of Excellence and Expertise have been initiated without explicit legislative authorization. Expansion tests were conducted for cargo entries by ocean, rail, and limited truck entries at 10 POEs. Senate bills S. 1269 and S. 1907 address these trade facilitation efforts. The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee have proposed legislation to improve benefits for trusted trader program participants and authorize Centers of Excellence and Expertise within CBP. Some businesses feel that the benefits received by C-TPAT members are inadequate considering the time and financial investments required for certification. Congressional testimony has highlighted concerns about the effectiveness of these programs. Some industry representatives express dissatisfaction with CBP's risk management approach. Only a small percentage of import-related businesses and customs brokers have joined C-TPAT. Congress is considering ways to increase participation in trusted trader programs like C-TPAT to facilitate trade flows, but expanding benefits may be challenging due to limited capacity at land ports. The primary benefit of C-TPAT membership for maritime imports is reducing the likelihood of inspection, but with only 4% of containers selected for secondary inspection, the practical advantage may be limited. Some CBP officials warn that further reductions in inspections could increase security risks. To encourage C-TPAT membership, increasing enforcement against non-members may be more effective. Some in Congress are concerned about delays and wait times at land ports of entry, especially on the U.S.-Mexico border. Various groups have recommended strategies to reduce wait times, such as optimizing demand dispersal, improving throughput with trusted trader programs, expanding capacity, and increasing staffing and operating hours. The Department of Homeland Security Southwest Border Task Force also suggested enhancements like trusted trader programs, improved scanning systems, and expanded infrastructure to improve U.S.-Mexico commerce. The Department of Homeland Security Southwest Border Task Force recommended strategies to improve throughput at land ports of entry, including enhanced scanning systems, expanded infrastructure, and increased staffing levels. These efforts aim to balance faster flows with security and trade enforcement goals, with a focus on adopting best practices for border inspections. While U.S. Border Patrol staffing at ports of entry doubled between FY2004 and FY2012, DHS's Office of Field Operations (OFO) staffing only increased by 20%. Some Members are skeptical of CBP's staffing model and suggest using technology and risk management to reduce border wait times. Congressional attention has focused on CBP's role in trade enforcement, including tariff collection, trade law enforcement, and intellectual property rights. Some in Congress and U.S. businesses criticize CBP for not adequately enforcing intellectual property rights laws, textile and apparel trade violations, and import safety regulations. Manufacturers allege CBP has not properly investigated duty evasion, product mislabeling, and fraudulent country of origin declarations. CBP officials cite due process requirements for confidentiality in investigations. The main policy question is how CBP can improve import security. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 mandated that 100% of maritime cargo containers entering the US be scanned for security purposes. Deadlines for this requirement have been extended multiple times by Homeland Security Secretaries. The Department has delayed the 100% scanning requirement by two years due to obstacles identified in the Secure Freight Initiative pilot program, including lack of support from foreign governments and logistical challenges. The Department has delayed the 100% scanning requirement by two years due to obstacles identified in the Secure Freight Initiative pilot program, including lack of support from foreign governments and logistical challenges. Implementing 100% scanning at foreign ports would be logistically difficult and costly, with an estimated total cost of $16.8 billion. Congress may consider allowing DHS to scan less than 100% of U.S.-bound cargo to address these challenges. The Department has delayed the 100% scanning requirement for U.S.-bound cargo due to obstacles in the Secure Freight Initiative pilot program. Scanning less than 100% of incoming cargo can reduce costs and processing time, aligning with DHS's risk management approach to focus on high-risk containers. This allows for more thorough inspection of each scanned container, especially since NII scanning is labor-intensive. CBP estimates illicit cargo to be limited to less than 1% of incoming containers. Focusing enforcement on the likeliest containers may be the most effective strategy instead of 100% scanning. Risk-based scanning, investment in CBP intelligence, and increased personnel could improve targeting. The question of where security scanning takes place, whether in foreign ports or U.S. ports, is important. Implementing 100% scanning abroad may be challenging. Efforts to implement 100% scanning abroad may be difficult due to various reasons. Radiation scanning within U.S. ports may be too late to prevent a WMD attack, making a case for conducting scanning in foreign ports before cargo is shipped to the United States. Scanning in foreign ports may be less urgent for detecting drugs and contraband compared to NII scanning at U.S. POEs. Some Members are frustrated with DHS for not finalizing regulations on card readers for the TWIC program. Congress may need to consider pushing DHS to speed up regulations for port access control. However, concerns about the overall effectiveness of the TWIC program have been raised, including weaknesses in enrollment controls, background checks, and security vulnerabilities. DHS has not fully evaluated the program's effectiveness. DHS's report on the TWIC pilot program highlighted strengths and weaknesses, such as efficient card verification but also issues like reader malfunctions and training requirements. In 2012-2013, GAO conducted a performance audit that identified persistent weaknesses in using TWIC readers. GAO recommended halting DHS's final regulation until a security assessment is completed. Customs modernization involves transitioning from ACS to ACE and developing ITDS, which has taken longer and exceeded cost predictions. Some import-related businesses have not established ACE accounts, causing frustration among Members of Congress and business groups. Some Members of Congress and business groups are frustrated with the lag in ACE development. However, CBP officials report that most support the plans to develop core ACE processes in three years. In February 2014, Executive Order 13659 was issued to streamline the export-import process for businesses, requiring the completion of the International Trade Data System (ITDS) by December 31, 2016. This system aims to create an automated \"single window\" for importers and exporters to transmit data efficiently and cost-effectively. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to confirm operational capabilities for trade community users to transmit import and export data to PGAs through the ITDS. CBP designates ACE as the platform for the \"single window\" required by Executive Order 13659, with mandatory use dates set for electronic data transmission by May 1, 2015, and full integration by December 2016. By October 1, 2016, all cargo data, including protest and liquidation data, must be transmitted to ACE. CBP has implemented ACE in modules for different phases of the import process. Importers can initially use ACS or ACE for tasks, but must switch to ACE once it has been tested and proven effective. The ACE development deployment schedule is available on the CBP website, with the final phase completed on January 3, 2015, allowing for filing of air import manifests for all modes of travel. The Automated Commercial Environment system, scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, will allow for filing air import manifests for all modes of travel. The project has a budget of $141 million for FY2014 and FY2015, with a $154 million budget request for FY2016. Maintenance costs are projected at $68 million per year from FY2018\u2013FY2026. S. 1269 and H.R. 1907 aim to authorize funding of $153.7 million from FY2016 through FY2018 for ACE development and implementation. CBP collaborates with 47 partner government agencies for trade enforcement, but they do not always successfully implement U.S. import policies. Important partners include TSA and Coast Guard for import security, and FDA, Agriculture, and Commerce for trade enforcement. CBP collaborates with partner agencies for trade enforcement, but faces challenges in information sharing and coordination with ICE and other agencies. The Border Interagency Executive Council (BIEC) was created to improve interagency cooperation in detecting and preventing illegal entries and trade violations. The Border Interagency Executive Council (BIEC) was established in January 2010 to enhance interagency collaboration on import safety issues. It includes agency leaders at the Assistant Administrator and Assistant Commissioner level and works closely with CBP's Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations (COAC) and the International Trade Data System (ITDS). ITDS, implemented through ACE, aims to standardize trade enforcement data collection across federal agencies to create a \"single window\" for import and export data. Section 405 of the SAFE Port Act mandates federal agencies to participate in the ACE for cargo documentation. All 47 PGAs are involved in ITDS implementation, with the Treasury Department coordinating interagency participation and CBP managing ITDS. Some in Congress may push for closer collaboration between agencies and CBP in trade enforcement. S. 1269 and H.R. 1907 would amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to address these issues. S. 1269 and H.R. 1907 aim to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 by requiring agencies to develop IT infrastructure for electronic data submission through ITDS, share information with CBP, and provide admissibility criteria for cargo release. This aligns with the goal of facilitating efficient trade flow. The Mod Act of 1993 aimed to address the tension between trade facilitation and enforcement of trade laws by implementing a \"shared responsibility\" approach where importers make duty determinations. This approach is meant to ensure legal flows without compromising trade enforcement, with a focus on import security. The tension between trade facilitation and enforcement of trade laws is more profound in import security, where post-entry enforcement may be too late to prevent security breaches. Programs like C-TPAT aim to outsource security functions to trusted industry partners, but post-9/11 concerns limit benefits for trusted traders. Transitioning to ACE should streamline imports while enhancing enforcement. Implementing programs like ACE and improving POE infrastructure can enhance trade flows and enforcement efforts. However, these initiatives may be costly to implement, and Congress may be hesitant to invest in them at this time."
