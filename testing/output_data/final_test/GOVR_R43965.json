    "content": "Three years after the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which called for the integration of drones into national airspace by September 2015, there has been little progress in enacting laws to regulate the privacy impacts of drone flights. Despite Congress holding hearings on the issue and introducing legislation, no explicit regulations have been put in place at the federal level. The executive branch has implemented measures to assess privacy impacts of drone operations, and many states have enacted UAS legislation. Two main privacy issues arise from domestic drone flights: defining privacy in aerial surveillance and addressing privacy concerns related to the aggregation and use of drone-obtained information. Traditional privacy concepts may not fully capture these concerns, requiring exploration of personal autonomy and anonymity. The Supreme Court's aerial surveillance cases generally hold that conducting surveillance of private property from navigable airspace is not a Fourth Amendment search. However, concerns arise regarding the aggregation and use of drone-obtained data, potential privacy risks, and the need for regulations to address UAS privacy issues. The courts are expected to apply traditional privacy rules, but the application to UAS flights remains unaddressed due to limited drone use. Privacy safeguards may also come from executive branch policies. President Obama issued a memorandum in 2015 for federal agencies using drones to evaluate privacy impact and develop policies. The FAA's role in setting privacy rules for drone operations has been passive, prompting the need for new initiatives. Congress has the authority to set national standards for UAS privacy regulation, including a warrant requirement for law enforcement. The use of drones for various purposes has led to discussions on privacy regulations. Different approaches have been proposed, including a warrant requirement for law enforcement use and regulations on data retention and dissemination. Federal legislation in Congress has addressed these issues, while some argue for state-level experimentation with privacy laws. Privacy rights concerning drones are complex and may involve various sources of regulation. This report provides a primer on privacy issues related to UAS operations, including current uses, privacy interests, and potential regulation. The FMRA defines unmanned aircraft and UAS, commonly known as drones, which can vary in size and be equipped with various sensors. Drones are equipped with advanced sensors like cameras, thermal imaging devices, and license plate readers. Future drones may have facial recognition capabilities. DARPA is developing drones with the ability to enter buildings and fly without GPS. These advancements raise privacy concerns. Currently, UAS operators not exempt for recreational use must apply to the FAA for permission to fly. Public and private commercial operators have different processes for obtaining permission. Federal, state, or local agencies must obtain a COA from the FAA, which involves a comprehensive review of the UAS. COAs are not publicly available but can be requested through FOIA. The DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection is a prominent domestic user of UAS. The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) owns 10 UAS operated by CBP's Office of Air and Marine (OAM). CBP's missions involve patrolling borders, interdicting illegal entries, and providing aerial support to various federal and state agencies. CBP has been increasingly using Predator drones for various operations since 2010, including assisting local police in monitoring suspects. The Department of Justice also utilizes small UAS for law enforcement, with the FBI being the main user since 2006. The DOJ, DEA, and Marshals Service have purchased UAS for future operations, with the DEA and Marshals Service using CBP drones. The FAA has issued COAs to various federal entities for UAS operations, including military and civilian agencies like DARPA, NASA, and the Departments of State, Interior, and Energy. State and local governmental entities, like Houston, Texas, and the Colorado Department of Transportation, have obtained COAs from the FAA to operate drones. These entities include fire and police departments, such as the Miami-Dade Police Department, and universities like Indiana University. Private commercial use of UAS currently requires a special airworthiness certificate from the FAA until the small UAS rule is finalized. The FAA issues certificates for limited UAS flights, including for flight tests, demonstrations, and training. Section 333 of FMRA allows for exemptions for specific UAS flights, such as movie productions and bridge inspections. Recreational UAS users may not need FAA authorization under the model aircraft exception. Privacy concerns arise in analyzing drone operations, both public and private. Privacy concerns are raised by drone operations, both public and private. The use of UAS involves surveillance through the collection of information about people, mainly visual surveillance from the sky. The U.S. Air Force has introduced the \"Gorgon Stare\" sensor for Wide-Area Persistent Surveillance, allowing a single UAS to monitor a large area. The Wide-Area Persistent Surveillance (WAPS) system enables a single UAS to monitor a 100km2 area in high resolution for hours. Surveillance methods vary, from targeted data collection by the FBI to CBP's border monitoring. Privacy concerns include personal control, secrecy, autonomy, and anonymity, with a focus on the right to control information about oneself. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of privacy in the context of drones and aerial surveillance. It questions the control individuals have over their privacy in public spaces and the implications of requiring consent for aerial surveillance. The secrecy model of privacy is also mentioned, where privacy is invaded when previously concealed information is publicly disclosed. The Supreme Court has relied on this model in privacy cases. The Supreme Court has relied on the secrecy model in privacy cases involving aerial surveillance, stating that information knowingly exposed to the public does not violate the Fourth Amendment. The privacy tort intrusion upon seclusion also follows this model, where activities revealed to the public may not constitute a violation. This raises concerns about the lack of protection from drone surveillance when information is made public. Personal autonomy is a key theory of privacy, allowing individuals to make decisions without interference. Surveillance can be seen as a form of social control, limiting independent thinking and enforcing conformity. While some level of social control is necessary for crime prevention, excessive surveillance can restrict freedom and creativity. Potential risks to personal autonomy from drone surveillance depend on the pervasiveness of the surveillance. Single, targeted operations may not implicate this fear, but 24-hour, omnipresent surveillance could harm autonomy. As small UAS with limited flight capabilities become more sophisticated, the risk to autonomy may increase. Anonymity in public spaces is crucial for privacy and freedom from identification and surveillance. Professor Christopher Slobogin emphasizes the importance of the right to public anonymity, stating that it ensures individuals can remain nameless in public unless they engage in suspicious behavior. While some argue that leaving home forfeits this right, potential drone surveillance over urban areas or large events like the Super Bowl poses minimal risk to anonymity. The use of drones for surveillance raises privacy concerns, especially regarding the potential use of sensors like ALPRs or facial recognition technology. The aggregation, use, and retention of data collected through drone surveillance also pose privacy risks, as the manipulation and storage of data may impact individuals' privacy interests. The privacy theory of aggregation suggests that collecting extensive information about a person can intrude on their privacy. Aggregated information can reveal new facts about a person that they did not expect to be known. This theory was evident in the 2012 GPS tracking case United States v. Jones. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia applied the aggregation theory in invalidating the NSA's metadata program, highlighting the significant amount of information now available through phone tracking. This aggregation theory also applies to UAS operations, where surveillance over an extended period or combining drone data with other information can intrude on privacy. Continuous surveillance by drones can raise privacy concerns, especially when aggregating drone-collected data with other personal information. Improper use of data collected for authorized purposes is another privacy risk, particularly in the era of big data sharing with government and commercial entities. Privacy laws should focus on controlling the use of data rather than just collection and retention. Federal laws like the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 emphasize informing individuals about how their information will be used and restrict unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Policymakers should consider regulating the use of drone surveillance instead of imposing front-end restrictions like warrant requirements. The digital revolution has enabled the government and private companies to store vast amounts of personal data at a low cost. Policymakers should focus on regulating how this information is used, rather than just collecting it. For example, allowing data collection for specific purposes like traffic control but prohibiting its use for other purposes without a court order. The declining cost of data storage and new technologies have made it easier to collect, store, and process data, raising concerns about privacy. The issue of data retention has been a driving force behind Europe's \"right to be forgotten\" law, which limits data retention to only what is necessary. While Fourth Amendment law allows for indefinite storage of lawfully collected information, the NSA metadata litigation raised concerns about the long-term storage of telephone call records, highlighting unique privacy interests at stake. The metadata program involves creating and maintaining a historical database with five years of data. The privacy impact of retaining UAS-derived data depends on identifying individuals in the recordings. Questions arise about which government entity should regulate privacy issues from integrating thousands of UAS into domestic skies. Congress did not address privacy in FMRA or enact drone-related privacy rules. The FAA's proposed rule for small drones lacks privacy safeguards. President Obama mandated federal agencies to evaluate privacy risks in drone operations. Different government institutions may regulate UAS privacy, including the courts, executive branch, Congress, and state governments. Courts play a key role in safeguarding privacy rights through the Fourth Amendment and privacy torts. The Fourth Amendment provides legal recourse for privacy invasions by drones operated by private actors. Courts must assess if a \"search\" invaded an individual's \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\" Previous cases on traditional aircraft and location monitoring offer insight on applying the Fourth Amendment to drone technology. The Supreme Court has upheld warrantless surveillance using traditional aircraft in the past, including cases where helicopters were used to observe private property. These cases suggest limited privacy protections against drone surveillance on both public and private property. The Supreme Court has previously allowed warrantless surveillance using traditional aircraft to observe private property. Recent cases show the Court's hesitation in applying old rulings to new technology, such as in Kyllo v. United States and United States v. Jones, where concerns were raised about the use of advanced technology for surveillance and its potential to infringe on individuals' privacy rights. The federal courts are grappling with applying old precedents to new technology, such as the use of drones for surveillance. Judges may need to modify existing rulings to address the privacy risks posed by advanced sensors on drones and the collection of large amounts of data. This issue highlights the challenge of adapting legal standards to evolving surveillance methods. The judiciary struggles to keep pace with rapidly advancing technology in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, leading to potential gaps in privacy protection. Some argue that courts, being reactive and backward-looking, may not be the best forum to create privacy rules for evolving technologies like email surveillance. The Supreme Court's uncertainty about its role in developing privacy rules during technological flux has led to calls for legislatures to take the lead. The Supreme Court's uncertainty about its role in developing privacy rules during technological flux has led to calls for legislatures to take the lead. Justices prefer legislatures over courts to lead, but the case-by-case approach allows cautious rule formulation based on concrete facts, reducing unintended consequences. Recent reliance on property rights in Fourth Amendment decisions may boost safeguards against UAS surveillance. In Jones, Justice Scalia rejuvenated a property-based theory of the Fourth Amendment by holding that attaching a GPS device to a vehicle constituted a Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court's uncertainty about its role in developing privacy rules during technological flux has led to calls for legislatures to take the lead. Recent reliance on property rights in Fourth Amendment decisions may boost safeguards against UAS surveillance. Justice Scalia observed that the Katz reasonable expectation of privacy formula added to, but did not replace, the traditional property-based test. In Florida v. Jardines, the Court held that using a trained police drug dog to investigate an individual's home was a \"search.\" Flying a UAS onto someone's property with the intent to obtain information may be considered a Fourth Amendment search requiring a warrant. Privacy torts could also regulate privacy issues arising from UAS use. The modern privacy tort originated from Justice Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren's article \"Right to Privacy,\" which led to the development of four discrete torts for civil liability. Among these, the tort of intrusion upon seclusion and publicity given to private life are likely to be relevant to UAS surveillance issues. The tort of intrusion upon seclusion involves intentionally intruding upon the solitude or seclusion of another in a highly offensive manner. It requires repeated and persistent intrusion that becomes a burden to the individual's existence. The invasion of privacy must be intentional and outrageous to be considered a violation. The tort of \"publicity given to private facts\" involves giving publicity to private information about someone that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person and is not of legitimate public concern. This focuses on publicizing an individual's private life, causing mental suffering, shame, or humiliation. The tort of \"publicity given to private facts\" pertains to publicizing private information about an individual that would be offensive and is not of public concern. It requires the information to be made available to the public at large and generally prohibits claims involving matters of legitimate public concern. The location of the surveillance target largely determines the viability of claims for intrusion upon seclusion and publicity given to private life, which is likely to apply to drone surveillance as well. Using a drone to peer into someone's home, whether through a window or with technology like thermal imaging, would likely satisfy the intrusion tort. The use of extra-sensory technology like thermal imaging could lead to claims for intrusion upon seclusion and publicity given to private life. However, the success of such claims is reduced if the surveillance is conducted in public spaces or from a public vantage point. An example is the case of Aaron and Christine Boring suing Google for taking and publishing photos of their private residence on Google Street View. The Borings sued for intrusion upon seclusion and publicity given to private facts after Google took photos of their residence and swimming pool. The court dismissed the claims, stating that the photos did not meet the \"highly offensive\" standard required for privacy torts. The court found that the photos were not invasive as they could be seen by anyone entering the Borings' driveway. The executive branch, including agencies like DHS and DOJ, may take a lead role in regulating privacy implications of UAS operations. President Obama issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to evaluate privacy impact of their UAS operations. Congress charged the FAA with integrating UAS into national airspace, with privacy remaining a key concern. The FAA has become the center of debate on the privacy implications of integrating UAS into the national airspace. Some question FAA's authority to regulate privacy, while others argue that it must address privacy issues due to its role in UAS integration. The FAA's mission does not include privacy enforcement, but obligations in FMRA have kept it involved in the privacy debate, such as establishing test sites for UAS integration. The FAA's involvement in UAS integration has sparked a privacy debate. Despite lacking explicit authority over privacy, the FAA issued privacy rules for test sites, requiring adherence to privacy laws and the development of a privacy policy based on Fair Information Practice Principles. The FAA issued privacy rules for UAS test sites, requiring operators to follow Fair Information Practice Principles and maintain records of UAS operations. The FAA's approach to privacy is hands-off, leaving enforcement to private parties, operators, and local/state governments. The FAA has recognized the importance of privacy in its proposed small UAS rule and planning documents. They issued operating requirements for small UAS for non-recreational purposes, noting privacy concerns were beyond the scope of the rulemaking. The FAA will participate in a multi-stakeholder process to develop a privacy framework for commercial and private drone use. The FAA has highlighted privacy and civil liberties concerns in its planning documents and Comprehensive Plan regarding the integration of UAS technologies into the national airspace. President Obama also issued a memorandum addressing these concerns in domestic use of drones. The presidential memorandum establishes new frameworks for privacy implications of drone operations by government and private actors. Federal agencies must comply with the Constitution and review UAS policies every three years to protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The presidential memorandum sets guidelines for the collection, retention, and dissemination of information gathered by UAS. Agencies must ensure that collected information is relevant to an authorized purpose, retain it for a maximum of 180 days unless necessary for their mission or required by law, and limit dissemination to comply with agency requirements. The presidential memorandum sets guidelines for agencies using UAS, requiring protocols for privacy complaints, rules of conduct, oversight of personnel with access to sensitive information, and policies for UAS use in government operations. Agencies must also provide public notice of authorized UAS operations and keep the public informed about their UAS program. The presidential memorandum mandates agencies to keep the public informed about their UAS program and any significant privacy changes. They must also provide an annual summary of UAS operations, including mission types and assistance provided to other agencies or governments. Additionally, agencies must report on policy implementation within 180 days and make policies publicly available within a year. The Department of Commerce is tasked with developing a privacy framework for commercial UAS operations. The President's memorandum mandates agencies to develop a privacy framework for commercial and private UAS use, focusing on accountability and transparency. Prior to this, federal agencies had already started assessing privacy impacts, such as DHS conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment for UAS operations at the U.S. border. This assessment was prompted by statutory obligations under the E-Government Act of 2002. The Department of Homeland Security conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to evaluate the collection and dissemination of personal information using information technology. The Privacy Officer of DHS coordinates with the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to ensure that civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy considerations are addressed comprehensively. The Department of Homeland Security conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to evaluate the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in its operations. The PIA concluded that UAS operations have minimal privacy impact due to limitations on altitude and technology capabilities. Personally identifiable information is generally not retrieved, but images may be associated with individuals if they are apprehended. Various safeguards, including well-defined flight operations, mitigate the privacy impact of UAS technology. The Department of Homeland Security conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to evaluate the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in its operations. The PIA concluded that UAS operations have minimal privacy impact due to limitations on altitude and technology capabilities. Various safeguards, including well-defined flight operations, mitigate the privacy impact of UAS technology. Additionally, DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and its Privacy Office spearheaded a working group to assess privacy and civil liberties issues related to UAS operations. The Department of Homeland Security conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to evaluate the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in its operations, concluding that UAS operations have minimal privacy impact. There is debate within the Department of Justice regarding the need for new rules on deploying UAS in law enforcement operations, with the FBI and ATF not seeing a practical difference in evidence collection between UAS and manned aerial surveillance. DOJ's Inspector General disagreed and found a need for specialized UAS privacy protocols. The DOJ may need consistent UAS-specific policies due to the unique privacy concerns raised by UAS capabilities. The ODAG should consider developing a DOJ-wide policy for UAS use to address potential privacy and legal implications. This conclusion aligns with the President's new memorandum on UAS operations. The DOJ, like other federal agencies using UAS, faces privacy concerns. The President's memorandum on UAS operations lacks specific privacy and transparency standards, leaving agencies to develop their own policies. Congress should set strong standards for drone use to protect individuals' privacy. In the 113th Congress, measures were introduced to restrict public and private drone operations, with proposed regulations ranging from warrant requirements for law enforcement to privacy-tort-like prohibitions against private intrusions. Congress has also held hearings to probe executive branch agencies on drone use and privacy implications. Senator Ed Markey and Representative Peter Welch introduced legislation for drone privacy and transparency. The bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to regulate government and private use of drones, including data collection requirements, a warrant requirement for law enforcement, and enforcement mechanisms. The bills required a study on privacy threats posed by drones, prohibited the FAA from issuing licenses without a data collection statement, and specified details such as authorized operators, usage location, and duration. The bills introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to regulate government and private use of drones, including data collection requirements, a warrant requirement for law enforcement, and enforcement mechanisms. The statement for drone operation would need to include details on the use of personal information, data minimization procedures, information storage, privacy impact mitigation, operator contact information, and processes for determining and handling collected information about individuals. The bills in the 113th Congress aimed to regulate drone use, including data collection requirements, a warrant requirement for law enforcement, and enforcement mechanisms. Law enforcement agencies operating drones would have to file a data minimization statement with the FAA, outlining policies to minimize data collection, destroy irrelevant data, and establish oversight procedures. The FAA could revoke a drone operator's license for non-compliance. H.R. 2868 proposed enforcement mechanisms for drone use, including license revocation for non-compliance, FTC oversight for data collection, state Attorney General civil suits for privacy threats, private right of action for violations, and restrictions on governmental drone use without a warrant except in exigent circumstances. The Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted Surveillance Act of 2013, proposed by Senator Rand Paul and Representative Austin Scott, focused on government drone operations. It required a warrant based on probable cause before conducting drone surveillance for criminal law violations, with exceptions for preventing illegal entry into the US and swift action to prevent imminent danger. H.R. 972 and S. 1016 proposed regulations on drone use for preventing imminent danger or terrorist attacks. H.R. 637 introduced by Representative Ted Poe aimed to regulate public and private drone use, including a prohibition on collecting or disclosing certain information. The prohibition on collecting or disclosing covered information was subject to exceptions, including law enforcement obtaining a court-issued warrant or order based on specific facts showing criminal activity. Surveillance in public areas was limited to 48 hours, renewable for up to 30 days, with notice required to the target. The operation can be renewed for up to 30 days with notice required to the target within 10 days or 48 hours before in a major publication, on a government website, or with signs posted in the area. The operation must be within 25 miles of the national border and the targeted individual must have provided prior written consent. In emergency situations involving danger of death or serious physical injury, conspiratorial activities threatening national security, or organized crime, law enforcement can proceed without a warrant but must obtain one within 48 hours. Any evidence obtained in violation of this act would not be admissible in court. H.R. 637 would have required governmental entities applying for a UAS license to file a data collection statement with the Attorney General, detailing the purpose, data collection capabilities, retention period, citizen feedback contact, operational responsibilities, authorization protocols, data minimization policies, and audit procedures. The Attorney General would have the authority to request information from the Secretary of Transportation. H.R. 637 empowered the Attorney General to request revocation of licenses for entities failing to file data collection statements and allowed for disciplinary action against officers violating the act. It also prohibited the intentional capture of offensive images with private drones in private settings. Congress utilized oversight to address privacy concerns related to drone surveillance. In the 113th Congress, both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees held hearings on the privacy impact of drone operations. Senator Rand Paul questioned the FBI on the definition of \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" in UAS surveillance, expressing concerns about potential privacy implications. The FBI cited Supreme Court cases from the 1980s to justify not needing a warrant for aerial surveillance. In the 113th Congress, hearings were held on the privacy impact of drone operations. Senator Rand Paul raised concerns about privacy implications in UAS surveillance, citing Supreme Court cases from the 1980s where a warrant was not needed for aerial surveillance. Justice Brandeis' theory of federalism suggests states can experiment with UAS policies to determine the best legal framework. However, some argue that having 50 different privacy regimes would be burdensome. State laws regarding the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have been enacted in 20 states by the end of 2014. These laws mainly fall into three categories: prohibitions on state law enforcement use with exceptions like obtaining a warrant, restrictions on data collected by UAS, and requirements for the destruction of information within a certain timeframe unless it pertains to criminal activity. Alaska prohibits retention of drone records unless for investigation, training, or legal requirements. Images retained are confidential. Idaho prohibits recording individuals without consent or publishing photos without permission. The tension between First Amendment rights and individual privacy interests arises in proposals regarding the public dissemination of photographs taken by drones, requiring a balance in UAS legislation."
