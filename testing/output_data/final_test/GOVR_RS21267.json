    "content": "The MREFC account of the NSF, established in FY1995, supports acquiring, constructing, and commissioning major research facilities and equipment to advance science and engineering. Projects funded include telescopes, research vessels, accelerators, computing resources, observatories, and earthquake simulators, often involving international partners. NSF provides around $1.0 billion annually for these projects, with construction funding ranging from tens to hundreds of millions. The NSF provides funding for major research facilities and equipment, with construction costs ranging from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. The NSF awards grants to universities, consortia, or nonprofit organizations to design, operate, and manage these facilities. Oversight of development, management, and performance is the responsibility of the NSF. The portfolio of facilities has expanded to include complex multidisciplinary and distributed projects in recent years. The NSF is facing concerns about the planning and management of major facility projects, with questions raised about project selection, funding costs, and personnel involvement. President Bush directed the NSF to develop clearer policies and procedures for managing large facility projects in the FY2002 budget submission. The NSF is developing a plan to improve cost estimation and project oversight for major facility projects funded by the MREFC account. These projects aim to advance scientific understanding and infrastructure technology, with a focus on transformative knowledge. The NSF is working on a plan to enhance cost estimation and oversight for major facility projects funded by the MREFC account. This includes investments exceeding 10% of the annual budget of the sponsoring directorate or office. Large facility projects are mainly funded through MREFC, with some receiving support from the Research and Related Activities Account. Concerns about project management and prioritization led to hearings in Congress, where the NSF Director discussed new guidelines for financial oversight. The Plan establishes new guidelines for oversight of financial and business functions, including a Deputy Director for Large Facility Projects responsible for managing guidelines and procedures, maintaining lines of authority, and providing project management training for NSF staff. There is debate over the selection of major research facility projects for funding. Anita K. Jones testified before the Subcommittee on Research about these issues. Anita K. Jones, Vice Chair of the National Science Board, discussed the prioritization process for selecting major facility projects, involving the NSF and the community. The NSB reviews the need for the facility, research enabled, construction and operation plans, and budget estimates before making decisions. Subcommittee members raised concerns about maintaining clear records of spending activities in the MREFC account and differentiating between construction and operation costs. The Subcommittee emphasized the need for internal mechanisms to prevent the combining of MREFC and RRA funds. A draft report by the NSF's Office of Inspector General highlighted limitations in the current policy for major research equipment projects, lack of guidelines for financial reviews, and inadequate direction on addressing potential cost overruns. The report also pointed out that NSF's policies did not provide clear directives for tracking the total cost of major research facilities through all project stages. NSF's policies did not fully account for costs of major research facilities in financial reports, leading to inconsistencies in tracking costs and funding sources. OIG recommended NSF to revise policies in line with FY2002 appropriation bill directives. Congress requested NAS to review NSF's management of large facility projects, offering recommendations to strengthen the process in a January 2004 report. The National Science Foundation was directed to implement a review process for large facility projects in 2004. A lack of support for idea-generating activities and funding for planning and design was identified. In 2012, concerns about management and accountability for Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) projects were raised in a House Subcommittee hearing. Testimony from the Project Director for IceCube indicated improvements in management practices and increased confidence in the process. The director of project management ensures proper systems are in place. Cora B. Marrett, Deputy Director of NSF, emphasized the importance of oversight in project planning, construction, and funding. External review committees evaluate management capabilities and the need for effective techniques. Project Management Control Systems are crucial for determining construction schedules and funding profiles. The project manager needs to effectively monitor the technical and financial status of the project during construction. The Large Facilities Manual outlines the review process for large facility research projects, including evaluation criteria such as project definition, partnerships, and project management plans. The MREFC Panel submits recommendations to the NSF Director regarding the project's importance, eligibility, and readiness. The Director makes project selections based on information strength, balance among fields, and leveraging funds. NSB approves projects for future funding and prioritizes them annually. Projects not approved or not construction-ready are returned for additional work. The 2012 NSF Facility Plan was presented to the NSB, covering projects in various stages from readiness to completion. Projects can be resubmitted for future budget requests, but approval does not guarantee funding. The Plan includes support for research infrastructure, operational facilities, and outlines NSF's goals and strategies. The 2012 NSF Facility Plan outlines goals and strategies for selecting, managing, and overseeing large facility projects. It includes detailed procedures for termination or renewal and a multi-stage development process. NSF has designated four project evolution phases and prioritizes projects that will transform research in science and engineering. The 2012 Facility Plan outlines the team approach and cooperation between staff for large facility projects. The NSF Program Manager has primary responsibility for project management and ensuring staff have necessary skills. The Rare Symmetry Violating Processes Project (RSVP) was initially approved for funding by the NSB. The Rare Symmetry Violating Processes Project (RSVP) was approved for funding in 2000 but faced cost overruns during the design phase. After an evaluation, the project was terminated in 2005 due to potential loss of research opportunities. The 2011 Large Facilities Manual discusses the termination of large facilities by NSF when their scientific priority decreases. Decisions require extensive community input and may involve transferring ownership to other entities. It is the responsibility of NSF to periodically review their facilities portfolio for appropriate support. The NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account receives $196.2 million in the FY2013 budget request, supporting the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment. NSF emphasizes the importance of modern research infrastructure for maintaining U.S. leadership in science and engineering. The NSF's MREFC account in the FY2013 budget request prioritizes ongoing and NSB-approved projects with potential to advance scientific understanding. The request includes funding for NEON, AdvLIGO, ATST, and OOI, but not for ALMA. Tighter standards for funding have been implemented by NSF in this account. The NSF's MREFC account in the FY2013 budget request has tighter standards for funding, including a \"no cost overrun\" policy for major projects. Projects must be transformative in nature and cost estimates must include contingencies. Any cost increase during construction will result in scope reduction. Projects funded through MREFC undergo major cost and schedule reviews as per NSF guidelines. The MREFC account undergoes major cost and schedule reviews as required by NSF guidelines, with funding levels provided for current and future projects."
