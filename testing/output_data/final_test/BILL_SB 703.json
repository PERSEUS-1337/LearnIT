    "title": "SB 703",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10295.35 of the Public Contract Code prohibits state agencies from entering into contracts over $100,000 with contractors who discriminate based on gender identity in employee benefits. This includes employee health plans that do not comply with specific codes. Contractors must comply with confidentiality requirements for employee benefit requests and documentation under specific conditions within the state, on state-owned property outside the state, or when working on a state contract elsewhere in the United States. Waivers for contractor requirements may be granted under specific circumstances: when only one contractor is available, in emergencies endangering public health or safety, or if compliance conflicts with grant terms after a good faith attempt to change them. The contractor provides wholesale water, power, or natural gas services if standard bidding is not practical. They must pay actual costs for benefits provided and certify compliance in contracts. The department or contracting agency enforces compliance with the section, and false certification results in contract penalties. Existing remedies can still apply. This section does not regulate local jurisdiction contracting practices. This section clarifies that federal laws take precedence over state laws. If federal law invalidates any part of this code, the rest remains in effect. Section 10295.35 of the Public Contract Code does not give new enforcement authority to the Department of General Services or any contracting agency. SEC. 3. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
