    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Endangered Salmon Predation Prevention Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of restoring healthy salmon and steelhead runs in the lower Columbia River, which are vital to the region's culture and economy. The Columbia River treaty tribes have significant rights related to these species, and efforts have been made by governments to assist in their recovery. One of the challenges facing salmonid populations is increased predation by marine mammals, such as California sea lions. The population of California sea lions has increased significantly in recent decades, with over 1,000 sea lions entering the lower Columbia River during the spring salmon run. The predation by sea lions at Bonneville dam has also increased, posing a threat to the salmonid population. Some sea lions have been unresponsive to hazing methods near the dam. The 1994 amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act established a process to address aggressive sea lion behavior near Bonneville dam. However, this process is not timely enough to protect threatened and endangered salmonids. An expedited procedure is urgently needed to remove California sea lions to safeguard the passage of salmonids in the Columbia River. To protect endangered and threatened species of salmon, California sea lions on the Columbia River or its tributaries can be taken under SEC. 3. Amendment to Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 includes temporary authority to remove California sea lions in the Columbia River or its tributaries to protect threatened salmon species. The Secretary has 90 days to determine the permit for lethal taking of California sea lions in the Columbia River to protect salmon species. Public comments are allowed within this period, and the decision will be published in the Federal Register. If the Secretary determines that alternative measures to reduce sea lion predation on salmonid stocks do not adequately protect the threatened or endangered species, an eligible entity may apply for a permit authorizing the lethal taking of California sea lions. The Secretary must approve or deny the application within 30 days. Multiple permits may be issued. The Secretary may issue multiple permits to an eligible entity for lethal taking of California sea lions. Each permit is valid for up to one year and can only be used once every 14 days. Consultation with other eligible entities and relevant entities like the Corps of Engineers is required before issuing a permit. The Secretary may issue multiple permits to eligible entities for lethal taking of California sea lions, with each permit valid for up to one year and allowing the lethal taking of up to 10 sea lions. A report on the implementation of the permits and their impact on Columbia River salmonid stocks and the California sea lion population must be published annually by January 31. The annual limit for lethal taking of California sea lions is one percent of the annual potential biological removal level. A sea lion can only be taken if it has preyed upon salmonid stocks in the Columbia River. The State of Washington and Oregon may delegate permit authority to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for administering permits related to preventing California sea lions from preying on salmonid stocks in the Columbia River. Consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and other relevant federal agencies is required for making determinations on nonlethal alternative measures. The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission may be designated to administer permit authority for preventing California sea lions from preying on salmonid stocks. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to permit issuance for a 3-year period. The Secretary cannot issue permits after 5 years or when lethal removal authority is no longer needed for salmonid protection. The Secretary of Commerce may recommend additional legislation to address marine mammal predation on threatened or endangered fish species. Eligible entities include states and tribes in the Pacific Northwest. Sense of Congress: Nonlethal methods should be used to prevent predation of listed salmonid stocks by California sea lions in the Columbia River. Permit holders with lethal removal authority should be trained in wildlife management. The Federal Government should support research for effective nonlethal alternatives."
