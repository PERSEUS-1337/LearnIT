    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal funding to states for cash assistance programs to very poor families with children. TANF replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program in 1996. The 1996 welfare reform law focused on moving non-employed single mothers from welfare to work. TANF aims to end dependence on government benefits by promoting job preparation and work. The work participation standard enforces this goal. The report discusses TANF's federal rules on work participation, trends in the work participation rate, and the engagement of non-employed TANF work-eligible individuals in welfare-to-work activities. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program aims to assist needy families with children, promote job preparation, work, and marriage, prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encourage two-parent families. States can use TANF funds for various activities to achieve these goals, including cash assistance, services, and other activities beyond traditional welfare benefits. States must also meet the maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement by spending on TANF-eligible families. In FY2015, $31.7 billion in federal TANF funds and state funds were used for various activities, including basic assistance, work programs, child care, tax credits, early childhood education, and child welfare services. Basic assistance accounted for $7.8 billion (25% of funds), while work programs totaled $2.1 billion (6.7% of funds). These activities represent a broader range than previous TANF predecessor programs. TANF funds can be used for a wide range of activities, including basic assistance, work programs, child care, tax credits, and early childhood education. The funds can support families with children, including those who are already working. A greater share of TANF recipients are working compared to those who received cash assistance under previous programs. State-funded expenditures can be used for any program providing services. The TANF program allows for a variety of activities and services to be funded, including basic assistance, work programs, child care, tax credits, and early childhood education. TANF funds can support families with children, even those who are already employed. State-funded expenditures can be allocated to different programs serving TANF-eligible families, making TANF more of a funding stream than a single program. The work participation standard applies to families receiving TANF or MOE-funded assistance, with \"assistance\" defined as benefits for basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. The TANF regulations define activities that do not constitute assistance, such as child care or transportation aid for working families, tax credits, and work subsidies. Short-term emergency payments are also not considered assistance. The work participation standard applies only to families receiving assistance, including ongoing cash assistance. Other benefits like food or housing assistance may also be considered. The TANF work participation standards are designed by states for individual recipients, with states determining exemptions, activities, and sanctions for noncompliance. Most states end benefits for families with noncompliant individuals, except for New York and California. While TANF aims to increase state flexibility, there are provisions to hold states accountable for meeting national goals. The TANF work participation standard sets numerical targets for families, with credits available for caseload reduction and excess state spending. States must calculate their work participation rate based on specific rules, including defining eligible families and activities. Failure to meet standards can result in penalties for states. States can avoid penalties for failing to meet work participation standards by claiming reasonable cause or entering a corrective compliance plan. Compliance within the plan's timeframe prevents penalties. Caseload reduction, whether from families leaving assistance faster or fewer new families joining, can help meet work participation standards. States receive credit for caseload reduction regardless of decreased need or increasing need in the state. The TANF caseload reduction credit allows states to reduce their work participation standard by one percentage point for each 1% decline in their caseload. States are credited for caseload declines from FY2005 to the most recent prior year, excluding reductions due to policy changes. States must provide HHS with gross caseload decline and policy change effects to determine the net caseload reduction credit. The TANF caseload reduction credit allows states to reduce their work participation standard based on net caseload declines from FY2005 through FY2014. The minimum work participation rate a state must achieve is determined by the percentage point credit received for caseload reduction. The credit has played a significant role historically, with changes in the base year for measuring caseload declines introduced by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Caseload declines were particularly sharp in the late 1990s, with a continued decrease at a slower rate after 2000. The TANF caseload reduction credit allows states to lower their work participation standard based on caseload declines from FY2005 through FY2014. Caseloads declined sharply in the late 1990s and continued to decrease at a slower rate after 2000. The caseload reduction credits were significant, with a cumulative decline exceeding 50% in the early 2000s. The credits were determined on a state-by-state basis and netted out policy changes. In FY2002, 21 states had a 50 percentage point credit, reducing their minimum work participation rate. The TANF caseload reduction credit allowed 21 states to lower their work participation standard by 50 percentage points, reducing the minimum WPR to 0%. Caseload declines were also seen in FY2007 and beyond, with caseload reduction credits frozen by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. States could receive credit for exceeding required spending under the TANF MOE. States can count extra state dollars spent on TANF-eligible families towards caseload reduction credits. This credit was rarely used until the DRA changed the measurement to caseload decline from FY2005. After this change, more states claimed the excess state spending credit, with 16 out of 45 states meeting the TANF work participation standard only because of this credit. The TANF work participation standard requires states to meet a higher standard for two-parent families, with the possibility of reducing it through caseload reduction credits. Before FY2007, states aided two-parent families in separate state programs, which were not initially included in the work participation rate calculation. The DRA changed this by including these families in the calculation, leading to adjustments in state programs. In response to changes in TANF regulations, many states now provide assistance to needy two-parent families through solely state-funded programs, separate from federal TANF and state MOE dollars. This allows states to exclude these families from the work participation rate calculation. Some states also use state-funded programs to assist other recipient categories, further excluding them from the calculation. The TANF work participation rate is determined by the percentage of families with a work-eligible individual engaged in work. To be included in the Work Participation Rate (WPR), families must have a work-eligible individual, typically adults or single minor parents receiving assistance for themselves and their children. Some parents or caregivers only receive assistance for their children, such as disabled parents on Supplemental Security Income. Immigrant noncitizen parents are often ineligible for TANF, but their citizen children may be eligible. Relative caregivers usually only receive benefits for the children in their care, making them \"child-only\" families excluded from the WPR calculation. In FY2015, 62% of families receiving TANF assistance had a work-eligible individual, but only 57% were included in the WPR calculation after disregards. To be counted in the WPR, individuals must participate in defined work activities for a minimum number of hours per week. The WPR requires individuals to participate in defined work activities for a minimum number of hours per week, with specific hour requirements for single parents and two-parent families. Federal law lists 12 activities that count toward the WPR, including employment, job training, and education related to employment. The Federal TANF law limits the counting of pre-employment activities towards the TANF WPR. Job search and readiness count for up to 12 weeks in a 12-month period, while vocational educational training counts for up to 12 months in a recipient's lifetime. Other education and training is also counted under limited circumstances, with specific criteria for teen parents and adult recipients. Under AFDC, federal rules dictated how much earnings a family could have to remain eligible for benefits. States disregarded some earnings when determining eligibility, but after 12 months on a job, only $90 of earnings per month was disregarded. This led to benefits being reduced dollar for dollar for any earnings over $90 per month. States experimented with different earnings disregards under waivers before the 1996 welfare law. TANF has no federal rules on earnings disregard, allowing states to implement various forms to support families with earnings to stay on the rolls longer. The TANF program allows states to implement policies that support families with earnings to stay on the rolls longer. Earnings supplement programs provide benefits to working parents separate from regular TANF cash assistance, typically paying a small monthly benefit. Some programs target welfare leavers who remain employed, while others support working parents with no necessary. Earnings supplement programs provide benefits to working parents separate from regular TANF cash assistance, typically paying a small monthly benefit for up to one year. California, for example, offers a $10 work incentive nutrition benefit to all working parents in the SNAP program. These programs are considered assistance and count towards a state's TANF work participation standard. The national TANF Work Participation Rate (WPR) for FY2002 through FY2015 shows an increase from around 30% to an estimated 48% in FY2015. Participation is divided into three categories: unsubsidized employment in regular TANF programs, employment subsidy programs, and welfare-to-work activities. The national TANF Work Participation Rate (WPR) increased from around 30% in FY2002 to an estimated 48% in FY2015. Participation is categorized into unsubsidized employment in regular TANF programs, employment subsidy programs, and welfare-to-work activities. Engagement solely in unsubsidized employment accounted for an average of half of all work participation from FY2002 to FY2011, with recent increases in unsubsidized employment, particularly in employment subsidy programs. The establishment of California's earnings supplement program caused over half of the increase in the national TANF Work Participation Rate from FY2013 to FY2015. Participation in unsubsidized employment accounted for 64% of all TANF WPR credits in FY2015, while other activities made up 36%. Participation in welfare-to-work activities has been low among non-employed work-eligible individuals throughout TANF history. The monthly average number of TANF work-eligible individuals not in unsubsidized jobs and their reported participation in welfare-to-work activities is low. Less than 1 in 4 non-employed recipients were engaged in these activities, with a decline in participation since FY2011. In FY2015, 143,000 TANF work-eligible individuals were not employed. In FY2015, about 143,000 TANF work-eligible individuals were not employed and participating in welfare-to-work activities. The activities were divided into pre-employment and supportive work activities, with more participation in pre-employment activities. Job search and readiness were the most common activity, with approximately 68,000 individuals participating monthly. Supported work activities included work experience, community service, subsidized employment, on-the-job training, and providing child care. TANF, enacted over 20 years ago, has seen declining cash assistance caseloads and an increase in working families. The work participation standard encourages states to continue pursuing these goals. However, there are concerns about low participation rates in welfare-to-work activities among those not employed. The caseload reduction credit in TANF incentivizes states to focus on reducing welfare dependency by moving away from measuring participation rates to outcomes. The late 1990s saw a decline in caseloads, an increase in work among single mothers, and a decrease in child poverty. This shift towards employment could be seen as a successful policy in reducing welfare dependency. Since 2000, child poverty has increased, single mothers' employment gains have eroded, and the population meeting TANF's financial need tests has grown. Caseload declines have raised concerns that the program is not meeting the needs of poor families, with fewer eligible families receiving benefits over the years. In 2012, only 28% of eligible families received assistance under TANF. The George W. Bush Administration proposed eliminating the caseload reduction credit under TANF and replacing it with a credit for employed leavers. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation multiple times to swap an employment credit for the caseload reduction credit, while House-passed TANF reauthorization bills aimed to retain the caseload reduction credit. The excess spending credit was viewed as an incentive for states to increase their investment in TANF-related activities. The excess spending credit in TANF allows states to count nonfederal spending on various activities towards their MOE. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of this incentive. The ability of states to include individuals in unsubsidized jobs towards meeting work participation standards also raises policy issues. The TANF work participation standard raises policy issues as states expanded assistance to working families in the early years of welfare reform. Research on pre-1996 welfare reform experiments showed that programs disregarding a greater share of earnings when recipients became employed were successful in moving recipients from welfare to work and improving family incomes. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of earnings supplement programs providing small amounts of aid to working families after reaching the end of eligibility for regular assistance programs. The TANF work participation standard raises policy issues as states expanded assistance to working families in the early years of welfare reform. Research on pre-1996 welfare reform experiments showed successful programs moving recipients from welfare to work by disregarding a greater share of earnings. However, there is a lack of research on the efficacy of earnings supplement programs providing aid to working families after the end of eligibility for regular assistance programs. Policymakers are interested in strategies to increase engagement in welfare-to-work programs, as highlighted in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 and a 2014 Government Accountability Office report on promoting wider use of employment-focused approaches for TANF assistance recipients. The Department of Health and Human Services funded a study to understand recipients with zero hours of engagement in welfare-to-work activities. Questions arise about the expected rate of engagement, focus activities, performance measurement changes, and program structure changes to increase engagement. Limited research addresses these questions, with most information coming from pre-1996 welfare reform experiments. The research from pre-1996 welfare reform experiments may not be applicable to current policies and economic context. States engaged at most 1 in 4 non-employed work-eligible individuals in welfare-to-work activities from FY2002 to FY2015. MDRC warned in 1995 that the participation rates contemplated in the 1996 welfare reform law were higher than any rate achieved. The 1996 welfare reform law resulted in higher participation rates than previous demonstrations. Current research is lacking on what engagement rate indicates a successful welfare-to-work program. There have been proposals to expand the types of activities that can count towards the work participation standard. The pursuit of a GED for single parents with pre-school children does not count towards the TANF work participation rate. There are proposals to allow GED pursuit to count and to extend the one-year limit on vocational education training. Past research questioning the effectiveness of education and training programs is outdated, and new \"career pathways\" programs have been developed. Recent interest in subsidized employment programs has emerged, stemming from states' implementation of such programs under the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF). This interest raises questions about the effectiveness of past education and training programs in improving employment outcomes for TANF recipients. Employment programs implemented under the TANF Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) in FY2009-FY2010 were not limited to TANF cash assistance recipients. Research on transitional jobs programs in Philadelphia and New York showed increased incomes for participants but limited long-term employment impacts. Evaluations of subsidized employment pilot projects are currently being conducted by HHS and DOL. The HHS and DOL are evaluating subsidized employment pilot projects. Policy debates on welfare-to-work often focus on the work participation standard and ways to engage non-employed recipients. One suggestion is to modify the standard to exclude caseload reduction and unsubsidized employment as credits. Another idea is to shift to an \"outcome\" measure, evaluating programs based on recipient employment status. The 2014 GAO report found that while some state and local programs are using promising approaches to move TANF recipients into employment, there is a lack of incentives for many agencies to adopt and test such approaches. This suggests a missed opportunity for increasing engagement in welfare-to-work activities. The 2015 HHS-funded report highlighted funding limitations in TANF programs, leading states to focus resources on easily employable individuals. This strategy may neglect hard-to-employ TANF clients who require more intensive support. States receive fixed TANF funding annually, which limits resources regardless of work participation outcomes. The state receives the same federal funding whether it engages non-employed recipients in activities or not. Performance measures used to enforce national policy objectives can lead to unintended behaviors and responses that may not efficiently further the true objective of TANF programs. The response to performance measures in TANF programs may lead to dysfunctional outcomes, such as using earnings supplement programs to meet work participation standards. Setting arbitrary national standards without considering state capabilities could hinder engagement in activities. Congress could explore alternative program structures to incentivize states to assist non-employed cash assistance recipients. Congress could explore creating a separate program with dedicated funding to provide employment services and work opportunities for non-employed cash assistance recipients. Previous programs like the Welfare-to-Work grant program have shown increased service capacity and a focus on serving non-custodial parents. The ECF added to TANF by ARRA provided funding for basic assistance, short-term benefits, and subsidized employment. The TANF subsidized employment programs were created to provide work opportunities for cash assistance recipients. The TANF work participation standard measures state engagement in work activities and reinforces the goal of work participation for welfare recipients. It sets a minimum standard that states must meet, with performance measures applied at the state level. The TANF statute sets performance measures for state engagement in work activities, requiring a specified percentage of families to be engaged in work for a minimum number of hours. States can receive credits for caseload reduction and spending in excess of the MOE requirement. States may receive extra caseload reduction credits for families assisted by spending in excess of MOE. Achieving caseload reduction of 25% reduces the state's work participation standard by 25 percentage points. The work participation rate is computed by dividing the number of families engaged in work by the total number of families included in the calculation. Families receiving cash assistance are included in the TANF work participation rate calculation, with certain exclusions such as those without a work-eligible individual or under specific circumstances like caring for a child under one year old. Families receiving cash assistance are included in the TANF work participation rate calculation, with certain exclusions such as those without a work-eligible individual or under specific circumstances like caring for a child under one year old. States have the option to exempt additional individuals and families from work requirements, but they will still be included in the calculation of the work participation rate. Work-eligible individuals must engage in specific countable activities to meet the requirements. Work-eligible individuals must participate in specific activities during a month to be considered engaged in work and count toward the work participation standard. Federal law lists 12 categories of activities creditable toward meeting the TANF work participation standard, including education and rehabilitative activities. Pre-employment activities like job search, rehabilitation, and education have limitations on how long they can count towards the work participation standard. Family members must engage in work activities for a minimum number of hours per week to be considered participants. The required hours vary based on family composition, with an average of at least 30 hours per week for most families, but 20 hours per week for single parents with a child under six. At age six, individuals must engage in work activities for a state to consider them participants, with varying hours required based on family composition. Table A-3 outlines core and supplemental activities that count towards meeting the participation standard. Core activities include employment, job search, community service, and vocational training, while supplemental activities include job skills training and education related to employment. HHS regulations specify that only actual hours of participation count towards meeting the work participation standard, with an excused absence policy in place. States receive credit for all hours of paid activities, including holidays and paid leave. Unpaid activities allow for up to 10 holidays and 80 hours of other excused absences per year, with daily supervision required. Teen parents without a high school diploma have special rules for work participation calculation. Teen parents without a high school diploma can be considered engaged in work if they are in education related to employment for at least 20 hours per week or making progress towards a secondary school program. However, their participation may not count if the state exceeds a cap on education participation. The education cap limits vocational training and teen parents in education to 30% of those considered engaged in work. Table A-4 displays families included in the work participation rate calculations for FY2015 based on required hours for full federal participation. The data used in this report to examine TANF participation in work activities are from the TANF national data files, which states are required to collect monthly and report to HHS. This data provides information at the family and individual recipient levels, including demographic and economic data. States are also required to report information on the average weekly hours of engagement in each of the 12 countable TANF work activities for FY2015. The TANF national data files provide information on the average weekly hours of engagement in 12 countable work activities. States may report engagement in other activities not countable towards the TANF work participation standard, but this data was excluded from the analysis due to lack of information for FY2014 and FY2015. The estimates are subject to sampling error and potential nonsampling error due to miscoded characteristics. State-to-state variation in reporting practices could also impact data quality and comparisons across states. The state-reported data for TANF work participation may not capture all activities, such as job search beyond certain limits. Non-reporting of credible activities was found to be minimal in a special data collection in FY2011. States collect and report data monthly for HHS to determine compliance with TANF's work participation standard. The TANF national data files may not accurately reflect compliance with work participation standards, as HHS uses a different version of the data. Earnings supplement programs are not separately identified in the data, so criteria were used to estimate their impact on work participation rates. The TANF national data files identify families in separate state programs based on specific criteria. Separate state programs were used before FY2007 to assist two-parent families, and earnings supplement programs were only identified for FY2007 and later years."
