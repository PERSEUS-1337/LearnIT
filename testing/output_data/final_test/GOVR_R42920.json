    "content": "The federal government owns 635 million acres of land in the US, with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) owning 247.5 million acres and the Forest Service (FS) owning 193.0 million acres. BLM manages public lands for various purposes like grazing, recreation, timber, and mineral exploration. FS manages national forests for similar purposes. Debate surrounds recreation on these lands, with issues of access, regulation, resource integrity, and overuse. The growing demand for recreational opportunities on federal lands and waters, particularly in western states and urban areas, has led to an increase in recreational visits. Various federal agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service, manage these lands and face debates on access, regulation, and balancing motorized versus nonmotorized activities. The FY2013 DOI budget documents reported a total of 478 million annual recreational visits to DOI managed lands, including 57.8 million visits to BLM lands and 201.6 million visits to National Forest System lands. Access to federal lands for recreational purposes is seen as crucial for public health, land management support, and economic stability. Advocates push for increased access to BLM and FS lands to address limited access in some areas and to protect the ecological integrity of federal lands from environmental harm due to recreational use. Motorized recreation on BLM and FS lands has evolved over the last half century, including activities like snowmobiling, mountain biking, and off-highway vehicles. Controversy surrounds the use of OHVs on federal lands, with lawsuits challenging their management. Supporters argue that OHVs provide outdoor recreation opportunities for various groups. OHV supporters argue that these vehicles offer outdoor recreation opportunities for the disabled, seniors, and those with mobility limitations, provide access to remote natural areas, bring economic benefits to communities, and increase winter season access. Critics raise concerns about environmental impacts such as damage to wildlife habitat, pollution, and noise, as well as the negative impact on nonmotorized recreation and the overall outdoor experience. The increasing popularity of OHV ridership has led to challenges for law enforcement, property owners, and riders as available land for OHVs decreases. Government agencies are identifying lands for OHV use while limiting or prohibiting use in other areas. Enforcement, planning, and management challenges have been documented in a 2009 GAO report. Development has also reduced access to private lands for OHVs. State legislative efforts are being made to address OHV management and law enforcement issues. State legislative efforts focus on OHV management and law enforcement, including safety, wildlife habitat protection, registration requirements, and collaborative enforcement approaches. Two executive orders define and guide OHV use on federal lands, establishing policies to protect resources and promote user safety. The executive orders aim to protect resources, promote user safety, and minimize conflicts among various land uses by regulating off-highway vehicle (OHV) use on federal lands. Agencies are directed to designate areas and trails for OHV use, monitor effects, and amend designations as needed. Military, emergency, and law enforcement vehicles are excluded from OHV restrictions, with authority to close areas if significant damage is caused.

Agencies are directed to designate areas and trails for OHV use, monitor effects, and amend designations as needed. Military, emergency, and law enforcement vehicles are excluded from OHV restrictions, with authority to close areas if significant damage is caused. BLM and FS managers formulate guidance on land uses, including OHV use, through regulations, national policies, and area-specific decisions. The BLM and FS jointly manage OHV operations on their lands in some cases, promoting consistency and public understanding of guidance. However, complete consistency on vehicular travel management is difficult due to separate authorities governing BLM and FS lands. Congress has addressed motorized recreation on federal lands through legislation and oversight hearings. Measures introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to establish new land units with both BLM and FS lands for governing motorized recreation. The 112th Congress introduced legislation to establish new land units with both BLM and FS lands for governing motorized recreation, including the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area in California. A House subcommittee hearing in 2011 focused on opportunities for recreation on federal land, particularly OHV recreation on BLM and FS lands. Issues discussed included OHV use on federal lands, agency planning processes, achieving balance among recreational users, and the economic impact of OHV use on nearby communities. The 2009 GAO report on OHV use on agency lands included recommendations to the BLM and FS for providing OHV opportunities while protecting resources. BLM lands are used for diverse forms of recreation, including hunting, fishing, visiting cultural and natural sites, birdwatching, hiking, picnicking, camping, boating, mountain biking, and off-road vehicle driving. The challenge of managing different types of recreation on BLM lands has increased due to the growing and diverse nature of recreation. The challenge of managing different types of recreation, such as low impact (e.g., hiking) and high impact (e.g., OHV) uses, has increased on BLM lands. Conflict arises between recreation and energy development interests, particularly regarding motorized OHV use in areas like Canyonlands in Utah and the Western Mojave Desert in California. Environmental concerns about harm to natural and cultural resources from OHV use clash with opposition to restrictions from motorized user groups. OHV use on BLM lands may conflict with other types of recreation like hiking. Enforcement of OHV regulations may be hindered by factors like remoteness and inadequate resources. BLM designates public lands as open, limited, or closed to OHV use. OHV use on BLM lands is categorized as prohibited on 13.1 million acres, limited on 146.6 million acres, and open on 66.0 million acres. The remaining undesignated acres, mostly in Alaska, have no restrictions on motorized use. BLM has supplementary rules for specific areas like Oregon and Washington, with revisions made in 2010 to address OHV use in certain locations. Additionally, BLM has issued guidance on transportation on its lands, including the National Management Strategy for Motorized Off-Highway Vehicle Use on Public Lands in 2001. The National Management Strategy for Motorized Off-Highway Vehicle Use on Public Lands aims to guide land managers in resolving OHV issues, promote consistency in decision-making, reduce conflicts among users, and update OHV regulations. In 2011, BLM issued a manual on travel and transportation management, followed by a related handbook in 2012 to improve travel planning and management at field offices. The BLM's National Training Center has also started a training program on travel and transportation planning for field units. BLM manages transportation on its lands through Comprehensive Travel and Transportation Management, with goals of providing varied routes for access and recreation while protecting sensitive areas. 142 BLM areas have completed travel management plans covering 32.5 million acres, with plans to cover 231 million acres by 2020. Implementation involves issuing maps, signs, and educating land users. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages transportation on its lands through Comprehensive Travel and Transportation Management, issuing maps, signs, and educating land users. BLM's plans involve constructing, reconstructing, and maintaining roads and trails, monitoring impacts, rehabilitating damaged areas, and enforcing restrictions. OHV designations are made on an area-by-area basis and have been contentious. BLM is updating land use plans to address issues like OHV use, with recent resource management plans in Utah limiting cross-country OHV travel to only 0.2% of total acreage. BLM plans largely limit OHV use to designated routes, with only 0.2% of total acreage open to cross-country travel. 31 new Special Recreation Management Areas will be established for intensive management of specific recreational activities and natural resources. OHV use is considered in ongoing plan revisions across the West, including in Nevada and California, as well as in completed plan revisions in New Mexico. BLM released a report on procedures for issuing special use permits for OHV racing on its lands on November 19, 2010. The BLM released a report on procedures for issuing special use permits for OHV racing on its lands following a deadly accident in August 2010. Agency actions included investigating the accident, evaluating safety measures for spectators, and increasing staff presence at motorized races. Congress is concerned about safety provisions in permits, enforcement by BLM, penalties for violators, and the role of BLM staff at racing events. BLM developed planned actions in response to GAO recommendations. BLM responded to GAO recommendations by developing performance measures and time frames for OHV goals, creating a travel management action plan with an implementation schedule, updating state directors on planning progress, and improving communication with the public through manuals and handbooks. BLM responded to GAO recommendations by developing performance measures and time frames for OHV goals, creating a travel management action plan with an implementation schedule, updating state directors on planning progress, and improving communication with the public through manuals and handbooks. In response to the GAO recommendation to enhance law enforcement of OHV use, BLM examined fines for OHV related violations and expressed an intent to seek changes where fines are inconsistent or insufficient. No legislation pertaining to motorized recreation on BLM lands has been introduced in the 113 th Congress as of January 16, 2013. In the 112 th Congress, no general legislation on OHV activities on BLM lands was introduced. However, various measures in the 112 th Congress would have affected OHV use in BLM areas, such as bills establishing recreation areas or OHV areas. For example, S. 173 would have established the Sacramento River National Recreation Area in California with restrictions on motorized vehicles, and H.R. 6286 would have designated the Clear Creek National Recreation Area. In the 113th Congress, various bills were introduced to address motorized vehicle use in protected areas. For example, H.R. 6286 designated the Clear Creek National Recreation Area in California for motorized vehicles with a user fee program. S. 138, the California Desert Protection Act of 2011, governed conservation and recreation in the California Desert Conservation Area, including off-highway vehicle use. Other bills aimed to expand BLM protected areas and limit motorized vehicles to designated roads and trails. The Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands of the House Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on bills related to conveyances of BLM land for recreation purposes. Examples include H.R. 3815 and S. 617 for the county of Elko, Nevada, and H.R. 6072, S. 1475, and S. 3346 for Clark County, Nevada. Measures aimed to establish parks for OHV recreation and rename areas for off-highway vehicle use. Additionally, a provision of P.L. 112-239 addressed the expansion of a Marine Corps training range in California onto BLM lands. The provision in the bill would limit funding for the transfer of land or development of a new training range in California until the Secretary of the Navy reports to Congress on the impact on OHV users. National forests managed by the USDA Forest Service allow various recreational activities, including OHV use, which is growing rapidly. Conflicts arise between different uses such as timber harvesting, OHV use, and birdwatching. Decisions on land use in National Forests are made in management plans, but plan revisions have been delayed. Attention has been on motorized recreation due to its impacts on other values. Despite federal guidance, not all forest plans have designated areas for OHV use, leading to varying local practices. The FS manages 193 million acres of land, with concerns about unmanaged recreation increasing. In 2004, the FS Chief identified unmanaged recreation as a threat to national forests and grasslands, specifically mentioning the increasing use of off-highway vehicles (OHVs). Regulations were finalized in 2005 to require forest plans to designate a system of roads, trails, and areas for motorized vehicle use, prohibiting OHVs and other motorized vehicles outside the designated system. The regulations aim to ensure safe and efficient travel and the protection of national forest system lands. Vehicle use is allowed and identified on a motor vehicle use map (MVUM). Management of over-snow vehicles is optional. MVUMs based on new regulations were completed for 82% of FS lands. 52% of national forest lands were open to OHV use, with opinions divided on the impact of travel management regulations. Some groups requested the end of snowmobile exemption from regulations, but the request was denied. The Forest Service denied a request to end the snowmobile exemption from travel management regulations in March 2011. Legal action ensued with a lawsuit filed in November 2012. Conflicts persist over OHV regulations, with some arguing they penalize law-abiding users. The FS finalized new land management regulations in April 2012, but did not specifically address transportation planning. The Forest Service has faced challenges with travel management plans, particularly regarding road and trail closures. Some plans have been criticized for being either too restrictive or not restrictive enough. There are ongoing tensions over OHV regulations, with disagreements over county primacy in determining road access to federal lands. The FS has implemented a Route and Area Designation Implementation Guide in response to GAO recommendations for a nationwide strategy for OHV use. The Forest Service implemented the Route and Area Designation Implementation Guide in 2010. By December 2012, they were developing performance measures for OHV goals and planned to implement them by 2014. To improve communication with the public, an interactive travel map was established on their website. They also examined fines for OHV violations and are considering a system-wide standard for fine amounts. Legislation in the 113th Congress addresses motorized recreation on trails in Idaho. In the 112th Congress, various measures were introduced regarding motorized recreation in national forests. Some bills aimed to restrict OHV activities by designating areas as wilderness or Special Management Areas. For example, S. 1635 proposed the Sheep Mountain Special Management Area, prohibiting motor vehicle use. Another bill, S. 3400, sought to establish the Hermosa Creek Special Management Area in the San Juan National Forest, limiting motorized vehicles to designated roads and trails. Hearings were held on these bills in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. S. 268 and H.R. 4109 proposed restrictions on motorized vehicles in specific areas, with limited access to designated roads and trails. The bills also aimed to establish Special Management Areas and OHV areas in national forests, with varying provisions on motorized vehicle use. The Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests held a hearing on S. 268 in 2011. The bill aimed to establish OHV areas in the forest with motorized vehicles permitted only on designated roads and trails. It also proposed the creation of the Condor Ridge Scenic Area with limited vehicle access. Additionally, the bill included provisions for designated uses on certain roads and trails, adding them to the forest's MVUM. The Secretary of Agriculture was to report on the feasibility of constructing new trails open to specific vehicles. The Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands held a hearing on the bill. Section 433 of another bill sought to prohibit certain travel management regulations in California. The bill aimed to establish OHV areas in the forest with motorized vehicles permitted only on designated roads and trails. It included provisions for designated uses on certain roads and trails, adding them to the forest's MVUM. The bill also proposed the creation of the Condor Ridge Scenic Area with limited vehicle access. The Secretary of Agriculture was to report on the feasibility of constructing new trails open to specific vehicles. Section 433 of another bill sought to prohibit certain travel management regulations in California until specific planning actions were taken. Hearings were held to address the Forest Service's implementation of the regulations, focusing on access to national forests, impacts of closing roads and trails to OHV use, and the travel management planning process. Testimony was received from various stakeholders. The FS and BLM manage motorized recreation on their lands under common authorities, with each agency having its own regulations and policies. They determine OHV use through planning processes and develop management plans or updates. The FS creates motor vehicle use maps, while BLM addresses motorized recreation through travel and transportation plans covering all modes of travel and public access. Recent Congresses have addressed motorized use on BLM and FS lands through legislation focused on specific areas, creating OHV recreation areas and establishing restrictions on where motorized vehicles can be used. Some bills also aimed to convey certain BLM lands for motorized recreation. The 112th Congress addressed motorized recreation in areas with special designations, such as wilderness, and held oversight hearings on BLM and FS lands. The 113th Congress may consider legislation on motorized recreation, including addressing OHV use on specific lands and broader programmatic legislation. There is a need for broader legislation focused on motorized recreation on federal lands, covering access, impacts, and funding. Congress may assess agency management through oversight hearings and address funding levels for OHV management."
