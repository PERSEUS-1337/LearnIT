    "content": "The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) within the USDA is responsible for protecting animal and plant health from agricultural pests and diseases, which is crucial for food safety, trade, and the agricultural industry. Disease outbreaks among animals can have negative consequences for the U.S. agricultural system and international trade. The USDA has authority to monitor animal health on farms to prevent the spread of diseases to human populations. An April 2009 outbreak of influenza A(H1N1), initially called \"swine flu,\" raised concerns. The USDA has confirmed that there is no evidence of the 2009-H1N1 virus in U.S. swine. The virus is not a foodborne illness and is not transmitted by consumption of pork products. The Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) allows USDA to take actions to prevent outbreaks of diseases in animals. The Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) authorizes USDA to take necessary actions to prevent the introduction or spread of pests or diseases of livestock, including holding, seizing, quarantining, or destroying animals in interstate commerce. USDA can also act in emergencies to protect U.S. livestock by seizing, treating, or destroying animals if a threat is present. The Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) authorizes USDA to take necessary actions to prevent the spread of threats by making inspections and seizures with a warrant showing probable cause. USDA has broad authority for detection, control, and prevention of outbreaks of animal diseases and pests, including diagnostic testing of animals at various points of concentration. The Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) and the Plant Protection Act (PPA) give USDA authority to prevent the spread of threats by making inspections and seizures with a warrant. AHPA focuses on animals, implementing a voluntary animal tracking system, while PPA focuses on plants, regulating plant pests and noxious weeds to protect agriculture, environment, and economy. The Plant Protection Act (PPA) gives USDA authority to regulate plant pests and noxious weeds in interstate commerce. It allows USDA to prohibit movement of plants and plant products to prevent the spread of pests. APHIS uses the PPA to monitor genetically engineered crops for potential negative effects on agriculture. USDA has the authority to hold, quarantine, treat, or destroy plants, plant pests, or noxious weeds in interstate commerce to prevent their dissemination. Remedial measures can be imposed, but less drastic alternatives must be considered first. Emergency authority under the Plant Protection Act allows USDA to act swiftly in response to threats. Under its emergency authority, USDA can take swift action if state measures are inadequate to eradicate plant pests or noxious weeds. If an extraordinary emergency exists, USDA may hold, seize, quarantine, treat, or destroy infested plants or premises. However, less drastic alternatives must be considered first to prevent the spread of new or uncommon plant pests or noxious weeds in the United States. The USDA has oversight authority related to farm activities and food safety through statutes like the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The Agricultural Marketing Service oversees programs for standardization and marketing of agricultural products, including issuing marketing orders that bind processors and producers. Marketing orders issued by the USDA under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act may include terms and conditions regulating the quality, packaging, and inspection of commodities like milk, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. These orders create legally binding requirements related to food quality and safety for products in interstate or foreign commerce. USDA enforces these orders to ensure compliance with the regulations. The USDA enforces marketing orders under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act to regulate commodities like milk, fruits, vegetables, and nuts in interstate or foreign commerce. The USDA has enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of these orders, including conducting investigations and hearings, and referring violations to the Department of Justice for enforcement. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 authorizes the USDA to develop regulations related to agricultural markets and standards, allowing for the inspection, certification, and identification of agricultural products in interstate commerce. The USDA has voluntary programs for agricultural producers to certify product quality. One example is the AMS's Good Agricultural Practices and Good Handling Practices Audit Verification Program. The USDA focuses on inspections during production and has authority to regulate on-farm activities. The USDA has authority to regulate on-farm activities related to food safety, even though some argue that these activities may not be directly linked to interstate commerce. This has raised questions about USDA's ability to implement programs on farms before products enter commerce. The USDA has regulatory authority over farms, even those that are self-sufficient and do not sell their products. This authority stems from Congress's power under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, allowing regulation of activities related to interstate commerce. The Supreme Court's ruling in Wickard v. Filburn expanded Congress's ability to regulate economic activities related to interstate commerce. The case involved a farmer challenging a penalty for growing excess wheat on his farm, arguing it was outside the scope of interstate commerce. The Court held that even activities like homegrown wheat production could be regulated if they had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. The Supreme Court's ruling in Wickard v. Filburn expanded Congress's authority to regulate economic activities related to interstate commerce. The relevant on-farm statutes, such as the AHPA and the PPA, allow for regulation of agricultural products in interstate commerce, including items still on the farm. These statutes also authorize USDA to inspect agricultural products on farms to control pests and diseases that could impact agricultural commerce. The USDA has the authority to regulate animals, plants, and agricultural products on farms to control pests and diseases that could affect agricultural commerce."
