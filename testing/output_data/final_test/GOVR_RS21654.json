Some argue that these religious schools are unfairly blamed for fostering anti-U.S. sentiments, while others believe they serve a crucial role in countries with poor educational infrastructure and high poverty rates. Madrasas are educational institutions offering instruction in Islamic subjects. They historically served as higher studies institutions compared to rudimentary Quran schools called kuttab. The term \"madrasa\" is now used broadly to refer to any school promoting an Islamic-based curriculum, with variations in meaning across different countries. Madrasa, Islamic religious schools, have been around for centuries, with the first established madrasa in Baghdad during the eleventh century A.D. These schools aimed to prepare future Islamic religious scholars through religious education and rote memorization. During the 1970s, madrasas experienced a revival in interest in religious studies and Islamist politics, particularly in Iran and Pakistan. In the 1980s, madrasas in Afghanistan and Pakistan received increased financial support from various countries, including the United States, European governments, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf states, as they were seen as recruiting grounds for anti-Soviet mujahedin fighters. This support led to the formation of the Taliban movement in the early 1990s, consisting of Afghan Islamic clerics and students who had studied in madrasas and advocated a strict form of Islam similar to Wahhabism. Madrasas advocate a strict form of Islam similar to Wahhabism. In many Muslim countries, madrasas are becoming more popular due to rising costs and shortages of public schools. Some argue for improving existing schools as an alternative to madrasas, while others believe reforms should be focused on Islamic madrasas to ensure a well-rounded curriculum. Islamic madrasas primarily focus on religious-based curriculum, with some promoting a militant form of Islam near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The 2003 USAID strategy paper highlighted rare but worrisome links between madrasas and extremist Islamic groups. Some concerns surround moderate madrasas, where students may reject Western culture. The outdated teaching methods in these schools may not prepare students for the modern workforce. Critics suggest introducing science and math content to improve madrasas' curricula. Proposals are being made to enhance science and math content in madrasas' curricula while maintaining their religious nature. Madrasas provide free education, room, and board, attracting impoverished families. These religious schools are funded by private donations through zakat. Most madrasas educate boys, with a few for girls. There is global concern about donations to Islamic charities and the spread of conservative religious education from the Persian Gulf. Concern has been raised about the spread of radical Islam through educational institutions funded by Persian Gulf governments and citizens worldwide. Critics argue that this funding may support extremist teachings in madrasas, threatening more moderate beliefs in the Muslim world. Several Gulf states have strengthened controls on charities funding madrasas linked to Al Qaeda. Islamic charitable organizations in Gulf states support educational projects worldwide, with unclear accountability for curricular development. Pakistan's 12,000 madrasas are a concern due to poverty-driven reliance on them for free education. Some Pakistanis turn to madrasas for free education and board due to shortcomings in the public education system. Concerns about links between madrasas and extremist groups have led to calls for reform to counter terrorism and stabilize the Afghan government. The 9/11 Commission highlighted poor education in Pakistan as a particular concern, with some madrasas being used as breeding grounds for violent extremism. Afghan president Karzai urged Pakistan to prevent extremists from using madrasas. In response to concerns about madrasas being used by extremists, Pakistani authorities required madrasas to register and disclose their financing sources. Over 12,000 out of 13,000 madrasas in Pakistan had registered by January 2007. Anonymity for donors was preserved, but the government also demanded further controversial steps. In a controversial move, the Pakistani government demanded madrasas to expel foreign students by December 31, 2005. By January 1, 2006, 1,000 out of 1,700 foreign students had left Pakistan. Authorities planned to deport the remaining 700 if they did not get permission to stay. An air-strike on a madrasa in Bajaur tribal region killed 80 militants in October 2006, leading to protests. In July 2007, Pakistani security forces raided a girls madrasa linked to the Red Mosque after individuals associated with the facilities refused government orders to stop enforcing religious social codes. Over 100 people were reportedly killed in clashes. In September 2007, the U.S. Department of State reported that many Pakistani madrasas taught extremist doctrine supporting terrorism, particularly in FATA and Balochistan. Madrasas' popularity is increasing in Southeast Asia, with Indonesia having a significant number of primary students attending. In Indonesia, 20%-25% of primary and secondary school children attend Islamic religious schools known as pesantrens, which teach a moderate form of Islam including Sufism. Authorities in Bangladesh are concerned about madrasas being used by Islamist activists involved in bombing attacks. The U.S. has shown interest in improving outreach and addressing educational challenges in the Muslim world post-9/11. The 9/11 Commission recommended addressing education issues in the Islamic world to prevent the growth of Islamist terrorism. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 includes provisions to improve educational opportunities in the Middle East, such as establishing an International Youth Opportunity Fund. USAID committed $100 million for education reform in Pakistan, and the Administration requested funding in FY2008 for ongoing education assistance programs in the Middle East. The Administration requested foreign operations funding for education assistance programs in Middle Eastern and South/Central Asian countries. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 amended appropriations for an International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund and requires reports on efforts to improve education and combat extremism. A separate report is needed on U.S. education assistance and the progress in establishing the authorized Fund."
