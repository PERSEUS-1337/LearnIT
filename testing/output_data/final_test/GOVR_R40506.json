    "content": "The report discusses the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources, which account for close to 30% of total U.S. emissions. Cars and trucks contribute over three-quarters of this total. The Obama Administration has collaborated with stakeholders to develop and implement GHG standards for vehicles. EPA and NHTSA are working together to address CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in cars and trucks. The White House directed EPA to harmonize GHG standards with fuel economy standards developed by NHTSA. California has unique authority to issue emission standards, granted a waiver by EPA in 2009. President Obama directed harmonization of federal standards with California's. EPA supported GHG legislation in 2009, but it did not pass the Senate. In 2009, GHG legislation passed the House but died in the Senate. EPA used existing Clean Air Act authority to set GHG emission standards after Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA. EPA Administrator issued endangerment findings in 2009, leading to standards for motor vehicles. The EPA has set standards for various types of vehicles, including cars, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, pickups, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and engines. The Trump Administration's stance on these standards is uncertain, and industry stakeholders may influence any potential rollbacks or modifications. Auto and trucking industries generally support EPA's GHG regulations to avoid a patchwork of state standards. The 2017-2025 light-duty vehicle regulations allowed for a Midterm Evaluation of the 2022-2025 standards, which EPA determined to be appropriate in January 2017. Congress may be interested in this decision, as well as the Phase 2 medium- and heavy-duty truck standards aimed at reducing oil consumption and saving vehicle owners fuel costs. The EPA estimates that the vehicle standards will save owners $170 billion in fuel costs. The truck standards have been well-received, but there may be efforts to review or modify them due to opposition from the new Administration and Congress. The International Civil Aviation Organization has agreed on CO2 emission standards for aircraft starting in 2020. The EPA plans to implement emission standards and an offset system for carbon emissions from aviation in the United States under the CAA. U.S. airlines and aircraft manufacturers support the agreements reached in ICAO negotiations. The report also addresses limiting GHG emissions from other mobile sources like ships, nonroad vehicles, locomotives, and fuels, following a discussion on EPA's regulatory decisions regarding GHGs. In 1998, EPA General Counsel Jonathan Cannon concluded that greenhouse gases were air pollutants under the CAA, allowing for regulation. A petition in 1999 requested EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under Section 202 of the act. The petition was denied by EPA in 2003 under the Bush Administration. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as they are considered air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This decision came after a petition was denied in 2003 by the EPA under the Bush Administration. The EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The Obama Administration prioritized reviewing the endangerment issue and found that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. Motor vehicles emit four greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons), with CO2 being the most significant. In 2006, these emissions accounted for 23.6% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The Obama Administration reached agreements with auto manufacturers and California on joint GHG/fuel standards for vehicles. Hydrofluorocarbons are the second-most important GHG from vehicles. The Obama Administration announced a joint greenhouse gas/fuel economy rulemaking with EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to integrate CAFE standards for new cars and light trucks with national greenhouse gas emission standards. The objective was to achieve \"One National Program\" with GHG reduction levels similar to California's standards. The GHG standards have led to the development of new technology, following California's lead in adopting stringent regulations. California can enforce stricter standards by obtaining a waiver from federal preemption under CAA Section 209(b). Other states may adopt similar requirements if California is granted a waiver, reinforcing the impact of its standards. EPA has also granted California waivers for GHG emissions since 2009. The EPA granted California waivers to enforce its own GHG standards in 2009. The joint regulations for light-duty vehicles were finalized in 2010, requiring vehicles to meet emissions levels averaging 250 grams/mile of CO2 by 2016. This would result in a 21% reduction in emissions by 2030. NHTSA set fuel economy standards, aiming for 34.1 miles per gallon in 2016. The standards were gradually phased in, with the first targets affecting model year 2012. EPA used the concept of a vehicle's \"footprint\" to set differing standards. The EPA used vehicle \"footprint\" to set varying CO2 emissions standards based on vehicle size. Compliance burden is spread across all manufacturers, with each having its own standard reflecting the vehicles they produce. This approach has led to reduced CO2 emissions by improving vehicle fuel efficiency. Manufacturers have reduced CO2 emissions by improving fuel economy and can also earn CO2-equivalent credits by reducing HFC and CO2 emissions through air conditioner and idle reduction technologies. EPA implemented second phase GHG emission standards for MY2017-MY2025 light duty vehicles, aiming to reduce emissions by 50% by 2025 with fuel economy standards reaching nearly 50 miles per gallon. The EPA released a proposed determination under the Mid-Term Evaluation (MTE) stating that the MY2022-MY2025 fuel economy standards of nearly 50 miles per gallon and CO2 emissions reduction to about 160 grams/mile remained appropriate, with no rulemaking to change them warranted. The EPA Administrator made a final determination to retain the MY2022-MY2025 standards after input from various stakeholders. Critics reacted swiftly, vowing to revisit the determination due to concerns about the accelerated timeline and lack of harmonization among existing standards. The Trump Administration's stance on the EPA/NHTSA/CARB standards remains uncertain, with potential options including easing or eliminating the MY2022-MY2025 standards. The possibility of a new rulemaking process to change the standards is on the table, but it would require justification to avoid legal challenges. Congressional oversight may play a role in the absence of clear review options. The role of Congress in overseeing the EPA/NHTSA/CARB standards is uncertain. Industry stakeholders suggest harmonizing NHTSA's standards with EPA and California without major changes. Stakeholder petitions highlight inconsistencies in the One National Program, including off-cycle technologies and credit transfer factors. Congress may need to revisit NHTSA's statutory authorities for suggested changes. The light-duty vehicle rules aim to reduce GHG emissions but face challenges due to slow fleet turnover and potential offset by increased vehicle miles traveled. Section 202(a) of the CAA authorizes the GHG standards for new motor vehicles. The EPA has the authority to set standards for the emission of air pollutants from new motor vehicles that contribute to air pollution endangering public health. This includes medium- and heavy-duty trucks, with standards set for MY2014-MY2018 and a second round for MY2021-MY2027. Additionally, NHTSA was directed to study GHG emissions under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 directed NHTSA to study fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, with a focus on tractor-trailers which account for a significant portion of fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks emitted over 400 million metric tons of GHGs in 2014, representing nearly 27% of total GHG emissions. Trucks emitted over 400 million metric tons of GHGs in 2014, nearly 27% of motor vehicle emissions. Emissions from trucks grew 76% between 1990 and 2014, the fastest among major GHG sources. The EPA Administrator has authority to regulate based on vehicle weight, power, fuel type, or other factors, and can delay regulations to allow for technology development. EPA has used weight or power classifications to set emission standards, especially for trucks. The EPA has set differing emission standards for trucks, allowing manufacturers up to four years to develop controls. Standards are based on fuel type, with no specified level of stringency except for specific pollutants. GHG and fuel economy standards for trucks were jointly promulgated in 2011, dividing them into three categories. The EPA has set emission standards for trucks based on fuel type, with varying stringency levels. The standards aim to reduce GHG emissions by 17% in diesel vehicles and 12% in gasoline vehicles by 2018. For vocational vehicles and combination tractors, emissions are expected to decrease by up to 23% and 6-9% respectively by 2017. Trailer design is highlighted as a significant source of efficiency losses and higher GHG emissions. Trailer design is a major source of efficiency losses and higher GHG emissions. Although trailers were not covered in the MY2014-MY2018 standards, President Obama directed the development of new standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in 2014. The Phase 2 standards, promulgated in 2016, cover MY2018-2027 for certain trailers and MY2021-2027 for semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, buses, and work trucks. EPA intends to include trailers in future rulemaking due to their impact on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The Phase 2 standards set by the EPA aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 billion metric tons, save $170 billion in fuel costs, and cut oil consumption by up to 2 billion barrels over the lifetime of vehicles sold under the program. The total cost of the rule is estimated at $29-$31 billion for MY2018-MY2029 trucks. The standards will increase the cost of a long haul tractor-trailer by $13,500 in MY2027, but the investment in fuel-efficient technology would be recouped in less than two years through fuel savings. Fuel consumption of 2027 model tractor-trailers is projected to decline by 34% as a result of the rule. Efforts in the 115th Congress leadership may involve reviewing or modifying truck regulations. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) could be used to disapprove standards, preventing them from taking effect or being reissued. The CRA allows for an expedited procedure within 60 days of a rule being published in the Federal Register. Regulations set by the EPA aim to reduce CO2 emissions, save fuel costs, and cut oil consumption over the lifetime of vehicles. The total cost of the rule is estimated at $29-$31 billion for MY2018-MY2029 trucks. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for fast-track Senate procedures to review and modify truck regulations within the first 60 legislative days of the 115th Congress. The truck and trailer rule could still be modified through ordinary legislation or a rider on an appropriations bill after this period. The American Trucking Associations are cautiously optimistic about the rule achieving its targets. The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association provided input to ensure a single national program for greenhouse gas reductions and fuel efficiency improvements. Only two organizations filed petitions for judicial review of the final rule. EPA issued a finding on greenhouse gas emissions on August 15, 2016. On August 15, 2016, the EPA found that greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aircraft contribute to climate change and endanger Americans' health. This finding led to the development of international CO2 standards for aircraft by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) starting in 2020. U.S. aircraft emit 11% of GHG emissions from the transportation sector and 29% globally. EPA and the Federal Aviation Administration participated in ICAO's process. The United States participated in ICAO's process and agreed on a Market-Based Mechanism (MBM) for offsetting carbon emissions from aviation. EPA's endangerment finding supports the adoption of domestic aircraft CO2 standards. U.S. aviation emissions contribute 2.2% to 3.2% of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions, with additional impacts from ozone formation, water vapor, and soot emissions at high altitudes. The EPA and ICAO are taking action to address aircraft greenhouse gas emissions, following petitions from states and parties. The EPA has the authority to regulate aircraft emissions under the Clean Air Act, with potential compliance approaches including emission limits, operational practices, fees, and more. The Clean Air Act (CAA) grants the EPA authority to set emission standards for aircraft engines to address air pollution. Unlike other mobile sources, the EPA must consult with the FAA and DOT when developing standards and cannot impose new ones if they significantly increase noise or affect safety. The Clean Air Act grants EPA authority to set emission standards for aircraft engines, but standards cannot be imposed if they increase noise or affect safety. EPA rarely regulates aircraft emissions without international agreements through ICAO. Recent standards for nitrogen oxides essentially ratified what aircraft manufacturers had achieved. Environmental groups petitioned EPA for action on aviation emissions and sued to force a response. The court found that EPA has a duty to determine if aircraft emissions endanger public health and may be sued for delays. EPA issued an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from aircraft, taking the first step towards setting standards. The endangerment finding is a final rule eligible for fast-track procedures in the Senate. The EPA issued an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from aircraft, which was welcomed by affected industries participating in the ICAO process. The finding will enable the adoption of international aircraft emissions standards into U.S. law, consistent with the Clean Air Act and international obligations. The EPA received petitions to regulate GHGs from various mobile source categories, including aircraft, ocean-going ships, motor fuels, locomotives, and nonroad vehicles. The agency's decision to regulate GHGs in response to the motor vehicle petition could set precedents for emission standards in other categories. EPA's authority to regulate pollution from these sources varies, but the endangerment finding for motor vehicles could guide future regulations. Three petitions to EPA request regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from ocean-going ships and their fuel. International shipping emitted 796 million metric tons of CO2 in 2012, accounting for 2.2% of global emissions. Including domestic shipping and other GHGs, the total would be 961 million metric tons, 2.5% of global emissions. Only five countries individually emit a higher percentage of CO2. Ships account for a higher percentage of global CO2 emissions and also emit significant black carbon, contributing to climate change. The authority to regulate ship pollution is found in Section 213(a)(4) of the CAA, allowing the Administrator to set standards for emissions other than carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds from nonroad engines and vehicles. The language in Section 213 differs from that for new motor vehicles in Section 202, using the phrase \"significantly contribute\" in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator may regulate ship emissions if they significantly contribute to air pollution endangering public health or welfare. Regulations can be promulgated as deemed appropriate, with no specified level of stringency. Classes or categories of ships can be established for regulation purposes, considering costs, noise, safety, and energy factors. Various measures could be implemented if GHG emissions from ships are deemed to significantly contribute to air pollution. Measures to reduce emissions from shipping include operational changes like reducing speed and using cleaner fuels, as well as hull and propeller design improvements. A.P. Moller-Maersk has successfully reduced CO2 emissions per container shipped by 42% from 2007-2015 and aims for a 60% reduction by 2020 through speed reduction, operational optimization, and newer, more efficient vessels. The petitions to EPA mentioned potential emission control measures for ocean-going vessels, including improved fleet deployment planning, shore-side power use, heat recovery systems, sail usage for propulsion, and NOx controls. A complicating factor is that most GHG emissions from these vessels occur in international waters, with 95% of the fleet calling on U.S. ports being foreign-flagged. However, petitioners argued that this should not prevent EPA regulation, citing a Supreme Court case involving the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged cruise ships. The shipping industry has generally opposed international regulation of ships' GHG emissions, but after the United Nations' climate agreement in Paris in 2015, the International Chamber of Shipping urged the International Maritime Organization to adopt a pledge to reduce international shipping emissions. The IMO's Environment Protection Committee met in 2016 but only required large ships to report their CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. California and Oceana et al. petitioned for EPA regulation of marine shipping vessel fuel composition. The International Maritime Organization, EPA, and California have implemented regulations to limit sulfur content in marine fuels to reduce emissions. California's low sulfur fuel requirements began in 2009, and the IMO designated the U.S. coastline as an Emission Control Area in 2010. The IMO added the waters around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as Emission Control Areas on July 15, 2011 to limit sulfur emissions from bunker fuel. Sulfur emissions form sulfate particles in the atmosphere, impacting public health and welfare. Sulfate particles are believed to have a cooling effect on the atmosphere by reflecting solar radiation back into space. However, removing sulfur may be necessary to prevent fouling of pollution control equipment. Section 213 of the Clean Air Act can regulate nonroad vehicles and engines. The Administrator can regulate nonroad vehicles and engines to control emissions that significantly contribute to air pollution. The nonroad sector includes various types of equipment and vehicles, accounting for a significant amount of CO2 emissions in 2007. According to a petition by ICTA, GHG emissions from the nonroad sector increased by 49% between 1990 and 2005, surpassing the rate of emissions increase for on-road vehicles, aircraft, boats, and rail. EPA has been slower to regulate pollutants from nonroad engines compared to motor vehicles, but has implemented standards in the last decade, often following California's lead. Some standards have been technology-forcing, particularly for diesel-powered and lawn equipment. The EPA has based its standards on individual subcategories and technologies to reduce emissions from specific machinery. A petition was received in 2010 to regulate GHG emissions and black carbon from locomotives, which emitted 47.6 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2014. Despite accounting for less than 1% of total U.S. GHG emissions, emissions from railroads increased by 22% between 1990 and 2014. Locomotives also emit significant amounts of black carbon, which contributes to global warming. The petition requested EPA to set GHG emission standards for locomotives and also for their black carbon emissions, citing NASA's report on black soot's contribution to global warming. Unlike other CAA sections, the locomotive subsection does not require an endangerment finding for the Administrator to act, but mandates setting standards for emission reduction achievable through technology. The EPA discussed strategies for reducing GHG emissions from locomotives in a 2008 notice, including idle reduction equipment and hybrid engines. The agency has not implemented these strategies yet. Fuel regulation for motor vehicles and engines is authorized under Section 211 of the Clean Air Act. The Administrator has authority under Section 211 of the Clean Air Act to regulate fuel or fuel additives if they pose a risk to public health. California has already implemented regulations to reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 10% by 2020. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard aims to regulate the transportation and consumption of gasoline, diesel fuel, and alternative fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. California has been a leader in developing cleaner fuels through technology-forcing regulations, with potential for national adoption. The Institute for Policy Integrity petitioned EPA to establish a cap-and-trade system for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, nonroad vehicles, and aircraft. Regulation of fuels by California or U.S. EPA could lead to emission reductions from existing vehicles and engines. Requiring low carbon fuels could achieve GHG reductions from the entire vehicle fleet more quickly, although measuring the carbon content of fuels is complex due to life-cycle emissions. EPA faced controversy over developing a methodology to measure greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels. EPA developed a methodology to measure GHG effects of land-use changes. Under the Obama Administration, EPA did not pursue an LCFS. The agency focused on motor vehicles for GHG emissions control. Endangerment findings were issued for aircraft in 2016. EPA has authorities over mobile source GHG emissions. The EPA issued an endangerment finding for aircraft in 2016, which was not challenged by manufacturers or airlines. Aircraft emissions are a significant source of GHGs after cars and trucks. Congress and the Trump Administration face questions regarding GHG emissions from mobile sources in 2017. President Trump promised to overturn EPA regulations on GHGs, and Congressional Republicans have also been critical of Obama's policies. The new Congress has the opportunity to rescind EPA regulations on GHGs, including emission standards for trucks and aircraft. The Mid-Term Evaluation of vehicle GHG standards is more controversial. Other mobile source categories contribute less than 1% of total U.S. GHG emissions. The EPA has shifted its focus from mobile sources to stationary sources, as stationary sources account for about 70% of the nation's GHG emissions. Electric power plants alone contribute about 30% of all U.S. GHG emissions, a higher percentage than all mobile sources combined. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) was introduced by the EPA on October 23, 2015, to address power plant emissions. The future of the CPP is a priority for the Trump Administration and Congress, despite being stayed by the Supreme Court."
