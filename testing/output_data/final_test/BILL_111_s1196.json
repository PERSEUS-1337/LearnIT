According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 97% of all exporters in the US and account for 29% of total exports. Despite this, less than 1% of small businesses are involved in trade activities. Over 72% of US exporters have fewer than 20 employees, making it challenging for small businesses to overcome trade barriers. Small business advocacy groups lack political influence in foreign countries, hindering efforts to solve trade problems. Advocates are not as visible on international trade issues due to resource constraints. Congress passed a law in 1988 calling for a special trade assistant for small businesses, but the position remains unfilled as of June 2009. The United States Trade Representative has not established the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for Small Business as of June 2009. Congress believes this position should be created to promote small business trade interests, address trade barriers, ensure representation in negotiations, and coordinate with other agencies assisting small businesses."
