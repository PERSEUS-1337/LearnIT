    "content": "The \"Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2005\" includes sections on the short title, findings, and purpose. It also addresses the safety and use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in agriculture. The Congress recognizes the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, which could limit treatment options for common infections and hinder the response to terrorist attacks or large-scale medical emergencies. The Congress acknowledges the public health threat of antibiotic resistance due to overuse in human medicine and agriculture. Steps have been taken to curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine, but not yet in agriculture. The National Academy of Sciences reported in March 2003 that reducing antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little impact on the current situation. The nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farm animals contributes to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people. About 70% of antibiotics used in the US are fed to animals for nontherapeutic purposes, such as growth promotion and to compensate for poor farming conditions. Unlike human use, animal use of antibiotics typically does not require a prescription. The report from \"Clinical Infectious Diseases\" in June 2002 recommended limiting antimicrobial use in agriculture to therapy for diseased animals and prophylaxis in herds or flocks. The US Geological Survey found antibiotics in 48% of streams tested nationwide in March 2002. Almost half of tested streams were downstream from agricultural operations. A study by the General Accounting Office in April 1999 linked resistant strains of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli to antibiotic use in animals. Consumer Reports found high levels of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter and Salmonella in poultry products in January 2003. Similar results were found in other meat products. The New England Journal of Medicine urged a ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in October 2001. In 1999, the European Union banned nontherapeutic use of medically important antibiotics in animals, leading to a decline in resistant bacteria levels. The National Academy of Sciences highlighted the significant costs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the US society. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that eliminating antibiotic use in animal feed would cost American consumers less than $5 to $10 per year. Various health and environmental organizations support legislation to phase out nontherapeutic antibiotic use in farm animals. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires drugs to be proven safe before approval. The FDA has modified the drug approval process for antibiotics to consider resistant bacteria as a safety concern. However, many antibiotics used in animal production were approved before this consideration. The FDA has not set a schedule to review these existing approvals. Certain non-routine antibiotic uses in animal agriculture are deemed necessary to prevent disease. The Act aims to preserve medically important antibiotics by phasing out their nontherapeutic use in food-producing animals. It also focuses on ensuring the safety of critical antimicrobial animal drugs. The term 'critical antimicrobial animal drug' refers to drugs intended for use in food-producing animals composed of certain types of antibiotics or derivatives used in humans. 'Nontherapeutic use' of these drugs means using them as feed or water additives for animals. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act pertains to the use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs for growth promotion and routine disease prevention in animals. The applicant must demonstrate the reasonable use of these drugs. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act focuses on the phased elimination of nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals to address antimicrobial resistance. The applicant must show no harm to human health due to this use. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act aims to phase out nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs in food-producing animals to combat antimicrobial resistance. Approval for such use will be withdrawn within 2 years unless specific conditions are met. The Secretary must make a final determination that there is no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance due to nontherapeutic drug use before a specified date. The Secretary must determine the harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance caused by nontherapeutic drug use before a specified date. Exemptions may be granted for critical antimicrobial animal drugs, leading to rescinding approvals for nontherapeutic use of these drugs after two years. Applications for critical antimicrobial animal drugs require approval from the Secretary. The Secretary will rescind approvals for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs two years after the application submission, unless a final determination of no harm to human health is made before that date. The Secretary will rescind approvals for nontherapeutic use of critical antimicrobial animal drugs two years after the application submission, unless a final determination of no harm to human health is made before that date. SEC. 201. Collection of data on critical antimicrobial animal drugs is added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers of critical antimicrobial animal drugs or animal feed containing such drugs must submit a report to the Secretary by July 1 each year. The report should detail sales of the drugs or feed from the previous year, including quantities sold for each type of food-producing animal and the claimed purpose of use. Manufacturers must submit annual reports detailing sales of critical antimicrobial animal drugs or feed containing such drugs, including quantities sold for each type of food-producing animal and the purpose of use. The Secretary will make this information public and may aggregate it to protect confidentiality. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act will take effect on January 1, 2006."
