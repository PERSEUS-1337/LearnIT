    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act\" and includes requirements for personnel performing private security functions under federal contracts. The \"Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act\" mandates that covered contracts require contractors to provide information on personnel performing private security functions, including the number of persons, their training, and the categories of activities required. The \"Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act\" mandates that covered contracts require contractors to provide updated information on personnel performing private security functions, safeguarding sensitive information, and including specific accounting requirements. Before contract closeout, the contractor must report actual costs of private security functions in the same categories as provided in the contract. Casualty reporting and oversight are also required for covered contracts to ensure accountability and transparency in security contracting. The agency officers oversee contract performance and have waiver authority in emergencies. Waivers must be justified and reported to congressional committees within 30 days. After a waiver is granted, a report must be submitted to congressional committees detailing the contract, waiver, emergency situation, and a plan for compliance. The committees include those from the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate requires regulations for hiring, training, and equipment standards for private security contractors, to be established within 90 days of the Act's enactment by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The standards must address criminal history, security clearance, and other relevant issues. The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Administrator for the United States Agency for International Development will issue guidance on equipment standards for private security functions under covered contracts, including body armor and equipment armor levels, and a recommended list of manufacturers. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, must submit a report to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment. The report will include an analysis of costs for purchasing equipment for contractors carrying out private security functions under covered contracts compared to reimbursing contractors for equipment purchases, along with any relevant recommendations. In this section, a \"covered contract\" refers to a prime contract, subcontract, or task order involving private security functions outside the United States with the Department of Defense, Department of State, or USAID. Private security functions for covered contracts outside the United States include activities where personnel can carry weapons and tasks like military logistics, interrogation, convoy security, guarding facilities, tactical security work, and local force training. This section applies to covered contracts entered into 60 days after the enactment of the Act."
