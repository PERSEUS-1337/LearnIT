The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area, with its remote location and depth, remains pristine and vital for scientific discovery despite facing rapid changes from warming waters, ocean acidification, and pollution. Marine habitat protection is crucial according to many scientists. Habitat protection is crucial for building resilience in ocean environments against various stressors. The purpose of the Act is to conserve the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area for future generations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as Exclusive Economic Zone, Conservation Area, and Outer Continental Shelf. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION. The Act designates the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area. The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area is established, including specific areas like Gorda Ridge and various seamounts. The boundaries are detailed by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior will develop a detailed boundary description and map for the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area, including Gorda Ridge and Northeast seamounts. The map will be publicly available and have the same force as if included in the Act. The administration of the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area will be overseen by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior have joint responsibility for managing the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area. They must consult with various fishing stakeholders and Indian tribes to develop a comprehensive protection and management plan for the Conservation Area. The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior must consult with Indian tribes to develop mutually agreed-upon plans for the long-term protection of the Conservation Area. The plan will prohibit exploring, developing, or producing in the area to ensure traditional tribal water uses are not impacted. The Conservation Area plan prohibits activities such as using poisons, explosives, or anchoring on coral reefs. It also restricts drilling, dredging, and altering the Outer Continental Shelf. The Conservation Area plan prohibits certain activities, but exceptions include Armed Forces exercises, emergency response actions, and scientific research. The Conservation Area plan allows for scientific exploration, the troll Albacore fishery, and recreational fishing. Exceptions are made for emergencies, national security, and law enforcement activities. The Conservation Area plan permits scientific exploration, the troll Albacore fishery, and recreational fishing, with exceptions for emergencies, national security, and law enforcement activities. Government agencies have the authority to respond to emergencies threatening human health, safety, or the marine environment. The Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard, are exempt from certain prohibitions under this Act, ensuring their operations align with its requirements. In the event of destruction, loss, or injury to living marine resources in the Conservation Area caused by the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, prompt coordination with the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce is required to respond, mitigate harm, and restore affected resources. Military property is not affected by this Act. Military property is not affected by this Act, allowing the Armed Forces to use, maintain, and control property for military mission purposes. The Outer Continental Shelf areas of Cortes and Tanner Banks, along with a portion of Mendocino Ridge, are withdrawn from commercial leasing for oil and gas exploration, development, and production, as well as mining minerals, energy sighting, and cable laying."
