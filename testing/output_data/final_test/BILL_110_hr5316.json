    "content": "The \"Universal Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" allows for recovery rebates for certain individuals receiving Social Security or certain veterans benefits under section 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Universal Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" provides a tax credit of $300 ($600 for joint returns) for eligible individuals who are social security or veterans benefit recipients. The credit is subject to a reduction based on adjusted gross income exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns). The \"Universal Economic Stimulus Act of 2008\" defines eligible social security or veterans benefit recipients as taxpayers who received social security benefits or compensation/pension under specific chapters of title 38, with earned income less than $3,000. Eligible individuals exclude nonresident aliens and those eligible for a deduction under section 151. The deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual's taxable year begins, and an estate or trust. The term 'earned income' has a specific meaning, excluding certain net earnings from self-employment. Coordination with advance refunds of credit is also addressed in the section. The deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individual's taxable year begins. Refunds and credits under subsection (f) reduce allowable credits. Joint returns split refunds or credits equally between filers. Advance refunds and credits are treated as payments against the tax imposed for the first taxable year beginning in 2007. The tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year should be refunded or credited as rapidly as possible, with no interest allowed on any overpayment. The Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to possessions of the United States to compensate for losses due to tax amendments. Payments will be based on information provided by the respective possession's government. The Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to possessions of the United States to compensate for losses due to tax amendments, with specific conditions for distribution in approved possessions like Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. The term \"mirror code tax system\" refers to the income tax system of certain possessions of the United States where residents' tax liability is determined by reference to US tax laws. Payments under this system are treated similarly to tax refunds. (1) Section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include \"or 6431\" after \"section 35\". (2) The table of contents for subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is updated with a new item. Sec. 6431 pertains to 2008 recovery rebates for certain individuals receiving social security or certain veterans benefits."
