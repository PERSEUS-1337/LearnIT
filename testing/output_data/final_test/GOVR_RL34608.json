    "content": "The value of tax benefits for charitable contributions and organizations has decreased in recent years due to economic challenges. Various provisions related to charitable contributions have been enacted temporarily, including an IRA rollover and liberalized treatment of certain gifts. The future of these charitable tax provisions beyond 2013 is uncertain. The future of charitable tax provisions beyond 2013 is uncertain, with current policy issues relevant for charitable organizations including donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, university endowments, and nonprofit hospitals providing charity care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act addresses some concerns by imposing new requirements on nonprofit hospitals. The report discusses proposals to limit tax benefits for charitable contributions, including caps or floors. It also reviews current tax benefits for tax-exempt organizations and potential future legislative issues related to deductions for charitable contributions. Eligible institutions include social welfare organizations, educational institutions, nonprofit hospitals, and churches. The tax system provides benefits for tax-exempt and charitable organizations, such as deductions for charitable contributions and exemption of earnings on assets from income tax. These benefits are significant, with charitable contribution deductions reducing federal revenue by $46.4 billion in FY2014. For universities and colleges, the benefits are even larger than the savings from deducting charitable contributions. The value of charitable contribution deductions fell temporarily during economic slowdowns but has largely recovered. Not all tax-exempt organizations can receive tax-deductible donations, but various types of organizations are eligible. Recent revisions have expanded benefits and addressed potential abuses. Some provisions are set to expire at the end of 2013. Individuals who take the standard deduction do not have a tax incentive to give, with about 30% deducting charitable contributions. Individuals can deduct charitable contributions up to 50% of income for most charities, but only up to 30% for certain nonprofits like non-operating foundations. Contributions of appreciated assets are especially beneficial as the value can be deducted without including capital gains in income. Corporate contributions are limited to 10% of taxable income. The treatment of charitable contributions has been a legislative interest with various proposals to expand benefits, including allowing deductions for non-itemizers. President Bush's 2000 campaign initiated these proposals, but they were scaled back with ceilings and floors and ultimately not adopted. Some limited proposals were considered and adopted temporarily as part of the \"extenders\" provisions. Proposals and enacted legislation placing restrictions on charitable contributions were motivated by potential abuses, focusing on documentation of cash contributions and gifts of property. Broad reform proposals suggest restricting charitable deductions to make incentives more efficient. Recent changes in tax laws may affect charitable contributions through limitations on itemized deductions. Tax exemption allows organizations to accumulate assets without paying tax. The tax exemption benefit allows organizations to accumulate assets without paying tax on earnings, potentially resulting in a larger revenue loss than charitable contribution deductions. Donations can be invested rather than spent, with some organizations maintaining assets in endowments or as private foundations that pay out a small share of assets. Supporting organizations and donor-advised funds also accumulate assets for payments. Prior to the recent recession, revenue losses associated with tax-free asset accumulation by organizations like educational institutions had increased substantially. Endowment earnings alone could have raised approximately $25 billion in FY2007, more than three times the revenue loss for charitable donations to educational institutions. The ratio of revenue cost of asset earnings to charitable contributions is likely smaller for other types of nonprofits. The revenue cost of exempting asset earnings for all charitable organizations was around $50 billion before the recession, similar to the cost of the charitable deduction. Educational endowments had negative returns during the recession but recovered by FY2011, with projected lost revenue of $22 billion. Endowment returns fluctuate with economic conditions, with recent returns falling to almost zero due to losses on international equities. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about tax-exempt organizations, particularly regarding donations to organizations acting as conduits without charitable activities. Private non-operating foundations must pay out 5% of assets, while donor advised funds and supporting organizations had no payout requirements. Legislative changes were made to address concerns about potential private benefits from these organizations. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 continued charitable extenders through 2013, with previous extensions by the 110th and 111th Congress. Legislative proposals relevant to the charitable sector have not become public law despite numerous introductions since 2001. Congress authorized Treasury studies for organizations benefiting privately, but major changes like payout requirements were not universally adopted. The 109th and 111th Congress enacted legislation to promote charitable giving, especially for disaster relief. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 included provisions that restricted charitable giving but also provided incentives like tax-free distributions from IRA accounts for charitable purposes. The curr_chunk briefly reviews tax proposals restricting charitable contributions and organizations, categorizing them as not adopted, temporary, extender, or permanent. Some proposals, like a deduction for non-itemizers and a reduction in the foundation excise tax, have not been adopted. However, a proposal to replace the disallowance of tax-exempt status for unrelated business income in a charitable remainder trust with an excise tax was adopted in 2006. The most significant charitable contributions proposal in recent Congresses was a deduction for non-itemizers, with limitations such as caps or floors on the deduction amount. President George W. Bush initially proposed this extension in 2001 without restrictions. The deduction for charitable giving to non-itemizers has not been enacted despite various proposals in recent years. The 2006 Pension Protection Act did not include this deduction. Different proposals, such as a 12% nonrefundable tax credit recommended by President Obama's Fiscal Commission, have been suggested. The 2005 President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform also proposed extending the deduction to non-itemizers with a floor requirement. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has discussed proposals to curtail the charitable giving deduction, including limiting deductions to donations above 2% of AGI for itemizers. Extending the charitable deduction to non-itemizers with caps ranging from $200 to $500 for married couples filing jointly was considered to increase charitable giving. Caps were seen as a way to constrain revenue loss after the 2001 tax cuts. The deduction for non-itemizers may increase giving, but its effects would be limited due to caps. Caps and floors help limit revenue costs and increase effectiveness per dollar of revenue lost. However, even without a cap, the deduction may not induce additional giving as large as the revenue loss. The responsiveness of taxpayers, especially lower and moderate income taxpayers, to incentives may be small. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to set a single tax rate of 1.32% on investment income of foundations, with additional scrutiny on private foundations due to the potential for donors to receive private benefits. Foundations must distribute 5% of their assets annually or pay a penalty, with tax credits applied against distributions. The proposed legislation in the 111th Congress suggests a fixed 1.32% tax rate on foundation investment income to encourage larger one-time payouts for natural disasters and crises. This change aims to remove disincentives for foundations and attract more donors. The proposed legislation in the 111th Congress suggests a fixed 1.32% tax rate on foundation investment income to encourage larger one-time payouts for natural disasters and crises. This change aims to make private foundations more attractive to donors, although the tax revenue has been variable due to stock market fluctuations. Proponents argue that reducing the tax would align with the original purpose of the tax introduced in 1969. The proposed legislation in the 111th Congress suggests a fixed 1.32% tax rate on foundation investment income to encourage larger one-time payouts for natural disasters and crises. This change aims to make private foundations more attractive to donors. The bill's final explanation cited objectives related to ability to pay and user fees. The tax has been reduced twice based on cost arguments, and there have been proposals to raise the cap on corporate charitable contributions. Corporate charitable giving is debated due to concerns about shareholder decision-making and monitoring problems. Some argue for encouraging corporate charity as part of profit-maximizing behavior. Evidence on the effectiveness of tax deductions for charitable giving is mixed. The current law provides tax deductions and income tax exemptions for trusts with a remainder left to charity. Trust income loses tax exemption if it has unrelated business income. In 2006, a 100% excise tax on unrelated business income was introduced as an alternative. Provisions in 2005 included the Tsunami Relief Act and the Hurricane Katrina Emergency Relief Act to encourage charitable giving for disasters. The Emergency Relief Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-73) provided incentives for giving to Katrina victims, allowing unlimited cash contributions for individuals and corporations. It also increased mileage rates for deducting vehicle costs for charitable purposes. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act (P.L. 109-135) extended benefits to contributions for Hurricanes Rita and Wilma. In 2010, the Haiti Assistance Income Tax Incentive Act (HAITI Act; P.L. 111-126) allowed taxpayers to claim tax deductions for charitable giving on previous years' tax returns. Various charitable provisions have been enacted temporarily and are now part of tax extenders. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) extended five provisions through 2013, reinstating them retroactively for 2012. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) extended all provisions through 2011. The provision related to donation of conservation property was last extended by the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-234). The IRA rollover provision, business inventory donations, charitable donation effect on stock basis, and unrelated business income tax elimination were extended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Provisions for business donations of computer equipment and books were not extended by P.L. 112-240. Senate-originated provisions lifted the cap on contributions for conservation purposes. The Pension Protection Act increased the limit for appreciated property contributions for conservation purposes to 50% for individuals and 100% for farmers and ranchers. The provision was extended multiple times, with the latest extension through 2013 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The Pension Protection Act extended the provision for tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to charities through 2011. This benefits non-itemizers and reduces adjusted gross income for potential tax benefits. The provision for tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to charities benefits non-itemizers by reducing adjusted gross income for potential tax benefits. There are income limits on charitable contributions, with individuals limited to contributing no more than 50% of income in cash and 30% in appreciated property. The latest extension in P.L. 112-240 has an estimated 10-year cost of $1.28 billion. Corporations donating inventory to charity get a deduction for the cost, not the market value. Businesses that donate inventory to charity can deduct the cost, not the market value. A special rule allows them to exclude half the appreciation if the inventory is given to those in need. Disputes have arisen over measuring the fair market value of food donations. Proposed changes would allow additional deductions for unincorporated businesses and consider the fair market value of food as the selling price. The provision allows firms to deduct appreciated property, limited to one-half the appreciation, to create equity among taxpayers. Concerns include potential overstatement of market value and firms selling donated inventory at lower prices due to damage or age. The provision allows firms to deduct appreciated property to create equity among taxpayers. There are concerns about potential overstatement of market value and firms selling donated inventory at lower prices due to damage or age. Legislation such as the Katrina Emergency Relief Act of 2005 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 extended provisions for unincorporated firms through 2007 and 2009 respectively. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the provision for C corporations to deduct donated computer technology or equipment for educational organizations or charities supporting education. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also extended this provision. The Stabilization Act of 2008 extended a provision for C corporations to deduct donated items for educational organizations. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 further extended this provision. Valuation may be an issue for book inventories donated to schools. The Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended provisions for C corporations to deduct donated items for educational organizations. The current law allows shareholders in Subchapter S corporations to deduct their share of corporate contributions, with a requirement to decrease the basis of stock by that amount. Congressional proposals suggest that taxpayers may not have to reduce basis in stock if a deduction exceeds the adjusted basis of the donated property. This provision aligns with allowing a deduction for the market value of appreciated property. The provision allowing a deduction for the market value of appreciated property was extended through various acts, with an estimated cost of $225 million over 10 years. Charities are subject to a tax on unrelated business income, with certain exceptions for rents, royalties, and annuities. The Congress version of charity proposals included excluding certain items like rent from a tax on unrelated business income, with the determination of arms-length rents being a challenge. This provision was extended through various acts until 2013, with an estimated cost of $40 million over 10 years. The Congress has considered provisions to prevent abuse in excise taxes, particularly targeting the Red Cross. The Senate Finance Committee has investigated compliance issues, with hearings held in 2004 and 2005. Concerns focused on potential abuses of charitable organizations, gift valuations, and certain types of organizations like donor-advised funds and supporting organizations. Private foundations and donor-advised funds are types of organizations that allow contributions to accumulate without immediate distribution. Private foundations have a 5% payout requirement and restrictions to prevent misuse of funds. Donor-advised funds involve donors contributing to an account for subsequent distribution by the institution. Supporting organizations indirectly support charitable purposes. Proposals to enhance the effectiveness of charitable contribution deductions have included introducing a floor to prevent small undocumented deductions. The Deficit Commission's proposal and other tax reform suggestions focused on creating a charitable credit with a floor percentage of income. Changes were made in 2003 and 2004, with more restrictive provisions in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 to address abuse in charitable donations, particularly gifts of appreciated property. These gifts make up a significant portion of donations, especially among higher income taxpayers. Gifts of property account for 50% of contributions, with taxpayers above $1 million making up 18% of cash gifts and 40% of property gifts. Donors benefit from a deduction for the full value of donated property, with no tax on appreciation. Valuation of non-publicly traded gifts poses challenges for tax compliance. The President's Advisory Commission on Tax Reform proposed allowing individuals to sell appreciated property and donate the proceeds without paying capital gains tax to address valuation issues. Broad changes were discussed in the treatment of gifts of appreciated property. Several changes were discussed regarding the treatment of gifts of appreciated property. The Joint Committee on Taxation proposed allowing only the basis to be deducted for gifts of non-publicly traded property. A Senate staff discussion paper suggested \"baseball arbitration\" to limit overstatement of value. Concerns about abuse of donations of used vehicles and intellectual property led to revisions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. $2.3 billion in deductions for vehicle donations were reported in 2003. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 made revisions to tax deductions for non-cash contributions, including restricting deductions for vehicle donations to the resale value, requiring appraisals for property donations over $5,000, and limiting deductions for intellectual property to the lesser of basis or market value. The Pension Protection Act required easement gifts to be limited to buildings, apply to the entire exterior, and include an appraisal. Concerns were raised about taxpayers receiving deductions for contributing mounted trophies at inflated prices. The Pension Protection Act restricted deductions for contributing mounted trophies at inflated prices. Concerns were raised by environmental and animal rights groups. The Act also imposed a recapture tax on gifts of appreciated property not used for exempt purposes. Contributions of used clothing and household items are valuable but challenging to value and audit. In 2003, non-cash contributions were estimated at $8.6 billion, with clothing accounting for two-thirds. The Pension Protection Act disallows deductions for items not in good condition and requires substantiation for all cash contributions. Items valued over $500 may be deducted with an appraisal. Taxpayers could deduct contributions of fractional interests in art based on a bank record or receipt. A court decision in 1988 allowed for donation of a fractional interest in art without physical possession, leading to concerns about abuse of the tax treatment. The possession or display of art by a museum can increase the market value of the artwork, impacting future deductions or sales. Estate taxes can be reduced through minority discounts, but this does not affect charitable deductions for tax purposes. The Pension Protection Act requires physical possession by the donee and completion of the gift within 10 years or at the donor's death. The Pension Protection Act imposes restrictions on fractional shares donated to tax-exempt organizations, with penalties for non-compliance. Provisions were enacted during the 108th and 109th Congresses, affecting tax-exempt organizations beyond charitable ones. The Military Family Tax Relief Act of 2003 automatically suspends tax-exempt status for organizations on the terrorist list. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 restricted tax benefits for leasing arrangements, impacting tax-exempt entities. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 imposed penalties on exempt organizations in prohibited tax shelter transactions. Investments in life insurance are subject to beneficial tax treatment, including exemptions at death and deferral of tax on earnings. State laws restrict holding an interest in life insurance without insurable interest. The Pension Protection Act requires reporting on life insurance arrangements by exempt organizations and mandates a Treasury Department study. Penalties apply to certain actions of charitable and tax-exempt organizations, including revoking exempt status for inappropriate actions. The curr_chunk discusses the various taxes and penalties imposed on charitable and social welfare organizations, private foundations, and nonprofit credit counseling agencies. It mentions the excess benefit tax, penalties for self-dealing, failure to distribute income, and other violations. The Pension Protection Act increased these taxes and penalties. The rapid growth of tax-exempt credit counseling agencies in the 1990s led to reports of widespread abuse. The Pension Protection Act established standards for credit counseling agencies and expanded income types subject to taxes. The Pension Protection Act requires certain exempt organizations, including churches, to report contact information to the IRS using Form 990-N. Failure to file for three years will result in tax-exempt status revocation. The Secretary of the Treasury must notify the appropriate State officer of any refusal to recognize an organization as charitable or revocation of tax-exempt status. The Pension Protection Act requires exempt organizations to report contact information to the IRS using Form 990-N, failure to file may result in revocation of tax-exempt status. The Act also revises rules for disclosure of tax information to state authorities, including disclosure of notices of proposed refusal to recognize or revoke tax-exempt status, names and addresses of applicants, and associated returns. Organizations must make information and application materials available for public inspection. The Act also applies disclosure rules to returns reporting unrelated business income and authorizes Treasury Department studies on donor advised funds and supporting organizations. Donor advised funds involve donors making contributions for charitable organizations. Supporting organizations, categorized into Type I, Type II, and Type III, make contributions to charitable organizations based on donor advice. While donors have no legal control, their wishes are typically honored. These organizations do not directly engage in charitable activities but provide financial support to other charitable organizations. Type III organizations can support multiple charitable organizations and share similarities with private foundations but are not subject to certain restrictions like self-dealing rules or payout requirements. The law made changes to prevent abuses in charitable organizations, including defining donor-advised funds, prohibiting benefits to donors, requiring governance for grants to individuals, and mandating the sale of contributions from closely held businesses. Supporting organizations must specify their type, with Type III organizations eventually facing a minimum payout requirement. Treasury issued proposed regulations in August 2007 for comment. The Treasury issued proposed regulations in 2007, applying the same minimum distribution rule to foundations. The Pension Protection Act prohibits supporting organizations from providing benefits to substantial contributors. Type III organizations have additional filing requirements and cannot support foreign nonprofits. Tax issues regarding charitable deductions and tax-exempt organizations are of interest in the 113th Congress. The charitable extenders are set to expire at the end of 2013. The President's Fiscal Commission recommended modifying the charitable deduction as part of tax reform to address the deficit. President Obama's budgets proposed limiting itemized deductions, including charitable contributions, to 28%. The Senate Finance Committee has shown interest in the tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals and university endowments. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed new requirements on tax-exempt hospitals. Provisions under the Pension Protection Act continue to raise issues for tax-exempt organizations. The Pension Protection Act continues to raise issues for tax-exempt organizations, with findings from Treasury studies on donor-advised funds and supporting organizations having broader implications for the charitable sector. In 2010, small tax-exempt organizations lost their status for not meeting reporting requirements. The revenue cost of extending charitable provisions from the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 is discussed, with questions on the effectiveness and temporary nature of these provisions. The use of temporary provisions for charitable purposes has both advantages and disadvantages. While it may lead to smaller budgetary costs and encourage reconsideration of provisions, it also creates uncertainty for taxpayers and adds to Congress's workload. Despite some revisions, most temporary provisions remain unchanged, with the exception of the R&D tax credit. The temporary nature of tax provisions for charitable contributions has advantages and disadvantages. Various proposals aim to limit tax benefits, such as replacing the charitable deduction with a 12% nonrefundable tax credit. Concerns about the impact on charitable giving have been raised, but the proposed changes would not affect all taxpayers equally. The provision on charitable giving, if not immediately enacted, is not expected to impact current contributions. Estimates suggest a small effect of around 1% on charitable giving from the 28% limitation. The itemized deduction cap is projected to raise $584 billion over 10 years, with charitable contributions accounting for about a quarter of itemized deductions at higher income levels. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed new requirements on tax-exempt hospitals, with concerns raised about the level of charity care provided by nonprofit hospitals compared to for-profit hospitals. Congressional interest in nonprofit hospitals was shown prior to the Act, with a study finding that nonprofit hospitals only slightly exceeded for-profit hospitals in charity care provision. Nonprofit hospitals provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals. Congressional committees held hearings on charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Concerns were raised about charity care, community benefits, governance, and billing practices at nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley released a staff discussion draft and authorized a round-table to discuss the issues. The IRS also released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals in July 2007. The IRS released an interim report on nonprofit hospitals, revealing that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9%. Under PPACA, tax-exempt hospitals must meet new requirements, including conducting a community health needs assessment, providing written financial assistance policies, and making efforts to determine eligibility for financial assistance before collections actions. The Treasury Secretary is tasked with reviewing the community benefit activities of tax-exempt hospitals. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will report annually to Congress on charity care, bad debt expenses, and community benefit activities of tax-exempt hospitals. Universities and colleges, as charitable organizations, receive deductible contributions and are tax-exempt. Prior to the financial crises, exempting endowment income of colleges and universities from taxes was valued at $25 billion, more than three times the benefit of charitable deductions to educational institutions. Endowments for colleges and universities saw significant growth between FY2006 and FY2007, with a 4.6% payout rate and a 21.5% average rate of return. However, losses in FY2009 averaged 18.7%, raising concerns about the use of endowment funds for affordable education. Senator Grassley highlighted the issue of tuition rates in response to the losses, urging colleges not to raise tuition due to endowment losses. Many colleges relied on risky investments like hedge funds for big gains, leading to losses now. Issues with donor-advised funds and supporting organizations include private benefit by donors and payout rates. Treasury is studying whether deductions for contributions to these funds should be revisited. The Treasury is studying issues related to deductions for contributions to donor-advised funds and supporting organizations, including distribution requirements and completion of gifts. A CRS report suggested that aggregate payout requirements may not have a significant impact, and effective requirements should be applied to individual accounts. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 implemented new reporting requirements for tax-exempt organizations. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced new reporting requirements for tax-exempt organizations with revenues under $25,000. Failure to file Form 990-N for three consecutive years results in revocation of tax-exempt status. In 2010, revocations occurred for the first time. Out of 714,000 registered tax-exempt organizations, 41% had not filed by July 2010. Reasons for non-filing include organizational dissolution and lack of awareness. The IRS extended the filing deadline to October 15, 2010 to aid charities in compliance. The IRS extended the filing deadline to October 15, 2010 for charities to comply with new reporting requirements. The Senate Finance Committee investigated specific charitable organizations and donation practices, leading to legislation and self-correction. Senator Grassley inquired about finances of media-based ministries in 2007. Religious organizations, exempt from filing 990 forms, are difficult to monitor. Senator Grassley announced the results of an inquiry into tax-exempt entities on January 6, 2011, revealing internal reforms were underway despite some ministries not providing all requested information."
