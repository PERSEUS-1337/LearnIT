These IMGs, also known as Foreign Medical Graduates (FMGs), play a crucial role in providing medical care in rural communities. FMGs enter the US through various visa programs for medical education and training. This report focuses on FMGs entering the United States through the J-1 program, which is a nonimmigrant visa category that includes various professionals like professors, students, and foreign medical graduates. Foreign medical graduates (FMGs) in residency programs in the US typically hold J visas, making up 15.8% of IMGs. FMGs can stay in the US on a J visa for up to seven years for training before needing to return home for two years. J-1 physicians can apply for a waiver to avoid the two-year home residency requirement. J-1 physicians can receive a waiver of the two-year home residency requirement through an interested government agency (IGA), extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or child, or fear of persecution in the home country. Most waiver requests are submitted by an IGA and go through the Department of State for approval. Once approved by USCIS, the physician's status changes to H-1B and is counted against the annual cap. If the cap is met, the physician's J visa status may be extended. The physician's J visa status may be extended to H-1B status in the following year through a waiver request from an interested government agency (IGA). The FMG must provide a \"no objection\" statement from their home country, have an offer of full-time employment, and commit to working in a health professional shortage area for at least three years. Failure to fulfill this commitment results in being subject to the two-year home residency requirement. The J visa status of a physician can be extended to H-1B status through a waiver request from an interested government agency (IGA) like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA allows facility directors to request J-1 waivers when efforts to recruit a qualified U.S. citizen or LPR have failed. Documentation of recruitment efforts and detailed applicant information must be provided for consideration. The applicant must submit copies of their medical license, visa, test results, clinical privileges, references, CV, and contact information. Once approved, the physician must serve for at least three years in a VA facility, regardless of shortage area. The Department of Health and Human Services historically had strict policies on J-1 waiver requests, emphasizing the exchange program's purpose and directing underservice issues to programs like the National Health Service Corps. The HHS announced J-1 waiver requests for primary care physicians and psychiatrists to increase healthcare access in underserved areas. The Appalachian Regional Commission ensures access to quality healthcare in Appalachia. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) facilitates J-1 waiver requests for primary care physicians in certain states. Physicians must commit to providing primary care for 40 hours a week for three years at a designated facility. The facility must be Medicare or Medicaid-certified and accept medically indigent patients. The physician must be licensed in the state, have completed a residency in a relevant field, and not have been out of status for more than six months after receiving the J-1 visa. The USDA participated in the J-1 waiver program from 1994 to 2002, sponsoring over 3,000 waivers for J-1 physicians. Physicians had to have an employment offer of at least three years in a designated medically underserved rural area to qualify for a USDA-sponsored waiver. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the USDA Office of the Inspector General recommended a review of the J-1 waiver program. USDA suspended processing waiver applications and eventually decided to no longer participate in the program due to security concerns. In March 2002, USDA returned 86 waiver applications to 25 states, and in April 2002, it announced it would temporarily process the pending applications. In 2002, USDA announced it would process 86 pending waiver applications and ceased participation in the \"Conrad 20\" program for states. The program, established in 1994, allowed states to sponsor up to 20 waiver applications annually. 45 states and the District of Columbia participated in the program in 2001, with 22 states sponsoring specialists in addition to primary care physicians. Administration of the program varied by state, with some charging application fees and requiring commitments of at least four years. Participants had to meet general US medical licensing requirements and state-specific criteria before starting work. On December 17, 2002, HHS announced a policy change to broaden its J-1 waiver program, taking over the role of USDA as an IGA sponsor for primary care physicians and psychiatrists. Physicians must practice in designated shortage areas for a minimum of three years in exchange for HHS sponsorship. Eligibility is limited to primary care physicians and general psychiatrists who completed their training within the last 12 months. HHS also allows physicians who have left the US to apply for waivers while abroad. HHS began accepting applications for J-1 waivers on June 12, 2003, for primary care physicians to practice in Health Professional Shortage Areas or Medically Underserved Areas. However, on December 10, 2003, HHS issued more restrictive guidelines, requiring physicians to work in Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Clinics, or designated shortage areas. The new policy for J-1 waivers requires physicians to work in specific healthcare facilities in designated shortage areas with HPSA scores of 14 or above. Many states saw a significant decrease in the number of communities eligible for J-1 physicians, with Texas, Iowa, Wyoming, Kansas, and Florida being particularly affected. Bills in the 108th Congress are addressing this issue by allowing states to place physicians in facilities outside of designated shortage areas if they serve patients from those areas. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) began accepting applications for its J-1 visa waiver program on May 17, 2004. Physicians must agree to practice in designated shortage areas for at least three years and pay $250,000 to the sponsoring facility. The DRA aims to stimulate economic development in 240 county or parish areas across eight states. The \"Conrad 30\" program expired on May 31, 2004, limiting state-sponsored waivers to J-1 physicians admitted before June 1, 2004. Concerns arise in rural medical communities over the lack of physicians, leading to proposed bills in Congress to address the issue. In the 108th Congress, a bill was introduced to address concerns of medically underserved areas relying on J-1 physicians. A nationwide survey in May 2001 by the Texas Primary Care Office gathered recommendations from states on J-1 visa waiver programs, including allowing states to determine program use and fees, coordinating support through HHS, and involving the Department of State. In the 108th Congress, a bill was introduced to address concerns of medically underserved areas relying on J-1 physicians. Recommendations from states on J-1 visa waiver programs included coordinating support through HHS and involving the Department of State and USCIS. Suggestions also included allowing states to share unused waivers, more interaction with USDA, and having an annual conference involving federal and state agencies. A survey conducted after USDA's withdrawal from the J-1 waiver program showed that 26 states would be impacted, while 25 states indicated they could place more than 20 physicians annually through \"Conrad 20.\" In July 2003, a review of the \"Conrad\" programs from 2000-2003 showed that 49 states and the District of Columbia had these programs. Over the four-year period, 2,949 waivers were requested, with 758 for sub-specialists. Recommendations for sub-specialists increased from 14% in 2000 to 33.5% in 2003. Idaho was the only state without a program, but was in the process of developing one. The \"Conrad\" programs are the only J-1 visa waiver programs recommending non-primary care physicians. In 2003, 18 states filled all their slots, with 15 states able to fill additional slots. States suggested redistributing unused slots, increasing waivers to 40, making the program permanent, and giving control to state health departments or program administrators. Several bills have been introduced to address the expiration of the \"Conrad 30\" program in May 2004. The bills, introduced by Representative Jerry Moran and Senator Kent Conrad, aim to extend the program until 2009, allow state public health departments to identify shortage areas, exempt physicians obtaining waivers from the H-1B numerical limit, and recruit primary and specialty care physicians. The amended version of S. 2302 passed the Senate on October 11, 2004, extending the program until June 1, 2006, exempting waiver recipients from the H-1B cap, and allowing placement of up to five physicians in designated shortage areas. The bill H.R. 4453, introduced by Representative Jerry Moran in 2004, aimed to extend the J-1 visa waiver program until June 1, 2006. It allowed states to recruit specialist and primary care physicians, exempted waiver recipients from the H-1B cap, and permitted the placement of five physicians in state-designated shortage areas. Some have argued for the program to be made permanent or extended to address healthcare shortages. The bill H.R. 4453 aimed to extend the J-1 visa waiver program to investigate the use of foreign physicians to address healthcare shortages. It allowed states to place 5 physicians in designated shortage areas before becoming a permanent provision. The bill passed the House and was referred to the Senate in 2004. S. 2302 was introduced by Senator Kent Conrad to extend the \"Conrad 30\" program, exempt waiver recipients from H-1B numerical limits, recruit primary and specialty care physicians, and place up to five physicians in shortage areas. The Senate-passed version extended the program expiration date to June 1, 2006, allowed states to recruit both types of physicians, and placed physicians in designated shortage areas. The bill was signed into law on December 3, 2004. The J-1 program, established in 1948, had restrictions on participants returning to their home country after education and training. Participants would often find ways to stay in the US by re-entering under different visas. In 1956, amendments were made to address these concerns and prohibited participants from applying for certain nonimmigrant visas. In 1956, amendments to the J-1 program prohibited participants from applying for H nonimmigrant or immigrant status until they had been present in a cooperating country for at least two years. Waivers could be granted in cases of extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or child. In 1970, Congress limited the two-year residency requirement for J-1 visitors whose participation was financed by certain entities. Waivers were allowed for J-1s fearing persecution or in the public interest to stay in the U.S. In 1976, restrictions were imposed on FMGs in the J-1 program due to no longer a shortage of physicians in the U.S. In 1981, FMGs were subject to a two-year home residency requirement, limited to a three-year stay in the U.S., and ineligible for waivers based on \"no objection\" statements. Congress extended the stay to seven years to deter studying in Communist countries, as requested by the Department of State. In 1994, Congress established the \"Conrad 20\" program allowing states to request waivers for up to 20 J-1 physicians annually. The program was extended until June 1, 2002, by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The program authorization expired on May 31, 2002, but efforts were made to ensure continued services to medically underserved areas. The \"Conrad 30\" program, initially established as the \"Conrad 20\" program in 1994, was extended multiple times to provide waivers for J-1 physicians in medically underserved areas. The latest extension, authorized by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, expanded the program to allow each state 30 waivers and retroactively enacted the law to May 31, 2002. The program was extended again in 2004 and 2006, with provisions to recruit primary and specialty care physicians, exempt waiver recipients from H-1B numerical limits, and place physicians in designated shortage areas. Congress plans to investigate the physician shortage and the program's effectiveness during the two-year extension."
