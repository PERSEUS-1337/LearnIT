Public funding for convention operations was eliminated, leading to debates over the use of private funds and the need for tighter restrictions. The debate over public funding for party conventions arose due to concerns about its pervasiveness and the need for tighter restrictions. Two taxpayer-supported revenue sources, presidential public campaign funds and security funds, previously provided approximately $136.5 million for the 2012 Democratic and Republican national conventions. While convention financing has been eliminated, Congress continues to appropriate separate security funds. Security funds and presidential public funds were separate revenue sources allocated differently and used for different purposes. Congress may reassess them separately, as public funding for convention operations has been eliminated. This report provides a historical overview of PECF convention funding and private funding sources available. For more details on policy debates preceding the repeal of PECF convention funds, refer to archived CRS Report RL34630. Through the 2012 presidential election cycle, federal funds from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF) and Congress supported different aspects of presidential nominating conventions. PECF funding for conventions was repealed in 2014, but separate security funds continue to be appropriated by Congress. Congress did not appropriate funds for PECF, which relies on individual tax designations. The checkoff question remains on tax forms, allowing individuals to designate $3 or married couples $6 to the fund. Grants of $18.2 million each were given to the two major parties' conventions for the 2012 election cycle. Qualifying convention committees were not required to accept PECF funds. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) provides federal convention funds through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, which has been available in select years. Congress appropriated $100 million for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominating conventions in 2004, 2008, and 2012, in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Third parties rarely qualified for limited public convention funds. In 2012, $100 million was allocated for convention security in Charlotte and Tampa through OJP's Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Programs. The funding was used to reimburse state and local law enforcement for overtime costs. In 2016, Congress appropriated $100 million for convention security in Cleveland, OH, and Philadelphia, PA, to be administered by OJP. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for planning and implementing security operations at the 2016 presidential nominating conventions. The federal government allocated approximately $136.5 million for convention security in 2012, with each Democratic and Republican convention receiving $68.2 million. No third parties qualified for federal funding in 2012, and the last time a third party received funds was in 2000. Congress has never appropriated funds for a third party's convention security. In 2016, $100 million was allocated for a party's convention security. To receive public funds, the convention committee had to agree not to raise or spend additional funds, except for certain exceptions like legal or accounting fees. Committees had to file disclosure reports, provide requested documents to the FEC, and undergo an audit of their spending. Federal law had few restrictions on how convention funds were spent, as long as purchases were lawful and used for convention-related expenses. FEC regulations outlined permissible and prohibited spending, including expenses like site preparation, personnel, and staff. The use of PECF funds for convention expenses was regulated by federal laws, allowing spending on activities like site preparation, personnel expenses, security, transportation, and certain entertainment. However, individual convention committees had the discretion to choose which activities to fund. Prohibited expenses included candidate or delegate participation, violations of laws, penalties for election law violations, and replacing lost or stolen items. In 2016, federal security funding for presidential nominating conventions was limited to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia and the Republican convention in Cleveland. The $100 million allocated by Congress primarily reimbursed states and localities for law enforcement costs, including overtime payments incurred in securing the convention sites in previous years. Local law enforcement personnel are involved in securing the convention venue, conducting advance planning, training, and maintaining communications. GOP convention organizers have security concerns for the Cleveland convention, with Cleveland law enforcement purchasing riot gear. Additional federal security costs include USSS protection for presidential candidates and other federal personnel assisting in securing convention sites. Federal security costs for conventions include law enforcement officers, fencing, K-9 units, and other teams. Private funds and state/local entities now fund convention operations, with security funding potentially affected by nonfederal funds. The PECF funds have been eliminated, requiring convention committees to raise private funds similar to other federal political committees. Recent policy developments allow national parties to establish separate political committees for convention fundraising with separate contribution limits. Congress enacted the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, affecting private convention funding. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) tripled individual and PAC contribution limits to national party committees for supporting party conventions. An individual could give $100,200 and multicandidate PACs could contribute $97,200 to conventions. Nonfederal funds play a significant role in funding presidential nominating conventions. Nonfederal funds play a significant role in funding presidential nominating conventions, generally not subject to federal campaign finance limits. Local host committees can solicit private contributions for convention-related activities, with permissible expenses including venue rental and promotional events. The regulation of federal versus nonfederal funds is determined by how FECA and the FEC treat each source, with the FEC ruling that nonfederal funds do not explicitly support conventions themselves. The FEC rulemaking in 2003 clarified that donations to convention host committees are distinct from other donations by prohibited sources, as they aim to promote the convention city and are not subject to the ban on corporate contributions. State or local governments can also provide financial assistance through \"municipal funds.\" Corporations, labor unions, and commercial vendors are allowed to contribute goods or services to host committees and municipal funds. Congress has previously appropriated separate security funding for conventions, with $100 million of federal funds allocated through DOJ's security grants to offset security costs incurred by state and local governments. Nonfederal funding from state and local governments may have also been used for convention security, based on costs to law enforcement entities working with federal agencies. Unlike party convention committees, nonfederal funds for security came from state and local governments, not PECF. Commercial vendors may provide goods or services to convention committees at reduced rates or no charge. The 113th Congress and President Obama eliminated convention funding from the PECF in April 2014. State and local governments, not PECF, provided nonfederal funds for convention security. Debate on convention financing focused on private support viability versus taxpayer-funded subsidy for political parties. The 113th Congress and President Obama eliminated convention funding from the PECF in April 2014. Various bills were introduced to eliminate convention financing, with debates focusing on private support viability versus taxpayer-funded subsidy for political parties. In the 112th Congress, efforts to repeal convention financing began with separate bills in both chambers. The Senate passed an amendment to eliminate PECF convention funding in 2012, while the House passed bills to eliminate public financing and convention funding in 2011 and 2011. In the 112th Congress, efforts to repeal convention financing began with separate bills in both chambers. The Senate passed an amendment to eliminate PECF convention funding in 2012. In the 111th Congress, several bills were introduced to eliminate convention funding, including H.R. 2992, H.R. 6061, and S. 3681. Additionally, four bills in the 110th Congress would have affected PECF convention financing, with only one bill primarily focused on convention funding (H.R. 72). None of these measures became law. The 114th Congress appropriated $100 million for convention security in FY2012. The 114th Congress allocated $100 million for convention security in FY2012, divided between Philadelphia and Cleveland. Public funding for convention operations ended in 2014, making the 2016 conventions the first to be financed solely by private funds. The federal government's role in funding convention security is a recent development post-9/11, and Congress may consider different options for future financing. Congress may consider different options for federal funding of state and local costs for securing convention venues."
