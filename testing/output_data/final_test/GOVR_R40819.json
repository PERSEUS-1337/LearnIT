Research activities cover biological, physical, and social sciences related to agriculture, food, and natural resources through research, statistics, extension, and higher education. Federally funded intramural research addresses national issues and promotes basic research, regional coordination, and spillover. Extramural research is regionally specific and applied in nature, supporting USDA's regulatory programs. The USDA's Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area consists of four agencies focused on advancing scientific knowledge for agriculture. Research activities cover biological, physical, and social sciences related to agriculture, food, and natural resources through research, statistics, extension, and higher education. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has about 100 research centers and work locations across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) partners with colleges of agriculture at land-grant universities in 50 states and eight U.S. territories. The USDA's Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area includes agencies focused on advancing scientific knowledge for agriculture. This includes 1862 institutions, 1890 institutions (HBCUs), and tribal colleges. The Economic Research Service (ERS) is based in Washington, DC, and Congress oversees agricultural research policy through the \"farm bill\" and annual appropriations. The USDA's Research, Education, and Economics (REE) mission area receives funding from annual discretionary appropriations in the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill. In FY2016, discretionary funding for the entire REE mission area totaled $2.937 billion. Some research programs, especially within NIFA, receive mandatory funding for specialty crops or organic agriculture from the 2008 and 2014 farm bills. The 2014 farm bill provides an average of $120 million per year of mandatory funding to agricultural research. Intramural research at federal agencies is funded directly with discretionary appropriations, while extramural research sponsored by NIFA is administered by a small cadre of employees funded by a portion of NIFA's appropriation. NIFA's appropriation is mainly used for extramural research grants, distributed through formula funds and competitive grants. Formula funds are allocated to land-grant colleges, schools of forestry, and veterinary medicine based on census data. The Hatch Act of 1887 provides research funding to state agricultural experiment stations based on each state's farm and rural population. The Hatch Act provides research funding to state agricultural experiment stations based on each state's farm and rural population. States appropriate three to four times the federal allotment and must match funds. HBCUs receive similar funding through Evans-Allen research grants. Smith-Lever Act authorizes cooperative extension funding with nonfederal matching requirements. Competitive grants are awarded through a peer-reviewed merit selection process for fundamental and applied activities. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is NIFA's flagship competitive grants program, funding research, education, and extension activities in priority areas. Grants are awarded through a peer-reviewed merit selection process to attract a wide pool of applicants and select the best quality proposals. The 2008 farm bill mandated that AFRI allocate 60% of grant funds for basic research and 40% for applied research, with at least 30% of funds integrating research with education and/or extension activities. Policymakers debate formula funding versus competitive grant funding for agricultural research efficiency, with calls for more competitive grants to allocate limited federal resources. Reports by the National Academy of Sciences and the Rockefeller Foundation recommended shifting focus to more cutting-edge basic research. The National Academy of Sciences and a USDA task force recommended shifting to more competitive funding for agricultural research, creating a new grant-making agency within USDA. This agency, now NIFA, was proposed to administer competitive peer-reviewed grants for high-caliber fundamental research. In 2012, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommended increasing competitive research funding in agriculture to engage top minds and address sector challenges. USDA-funded research, whether intramural or through formula funds, plays a crucial role in advancing agricultural research. The reliability of formula funds for state agricultural experiment stations has traditionally supported core research programs, benefiting academic programs at universities. Competitive grants tend to favor basic research and reach a greater proportion of non-land grant universities, with funding concentrated among fewer states. States with large agricultural production and top-ranked academic programs in biology and agricultural sciences are generally more competitive. Academic programs in biology and agricultural sciences are more competitive and successful in receiving federal funds through competitive grants. Federal formula funding has a greater impact on agricultural productivity in the long term. Federal-level research provides steady funding for core research and high-risk, long-term projects of national importance. Multi-disciplinary proposals addressing regional concerns are typically underfunded in national competitive-grant processes. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) receives federal funding for research projects that are not always competitive in the grant process. Some believe that federally funded internal research allows ARS to address national and long-term research priorities that industry or other institutions may not focus on. However, there are concerns that ARS scientists have an unfair advantage over other agricultural scientists who do not have the same level of support. Public funding for agricultural research has fluctuated over the years, with steady growth from the 1950s to the late 1970s, followed by a period of stability in the 1980s. There was a notable increase in funding from 1998 to 2001, with a peak in FY2010 before declining in FY2011 due to federal budget cuts. This has led to concerns about the level of support for agricultural scientists who do not have the same resources as those funded by the government. Private and federal funding for agricultural research has been shifting, with private industry and other federal agencies like NIH and NSF playing a larger role in funding. Public-private partnerships have increased, aiding in technology transfer and supplementing federal and state support. In 2009, $13.9 billion was allocated for agricultural research, with 68% coming from the private sector and $1.4 billion passed through state governments to land-grant universities. In 2009, $8.7 billion was allocated for agricultural research, with $1.4 billion passed through state governments to land-grant universities. USDA intramural research accounted for 11% of total spending. Concerns exist about the shift in funding sources affecting the focus of agricultural research and the nation's ability to remain competitive and address long-term challenges. Public investment in agricultural research has been linked to productivity gains and economic growth, with high social rates of return reported annually. Advances in agricultural research and extension were critical to productivity gains in the United States post-World War II, with yields for major crops growing about 2% annually from the 1950s through the 1980s. Key advancements include disease-resistant crop varieties, efficient irrigation practices, and improved marketing systems. Public investment in agricultural research has been crucial for productivity gains and economic growth. Some advocate for increased funding to maintain competitiveness and boost agricultural productivity in response to global population growth. The 2008 farm bill mandated the development of a USDA Roadmap for Agricultural Research to coordinate capacity and competitive programs within the department. The USDA conducted a study to identify trends, constraints, and opportunities in agricultural research. The 2008 farm bill led to changes in research management and structure, based on recommendations from key stakeholders. Some argue that stagnant funding for agricultural research has hindered the sector's competitiveness. Some critics argue that USDA has not prioritized agricultural research like other sectors, leading to potential long-term consequences for U.S. agriculture. They believe that public investment in new innovations is crucial due to challenges like rising production costs, pest outbreaks, extreme weather events, and climate change. Others suggest a limited federal role in funding agricultural research, opposing the use of taxpayer dollars for this purpose. Some argue against using taxpayer dollars for agricultural research, citing limited federal funding and a focus on immediate farmer benefits. They suggest states and the private sector should fill the funding gap, but there are concerns that private funding mainly supports applied research, neglecting basic problems and long-term challenges. Some advocates argue that USDA's agricultural research portfolio duplicates private sector activities on major crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton. They suggest reallocating funding to basic, noncommercial research for public benefit. However, others emphasize the economic importance of these crops and the need for public funding to address emerging threats like new pests, limited water availability, and impacts on human and environmental health."
