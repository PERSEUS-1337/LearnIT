    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It includes both mandatory and discretionary spending, with most decision-making focused on the latter. Jurisdiction lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and their respective Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. In FY2015, discretionary appropriations totaled 14% ($20.6 billion) of the Agriculture appropriations bill, which includes both mandatory and discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is controlled by budget enforcement rules during the authorization process. Discretionary appropriations in the Agriculture appropriations bill (P.L. 113-235) totaled $20.6 billion, making up 14% of the total bill. Mandatory spending accounted for $126.5 billion, or 86% of the total. Key discretionary spending items include WIC, agricultural research, FDA, rural development, food safety inspection, and conservation programs. Mandatory spending items include SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP requires an annual appropriation. SNAP is an \"appropriated entitlement\" based on projected spending needs, while the Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit. The FY2015 Agriculture appropriation was part of an omnibus bill passed in December 2014. Table 1 summarizes actions on Agriculture appropriations since FY1995, and Figure 2 provides a visual timeline. In FY2015, Congress began under a 10-week continuing resolution (P.L. 113-164) that lasted until December 11, 2014, with two additional CRs enacted to extend funding. Both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported their respective FY2015 Agriculture appropriations bills, but proceedings stopped before final votes were taken. In FY2015, Congress began under a 10-week continuing resolution (P.L. 113-164) that lasted until December 11, 2014. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported their FY2015 Agriculture appropriations bills, but final votes were not taken. In the House, amendments were debated and some were adopted as the bill was read through Title VI. Procedural reading stopped before Title VII due to disruptions. In the Senate, a minibus appropriation of three bills, including Agriculture, was brought to the floor but consideration stopped over disagreements about amendment procedures. The last official versions of the stand-alone Agriculture bills are H.R. 4800 and S. 2389. The Administration released its FY2015 budget request on March 4, 2014, along with USDA's budget summary and detailed agency justifications. The Agriculture Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee held hearings on FY2015 appropriations with various USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC. The subcommittee approved its FY2015 appropriations markup, and the full House Appropriations Committee reported the bill (H.R. 4800) by a vote of 31-18. House floor debate began with amendments debated under the five-minute rule. The bill was read procedurally through Title VI, with several amendments adopted, but was left unfinished due to political changes in the House. The Agriculture appropriations bill in the House was left unfinished due to political changes in leadership. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2015 bill, which included the USDA and FDA budgets. The Senate adopted cloture on a \"minibus\" appropriation bill that included Commerce-Justice-Science. The Senate's appropriations efforts for FY2015 shifted to supplemental funding and a continuing resolution after disagreements over amendments. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set government-wide discretionary spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015 to avoid sequestration on discretionary accounts. Budget sequestration on non-exempt mandatory accounts continued in these fiscal years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set government-wide discretionary spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015 to avoid sequestration on discretionary accounts. Sequestration on non-exempt mandatory accounts continued in these fiscal years. The House Appropriations committee set a $20.880 billion discretionary limit for the Agriculture bill for FY2015, while the Senate allocation was $20.575 billion, lower than the House bill by $305 million. The FY2015 Agriculture appropriation was set at $20.575 billion, with an additional $116 million for emergency spending. This amount is slightly lower than the FY2014 allocation, with $91 million for agricultural conservation and $25 million for Ebola-related activity at FDA included in the appropriation. The FY2015 Agriculture appropriation includes $91 million for agricultural conservation and $25 million for Ebola-related activity at FDA. The Senate-basis spending level with emergency spending is $26 million greater than FY2014, while the House-basis spending level is $61 million greater. Table 2 compares the enacted amount to appropriations for FY2012-FY2014, and the FY2015 House-reported, Senate-reported, and Administration-requested amounts. The House-reported bill's details are presented in this report. The House-reported bill's discretionary total for FY2015 was $20.880 billion, the same as FY2014. The Senate-reported bill total was $20.575 billion, allowing for $100 million in emergency appropriations not in the House bill. The Administration's request was nearly $450 million less than the House and Senate bills, with differences due to sequestration scoring. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions to meet statutory goals. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 raised spending limits to avoid sequestration on discretionary accounts but did not prevent it on mandatory accounts. Over $1 billion has been sequestered each year from mandatory programs in the Agriculture appropriations bill, mainly in farm commodity and conservation areas. Sequestration in the Agriculture appropriations bill affects funding for farm commodity and conservation areas, with exemptions for crop insurance and nutrition programs. The continuing resolution (P.L. 113-164) from October 1, 2014, to December 17, 2014, included a 0.0554% across-the-board rescission, funding accounts at 99.9446% of their FY2014 amounts. Specific details on sequestration at the individual account level are provided in Appendix B. The FY2014 appropriation continued to apply during the CR, with anomalies affecting the Agriculture appropriations bill. The SNAP program and other mandatory programs were funded to maintain current levels. The Commodity Assistance Program received increased funding, with $275.7 million allocated, a $6 million increase from FY2014. The increase went to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, as proposed in both House and Senate bills. The Food and Drug Administration was allowed to incorporate outsourcing facility fees related to drug compounding in the Agriculture appropriations bill. The CR provided an annual rate of $20.789 billion of discretionary budget authority, with adjustments for reductions and additional funding for the Commodity Assistance Program. The CR closely matched the total amounts proposed by the House and Senate for Agriculture appropriations accounts. The explanatory statement approves House and Senate report language for interpretation and implementation of the appropriation. It emphasizes that unchanged provisions from both reports are approved, and any report directed by either chamber must be submitted within 60 days. The USDA receives 95% of its funding from the Agriculture appropriations bill. The USDA, funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill, was created in 1862 and has about 30 internal agencies with nearly 100,000 employees. Two-thirds of employees are funded by the Agriculture appropriation, while the remaining third, about 33,000 staff years, are in the Forest Service funded by the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The report follows the order of agencies listed in the Agriculture appropriations bill, with a section on FDA appropriations for food safety. Various accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill cover USDA administration. The USDA's administrative accounts cover various expenses, including rental payments for buildings. In FY2015, a change was made to have individual agencies pay for their rental expenses instead of a central account. This resulted in increased budgets for many agencies to cover the additional obligation. The $162 million decrease in Departmental Administration for FY2015 is mainly due to the accounting change in rental payments, offset by increases in individual agency budgets. This shift in rental expenses resulted in agencies having to cover their own rental costs, leading to budget adjustments throughout various agencies. The Departmental Administration budget for FY2015 decreased by $162 million mainly due to a shift in rental expense responsibilities. Other offices within Departmental Administration saw either unchanged amounts or a combined $15 million increase. The final amount allocated differed from both the House and Senate bills, with the Senate bill providing $15 million more. The differences between the House and Senate bills included funding for the Office of Communications, General Counsel, and Departmental Administration. The Senate bill also allocated $10 million more than the House bill for building operations and maintenance. The USDA's research, education, and economics mission is carried out by four agencies: The Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Census of Agriculture. ARS conducts research on food and agriculture issues, NIFA provides funds to land grant colleges for research and education, and NASS collects agricultural statistics. The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis of issues in agriculture, natural resources, food, and rural America. The FY2015 appropriation for USDA REE mission area is $2.725 billion, an increase of $86 million from FY2014. No earmarks have been included in annual appropriations for REE since FY2010. About half of the increase is for ARS buildings and facilities. The FY2015 funding levels for the USDA REE mission area increased by $86 million from FY2014, with no earmarks included since FY2010. Despite some restoration of previous reductions, ARS and NIFA funding levels in FY2015 remain below FY2010 levels in inflation-adjusted terms, leading to ongoing concerns among agricultural research stakeholders. The enacted appropriation for FY2015 includes $1.133 billion for ARS salaries and expenses, along with $45 million for ARS buildings and facilities construction. The FY2015 funding levels for the USDA REE mission area increased by $86 million from FY2014, with $1.133 billion allocated for ARS salaries and expenses. An additional $45 million was designated for ARS buildings and facilities construction, with a focus on priorities identified in the USDA ARS Capital Investment Strategy. This funding is less than previous proposals and is not specific to a particular facility. The Senate-reported bill for FY2015 did not include funding for buildings and facilities in Athens, GA. The joint explanatory statement and House and Senate report language rejected the Administration's request to close six ARS research centers. The enacted appropriation for NIFA in FY2015 is $1.290 billion, which is $12 million more than the previous year. The FY2015 appropriation for NIFA is $1.290 billion, with $787 million allocated for Research and Education Activities, including a $9 million increase for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. Funding remains constant for Hatch Act and Evans-Allen activities. The FY2015 appropriation for NIFA is $1.290 billion, with $787 million allocated for Research and Education Activities. The Administration's request for $75 million for \"Innovation Institutes\" focusing on agricultural research challenges was not funded. Extension Activities receive $472 million, slightly more than FY2014. Integrated Activities funding decreased to $30.9 million in FY2015. The FY2015 appropriation for NIFA is $1.290 billion, with $787 million allocated for Research and Education Activities. The enacted amount is $30.9 million, which is $4.4 million less than FY2014 (-12%). The Administration proposed an additional $80 million through the OGS Initiative, with most going towards AFRI competitive research grants. The enacted appropriation provides $172 million for NASS, an increase of $11 million over FY2014 (+7%). The Administration's requested level for ERS is $6.6 million more than the enacted amount to restore selected surveys. The enacted appropriation for ERS in FY2015 is $85 million, an increase of $7 million over FY2014. Three agencies carry out USDA's marketing and regulatory programs mission area: APHIS, AMS, and GIPSA. APHIS is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. APHIS is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from domestic and foreign pests and diseases, including avian influenza, mad cow disease, and invasive plant pests. They also administer the Animal Welfare Act to protect animals used for research and entertainment. The FY2015 appropriation for APHIS is $874.5 million, with a majority allocated for salaries and expenses. The FY2015 appropriation for APHIS is $874.5 million, with $3.2 million allocated for building and facilities. Salaries and expenses are well above the Administration's request, with higher amounts to cover rental obligations previously funded through a central departmental account. Enacted law authorizes APHIS to collect fees to cover total costs of providing technical assistance, goods, or services. Enacted appropriations are provided across program-level budget categories within APHIS. The enacted law authorizes USDA to transfer funds from other appropriations for activities related to animal and plant pest eradication. There is ongoing debate between OMB and congressional appropriators on whether APHIS should access CCC funds for emergencies or rely on annual USDA appropriations. Appropriations subcommittees emphasize the need for USDA to use CCC funds for emerging plant pests. The enacted law authorizes USDA to transfer funds from other appropriations for activities related to animal and plant pest eradication. It provides $470,000 for a contingency fund to control outbreaks of pests and allocates funding for various pest control programs, including specialty crop pests, tree and wood pests, avian health, animal health services, and cotton pests. Additionally, funding is allocated for the scrapie program, National Veterinary Stockpile, and critical veterinary countermeasures. The enacted law allocates funding for various animal and plant pest eradication activities, including specialty crop pests, avian health, and critical veterinary countermeasures. It also specifies funding for national rabies management, surveillance, and eradication efforts, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and the Citrus Health Response Program. Additionally, funding is provided for wildlife damage management, wildlife services methods development, activities under the Horse Protection Act, and cervid health activities. The committee report addresses concerns about APHIS' regulatory backlog and provides increased funding to improve enforcement activities under the Horse Protection Act. The Agricultural Marketing Service administers programs to facilitate the marketing of U.S. agricultural products, receiving appropriations through discretionary and mandatory spending. The Agricultural Marketing Service administers programs for field crops and dairy, funded by user fees and discretionary appropriations. Activities include market news, shell egg surveillance, market protection, transportation, and promotion. AMS also oversees pesticide data, organic program, seed program, COOL, and commodity research programs. Additionally, AMS monitors agriculture transportation and conducts market analysis. The Agricultural Marketing Service administers programs funded by user fees and reimbursements for various activities including product quality verification, commodity grading, and farm bill programs supporting specialty crops and organic certification. For FY2015, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides $81.2 million for marketing activities, with an additional $1.2 million for cooperative marketing agreements and grants, totaling $82.4 million in discretionary appropriation. The joint explanatory statement directs USDA to submit a report on changing the country-of-origin labeling law to comply with WTO obligations. The WTO is hearing appeals on the COOL compliance report issued in 2014, with a final resolution expected in 2015. If the appellate hearing determines that COOL is inconsistent with U.S. obligations, U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico could face $2 billion in retaliatory tariffs. USDA was directed not to implement a second beef checkoff program after stakeholders couldn't agree on reforms for the current one. The mandatory appropriation for AMS reflects a transfer from the Section 32 program, created in 1935 to assist agricultural producers. Section 32 funds, totaling $9.7 billion in FY2015, are used by the USDA to purchase agricultural commodities like meat, poultry, fruits, vegetables, and fish for domestic food programs. The 2008 farm bill capped the annual amount available for obligation at $1.284 billion in FY2015. Congress also limited USDA's discretion to increase purchases of fruits and vegetables under Section 32. The 2008 farm bill established a school snack program for fruits and vegetables funded by Section 32 funds. The program expanded in the 2014 farm bill to include frozen, canned, and dried fruits and vegetables. The FY2015 appropriation provided $1.284 billion of Section 32 funds for AMS, with reductions due to rescission and sequestration. The enacted appropriation includes a provision that prohibits the use of Section 32 funds for emergency disaster payments to farmers. USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration oversees the marketing of various commodities, and the Federal Grain Inspection Service establishes standards for grain inspection. The Packers and Stockyards Program oversees livestock and poultry markets to ensure fair competition. The FY2015 appropriation for GIPSA salaries and expenses is $43.0 million, with authorization to collect up to $50 million in user fees. Section 731 (P.L. 113-235) restricts USDA from finalizing parts of GIPSA's proposed rule on livestock and poultry marketing practices. The proposed rule under the Packers and Stockyard Act sets criteria for unfair practices and includes arbitration provisions for contract growers. Proponents argue for fairness in marketing transactions, while opponents fear market disruption and increased litigation. USDA finalized parts of the rule in December 2011, but implementing prohibitions have been enacted since FY2012. Section 731 limits USDA from finalizing a GIPSA rule if the annual cost exceeds $100 million. The USDA is prohibited from using funds to implement specific provisions in the proposed rule under the Packers and Stockyard Act, including definitions related to the tournament system, competitive injury, and likelihood of injury. Funding is also rescinded for enforcement of provisions finalized in 2011. Numerous agencies share responsibilities for regulating the safety of the U.S. food supply. The FDA and USDA are primarily responsible for regulating the safety of the U.S. food supply. FDA oversees the safety of most food products, while USDA's FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Despite FSIS being responsible for 10-20% of the food supply, it receives a disproportionate amount of funding compared to FDA, which is responsible for 80-90% of the food supply. The FDA is responsible for 80-90% of the U.S. food supply and has received increased funding for food safety activities, while staffing levels are lower compared to FSIS. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act provided additional funding through user fees, leading to a shift in overall funding for food safety between FDA and USDA. Funding for FSIS has remained mostly unchanged. The FDA received additional appropriations and staff for food safety activities through the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s. FSMA authorized increased inspections at food facilities, tightened record-keeping requirements, extended oversight to certain farms, mandated product recalls, and required facilities to conduct food safety plans. However, funding was not fully provided for these activities, raising concerns about implementation. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was signed into law in January 2011, raising concerns about funding for overhauling the U.S. food safety system. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $1.4 billion increase in federal spending over five years for implementing FSMA, not including new user fees. CBO also estimated $240 million in new fees collected over the same period, with additional outlays needed to cover new FDA requirements. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) required additional outlays of $1.1 billion for more frequent inspections and increased FDA staff. FDA staffing levels were below expectations at 3,800 FTEs in FY2014. An additional $400-450 million per year is needed to fully implement FSMA, with a total program level of $913.8 million expected from appropriations and fees. Under FSMA, fees such as food and feed recall fees, food reinspection fees, and voluntary qualified importer program fees are included. The total program level funding is $210.5 million below the Administration's request, which proposed new user fees not authorized by congressional appropriators. The enacted appropriation does not include the proposed fees for food facility registration and inspection, food import, international courier, and food contact notification. The House committee report requests a report on user fees collected for each program, while both the House and Senate appropriators make recommendations on FSMA and FDA's regulatory efforts. The House and Senate committees express concerns about FDA's regulatory approach to FSMA, urging for risk-based, flexible, and science-based regulations. They emphasize the need for regulations to be comprehensive and interconnected to address the complexity of food safety rules under FSMA. The House and Senate committees emphasize the need for FSMA regulations to be science-based, risk-based, and flexible. They highlight the importance of considering the secondary market for animal feed and urge FDA to maintain a commitment to data-driven decision making. Funding for food safety activities in FY2015 is $27.5 million, an increase from FY2014 levels. The House report highlights the increase in funding for food safety activities in FY2015 to $27.5 million, up from FY2014 levels of $25 million. It encourages FDA to fund research for advanced testing platforms to monitor food supply adulteration and suggests exempting tree nut producers from produce standards if criteria are met. Both House and Senate committees urge FDA to form partnerships under FSMA. FDA is encouraged to form partnerships under FSMA with existing government food safety programs to verify compliance and eliminate duplication of activities. Senate appropriators recommend FDA to work with USDA for outreach and technical assistance to farmers and small businesses. Additionally, $2.5 million in funding is recommended for USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture for extension activities related to FSMA. Emphasis is placed on ensuring public review and comment on proposed requirements. The House report expresses concern about FDA not providing stakeholders with adequate input on regulatory proposals and urges better management of agency priorities. The House and Senate committee reports contain provisions related to seafood safety and direct FDA to update advice for pregnant women on seafood consumption. The Senate bill also encourages FDA to combat fraud in the seafood industry and resolve a dispute with the European Union over sanitation protocols for U.S. shellfish. Additionally, there is a proposal for FDA to implement a labeling requirement for genetically engineered salmon. Both House and Senate appropriators urge FDA to expedite the import clearance process and report statistics to Congress. The House and Senate appropriators urge FDA to expedite import clearance, report statistics to Congress, investigate imported pet food, address antibiotic use in food animals, and maintain funding levels for FSMA-related activities and food and veterinary medicine programs. Additionally, $47.993 million is allocated for foodborne disease surveillance by the CDC. The enacted appropriation provides $1.016 billion for USDA's FSIS in federal appropriations for FY2015, with an increase of $5.8 million from FY2014. The appropriations include funding for advanced DNA technology to enhance surveillance and prevention efforts at the state and local level. User fees are estimated to be $160.2 million, with allocations for federal, state, and international inspection, Codex Alimentarius, and the Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System. The enacted appropriation for USDA's FSIS in FY2015 is $1.016 billion, with an increase of $5.8 million from FY2014. FSIS may collect fees for national laboratory accreditation programs. The Administration proposed a user fee for additional inspection costs, but it was not included in the appropriations. FSIS must have at least 148 FTEs dedicated to HMSA enforcement. Catfish inspection is required under the 2008 and 2014 farm bills, but USDA has not started due to a pending final rule. FSIS is prohibited from inspecting horses for slaughter or providing fee-for-service inspection. The FY2015 enacted appropriations for USDA's FSIS increased by $5.8 million from FY2014. Horse slaughter inspections were prohibited from FY2006 to FY2011 and in FY2014. The joint explanatory statement highlights concerns about economic fraud and seafood safety, urging USDA and FDA to support technology for screening seafood. USDA's FSA administers farm subsidy and disaster assistance programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers farm subsidy and disaster assistance programs, as well as USDA's farm loan programs and conservation programs. The FY2015 appropriation for FSA is $1.507 billion for salaries and expenses, an increase of $22.1 million from FY2014. This increase covers new rental expenses. The FY2015 appropriation for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) remains level with FY2014 after adjusting for new rental expenses. Strong requirements have been imposed on FSA's information technology plans, with criticism for delays and costs in implementing MIDAS. The IT Dashboard flagged concerns in December 2012, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted management and schedule problems in 2011. FSA must submit a detailed IT plan before spending 50% of the $132 million allocated. The FY2015 appropriations act imposes strict requirements on the Farm Service Agency's information technology plans due to mismanagement of funds and IT projects. The agency must submit a detailed IT plan meeting specific criteria and provide monthly briefings to Congress. The joint explanatory statement criticizes USDA's mismanagement of the MIDAS program, which cost over $400 million and failed to deliver promised results. Additionally, the statement rejects USDA's proposal to close 250 FSA county offices and reduce staff. The joint explanatory statement rejects USDA's proposal to close 250 FSA county offices and reduce staffing. It prohibits FSA from closing any county office and relocating employees without approval. The statement requires FSA to conduct a workload assessment by August 1, 2015, and contract with a third-party for review by September 1, 2016. This is the first mention of FSA office closure in appropriations since FY2006-FY2008. The 2008 farm bill enacted a provision setting conditions for FSA to close offices, surpassing a temporary moratorium in appropriations. USDA Farm Service Agency provides loans to farmers for real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. The FSA farm loan program in FY2015 received $79 million for loan subsidy to support $6.402 billion of direct and guaranteed loans, with the loan authority being $875 million greater than in FY2014. In FY2015, the FSA farm loan subsidy is 12% smaller than in FY2014, with a loan authority of $875 million greater than FY2014 (+16%). The direct farm ownership program becomes self-supporting and doubles in size, while reductions in the guaranteed operating loan program account for the remaining difference. The demand for FSA farm loans increased after the 2008 global financial crisis, leading to rising loan authority levels to meet farmers' borrowing needs. The loan authority for FSA farm loans increased from $6.0 billion in FY2010 to a new high level in FY2015, with the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funding most mandatory programs in the 2014 farm bill. This includes farm subsidy and disaster payments, conservation, trade, food aid, research, rural development, and bioenergy programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds mandatory programs such as farm subsidy, disaster payments, conservation, trade, food aid, research, rural development, and bioenergy. It is a government corporation with the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance program spending. CCC earns money through activities like buying and selling commodities and receiving interest on loans. The CCC's borrowing authority must be replenished periodically through a congressional appropriation to avoid reaching its $30 billion debt limit. Congress typically provides this infusion through the annual Agriculture appropriations act, which may not always restore the line of credit to the previous year's level. The appropriation for CCC is greater than farm commodity subsidies as it also funds conservation and other mandatory programs. The FY2015 appropriation included an indefinite appropriation of \"such sums as necessary\" for CCC, totaling $13.4 billion. The FY2015 appropriation for CCC is $13.4 billion, up 7% from FY2014, with higher disaster payments and delayed farm program payments. Mandatory outlays for commodity programs fluctuate based on economic or weather conditions. The enacted appropriation includes a provision prohibiting the use of CCC funds for emergency disaster payments to farmers. The FY2015 appropriation for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is $13.4 billion, with higher disaster payments and delayed farm program payments. CCC funds cannot be used for employee salaries, surplus removal activities, or price support activities. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offering free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Additionally, a provision limits USDA's ability to provide marketing assistance loans for mohair. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, with funding provided through discretionary and mandatory appropriations. The discretionary funding covers RMA salaries and expenses, while mandatory funding finances premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to private insurance companies. The FY2015 appropriation for RMA salaries and expenses is $75 million, with additional funding requested for program compliance improvements. The FY2015 enacted appropriation for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund is $8.7 billion, a 9% decrease from FY2014. This decline is due to lower commodity prices, leading to reduced premium subsidies. The estimate includes funds for crop insurance changes from the 2014 farm bill, such as the Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) for upland cotton. Agricultural disaster assistance is typically funded through supplemental or mandatory spending programs. The FY2015 enacted appropriation provides $91 million for three watershed and conservation recovery programs, with funding designated as disaster funding for budget scoring purposes. The Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) receives $9.2 million to assist in rehabilitating farmland and conservation practices destroyed by natural disasters. ECP is administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). The FY2015 enacted appropriation provides funding for three watershed and conservation recovery programs: Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) with $9.2 million, Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) with $3.2 million, and Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) with $78.6 million. ECP assists in rehabilitating farmland and conservation practices after natural disasters, EFRP aids nonindustrial private forestland owners in restoring forestland, and EWP provides assistance for hazards caused by floods, fires, and other natural occurrences. These programs do not require a national or state emergency declaration to receive assistance. The USDA administers agricultural conservation programs for private landowners to address natural resource concerns. These programs include working land, land retirement, easement, watershed, and technical assistance programs. The main agencies involved are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Funding for most conservation programs is mandatory and authorized through omnibus farm bills. The USDA administers agricultural conservation programs through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Funding for these programs is mostly mandatory and authorized through omnibus farm bills, with additional discretionary funding through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary conservation program administered by NRCS is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which received increased funding in the enacted FY2015 appropriation. The enacted FY2015 appropriation directs CO funding for various conservation programs, including congressionally directed actions for NRCS. These actions can direct funding to specific projects, similar to earmarks. The Administration's proposal to rename the Conservation Operations account was not adopted. Funding is also provided in P.L. 113-235. The enacted FY2015 appropriation includes funding for the Watershed Rehabilitation program, which aims to rehabilitate aging dams built by USDA. The program received $12 million in FY2014 and $12 million in FY2015, with additional mandatory funding of $250 million in FY2014 from the 2014 farm bill. Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending. The FY2015 appropriation includes reductions to conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending, with CHIMPS totaling $212 million. These reductions are not necessarily applied towards other conservation activities. Prior to the 2008 farm bill, reductions peaked in FY2006 at $638 million, and peaked again in FY2012 at $929 million. The 2014 farm bill authorized over $5 billion in mandatory funding for conservation programs. The FY2015 enacted CHIMPS are less than the Administration and Senate-reported bill, but more than the House-reported bill. The Administration's proposed reductions to conservation funding in FY2015 were more substantial than what Congress supported. The total effective reduction to conservation programs was $430 million due to sequestration. Some programs, like EQIP, have been reduced annually since FY2003, while others, like CRP, have not been reduced in over a decade. In FY2015, P.L. 113-235 limited EQIP spending to $1.35 billion. In FY2015, P.L. 113-235 limited EQIP spending to no more than $1.35 billion, with reductions to other conservation programs. USDA's rural development mission area includes the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The FY2015 enacted appropriation provides $2.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. The FY2015 enacted appropriation provides $2.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for rural development programs, essentially level with FY2014. The bill supports $36 billion in loan authority and $678.2 million for salaries and expenses within Rural Development. The enacted bill provides $1.71 billion in budget authority for RHS programs in FY2015. The FY2015 enacted appropriation provides $1.71 billion in budget authority for RHS programs, with $27.4 billion in loan authority. The largest loan account is the single-family housing loan program, with $900 million for direct loans and $24 billion for loan guarantees. Additionally, $3.7 million in budget authority is allocated for the Section 504 Very Low-Income Housing Repair loan program. The FY2015 enacted bill provides $1.71 billion in budget authority for RHS programs, including $150 million for the Multi-Family Housing loan guarantee program and $28.4 million for the Section 515 Rental Housing Program. The Rental Assistance Program grants account for 63% of the total RHS budget authority appropriation. The bill also includes $1.09 billion in new budget authority for the Rural Housing Service, a decrease of $22 million from FY2014. The FY2015 enacted bill provides $30.3 million in new budget authority for the program supporting a loan authorization level of $2.27 billion and $13 million in grants for essential community facilities in rural areas with less than 20,000 in population. The budget authority is $2.2 million less than FY2014, with guaranteed loan authority increasing by $13.7 million. The bill also provides $108 million to the RBS before adjustments, which is $27 million less than FY2014. If adjustments are included, the net RBS budget authority is -$71.3 million. The bill allocates about $985 million in loan authority for RBS loan programs, $38.2 million less than FY2014. The enacted bill for FY2015 provides $74.0 million in new budget authority for the Rural Business Program, which is $22.5 million less than FY2014. This program includes the Business and Industry Loan Guarantee program, the Rural Business Development Grant program, and the Delta Regional Authority grant program. The bill also allocates $1.4 million for loan subsidies for the Rural Energy for America Program, with no appropriation for grants as in FY2014. The Administration's request for funding for new business programs was not granted. The FY2015 appropriation includes funding for two new business programs: the Rural Business Investment Program ($6 million) and the Health Food Financing Initiative ($13 million). Additionally, $3.3 million was requested for the Rural Microenterprise Assistance Program. The budget authority for the Rural Utilities Service remains the same as FY2014 at $536.2 million, which is $145 million more than the Administration requested. Loan subsidies and grants under the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program account for the largest share of the recommended budget. The enacted FY2015 budget provides $465 million in budget authority for the Water and Waste Disposal Program account, representing approximately 87% of total RUS budget authority. This appropriation supports $1.25 billion in direct and guaranteed loans, as well as various grant accounts for water, waste water, solid waste management, individual well water, and other programs. Additionally, the bill includes funding for rural electric and telecommunication loans. The FY2015 budget provides $5.5 billion in rural electric loans and $690 million in Treasury rate telecommunication loans. Most of the loan authority is for Federal Finance Bank electric loans. The budget also includes $36.8 million for distance learning, telemedicine, and broadband, with a decrease in grant support for distance learning/telemedicine compared to FY2014. Rural broadband funding remains the same as FY2014. Domestic food assistance makes up a significant portion of the USDA's budget, with funding primarily allocated to mandatory programs like SNAP and child nutrition programs. Discretionary budget items include WIC, CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. The enacted appropriation for FY2015 is approximately $110.2 billion for domestic food assistance. The enacted appropriation for FY2015 for food assistance is approximately $110.2 billion. The difference in funding levels between House and Senate bills is around $400 million, mainly due to updated estimates for child nutrition programs and SNAP. Funding supports SNAP, Nutrition Assistance Block Grants, Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The enacted appropriation for FY2015 for food assistance is approximately $110.2 billion, with funding supporting SNAP, Nutrition Assistance Block Grants, Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The enacted appropriation for programs under the Food and Nutrition Act is approximately $81.8 billion, with a slight decrease in funding due to reduced spending on SNAP benefits. The Administration requested $3 billion for the SNAP contingency reserve fund, reflecting a forecast of decreased participation. Funding increases authorized by the 2014 farm bill are reflected in the FY2015 appropriations for TEFAP, Community Food Projects, and certain SNAP-related funds. The child nutrition account funds various programs like the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Summer Food Service Program. These programs also cover initiatives for food safety education and meal quality improvement. Funding for these programs is discussed in CRS Report R43332, SNAP and Related Nutrition Provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill. The FY2015 enacted appropriation of approximately $21.3 billion for child nutrition programs includes funding for education initiatives to improve meal quality and safety. This total amount is 10% higher than FY2014, with additional funding from the Section 32 account. The enacted appropriation also includes funds for certain child nutrition discretionary grants, reflecting a compromise between House and Senate bills. The FY2015 enacted appropriation of approximately $21.3 billion for child nutrition programs includes funding for education initiatives to improve meal quality and safety. This total amount is 10% higher than FY2014, with additional funding from the Section 32 account. A compromise between House and Senate bills was reached for certain child nutrition discretionary grants. The enacted appropriation provides $16 million for Summer EBT Demonstration Projects, lower than the requested $30 million. The FY2015 appropriations process debated updated nutrition guidelines for school meals programs. The enacted law included provisions related to sodium and whole grain regulations. Since the 2010 reauthorization of child nutrition programs, USDA-FNS has implemented multiple regulations. The new regulations for school meals programs, finalized in January 2012, include requirements such as whole-grain-rich grains, new fruit requirements, and sodium targets. USDA-FNS announced flexibility on whole grain pasta in May 2014. Proposed House and Senate bills aimed to affect schools' implementation of these rules for the 2014-2015 school year. The Senate bill required scientific research before imposing lower sodium limits, a USDA report on whole grain products availability, and a technical assistance plan for schools. The final language in P.L. 113-235 included provisions related to but different from the Senate's language. Exemptions from whole grain rules allow states to exempt school food authorities from 100% whole grain requirements if they demonstrate hardship in procuring specific whole grain products. Exempted authorities must maintain a 50% whole grain minimum. The law requires a 50% whole grain minimum and exemptions from whole grain rules until school year 2015-2016. A policy rider prevents USDA from reducing sodium limits in school meals until latest scientific research proves it beneficial for children. The enacted appropriation of approximately $6.62 billion includes provisions to prevent processed chicken imported from China from being included in certain child nutrition programs. Inadequate funding for the WIC program could reduce services for pregnant women, infants, and children. The enacted appropriation of $6.62 billion for WIC includes set-asides for breastfeeding peer counselors, infrastructure, and management information systems. It also includes funding for transitioning WIC programs to electronic benefit transfer. The enacted appropriation for WIC includes a provision impacting foods eligible for purchase with WIC benefits, specifically white potatoes. USDA-FNS regulation prevents WIC benefit redemption for white potatoes. WIC benefits are tailored to specific nutritional needs of participants through \"WIC Food Packages.\" States have flexibility in determining eligible foods within federal requirements. The federal government regulates the WIC food packages, with a recent major revision in 2014. A Fruit and Vegetable Voucher was added, but white potatoes were initially excluded based on IOM recommendations. The House and Senate proposals aimed to allow all vegetables in the WIC food package, including white potatoes. The Senate language, similar to the House proposal, allows white potatoes in the WIC food package with provisions for USDA to make changes based on updated scientific recommendations. The enacted language requires USDA to review the WIC food package again, determining whether white potatoes or other vegetables will be included. FNS has started implementing white potato purchases in WIC, following IOM's recommendation. Funding supports various programs like CSFP and TEFAP. The budget account provides funding for various food assistance programs, including CSFP, TEFAP, WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, and Pacific Island assistance. The enacted appropriation is approximately $279 million, with an increase of $9 million from the previous year. The increase is mainly for CSFP, which receives approximately $212 million, a 4% increase from the previous year. Other programs in the account receive funding equal to the FY2014 appropriation. This budget account covers federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs and special projects for program integrity and quality improvement. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) provides nutrition education and information to consumers. The enacted appropriation for this account is approximately $151 million, a 7% increase from FY2014. USDA also provides commodity foods to child nutrition programs using funds from Section 32. About $480 million worth of commodity support in FY2008 came from outside the Child Nutrition account. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program, funded by permanent, mandatory funding, offers fresh produce to selected elementary schools nationwide. However, a delay in the availability of funds has shifted the allocation of funds from a school year basis to a fiscal year basis. This change does not reduce overall support for the program. The Food Service Management Institute receives $4 million in permanent annual appropriation. The Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets $21 million in mandatory funding per year. The Foreign Agricultural Service administers market promotion and export credit guarantee programs to enhance U.S. agriculture's global competitiveness. The FY2015 appropriation for FAS/USAID programs is $1.848 billion, $10 million more than FY2014. There is an increase of $6.5 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Salaries and expenses for FAS receive $181.4 million, a $3.6 million increase from FY2014. The FY2015 appropriation for FAS/USAID programs is $1.848 billion, with an increase of $10 million from FY2014. The final appropriated amount for FAS is slightly below the requested $182.6 million, with an additional $6.7 million provided for the export credit guarantee program. This program facilitates the direct export of U.S. agricultural commodities and food. The FY2015 appropriation for FAS/USAID programs is $1.848 billion, with an increase of $10 million from FY2014. The export credit guarantee program, authorized by the 2014 farm bill, guarantees repayment of commercial loans for U.S. agricultural commodities and food products. The program operates with a $5.5 billion program level each year and provides $600,000 for a report on reorganizing USDA's international trade functions. The Senate report language directs FAS to include performance goals in future budget justifications, present budget submissions similarly to other USDA agencies, and allocate funds for programs like the Borlaug Fellows and Cochran Fellowship Programs. Senate appropriators also expect FAS to fund the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program and maintain full mandatory funding for the Market Access Program. The Food for Peace Program consists of four program areas: Title I\u2014economic assistance and food security, Title II\u2014emergency and private assistance programs, Title III\u2014food for development, and Title V\u2014the farmer-to-farmer program. Funding for Title I and Title III activities has not been requested since 2002, with the last Title I concessional commodity shipment occurring in 2006. Title V funding is mandatory and linked to the overall funding under the Food for Peace Act. The Food for Peace Title II program, funded through agricultural appropriations, is administered by USAID and is a key component of international agriculture food aid expenditures. There is ongoing debate between the Administration and Congress on how Title II funds should be used for international food aid. The Food for Peace Title II program, funded through agricultural appropriations, is administered by USAID and is a key component of international agriculture food aid expenditures. There is ongoing debate between the Administration and Congress on how Title II funds should be used for international food aid. Congress prefers using Title II funds to purchase U.S. commodities and ship them on U.S.-flag vessels to countries with food deficiencies, while the Administration proposed shifting all funding for food aid to the State Department for cash-based assistance in emergencies. The Administration proposed $1.4 billion for Title II programs in FY2015, with $350 million available as cash-based food assistance for emergencies. The enacted FY2015 appropriation provides $1.466 billion for Title II programs, slightly above the Administration's request. The 2008 farm bill authorized $60 million for a pilot project on local food aid purchases. The 2014 farm bill allocated $80 million annually for the LRP program, but FY2015 appropriations did not fund it. The Administration requested $350 million for cash-based food assistance, but only $10 million was provided. The House adopted an amendment to provide $10 million for the LRP program by reducing funding for the Agricultural Marketing Service, but it was not included in the final appropriations act. Section 728 of the FY2015 appropriations act ensures that emergency food aid is received by intended beneficiaries. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program provides donations of U.S. agricultural products and assistance. The program provides donations of U.S. agricultural products and financial assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects in developing countries. The enacted appropriation for FY2015 includes a higher funding allocation of $191.626 million, with attention to the production of industrial hemp in the United States. The provision blocks federal law enforcement authorities from interfering with state agencies, hemp growers, and agricultural research. The provision in response to the seizure of hemp seeds in 2014 states that DOJ and DEA funds cannot be used against the 2014 farm bill. The House bill aimed to prevent interference with state laws on industrial hemp but was not adopted. This provision aims to protect hemp growers and research efforts. The Agriculture appropriations subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for the FDA and the CFTC. The FDA regulates food safety, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA's budget is overseen by the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration. The FDA's total program level for FY2015 is $4.525 billion, including an additional $25 million for Ebola virus response. This amount consists of direct appropriations and user fees, with the enacted appropriation including $2.597 billion in direct appropriations. The enacted FY2015 FDA appropriation includes $2.597 billion in direct appropriations, with an additional $25 million for Ebola activities, bringing the total to $2.622 billion. User fees totaling $1.902 billion are also allowed in the appropriation. The President had requested $1.901 billion in fees for specified agency activities. The President requested $260 million in unauthorized fees for various programs, bringing the total user fee request to $2.161 billion. The House and Senate bills provided $1.902 billion for authorized programs and an additional $1 million for drug compounding regulation. The enacted appropriations included the $1 million in fees and a provision to withhold $20 million until FDA finalizes guidance on abuse-deterrent opioids. The enacted appropriations bill includes provisions for transferring $1.5 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General for FDA oversight and withholding $20 million until FDA finalizes guidance on abuse-deterrent opioids. Additionally, the bill increased budget authority for food safety, pharmacy compounding, counterfeit drugs, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, and foreign drug inspections. The explanatory statement expresses concerns about FDA actions affecting the collaborative working relationship with the Committees. The explanatory statement directs FDA to notify Committees of major policy changes and developments. Committees instruct FDA to work with stakeholders on nutrition labeling, report on blood plasma policies, and finalize the Veterinary Feed Directive. They support a meeting between industries and FDA to address safety labeling concerns. The House committee recommends increased appropriations for food safety, pharmacy compounding, National Antimicrobial Response Monitoring System (NARMS), genetically engineered salmon labeling, National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, counterfeit drug investigations, and cosmetics activities. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations express concerns and provide directions for specific FDA activities, particularly in the areas of food and human drugs. While these directions do not have statutory authority, they reflect the committees' priorities and the scientific expertise required to regulate products that impact consumers' lives. The FDA's budget authority and program levels for previous years, as well as the appropriations for FY2015, are detailed in Table 11. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations provide directions for specific FDA activities, focusing on food and human drugs. The FDA's budget authority and program levels for previous years, as well as the appropriations for FY2015, are detailed in Table 11. The FDA center apportions user fee revenue across program areas, with the CFTC overseeing derivatives markets. The Dodd-Frank Act brought previously unregulated swaps markets under CFTC jurisdiction. The FY2015 appropriation provided $250 million for CFTC, $35 million above FY2014 level. The Farm Credit Administration regulates the Farm Credit System without federal appropriation. The FCA, funded by assessments on FCS entities, receives a federal appropriation with a maximum operating level set by the Agriculture appropriations bill. For FY2015, the enacted appropriation allows FCA $60.5 million, lower than previous years. The Senate and House bills differed on the limitation on expenses, with the Senate bill concurring with FCA's request for $65.1 million while the House bill proposed $54 million. FCA's request included a staffing replacement plan expecting a 20% rise in personnel obligations in FY2014. The Senate report required an FCA study on providing financial support for farms and ranches serving local and regional food markets, with a total of $1.2 billion in net offsets in the FY2015 Agriculture appropriation bill. Reductions in mandatory farm bill programs and other adjustments effectively reduce the cost of appropriations in the bill. Additional spending is authorized in the General Provisions. The General Provisions title authorizes $123 million in FY2015, including $116 million emergency spending. Limitations and rescissions help score budgetary savings to meet discretionary budget allocation. Policy-related provisions affect how the executive branch carries out appropriation and authorizing laws. Appropriators have placed limits on mandatory spending authorized in statutes like the farm bill for over a decade. Limits on mandatory spending in appropriations bills are set through language that restricts the use of funds for specific programs authorized by multi-year laws like the 2014 farm bill. These limits do not change the authorizing law but control how funds are allocated for programs. The debate over funding for agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. The debate over funding for agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. Mandatory funding through the Commodity Credit Corporation was created to address unpredictable funding issues. After the 1996 farm bill, tension arose over the use of mandatory funds for discretionary programs. Some question the use of the CCC for non-variable programs. CHIMPS typically affect conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and smaller nutrition assistance programs, not farm commodity or primary nutrition programs. The enacted FY2015 appropriation contains $785 million in CHIMPS, smaller than levels enacted since FY2011. Rescissions permanently cancel funds from previous appropriations, achieving budgetary savings and potentially allowing more spending in an appropriations bill. Rescissions can prevent unobligated budget authority from being reallocated in the future. The FY2015 appropriation includes $17 million in rescissions, which cancel funds from previous appropriations to achieve budgetary savings. These rescissions prevent unobligated budget authority from being reallocated in the future. The enacted FY2015 appropriation includes emergency funding for conservation and Ebola. Scorekeeping adjustments are crucial for the bill to meet the spending limit. Some amounts are related to program operations, like loan programs. For FY2015, scorekeeping adjustments in the enacted appropriation total -$514 million, with regular adjustments about $200 million higher than in previous years due to increased negative subsidies in USDA loan programs. These subsidies reflect government income when program costs are lower than expected. Historical Trends This appendix provides perspective on trends in Agricultural appropriations, including mandatory vs. discretionary spending, inflation-adjusted amounts, and comparisons to the federal budget, economy, and population. Discretionary Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, while mandatory nutrition spending continued to rise. Total Agriculture appropriations grew at a compounded annual rate of +5.6% over the past 10 years, with mandatory spending showing a +6.4% annual increase. See Figure A-1 for the breakdown and Tables A-1 and A-2 for data. In FY2015, 14% of the total agriculture appropriation is discretionary spending, down from 28% in FY1998. Domestic nutrition programs, including child nutrition, SNAP, and WIC, are part of the domestic nutrition appropriations. Total domestic nutrition program spending rose at a 7.7% compounded annual rate over 10 years. In FY2015, 75% of the total agriculture appropriation was for domestic nutrition, with most of it being mandatory spending in programs like SNAP and child nutrition. Mandatory nutrition spending increased at a +8.2% annual rate over 10 years. Appropriators have more control over discretionary appropriations, with a comparison between domestic nutrition and the rest of the bill. The discretionary Agriculture appropriations have shown varying growth rates over the past 10 years. The domestic nutrition portion has increased by +2.5% annually, while the rest of the bill has risen at +2.0% per year. Over a shorter period, the annual changes have been -1.5% for domestic nutrition and -2.6% for the rest of the bill. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget has fluctuated over the years, declining from over 4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2009 before rising again to 4%. The share for nutrition programs decreased from 2.6% in FY1995 to 1.8% in FY2008 but has since increased to about 3% due to the recent recession. The rest of the bill's share has also decreased from 2.2% in FY2000 to about 1.0% currently. The mandatory share for nutrition is around 2.7%, while the discretionary share is 0.2%. The mandatory share for the rest of the bill (crop insurance, commodity program subsidies, and conservation) is about 0.6%, while the discretionary share is about 0.4%. Farm bill spending on agricultural programs has been variable and generally declining since 2000, but steadier since 2009. Agriculture appropriations have risen to about 0.8% of GDP since FY2010 due to increases in nutrition program demand. Agriculture appropriations have risen to about 0.8% of GDP since FY2010 due to increases in nutrition program demand. Nutrition programs have been rising as a percentage of GDP since FY2000, while non-nutrition agricultural programs have declined. On a per capita basis, inflation-adjusted total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly over the past 10 to 15 years. Nutrition programs have risen more steadily on a per capita basis, while non-nutrition \"other\" agricultural programs have been more steady or declining. Sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 involves reductions in budget authority to meet statutory budget goals. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 raised spending limits to avoid sequestration on discretionary accounts in FY2014 and FY2015 but extended sequestration on mandatory programs until FY2023. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, including nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Since the Budget Control Act of 2011, budget sequestration has been ordered by the Office of Management and Budget on non-exempt discretionary accounts in FY2013 and on mandatory accounts in FY2013-FY2015. Some farm bill mandatory programs, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program, are exempt from sequestration."
