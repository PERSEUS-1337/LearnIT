    "content": "Climate change issues have been a topic of interest and debate for the past two decades. In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The focus of the debate has shifted from scientific aspects to policy issues, with discussions on implementing a national program of mandatory, market-based limits and incentives on greenhouse gas emissions. Members of the 110th Congress have introduced bills to establish a market-based, mandatory GHG emission reduction program. Bills in the 110th Congress propose a market-based, mandatory GHG emission reduction program through a cap-and-trade system. Policymakers face challenges in distributing emission allowances, which could be done through auctions, allocation to covered sources, or providing to non-covered sources for sale. Emission allowances hold monetary value in a carbon-constrained regime. Policymakers must decide how to distribute emission allowances in a cap-and-trade program. They can use auctions or allocate allowances for free to various parties. This allocation strategy does not impact the emissions cap's environmental integrity. Covered entities would face similar emission reduction decisions regardless of the allocation strategy. There is a misconception that free allowances would lead to different behavior from purchased allowances. Economists emphasize that free allowances have value. The report discusses emission allowance distribution methods, including auctions and free allocation to covered sources. It also highlights the importance of considering different options and policy considerations for Congress in distributing the value of emission allowances. The use of auctions has gained interest in recent years, impacting the cost and apportionment of cap-and-trade programs. Proposals from the 110th Congress, such as S. 2191, aim to allocate emission allowances through auctions in a cap-and-trade program. Auctions offer transparency by letting the market determine allowance recipients based on value, relieving policymakers from making distribution decisions. In a cap-and-trade program, auctions are considered the most transparent way to distribute emission allowances, eliminating advantages for parties seeking larger shares. The \"polluter pays\" principle suggests that polluting facilities should bear pollution costs, which should be reflected in product prices to reduce demand for environmentally harmful products. Advocates of polluter pays argue that facilities should pay for the right to pollute, with auctioning emission allowances being a transparent way to distribute them. Using auction revenues to offset taxes on desirable activities could reduce overall costs of a cap-and-trade program by approximately 50%. The application of auction revenues to offset taxes on desirable activities could reduce overall costs of a cap-and-trade program by approximately 50%. This approach is unique to the auction mechanism, but some argue it is politically unlikely. Other uses of auction revenues may not generate economic cost savings and could avoid undesired economic effects compared to providing allowances to covered sources at no cost. The design of auctions for cap-and-trade proposals in the 110th Congress is crucial for achieving goals. Efficiency and revenue generation are key measures of success in emission auctions. The allowance price should reflect the marginal cost of emission reduction for a cost-effective emissions trading program. An effective auction for cap-and-trade proposals should aim to identify the allowance price close to the marginal cost of emission reduction. Collusion and hoarding among bidders should be discouraged to prevent inefficient outcomes. High transaction costs could hinder cost-effectiveness and disadvantage smaller firms. Auction rules should be transparent and unbiased towards all participants, with different auction designs offering various advantages or disadvantages based on the primary objective. Auctions for cap-and-trade proposals should aim to identify allowance prices close to the marginal cost of emission reduction. Different auction designs offer advantages or disadvantages based on the primary objective, such as revenue generation or market price matching. Policymakers may need to study the performances of various auction formats before specifying logistics. Few papers have examined the merits of different auction forms in multi-unit auctions. Congress could direct an agency to devise the most appropriate auction format based on objectives provided. Auction designs vary in the number of bidding rounds and whether there is a uniform or individual price.

Different auction designs offer advantages or disadvantages based on the primary objective, such as revenue generation or market price matching. Policymakers may need to study the performances of various auction formats before specifying logistics. Few papers have examined the merits of different auction forms in multi-unit auctions. Congress could direct an agency to devise the most appropriate auction format based on objectives provided. Auction designs vary in the number of bidding rounds and whether there is a uniform or individual price. Examples of auction designs include sealed bid versus multiple rounds, and uniform price versus discriminatory price for each buyer. In EPA's SO 2 emission trading program, parties submit sealed bids with multiple offers to purchase allowances at certain prices. The implementing agency opens the bids and distributes allowances starting with the highest offer until the supply is exhausted. In emission allowance auctions, bidders receive allowances at a set price, with the highest rejected bid determining the price for all bidders. This format was used by Ireland for the EU ETS auction and recommended in a study for RGGI officials. The auctioneer sets a low initial price, gradually increasing it until demand matches supply. Virginia used a type of auction to sell nitrogen oxide emission allowances, with the highest rejected bid determining the allowance price for all bidders. One consideration is whether to have a reserve price, which could guarantee a revenue stream and address logistical concerns like bidder collusion in cap-and-trade auctions. The authors of the RGGI auction study recommended setting a reserve price in allowance auctions to address logistical concerns like bidder collusion and provide assurance to parties making emission reductions. A reserve price can help covered sources ensure cost-effectiveness by establishing a minimum price for allowances. The EPA's SO2 emissions trading program and S. 2191 propose annual auctions for allowances distribution. However, policymakers may benefit from considering more frequent auctions, such as quarterly, to provide flexibility for covered sources in adapting to unforeseen events like increased electricity demand. Smaller, more frequent auctions could enhance program efficiency and accommodate smaller operations. Smaller, more frequent auctions could enhance market efficiency by reducing manipulation risks and increasing liquidity. The study recommends quarterly auctions for emission allowance allocation in the RGGI states. The use of quarterly auctions to allocate emission allowances in RGGI states has gained momentum, with support for auctions increasing due to a better understanding of their benefits. The primary argument for no-cost distribution of allowances is to compensate carbon-intensive industries for potential financial losses imposed by cap-and-trade programs, which could lead to job losses in these industries. The financial losses from cap-and-trade programs may result in job losses in certain industries. Compensation can be seen as a form of transition assistance for industries most affected by GHG emissions caps, especially those struggling to include emission reduction costs in product prices. Industries vulnerable to foreign competition, particularly from nations without emissions caps, may face a comparative disadvantage if prices increase to reflect emission abatement costs. This could lead to emissions leakage as foreign competitors increase market share and emissions in uncapped economies. Emissions leakage is a concern in climate change policy, especially in sectors like electricity generation. Higher emission reduction costs may lead to price increases for consumers, reducing demand and impacting profits of carbon-intensive industries. Cap-and-trade programs often provide free allowances to covered sources to garner support for emissions reduction. Industries may prefer free allowances over competing for auction revenues for political security. The electricity sector, accounting for 34% of GHG emissions in the US, plays a crucial role in cap-and-trade effectiveness. Concerns exist regarding free allowance distribution to electric utilities, as it may weaken price signals for consumers in regulated markets. An auction distribution system could provide a comparable price signal to consumers in both regulated and competitive markets. In the electricity sector, regulatory structures vary between cost-of-service regulation and deregulated markets. Traditional utilities generate 60% of electricity under price regulation, while 40% is generated by unregulated facilities. A comparison of price signals under different regulatory frameworks shows the impact on consumers in a cap-and-trade system. Under an auction system, a large percentage of consumers would see an $8/Mwh increase in electricity prices. The change in prices is symmetrical for both regulated and competitive regions, reflecting different fuel portfolios. Regions with higher carbon content fuels would have higher prices under a cap-and-trade system. However, when covered sources receive allowances at no cost, consumers in regulated and competitive regions experience different price changes. The columns in the graph show an asymmetrical shape compared to the previous figure, indicating varying price impacts. The electricity price impacts differ between price-regulated and competitive regions due to their market structures. Electric utilities would incur costs for mitigation and purchasing allowances in an auction system. Policymakers may choose to auction allowances to utilities, resulting in increased electricity prices for consumers. Consumers in price-regulated areas benefit from free emission allowances, leading to stable or lower electricity bills. In competitive areas, consumers face price increases without the benefit of free allowances, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the cap-and-trade program. Consumers in price-regulated areas benefit from free emission allowances, leading to stable or lower electricity bills. An auction system would create fairer and more efficient outcomes for consumers with different electricity profiles. The costs of the cap-and-trade program would be included in the price of electricity, encouraging energy conservation efforts and more efficient installations. The concern with providing GHG emission allowances at no-cost to covered entities is the potential for overcompensation under a cap-and-trade program. Depending on the percentage of allowances auctioned, overcompensation could be avoided. Covered sources receiving allowances for free would benefit from them as a form of currency, leading to potential price increases for their products. Covered entities may raise product prices even with free allowances, leading to windfall profits. This phenomenon has been observed in cap-and-trade programs like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, where power plants received significant windfall profits. The EU ETS Phase 1 allowance price dropped dramatically in April 2006, leading to windfall profits only in the first year. However, a 2008 study projected continued windfall profits for European power plants in the second phase (2008-2012), with German plants expected to generate the most. The European Commission proposed full auctioning for the power sector from 2013 onwards to address this issue. The European Commission has proposed phasing out free allocation in sectors by 2020, with auctions distributing 100% of allowances. This approach addresses economic inefficiencies and fairness concerns for new emission sources and facilities near retirement. A recurrent auction system creates a level playing field, unlike a \"grandfathering\" strategy that could advantage existing facilities. Free allowances may subsidize outdated technologies and incentivize prolonging operations beyond efficiency. A cap-and-trade system limits emission allowances, creating a valuable commodity worth billions of dollars. Policymakers must decide how to distribute the allowance value, impacting the overall cost to society and who bears the costs. Options include providing assistance to specific industries or supporting various objectives. The report discusses the allowance and auction revenue distribution strategies proposed by S. 2191 in a cap-and-trade program. It outlines key concepts, estimates the total allowance value, examines distribution options, and discusses policy considerations. Covered entities would comply by reducing emissions, purchasing credits, or buying offsets. Compliance costs are different from the aggregate value of emission allowances. The early years of a cap-and-trade program show that the aggregate value of emission allowances outweighs the costs of emission reductions. Compliance costs vary depending on the type of reduction, with some options being more expensive than others. Policymakers may set a cap on emissions, requiring reductions to meet the target. In a cap-and-trade system, a 7-ton cap is set on an economy emitting 10 tons, with each ton costing $1, $5, and $10 respectively. The marginal cost, which determines the market price of emission allowances, is $10. This results in an allowance value of $70 but compliance costs of only $16. The Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 proposed an economy-wide cap-and-trade system. The EPA conducted an economic analysis of provisions in S. 2191 at the request of Senators Lieberman and Warner. The analysis estimated the price range for emission allowances, with potential auction revenues identified based on specified percentages. Table 1 shows estimated annual auction revenues under the legislation, as well as revenues if 100% of allowances were auctioned. This provides an approximation of the aggregate value of emission allowances. Comparing auction revenues to federal tax revenue from major sources in Fiscal Year 2007 gives context. Several economic studies have estimated the percentage of allowances that would compensate carbon-intensive industries for projected profit losses. Goulder found 13% would compensate the fossil fuel producing industry, Burtraw and Palmer concluded 6% for the electric-generating industry, and Smith and Ross estimated 21% for primary energy producers and electric utilities. These studies analyzed the net effects on economic sectors. Some economic studies estimated the percentage of allowances to compensate carbon-intensive industries for profit losses. Winners and losers are expected within sectors, with coal-fired plants facing greater losses and hydroelectric or renewable energy plants potentially gaining profits. Certain cap-and-trade proposals in the 110th Congress may phase out free allocation as auctioned allowances increase. For example, S. 2191 would provide fossil fuel-fired power plants with 19% of emission allowances at no cost in the first five years. Fuel-fired power plants would receive 19% of emission allowances at no cost, gradually decreasing to zero by 2031. Economic theory supports a tax policy that reduces taxes on favored activities and increases taxes on less desirable behavior, like pollution. Auction revenues could offset tax reductions on desirable activities, yielding a double-dividend of reduced GHG emissions and market distortions. Recent studies suggest the costs of cap-and-trade programs could act as an additional tax, potentially exceeding benefits. Several economic studies have estimated the cost savings of auctioning allowances in a cap-and-trade program, which could reduce projected costs by 21% to 47%. The range of potential savings depends on how the auction revenues are allocated, with distributing revenues to households resulting in lower cost savings and using revenues to reduce taxes on labor or investment minimizing society's costs. Figure 4 illustrates the differences in society costs based on different allocation strategies. In cap-and-trade programs, different allocation strategies can impact society's costs. Non-covered entities may receive free allowances or a percentage of auction revenues. Congress may allocate allowance value to specific groups, like low-income electricity consumers. Covered sources pass along their costs, whether they receive allowances for free or purchase them. This behavior has been observed in previous cap-and-trade programs. In cap-and-trade programs, the majority of costs are expected to be borne by consumers, particularly households. A scenario where 100% of emission allowances are auctioned to fossil fuel producers shows that households and businesses would bear 89% of the costs. Businesses may also pass on increased costs to consumers through higher prices for goods and services. In cap-and-trade programs, costs are mainly borne by consumers, with businesses passing on higher prices for goods and services. Policymakers may distribute auction revenues to support technology development, energy efficiency, and other objectives. Improvements in energy efficiency can help reduce GHG emissions, requiring new technologies and incentives for behavioral changes. Biological sequestration, such as trees and plants, can remove carbon from the atmosphere, with allowance values incentivizing landowners to engage in activities like reforestation. Some actions may qualify as offsets in a cap-and-trade program, while others may require additional incentives. Adaptation efforts are necessary due to inevitable global warming effects, prompting investment in preparing communities for climate change impacts. Deficit reduction proposals suggest using allowances or auction revenue to address budget shortfalls, aiming for a \"revenue-neutral\" program. The distribution of allowance value in a cap-and-trade program presents policymakers with trade-offs, including minimizing costs, alleviating disproportionate costs, and funding other policy objectives. Economic studies suggest that using auction revenues to offset reductions in distortionary taxes is the most efficient use of revenues, benefiting society as a whole. The auction allocation strategy in cap-and-trade programs can lower overall costs, but using auction revenues to offset tax reductions is unlikely. Government tends to fund new programs with new revenue rather than reduce taxes. Industries unable to pass on increased costs may face higher expenses, impacting certain economic sectors disproportionately. Ultimately, consumers bear the costs of a cap-and-trade program. Consumers are expected to bear the majority of costs in a cap-and-trade program. Policymakers may consider compensating specific industries or households facing higher energy prices. Using allowance value for technology development could impact overall program costs. The funding allocated for technology development under S. 2191 would significantly increase compared to current federal funding. However, the return on investment for promoting technology improvements remains uncertain. Research shows that using allowance value for existing or new programs may not guarantee a positive return. The return on investment for funding new programs is uncertain, as some programs may already be at full capacity. A cap-and-trade program could increase incentives for low-carbon energy alternatives. Policymakers must consider whether emission allocation strategies would have regressive or progressive economic effects. The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the distributional effects of different scenarios for a cap-and-trade program. A cap-and-trade system sets a limit on greenhouse gas emissions from covered sources. Different allocation strategies have varying effects on progressivity. Distributing revenues as lump-sum payments to households is the most progressive option. Providing allowances to covered sources for free is the most regressive. Lowering tax rates would be regressive but reduce program costs. The emissions cap in a cap-and-trade system is divided into emission allowances, each representing the authority to emit one ton of carbon dioxide-equivalent. Policymakers can choose to distribute allowances for free based on previous emissions, sell them through auctions, or use a combination of both strategies. This report explores the issues related to these allocation options for covered entities incentivized to reduce emissions. In a cap-and-trade system, entities with low emission-reduction costs may go beyond required reductions to sell excess reductions as emission credits. Various mechanisms like banking or offsets can enhance program flexibility. Covered sources must surrender emission allowances at the end of each compliance period or face penalties.
