    "content": "The ATF, located in the Department of Justice, enforces federal laws on firearms, explosives, arson cases, and criminal violations related to alcohol and tobacco. It was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to the DOJ and is focused on preventing terrorist attacks in the US. The ATF, under the Department of Justice, combats illegal firearms and explosives trafficking, and criminal diversion of alcohol and tobacco for terrorist funding. ATF agents have uncovered foreign terrorists involved in bootlegging cigarettes for financing. Despite partnering with DOJ's Joint Terrorism Task Forces, ATF mainly focuses on firearms compliance and investigations. Congress increased ATF's funding by 13.4% from FY2007 to FY2010. Congress increased ATF's funding by 13.4% from $988.1 million in FY2007 to $1.121 billion in FY2010, with most of the increases focused on gun trafficking and explosives capabilities. Specifically, funding was provided for initiatives like \"Project Gunrunner\" to address illegal gun trafficking to Mexico. Over $49 million was allocated for gun trafficking efforts, and nearly $30 million was designated for the construction of a National Center for Explosives Training and Research. Congress appropriated nearly $30 million for the construction of a National Center for Explosives Training and Research (NCETR) as part of ATF's budget, which saw a 13.4% increase from FY2007 to FY2010. The funding focused on gun trafficking and explosives capabilities, including initiatives like \"Project Gunrunner\" to combat illegal gun trafficking to Mexico. The requested program increases are provided in report language for the salaries and expenses account. Appropriators are aware of the increases in decision unit totals. Funding shifts trigger budget reprogramming requirements. Over three cycles, firearms allocation increased by 13.0%, arson and explosives by 14.7%, and alcohol and tobacco by 13.3%. FTE positions decreased from 5,053 in FY2007 to 4,880 due to reduction in unfunded positions. In FY2007, FTE positions decreased from 5,053 to 4,880 due to unfunded positions. Funding for ATF increased in FY2010, but the number of FTE positions remained lower than in FY2007. Congress appropriated $1.121 billion for ATF in 2010, a 3.9% increase from FY2009. The Administration requested $1.121 billion for ATF in FY2010, a 6.3% increase from FY2009. The funding was projected to support 5,025 FTE positions and 5,101 permanent positions, including resources for \"Project Gunrunner\" to combat illegal firearms trafficking to Mexico. The House Appropriations Committee reported an FY2010 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 2847) on June 12, 2009. The bill would have provided ATF with $1.106 billion for FY2010, including budget increases for combating gun trafficking on the Southwest border and ATF Violent Crime Impact Teams. However, the committee did not include $25 million for phase two of the NCETR project due to fiscal constraints. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a similar bill on June 25, 2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an FY2010 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 2847; S.Rept. 111-34) on June 25, 2009, providing ATF with $1.121 billion, including $61 million to combat gun trafficking on the Southwest border and an increase of $18 million for Project Gunrunner.

The FY2010 appropriation funds 5,101 permanent positions, including special agents, industry operations investigators, and other positions. ATF's firearms budget program focuses on administering and enforcing federal laws related to firearms. The ATF's main focus is reducing firearms-related violence by investigating criminal activities of violent street gangs, ensuring gun dealers comply with the law, and suppressing gun trafficking. They have dedicated resources towards this goal, with a budget allocation of $802.6 million for firearms in FY2010. The ATF is a partner in the President's Project Safe Neighborhoods, working with various law enforcement agencies to prosecute armed violent and career criminals. Additionally, they lead the Attorney General's Violent Crime Impact Teams in 29 cities to reduce homicides and violent crimes. The Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCITs) in 29 cities work to reduce homicides and violent crimes committed with firearms by investigating leads, targeting violent criminals, tracing recovered guns, and prosecuting gang-related cases. Defendants referred for prosecution in gang-related investigations increased from 403 in FY2000 to 4,381 in FY2007 under the VCIT initiative. Gang-related investigations have significantly increased from 403 in FY2000 to 4,381 in FY2007 under the Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCITs) initiative. ATF inspects federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to ensure compliance with the Gun Control Act (GCA) and prevent firearms from being diverted to illegal channels. Despite tensions with the firearms industry, ATF Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators are authorized to inspect FFLs without search warrants for criminal investigations or to ensure GCA compliance. ATF investigators inspect firearms transfer records maintained by FFLs to trace crime guns and uncover evidence of illegal activities, such as straw purchases and off-the-books transfers. This helps generate leads in criminal investigations and prevent firearms from being diverted to illegal channels. In July 2004, the DOJ Office of Inspector General reported on ATF inspections of FFLs, revealing that ATF inspected 4.5% of FFLs in FY2002. Firearms compliance inspections increased in FY2007 and FY2008, covering about 9.3% and nearly 10% of FFLs, respectively. On the Southwest border with Mexico, firearms violence has spiked due to drug trafficking organizations competing for control of smuggling corridors. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n deployed military and police to address the issue. Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in Mexico are acquiring military-style firearms, including semiautomatic versions of AK-47 and AR-15 rifles, .50 caliber sniper rifles, and other small arms from the United States. This has led to DTOs having comparable firepower to the Mexican Army and law enforcement. President Calder\u00f3n has urged the U.S. to curb the flow of firearms into Mexico. DTOs are using straw purchasers to buy military-style firearms from Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) in the Southwest border region, with these firearms being smuggled into Mexico in smaller shipments. In FY2006 and FY2007, ATF focused on disrupting the illegal flow of guns from the US to Mexico through \"Project Gunrunner.\" ATF agents investigated 187 firearms trafficking cases in FY2007, recommending 465 defendants for prosecution. By FY2008, ATF had deployed personnel and resources to the Southwest border at a cost of $32.2 million. The FY2009 budget included funding for industry operations investigators to support Project Gunrunner. The CJS appropriations bill included $5 million for Project Gunrunner in the House bill (H.R. 7322). The Senate had previously allocated $15 million for Project Gunrunner in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill (H.R. 2642), but it was not included in the enacted appropriation. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2008 included $1.054 billion for ATF, with an increase of not less than $5 million for Project Gunrunner. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $10 million for ATF and $30 million for state and local law enforcement for counter-narcotics efforts in FY2008. The ATF FY2010 budget request includes $1.121 billion for ATF. The ATF FY2010 budget request includes $1.121 billion, with an $18 million increase for Project Gunrunner. The House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill also included the $18 million increase for Gunrunner, with total funding for Southwest border firearms trafficking efforts reaching over $61 million. In FY2010, Congress provided ATF with $61 million, including $18 million for Project Gunrunner. ATF maintains an eTrace program in Mexico City to trace firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, with 90% traced back to the United States. However, caution is advised when interpreting this data as it does not represent all guns used in crime in Mexico. While tracing firearms recovered in Mexico back to the United States is useful, issues with data collection hinder statistical significance testing. Despite this, criminal investigations show a high demand for certain firearms available in the US, illegally trafficked to Mexico. Successful traces help in homicide and gun trafficking cases, uncovering corrupt FFLs involved in smuggling firearms. ATF's e-Trace program plays a key role in these investigations. In FY2008, ATF traced 7,743 firearms recovered in Mexico, with 63.5% made in the US and 29.5% imported. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported the M\u00e9rida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce criminal conspiracies involving firearms smuggling into Mexico. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs reported the M\u00e9rida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6028) on May 14, 2008. This bill authorized $73.5 million over three years for Project Gunrunner and assigning ATF agents to Mexico. The House passed the bill on June 10, 2008. Similar authorizations are included in other bills in the 111th Congress. ATF's arson and explosives budget program covers activities related to enforcing federal laws on explosives and investigating arson. The ATF is responsible for regulating explosives and investigating arson cases with a federal connection. They maintain a database of arson and explosive incidents in the US and are tasked with closely monitoring the explosives industry under the Safe Explosives Act. Congress also requires ATF to conduct thorough investigations into explosive thefts and losses, as well as provide background checks for licensees. The ATF is responsible for regulating explosives and investigating arson cases with a federal connection. They conduct background checks for licensees and permittees to prevent prohibited persons from acquiring explosives. ATF also inspects explosive licensees and permittees every three years to ensure proper storage and accounting of explosive materials. In FY2007, 3,291 explosives compliance inspections were conducted, covering about 28% of licensees/permittees. The FY2010 arson and explosives allocation is $295.8 million, representing 26% of the total appropriation. Congress allocated nearly $30 million for the construction of the ATF-administered National Center for Explosives Training and Research in FY2008 and FY2010. The ATF alcohol and tobacco budget program, totaling $22.3 million for FY2010, aims to combat illegal diversion and smuggling of tobacco and alcohol products. This criminal activity results in significant tax revenue losses and is exploited by terrorist groups for financing. No additional resources were requested for this program in FY2009 or FY2010."
